You can interfere by speaking with the bully if you feel safe doing so, or telling a school administrator what you saw.


If your friends start gossiping about someone, make it clear that you don't participate in that kind of thing. Try saying something like, “I don’t like gossip. Can we talk about something else?”
If you're part of a group that's intentionally leaving someone else out, tell the group you want to include everyone, because it's the right thing to do. Try saying something like, “I think we should be nicer to Catherine. It must be hard to be the new girl in school.”

Stop considering yourself a bully.,
Don’t forget the impact on you.,
Explore why you bully.,
Talk to someone.,
Develop new coping mechanisms.",How to Stop Yourself from Bullying2,"

Although bullying may be something that you do, it is not who you are.Negative labels lower your self-esteem and can increase the stress that is actually causing you to bully others. Face the fact that you did mean things, but acknowledge that you still have a lot of good qualities.

Instead of calling yourself a bully, try saying to yourself, “I have bullied in the past, but that’s not something I do anymore.”
Think about your positive qualities, skills, and talents. Use these things to identify yourself. For example, say to yourself, “I am funny and smart.”

, Bullying not only hurts the people being bullied, but also hurts you. Recognizing the effect your bullying has on your life now, as well as facing what impact it can have on your life later, are important steps in ending your bullying.


Bullying can get you into trouble if reported or get you hurt if someone decides to retaliate.
It can cause you to lose friends and cause people you don’t even know to dislike you.
Your self-image and confidence can be lowered because of your bullying.
Some people who were bullies as children have problems with their adult relationships, friendships, and careers.,

Do you mean to hurt others? Bullying is usually a learned response to stress.In other words, something has taught you that bullying is a way to cope with anxiety, fear, etc. One key to stop bullying is to identify why you do it in the first place. Be honest with yourself and take time to think deeply about why you have been doing this.

Some people bully others because they have been bullied or are being bullied themselves. Some people that bully have been the victim or abuse or trauma. If either of these is your situation, talk to someone you trust about what happened to you.
Other people bully because they want attention, or to feel powerful.
Some people bully because of their beliefs about race, sexuality, religion, etc. They are often uncomfortable with people they consider ‘different.’
Don’t blame the other person as the reason why you bully them. The other person is not responsible for your actions; you are. Even if he did something to you in the past, your actions and your response now are under your control.

, Whether it is a teacher, mentor, counselor, or even an online forum, share what you are going through with someone you trust. She can help you sort through any negative feelings you are having, deal with your underlying reasons for bullying, and introduce you to more constructive ways to express your feelings.,

One of the biggest things you can do to stop bullying is to explore different ways to cope with stress. Using new methods of coping with your negative feelings replaces your bullying with appropriate behavior.Explore various deep breathing techniques. Changing your breathing is one simple way to calm down quickly and appropriately handle a situation.
Look into meditation and mindfulness strategies. These techniques are often successful in reducing anxiety and stress, which can lead to bullying behavior.

Recall your experiences.,
Think about the immediate impact on the person.,
Consider the long-term impact.,
Examine your reputation.",How to Stop Yourself from Bullying3," Think about a time in your life when you felt bullied, afraid, powerless, humiliated. This memory is probably something you don’t want to go through again. Remembering that time can help you understand how the person you are bullying feels, which can help you stop.How did you feel about yourself when this was happening? Try to remember the exact feelings you had. For example, did you feel worthless, uncool, unlikable? These are some of the feelings the person you are bullying may feel because of what you are doing.
How did you feel about the person who made you feel this way? Were you angry with him? Were you afraid of him? That's how the person you are bullying probably feels about you.

,

Imagine that you are the person you bully. Think about how it feels in the moment that you are being bullied. Taking her perspective helps you stop bullying by making you consider the negative feelings your actions cause at that moment.Think about how the person feels when she sees you coming. Dread? Resignation? Do you think she has had to change her habits (what time she or arrives or leaves, which route she takes, etc.) just to avoid interacting with you?
Consider how she feels as you are in the act of bullying her. Think about the emotions she experiences, as well as the impact those emotions have on her.
How does she feel after your interactions? Shaken? Angry? Hurt? Scared? Relieved? How hard is it for her to continue what she was doing?

,

Although you may have thought about how the person feels when you are bullying him, think about the serious impact your actions can have on that person in the future. This will help you understand just how much harm you can do. Taking a long-term perspective of your behavior can help you stop bullying.

1/3 of people bullied later start doing things like cutting themselves and other forms of self-harm.80% of youth suicides are because of bullying.Many people that have been bullied have problems with their school and work performance over time.,

Although bullying might make you feel better at the time, in reality, you know that nobody likes a bully. Take the perspective of other people that know you (and even those that don’t). What impact is your bullying behavior having on how people perceive you?

Do people avoid you or automatically treat you like they expect you to bully them?
Even though you may have a reputation for being mean and a bully, you can change this.

"
"
Confront the bully.,
Tell a teacher, coach, counselor, or any other adult with authority.,
Open up to your parents.,
Seek support from trusted friends.",How to Stop Getting Bullied at High School2," Staying quiet only enables the bully to continue harassing you. Pretending that an incident with a bully did not happen is denying yourself as a human being and only empowers him. The next time he comes to you, look at him square in the eye and firmly, but calmly, say, ""I want you to stop right now."" If he gets in your face, bring your arm across your chest to use it as a barrier between you and the bully.
If he continues to invade your space, hold your ground and continue to repeat, ""Stop. I want you to stop right now. Stop"" or loudly say, ""Stop! Leave me alone!"" Don't say or do anything else but continue to repeat these phrases.
If he still doesn't stop, then this is when you might consider telling someone.

, Tell them exactly what happened, who the bully is, where and when the bullying took place, how long it's been happening and how it makes you feel. When you tell them, ask what they are going to do to help you stop the bullying. It is their job to keep you safe. Speaking up is imperative, especially if you are afraid for your safety or have been threatened with harm. There have been many instances where teens have died due to unreported stalking, threats, or attacks. Remember, it's the only way you can win.If you choose to disclose to a school social worker or guidance counselor and are feeling nervous, you might consider taking a friend with you so that you feel comfortable. Remember, most teachers and counselors want to help.
Another suggestion is to write down what's been happening first, to facilitate the process. This way you don't forget any important details.
If the person you talked to doesn’t help, seek help from another authority figure. As difficult as this may sound, keep doing this until you get the help you need or the bullying behavior is resolved.

, This can be difficult, especially if you believe they'll overreact. Let them know that you just want their support, ideas and guidance, but you'd like to first try and resolve it on your own. If you fill them in about what's happening and ask for help, they'll be more likely to trust you.

, Confiding in a friend can give you much needed support and advice in dealing with your situation. Sharing your experience may lead others to also open up about experiences they’ve had with bullies. If you don't have much or any friends because of bullying, try to make friends with someone you think is nice or with people in other classes or grades/years. It may not be easy, but try to get at least one person on your side and it will make a big difference. There must be at least one nice person in your school, right?


If there is a rumor about you, set the record straight by letting your friends know what's true and untrue. Hearing them say, “I understand and don’t believe the rumors,” let’s you know that most people see gossip as it is, petty and immature.

Stay positive.,
Practice appreciating yourself.,
Stay true to yourself by honoring your unique qualities and talents.",How to Stop Getting Bullied at High School3," This can sometimes be difficult but is important for your own sanity. Don’t let him affect how you feel. Bullies generally want to know that they have control over your emotions. They absolutely don't, you do. Behave normally and don’t show fear. Act like his negative comments don’t affect you even if at first you are faking it.


React by using a sense of humor, saying something such as ""I'm really glad you finally found something funny to say."" This will throw the bully off guard and might change the direction of the interaction.

, Only you are responsible for yourself and your emotions. A good way to practice is by making a list of positive attributes and reflecting on them daily. Another way is by celebrating and rewarding yourself.


The more empowered you are and the more you can help yourself, the more likely you'll be able to stop the bully.

, Think of ways to feel at your best or strongest. Join a club or sport like track and field or drama. Get involved in school activities like yearbook or the school newspaper. You can perfect an existing talent or learn a new skill and make new friends in the process."

Know your rights.,
Encourage the student body to stand against bullying.,
Join the school’s anti-violence program.",How to Stop Getting Bullied at High School4," Remember that everyone in school has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, free from bullying, harassment, discrimination, and violence, so as to facilitate and harness the learning process. , Encourage them to visit areas in school that are not regularly monitored by staff.

Don't react with more bullying.,
Cut off the bully's power.,
Identify and avoid bullies.",How to Stop Being Bullied1,"

Although it might seem tempting to fight back with bullying it can cause further problems. Bullies enjoy feeling as though they have power over you or that they are able to get a reaction from you. Bullying back or getting angry will let the bully know they are hurting you. Do not respond to the bully with more aggression in order to get them to leave or stop.Tell them calmly to stop bullying you. For example, “You are being really uncool right now. Please stop.” or “That's enough. Don't talk like that again.”
Avoid getting angry or sarcastic in your response.
Try to keep your response short.
If they don't stop, walk away from them.
Do not fight with a bully, either with words or physically.;
,

Bullies try to take away your own sense of power and self worth so that they can enact their own power over you. Every time you give into the bully's tactics you make it more likely that they will bully you again in the future. Standing up to the bully by denying their demands will likely stop them from identifying you as a target. ,

Bullies will often act aggressively or intimidatingly in order to cause you to act how they want. They will use negative tactics to hurt you in some way, causing you to give in and do and feel what they want you to.

Determine if it’s bullying.,
Stay calm and tell the person to stop.,
Walk away.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Think of ways to keep yourself safe, emotionally and physically.",How to Stop Bullies1," There isn’t just one type of bullying—there are verbal, social and physical forms of the aggressive behavior known as bullying. But what they all have in common is that they are unwanted and repeated (rather than one time) behaviors.Verbal bullying includes teasing, name calling, inappropriate sexual comments or jokes, taunts and threats.
Social bullying refers to attempts to hurt someone's reputation or relationships and can include spreading rumors about someone, telling others not to associate with that person or purposefully embarrassing someone in public.
It's important to note that verbal and social bullying don't always happen in person. Cyberbullying is a type of bullying that happens through email, social media sites, phone messages, or in any other digital space.Cyberbullying can include threatening messages, online harassment, excessive texts or emails, embarrassing images or information posted on social media, and other verbal or social bullying tactics used in a digital space.Physical bullying happens when someone hurts another person's body or possessions. Physical bullying includes spitting, hitting, pushing, kicking, punching, tripping and pulling as well as stealing or destroying someone's property.
Keep in mind that all of these behaviors can happen and not be considered bullying. If a mean or aggressive behavior like hitting or name calling happens once, it isn't technically considered bullying. But if it happens repeatedly, or it becomes obvious that the perpetrator intends to continue with the unwanted behavior, it can be called bullying.;
, Look at the person who is bullying you and in a calm, clear voice tell him or her to stop, that his or her actions are inappropriate, or that he or she is being disrespectful.


If you’re good at joking with others and don’t feel threatened, you could also try to laugh off the comments or jokingly say something back. A humorous response can disarm the bully by throwing him or her off guard.
If the bullying is happening online it's best not to respond to the messages. If you know who the person is and feel comfortable telling them to stop, wait until you're face to face to do so., If you don’t feel safe or comfortable speaking up, simply walk away. Remove yourself from the situation and go to a safe space where there are other people around whom you trust.


If you're dealing with a cyberbully, stop responding to the bully's messages or log out of the site. To further remove yourself from the situation, block the bully so he or she can't contact you directly.

, Go to an adult, a family member, a teacher, a colleague, someone you trust, and explain to them what happened.


Talking to someone else can help you feel less afraid and alone and it can help you determine what you need to do next to prevent any further bullying.
If you feel threatened or unsafe it’s best to talk to someone who has authority over the bully and can intervene on your behalf, such as a teacher, boss, or police officer.

, It’s not up to you to fight back and you should always talk about what you’ve experienced with someone you trust. There are, however, some things you can do to take control and help yourself:


If possible, avoid the person who is bullying you or locations where the bullying happens.
Surround yourself with other people, especially if the bullying tends to happen when you are alone.
If the bullying is happening online, consider changing your screen name or other online identifiers, updating your privacy settings so only friends and family can contact you, or opening a new account. Remove information like your address or phone number from your online profiles and limit the amount of personal information you share in the future. Don't give bullies additional ways to get in contact with you.
Document when and where the bullying happens and what is done to you. It helps to have documentation of what happened if the bullying persists and further steps need to be taken by an authority figure. If the bullying is happening online, save all messages and emails and take screenshots of any social media posts.

(Have good bonds with the teacher(s) in order to do this) Never make the teacher hate you, s/he won't believe you and you will end up getting in trouble.;
, Don't be afraid to be called ""tattletale"", as you are doing the right thing by telling someone. If you don't feel comfortable telling them face to face, then write them a letter explaining your situation and give it to them. They will then most likely read it and approach you, wanting to assist you.

, If you think that your 'friend' is actually a backstabber or a frenemy, stop being friends with this person immediately.

, When they bully you, instead of fighting back, get away. Do it for your own safety, and if they chase you go to where there are other people. If they don't give up, go to the principal office as soon as you can, or go to a teacher who is nearby. If you don't do this quickly, the bully might see you and tell the teacher lies.

, Don't use high kicks, as the bully will just grab your leg and pull you down. When the bully gives up, don't become the bully by further hurting him or her, instead just calmly walk away.

,, Be honest but don't be overly dramatic. No principal wants students getting hurt in their school.

, This really helps! When a bully gets close your group, they will protect you from him or her. The bully may not even approach you. If you don't have any friends, just try to stay as far away as possible from that bully or stay within sight of a teacher.

, Become friends with old bullies, or at least neutral friends. Be as kind as possible.

, You probably have worked a long time to get here.

, Get more aggressive in trying to stop it instead of being intimidated. Talk with people around you, find out who else is hurt by that bully, and help them. Report the bully to the principal. Aggressively fight back (without being too physical). Don't let them see that you are bothered by what they say.

, Someone is bullying you! Don't just stand there and take it, stand up for yourself. This may be a lot harder than it sounds but if you do it, afterwards, you'll feel great. If you are not convinced that you have the courage, know what you want to say and who you want to say it to when you are standing up for yourself.

, When standing up for yourself, you have to know what to say and what not to say. The right thing to do, no matter how far it goes, is to avoid being mean. For example, if someone says something like, ""Nice shirt... not!"" to you, or something to diss you, you can say something back, that is not mean, but surprises them like, ""Thanks! I like your shirt too!"" Don't be sarcastic when saying this, sound genuine.

, Most likely, when you are getting bullied, you will be surrounded by a group. These can be your friends, or enemies. No matter who they are, you need to stand up for yourself. You may hear someone make fun of you for simply standing up for yourself. Some people may not even support the idea of you standing up for yourself.

, There are times that you can actually put a stop to a bullying situation. The greatest step to doing this is standing up for who you are and standing up for your friends. If someone insults you again and you are finally done with the bullying, you can say something along the lines of, ""You know what, I am tired of you bullying me! You may be insecure about yourself or just not like me, but that is no reason to do the things you are doing right now.""

, Often times, bullies want the attention, and get the attention. They want to start a fight and hurt the other person's feelings/emotions. Don't show them, and don't let them hurt your feelings. The person may be embarrassed, but you were too when you were being bullied. Your bully heard what you were saying when you stood up for yourself and in their heart, knows that it's wrong to do what they did.

Confide in an adult or someone with authority.,
Be assertive by telling the mean girl to “stop!” You must be willing to show strength to fend off a mean girl who is teasing or calling you names.,
Use your body language to reinforce the message.,
Try to ignore subtle forms of mistreatment.,
Fight back as a last resort.",How to Stop a Mean Girl1," If you encounter bullying or teasing at school or in a community environment, the best solution is to step forward and tell an adult. A teacher, coach, school counselor, community leader, or parent can all help you handle mean girls.Don’t fall into the trap of thinking the bullying will get worse if you tell. Bullies threaten their victims like this to keep their negative behavior a secret. Exposing the bully is the only way you can stop the problem. If the first person you tell does not take action, keep telling until something changes.
Pull the person aside and explain the situation. “Excuse me, Ms. Carson. Melanie keeps pushing me whenever we are in line for recess.” Stick to the facts and ask for help.;
, There’s no need to demonstrate your strength by getting physical or being verbally abusive with the bully. Instead, use your voice to speak up for yourself with confidence.


Your response to teasing or bullying doesn’t have to be grand. All you have to say is “Stop it,” or, “Knock it off,” to send the message that you will not allow yourself to be mistreated., Being assertive also crosses over to how you are holding your body and your facial expressions. Stand with your back straight, shoulders loose and your chin up. Make your facial expression serious to demonstrate that you are not joking around. Make direct eye contact and don't fidget — you can put your hands in your front of back pockets to appear confident and relaxed., Sometimes, mean girl behavior isn't so obvious. In such cases, it may be more difficult for you to call out the behavior and insist that the girl stop. Ignoring and trying not to demonstrate a negative reaction can help you in these instances.For example, if a girl is spreading rumors about you, but it's hard to prove, you might tell an adult; however, there's a chance it may not get resolved because no one wants to admit any wrongdoing. In this scenario, you may try to avoid showing any sort of response to the rumors and avoid talking to the people you think are involved. Remain true to yourself and eventually the truth of who you are will be louder than the rumors, which will fade away.
Or, if a group of ""friends"" is ignoring you, you might stop trying to be included and act as if you don't notice their slights. If they don't get a reaction, the mistreatment may stop in its tracks.

, Of course, you want to avoid getting in trouble because you were forced to get physical with a bully. That’s why you should always try to get to an adult and assertively stand up for yourself when facing a mean girl. Using any sort of physical defense should be your last option.Self-defense should be used during times when you are completely alone and unable to call for help and a bully has physically harmed you. If this happens, try a defense like kicking the person in the shins and then running away.

, Victims of bullying can suffer long-term emotional and psychological effects.Seeking professional help early on can help mitigate these effects.Older children and teens often try to deal with the emotional consequences of bullying on their own, which can lead to depression and anxiety disorders.If an older child or teen becomes withdrawn, or shows signs of depression or anxiety, such as sudden changes in school performance, sleep patterns, diet, or a reluctance to take part in social activities, it is important to seek professional help.Consult with a social worker or counselor at your child's school or another mental health professional.

, Bullying involves a perceived or actual imbalance of power – one person is bigger than the other, a group of people gang up on a single person, one person has higher status and control, etc. Fighting back can put victims at risk of more harm or leave them feeling to blame for the situation."

Look out for warning signs of bullying.,
Know who is most at risk of being bullied.,
Know where bullying happens.,
Talk about bullying.,
Model respect and kindness.,
Create a community strategy.",How to Stop Bullies3," There are many indicators that can let you know if someone is being bullied or bullying others. Looking out for these signs will help you identify bullying and intervene early on.


Signs that someone might be a victim of bullying:Injuries or bruises that a person can’t, or is unwilling, to explain
Lost, stolen or damaged personal property, such as torn clothing, broken glasses, stolen cell phone, etc.
Sudden changes in interests or a sudden urge to avoid certain people or places
Sudden changes in diet, self-esteem, sleeping, or other dramatic emotional or physical shifts
Depression, self-destructive actions, or talk about harming one’s self or others. If you or someone you know is in danger or is suicidal, don’t wait. Get help now. Resources can be found here



Signs that someone might be bullying others:

The person has become increasingly aggressive, either physically or verbally
Starts getting into frequent physical or verbal fights
Associates with people who bully others
Gets into trouble with authority figures frequently
Can’t take responsibility for his or her own actions and blames others for his or her problems


If you notice any of these warning signs have a conversation with the person. Letting others know that bullying isn't acceptable and that you are there to help can give a victim of bullying the courage to speak up.

, Certain groups may be at higher risk of being bullied than others. It's especially important to pay attention to these groups and watch for signs of bullying.Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) youth
Youth with disabilities
Youth with special needs, either educational or physical
Bullies may also target victims based on race, ethnicity or religion
Dealing with bullying targeted at LGBT youth, youth with disabilities or special needs, or bullying based on race, ethnicity or religion necessitates extra considerations specific to the victim. Information on dealing with these specific situations can be found here.


, Bullying often happens in places where supervision or outside observation is limited or absent, such as a school bus, a bathroom, etc.


Make an effort to check in on these spaces periodically so bullies don't see them as easy places to attack others.
If you are a parent, know where your kids are hanging out online. Be familiar with the platforms and devices they're using and ask to ""friend"" or ""follow"" them. If your child feels uncomfortable ""friending"" you, make sure s/he knows that s/he can always talk to you about issues s/he is experiencing online.

, Discuss what bullying is and ways to address it in your home, classroom, office, etc. Remind people that bullying is not acceptable behavior and there will be consequences for it.


When people can identify bullying they are more likely to take action, so talk about it before it happens.
Encourage others to talk to someone they trust if they are being bullied or know of someone else who is.
Establish rules about safe and appropriate technology use. Discuss what sites kids can and cannot visit, and when and where technology can be used.
Make a plan for safe ways to stand up against bullying for yourself and for others. Who would you talk to if you or someone else were being bullied? What would your first response be? How would this change depending on where you were?

, Respond to others with respect and kindness, even when you’re dealing with a bully. Bystanders will see how you handle the situation and will learn from you. Responding to a bully in an aggressive manner only intensifies the situation and can continue the cycle of bullying.

, Find others who want to prevent and address bullying and discuss prevention and intervention strategies.


Work together to keep an eye on places where bullying usually happens and watch out for signs of bullying in those around you.
Learn about your school or office bullying policy and encourage others to get familiar with it as well.
Let others know what to do and who to talk to if they're being bullied. Encourage others to speak up if they experience bullying themselves or see it happening to others.

Report relational aggression.,
Walk away from toxic friendships.,
Seek out friends who value and support you.",How to Stop a Mean Girl2," Schools often have rules against bullying, but there is a subtle, sneaky form of bullying called relational aggression that may go unnoticed. It’s important for you to be able to identify it so that you can know when it’s happening to you and protect yourself.


Relational aggression is more under-the-radar, less clear form of bullying that may involve being excluded from parties or playdates, teasing or calling girls names, giving the “silent treatment,” spreading rumors, not saving a seat for a friend, or using social media or cell phones to say mean things about another girl.Although it is more subtle, you can still talk to your parents, teachers, and other adults about helping you take action against a mean girl who is using relational aggression. Find out how your school handles bullies so that you can handle the situation appropriately.

, In addition to standing up for yourself in the midst of bullying, you also need to make it clear that you find the behavior unacceptable coming from a friend. Have the courage to say goodbye to friends who make you feel bad about yourself or make fun of you in front of others.


You can walk away from the friendship by saying something like, “The way you have been treating me hurts my feeling. That is not the way I expect to be treated by friends, so we’re not friends anymore.”, Just as you should know how to identify and walk away from a toxic friendship with mean girl, you also need to know what to look for in a positive friendship. Think about the people in your life who make you feel good about yourself and who seem to value your presence. Write down a few characteristics that you think define these people and use these as your standard for making new friends in the future.


For example, a good friend uses kind words, offers help when it is needed, shares, stands up for you, cares about your feelings and opinions, and is there for you. Believe that you are worthy of positive friendships and seek out people who can offer you these types of relationships."
"
Offer a safe place for discussing bullying.,
Model healthy relational behaviors.,
Present opportunities for her to resolve conflict.,
Teach empathy.Many times in school settings mean girls gang up on another child who is an outsider in some way.",How to Stop a Mean Girl3," If your child feels comfortable talking to you about problems at school, you are more likely to be able to intervene in a bullying situation and stop it before it gets worse. Usually, when bullying goes unchecked, the victim loses confidence about their ability to handle it.Make it normal in your household to discuss what’s happening at school. Ask your child about friends and classmates. Listen without distraction to catch cues that something may be amiss. Provide comfort and guidance and tough situations and make sure your child knows they can count on you if necessary.

, Recognize that how you communicate with and treat other adults and adolescents is being observed by your children. If you are not modeling appropriate behaviors at home, such as respecting other’s boundaries, listening, sharing, and avoiding sarcasm or mean comments, it’s highly possible that your children will take what they learn to the school environment. Remember that if your children see you model inappropriate relationship behaviors, they assumes that this behavior is OK., Your child's ability to effectively cope with mean girls at school relies on how they have seen conflict handled at home.Plus, their ability to have confidence and stand up for themselves comes with getting practice navigating difficult relational situations.


Not only do you want to model appropriate ways of handling conflict, but you also want to present your children with chances to develop conflict resolution skills. By doing this, you are empowering your children to handle difficult situations that may arise at school.
For example, you might find teachable moments when watching a movie together if a child in the movie is being bullied. You can quiz your children about appropriate ways to handle similar situations and see what they say. Based on their answers, you can use this opportunity to talk to them about bullying and how to protect themselves or stand up for a friend when bullying happens.

, Perhaps this child just moved to the area and is a new student at the school. Or, maybe this student is different in some way, such as race, culture, language, sexual orientation or disability.


If you can help your child learn to develop empathy for all people—even those who are different—they may be less likely to engage in bullying behaviors. What’s more, having empathy may also help a child who is the victim of bullying not internalize the behavior as being about them. An empathetic child may come to understand that a girl who constantly picks on others may be being picked on at home, have a dire need for attention, or hasn’t had the opportunity to participate in healthy friendships.
Teach empathy by first attending to basic emotional needs of your child. If those basic needs are met, then your child is more likely to show compassion and help others in need. Another way to teach empathy is to discuss bullying situations with your child and consider how the victim must feel. Saying things like “That must have been very humiliating for her” allows your child to identify how someone else may react to a situation emotionally.
Finally, you can teach empathy by giving your child opportunities to work alongside and help those who are less fortunate. It may be helpful to participate in a volunteer project in which your child becomes more aware of the circumstances of other people.

"
Ignore her as often as possible.,
Tell a trusting adult.,
Make eye contact with her.,
Use your words, not your fists.,
Find her weakness before she finds yours.,
Showing her assertive energy can also help, in some cases; it doesn't need to be confrontational.

,
Remember that it's only a phase.,
If she feels the need to say ""we"" or ""us"" and you know it's only her that's bullying you, it shows that she's a coward, and she is trying to intimidate you.,
See if she's bullying anyone else.,
Don't let it slide.,
Make a confrontation direct and brief.,
If they gossip you don't!",How to Stop a Mean Girl Bully," Bullies crave attention, and female ones aren't much different. If she bothers you, she'll expect a response, so if you decide not to give her one, she'll eventually grow bored with you.;
, Make sure you tell them not to mention your name so you aren’t labeled a snitch. By doing so, not only will you get your problem out, but you'll also be getting it off your chest, and sharing it with someone who cares.

, It shows confidence, that you couldn't care less what she does. If she can sense you're 'weak' or scared, she'll go after that. When you're making eye contact, and she looks at you, just give your hair a flick, smile, and turn away.

, However, if you are being physically threatened, (with guns, knives, etc.) do whatever you can. Do NOT start a fight or a riot; it will only create tension, and an audience, which may lead to a principal or boss pulling you into their office for a talk.

, This is the key to making her stop. Make her feel bad about bullying and try to shut her up so that she can't bother you. In other words, say something that she can't answer. Nevertheless, make sure it's not something that she can later make a comeback from.

,, Even if feel like it's the worst thing in the world, know that it will pass over some time. You won't have to spend the rest of your life with her.

, They do that to make people scared.

, Is it only you she's bullying? Maybe she has other victims too. Talk to them about it; see if she is doing the exact same thing to others.

, Hard kidding, making you the butt of the joke all the time, put-downs, and harsh criticism for no reason can't slide. If it's been going on for months or longer, it's a red flag. If it's a friend that's doing this, your friend is slowly wearing you down and that's indirect aggression.

, Don't try to butter up to her. That’s weakness in her eyes and don't provoke anything. (Your talents provoke her already.)

, It's just a way of telling them you want more meanness! Don't say negative things!"

Express your feelings constructively.,
Repeat these assertive behaviors.,
Understand that rude people may not change overnight.,
Gain perspective through your friends and family.,

Be proud of yourself.",How to Stand up to Someone," Standing up to someone can be stressful and it works better if you are feeling calm. Take a few deep breaths to calm your nerves and to help prepare yourself for the confrontation. Don't immediately react to the negative person without taking a deep breath.


Deep breathing can help to slower your heart rate, and relax your muscles. You may also feel less stressed about the situation.Breathe in deeply through your nose as you count up to five, and then breathe out through your mouth as you count down from five.;
, Rude people or bullies may try to make you feel guilty, anxious, fearful, or embarrassed. Bullying also has a lot to do with control.The bully wants to affect you emotionally, such as by making you angry, sad, or fearful. By staying in control of your emotions, you can avoid giving the bully the satisfaction of affecting you emotionally.


Try focusing on the bigger picture of who is in control rather than on the things the bully says or does to you. Remind yourself that you are in control of what you say and do, not the bully.
Identify a healthy way to express your feelings. You could do this by writing in a journal, calling a friend, or talking out loud to yourself.
See if there are ways to redirect your frustrations with that person. For example, you might go for a walk, prepare a meal, or listen to some music.

, Being unprepared to stand up to someone may increase your nervousness. That is why it is better to be prepared. Before you confront someone about their behavior, think carefully about your words. Name-calling and belittling them will only make them defensive. Think about ways to be serious and specific.


If there is a specific thing that someone is saying or doing to you, be specific in how and why you want them to stop. Explain your reasons, and the consequences if they don't.
Consider saying something like, ""Please don't take my folders without asking. This is my personal space, and if you need something, please ask me directly. Hopefully this won't happen again. But if it continues, I'll need to talk with the teacher/manager.""
Don't talk about using an act of violence as a consequence for the person's behavior.

, Power posing is the practice of getting into assertive, dominant physical positions to change your mindset. You can do a power pose for one minute and experience a large boost in self-confidence. Try doing a few power poses to build up your confidence before you confront this person. You can even stay in a power pose while you are standing up to someone.Try the Wonder Woman or Superman pose. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and place your hands on your hips. Then, lift up your chin and press out your chest slightly, just like a superhero. Stay in this pose for a minute to prepare yourself or maintain this position while you are standing up to the person.
Do the Obama pose. If you are sitting down, then a great way to look and feel more powerful (and nonchalant) is to lean back in your chair, put your feet up on a table, and place your hands behind your head.
Try the performer. Put your hands up above your head, as if you have just crossed a finish line in a race and you are celebrating your victory. This is a good pose to boost confidence, but it might look a little strange if you do it while you confront someone.

, Dealing with difficult people can make anyone angry, but it's not a healthy way to start an effective conversation. If you're feeling unable to be cool and calm, or feel like your emotions are too much at the moment, take a step back and breath.


When beginning to speak with someone about a conflict, keep your voice even and calm.Consider saying, ""I know that things are getting heated, but I'm just trying to figure out how we can handle this.""
Avoid name-calling, belittling, and threatening. Threatening someone will likely escalate the situation, and could be unsafe. If you feel that violence may occur if standing up to someone, talk with a person who is in charge before proceeding.

, Make eye contact when talking with the person. Keep a neutral or positive face if possible. Stand tall and upright.


Practicing in the mirror may help you. Non-verbal cues can be just as meaningful as words in how to stand up to someone. Avoid body language that threatens or demeans the person. You want to be his or her equal, not another bully.

, If you are making vague statements about a person's behavior, they are less likely to change. You need to speak your mind in a thoughtful and clear way, so that it is easy for the person to understand why you are upset or frustrated. If you can get them to ""walk in your shoes,"" they will be better able to follow what you ask.


Keep the conversation brief and concise. You don't need to use this as an opportunity to blame them for all their faults. Focus only on the issue at hand.Consider saying, ""I am uneasy about the way you just talked to my friend and I. Please think about what you say before you say it. And we'll respect you in the same way.""

, Use statements that focus less on the person, and more on how their actions make you feel. By focusing on how a person's behavior is making you feel, it sounds less accusatory. You want to avoid making them defensive and angry.


Consider using 'I' statements such ""I disagree with some of the facts that you presented"" instead of ""You're wrong"" or ""I am upset with how you don't complete your part of the assignment on time"" instead of ""You're lazy.""

, Being assertive one time will probably not be enough to stop the bully. The bully may need several reminders to stop bullying. That is why it is important to repeat these assertive behaviors and make them part of your regular behavior. By practicing these assertive behaviors on a regular basis, they will become habitual and this will make it easier for you to stand up for yourself.

, While it's good to stand up to someone, it's unlikely that they will change their behavior completely. Be realistic that change may not happen overnight, or at all. Change will most likely be small at first.Making the issue known has the greatest potential for change, but it will take time for actual change to occur.
See yourself as helping the negative person become more aware of the issue.

, Your friends and family may have a different take on how to handle a negative person. Be aware of what might work, and not work, in this particular situation. Consider asking them for your support, or being present, when you need to stand up to someone. What works for one person may not always work for another. But it's good to get a wide variety of perspectives rather than keeping it to yourself.

, If you are a teenager or younger, sometimes it is necessary to involve adults such as teachers, parents, or other adults. If you are an adult encountering a negative person in the workplace, you may want to discuss the issue with a supervisor.


A person in authority can help you to handle the situation more formally, with specific consequences. This is largely done after an issue cannot be resolved informally.
While it is generally appropriate to resolve an issue informally with someone, don't let a negative person continue to frustrate you for weeks or months. Be willing to speak out formally if needed.

, Even if the person does not heed your request to back off, it is important for you to acknowledge your success in being assertive and standing up for yourself. Try looking yourself in the mirror and congratulating yourself. Remember to be proud of yourself every time you stand up for yourself.

Learn to say no.,
Redirect the conversation respectfully.,
Ask your bully for an explanation.,
Show confidence when interacting with your bully.,
Stay calm and unemotional.,
Make eye contact.,
Defend yourself physically as a last resort.,
Stand up for others who are bullied.",How to Stand up Against Bullying Without Getting in Trouble1," Bullies look for targets who will not assert themselves. One simple way to deal with bullies is to just tell them no. If they’re trying to make you do things for them or boss you around, say no and walk away. Don’t let the bully dictate how you should act. The more you give in, the more likely the bully is to continue harassing you. That’s why the first step to getting rid of a bully is simply saying no and sticking to it.If a bully asks you to do something for them, try saying no politely. For example, if a bully says, ""Can you answer these homework questions for me?"" You can say something like, ""I'm sorry I was just about to leave."" Then, walk away.
If you can't leave the situation, you can try something like, ""I don't think I'll be able to help you. I'm struggling with this assignment as well.""
If you have the time and think the bully may be open to listening, you can say something like, ""No I can't answer them for you, but I can help you with the assignment."";
, This can be difficult, especially if you feel your bully has disrespected you, your loved ones, or your friends. However, most bullies won’t enjoy their bullying behaviors if the person being bullied continues to treat them with respect. Don’t engage with their bullying talk. Instead, redirect the bully to a different topic. If you feel confident enough to do so, you can even try making a joke to diffuse the situation.


An example of redirecting the bullying talk may be, if your bully says something like, “There’s that stupid kid.” Respond politely with something as simple as, “My name is Sam.”
An example of using a joke to diffuse the situation could be, responding to the same comment, “There’s that stupid kid,” by saying something funny like, “I’m not that stupid.”
Don’t make the joke at the bully’s expense. This will likely only make them angrier, and turn you into a bully.
As long as the bully continues to harass you verbally, you can continue to respond to them with respect. If they begin to physically harm you, it’s time to avoid them or ask for help., If you’re unable to redirect the bullying talk or make a joke, you can attempt to address the issue directly. When you have an opportunity to talk to the bully one-on-one, ask them why they are harassing you. In some cases, pointing out the bully’s behavior may be enough to make them stop. This direct approach will let them know you can stand up for yourself, and in some cases, they may not even realize their behavior is affecting you.


Make sure you talk to your bully privately, but always be close enough to other people that you can call for help. You never know when a bully will escalate from verbal harassment to physical abuse.
Use specific incidents rather than generalizations. For instance, say, “Why do you keep calling me stupid?” Instead of, “Why do you keep making fun of me?”
If your bully refuses to respond or responds with more harassment, walk away. Don’t push the issue. Remember that people often use bullying as a tactic to deal with unpleasant issues in their own life, and prodding into those issues may cause them to take it out on you., Don’t turn away, look down, or look scared. Hold your head up high. Try to seem confident, even if you aren't. If your bully sees you as being weak or scared, they’ll consider you an easy target for their harassment for two reasons: they think you won’t defend yourself and they think what they say will affect you. Show your bully that you are confident in who you are and that their bulling doesn’t upset you.


Remember that despite what a bully says about you, you are a valuable person with valid opinions and insights. You have every right to expect people to treat you with respect.
If you take what a bully says personally, it may be an indication that you hold negative beliefs about certain aspects of your life. If you internalize their comments, you may want to think about why they impact you so much. This can be used as a tool for growth.
You may look and feel more confident if you wear clothing that makes you feel comfortable, so select outfits that boost your self-confidence.
Don’t allow the bully’s comments to make you doubt yourself., No matter how upset you are, don't cry, yell, or show emotion in front of the bully. In many cases, this is exactly what they want. This will let them know that what they are doing is working. Bullies like getting to you, and they will come back for more. Don’t react to their harassment, and many bullies will stop simply because they aren’t getting the reaction they want out of you., If you notice the bully looking at you, look them in the eyes. Keep your face free from emotion, and try to maintain eye contact to let them know you’re not scared of them. Don't look worried. You’d be surprised how uncomfortable eye contact can make your bully. This shows you are confident and unconcerned, and it will make them second guess themselves., Don’t ever start a physical fight with a bully. This will almost certainly lead to you getting into trouble. However, if your bully does try to fight, you may want to be able to protect yourself. Run away if this is possible. Curl into a ball with your face and head protected. As a last resort, fight back. You don’t want to take this approach if you can avoid it, but sometimes, you need to protect yourself.


Consider taking self-defense courses, if your bully is physically harassing you regularly.
Avoid your bully to prevent physical altercations, whenever possible. Remember that unwanted physical contact is considered assault, and is a crime. You can always threaten to call the authorities if things get physical.
Always seek help from a person in authority if your bully is physically assaulting you., If you notice your bully is harassing other people too, offer your support to the people being bullied. Even if the other people are harassed by a different bully, stopping to make sure they're okay and helping them address the bully will not only make them feel better it will continue to improve your confidence."

If they continue encroaching on your territory or continue mocking you in some way, simply repeat your sentence. ""Stop. I want you to stop right now. Stop."" Don't say or do anything else but hold your ground and repeat yourself.;
, Bullies tend to pick on those who they identify as being unwilling or unable to stand up for themselves. Bullies choose easy targets to ""test"" by needling with words and actions. The quickest and best way to end bullying is to stand up for yourself and tell the bully firmly to stop and repeat the action until they comply.


Negotiating, trying to befriend, or showing that it bothers you will give them more ammunition and make it worse. Don't whine, try not to cry, and stay firm. They'll get bored and lose interest when you stand up for yourself and don't give them anything to bully. There's nothing funny to say about ""Stop."" There's nothing to mock in someone who is confident.

, Pay attention to the way you hold yourself physically in the presence of bullies. Even if they're bigger than you (which they often are) stand up straight and look them straight in the eye. Hold their gaze icily. Look through them. Look as if you know something they don't.


Think of your favorite strong-willed characters from movies. Picture Vin Diesel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Clint Eastwood standing up to your bully as you stare them down: ""Go ahead, punk. Make my day."" Cast yourself as Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada Angelina Jolie in Wanted, or even Wednesday Adams from the Adams Family. Be unflappable.

, Don't listen to the things bullies say or take them seriously. Bullies say things in order to get a rise out of you, not because they believe these things, not because they are true, and not because they're trying to help. They're trying to break you down as a way of holding themselves up, because bullies are insecure and bullies are weak at heart.


Develop a mantra to recite if you're consistently bullied, and continually run it over in your mind while your bully is talking. A good mantra might be a set of lyrics that you like, or a prayer, or a quote that holds you up. If they get in your face, tell them to stop and hold your icy stare. Stay calm. Repeat your mantra.

, Don't allow yourself to get sucked into an insult-exchange with a bully. You'll almost always lose any kind of verbal head-to-head, even if you're wittier, funnier, and smarter (which you are). Bullies rig the game. Don't try to come up with better come-backs and cutting insults, which can do more to make it worse.


Don't play the bullying game. Don't give them more ammunition. Tell them to stop, stand tall, and give them a target they'll be uninterested in.
Alternatively, play dumb. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, the professional wrestler, used to interrupt other wrestlers who tried to talk trash by shouting, ""What?"" and acting confused when they talked. It took the wind right out of their sails.

, The best thing you can do to stand up to faceless online bullies is to ignore them. If someone is bullying you online, whether it be through email, text, Facebook, or other social networking, you need to disengage from the bully as much as possible. Avoid getting sucked into an exchange of insults or arguments on any web platform, especially one in ""public."" As tempting as it may be, avoid the temptation to sling mud back.


If necessary, change your privacy settings, ""unfriend"" the bullying party, or start new accounts, if necessary. Just because it's not in person doesn't make it less dangerous.

, It's not advisable to let bullies draw you into a fight, but you'll be able to carry yourself with more confidence and character if you're confident that you'll be able to defend yourself if it comes to that. Learn to throw a proper punch and hold your own.



Stand properly. Put one foot forward and balance your weight with your legs shoulder width apart. Maintain a solid center of gravity and keep moving, bouncing on your toes. They can't hit you solidly if you keep moving.

Make a fist. Wrap your thumb around the bottom of your fingers, not inside your fist and not on the side of your fingers, as if you were holding a bug you didn't want to escape. Make a loose fist.

Aim for the soft spots. If you've got to throw a punch, aim for a place that'll do the most damage. Smashing your fist into someone's jaw will hurt you more than them. Aim for the nose.

Keep your elbows tucked in. Throw straight punches and jabs, not wild uncontrolled hay makers. More power comes from vertical straight-ahead punches, so keep your elbows in.

Play defense. Hold your non-writing hand near your chin to guard your face and hold your writing hand up nearer your cheek. When playing defense, leave your fists relatively loose to swat away punches.

, Any time you're bullied, write it down as specifically as possible. Record who was involved, where, and at what time. If you're physically injured, take pictures of any cuts, scrapes, or bruises you receive. If your clothes get torn, save them. If anyone saw the bullying take place, talk to them and get them to come forward with you and report the behavior.


Save any evidence of cyberbullying you receive by making a copy, taking a screen shot, or printing out hard copies for your records. Use these as evidence.

, As soon as you feel you've been bullied, report the behavior, with your good evidence and your witnesses, to the appropriate authority in charge of the situation. Be sure to use the word ""bully,"" say that you feel unfairly singled out and that you're intimidated and frustrated by this person's behavior.

, Whether you've encountered a bully at school or elsewhere, it's always best to start by telling your parents.Your parents are always there for you so tell them the details. It's still on you to stand up for your own self, but having the back-up of your parents is important.

, Wait and present your case calmly to the correct authority. If you're getting bullied at lunch, telling the exhausted and overworked lunch lady probably won't get much done. If the student is in your class, tell your teacher. If the student that's bullying you is in another grade, consider making any appointment with the guidance counselor or an assistant principal.

, If you're not in school, or if the behavior continues and won't stop, contact the police. Provide your evidence and follow their instructions.

, Don't leave anything out to make yourself look better. It's better to be honest and try to get action to occur, rather than trying to make yourself look good. If you said something mean back to the bully, own up to it. If you threw the first punch, say so. Your word will mean more in this situation.

, Bullies select targets who they perceive as being weak. People with fewer friends, or people who are physically smaller are more readily targeted by bullies. Because bullies lack confidence, they will only select targets they can intimidate and dominate. By befriending those who are likely to be bullied, you'll take away the ammunition and find safety in numbers.It can be tempting and misguided to want to pile on a kid getting bullied to get the attention away from yourself. ""Hey, if that kid's getting it, it means I'm not getting it!"" Never do this. Instead, stick up for the bullied and everyone will end up being better off.

, As you roam the halls of your school and neighborhood, keep an eye out for the signs of bullying. Any time you see a bigger kid picking on a smaller kid, or any time you see a classmate who seems beat down and nervous, start paying attention and learn to fight bullying.

, Travel the halls with friends, and walk home with other kids in your neighborhood to stay safe in numbers. Bullies will be less likely to pick on a group of kids.


If you are confronted by a bully, stay solid in a pack. Stick with the plan. Tell them to stop and stare them down. Tell your friends to do the same. Stay confident.
If a bully starts picking on a friend in your group, never laugh or join in the bullying. Don't try to deflect the bullying elsewhere, or you're engaging in bully-type behavior yourself.

, Spread goodwill and be friendly to more people as a way of earning respect widely. If you're known as a person of character and confidence, someone who is unshaken by confrontation, you won't be bullied. Be kind to everyone, the popular and the unpopular, even if you're not best friends. Don't take cheap opportunities to exploit or tease other people for your personal gain.

, When you've got a network of people built up around you, use that network to ignore people who would bully and would use bullying tactics to intimidate others. Freeze them out.


If a bully confronts you about not talking to them or including them in activities, be up front about what you're doing: ""We don't like the way you act. If you stop insulting everyone and bullying everyone, you'll be welcome.

Stick with your friends.,
Avoid places where the bully hangs out.,
Ignore your bully.,
Walk away.",How to Stand up Against Bullying Without Getting in Trouble2," Avoid walking alone as this may attract the bully. If there isn't anyone else around to walk with, take a path where there are a lot of people who will see if the bully tries to harass you. Most bullies won’t approach a group of people. They want to make you feel bad or get a reaction from you. With friends there to support you, they know you’re less likely to respond with the emotion they want.


Bullies are less likely to pick on you, if they think they’ll be the “odd man out.” Sticking with your friends will discourage them from bullying you.
Tell your friends about the bullying, and ask them to stick up for you in case the bully does approach., Don’t put yourself in a situation where the bully will have an opportunity to verbally or physically attack you. Think about where you’ve come in contact with your bully in the past, and try to find alternate routes, shift your schedule, or change habits to avoid the bully. Don’t let your bully dramatically impact your day to day life, but if you can easily circumvent the places you run into them, doing so may be the easiest way to avoid conflict.


For instance, if you often run into the bully on your way home from a specific event, plan for an alternate route that won't take you past your bully.
If you have to see your bully in a class, try to walk as far away from them as possible, and avoid sitting near them.
If your bully frequents the same coffee shop or other public location, consider going at a different time of day., If they call you names, don't say anything in response. Most bullies are behaving in a harassing way to get a specific reaction from you. If you don’t respond at all, they are more likely to lose interest. Not responding may also make the bully angrier, so make sure to read their responses and leave possibly hostile situations., This may be easier said than done. In some cases, the bully will not want you to walk away, and will continue to follow and harass you. If the bully tries to physically attack you, it is especially important to walk away because engaging in violent behavior will likely lead to you and your bully being in trouble. In some cases, you may even attract the attention of the police. Do what you can to remove yourself from the situation by simply walking away rather than engaging with the bully."
"
Keep evidence of the bullying.,
Ask friends for advice.,
Talk to your family.,
Tell someone in authority.",How to Stand up Against Bullying Without Getting in Trouble3," If you’re being bullied via email, text, negative comments on social media, or other cyberbullying techniques, document this. Print off emails, save text messages, and capture screenshots of social media comments. You can also note days, times, and places where in-person incidents occurred. If you had friends present to witness the bullying, ask them to write a summary of what happened and what both you and the bully did. If possible, you should take pictures, audio recording, or videos as the bully harasses you., If you feel you’re being bullied, chances are you’re right. However, other people may perceive the situation differently. See what your friends think of the situation, and ask them what they would do. Listen to your friend’s advice, and try to put it into use right away. If you’ve already tried a method they recommend, let them know how it went.


Start by finding out if your friend thinks the situation is bullying. While you may be hurt by certain behaviors, other people may view them differently. Say something like, “Bryan is always calling me stupid. Do you think he’s kidding, or do you think he’s really being mean to me?”
Ask for advice dealing with a specific issue. Say something like, “You remember how Bryan called me stupid the other day? He does that a lot. Do you think I should say something?”This is also a good rule of thumb if you feel bullied in the workplace. Talk to you coworkers first, especially if you have a coworker who has more experience with the person bullying you., While friends will likely want to help you, they may also be friends with the person doing the bullying. This can prevent them from giving you the best advice. Your parents, siblings, or other family members may be able to offer more objective perspectives for you. You can practice interacting with the bully by role playing with a family member. Additionally, they can serve as advocates or mediators, if you want to confront the bully in a safe, controlled environment.


Depending on your age and the age of your bully, you may also want to have your family member reach out to their parents or other family member to meet with you.If your bully is a coworker, a human resources representative may be a more appropriate advocate and mediator., If the bullying continues to escalate despite your best efforts to confront or avoid the bully, it’s time to ask for help from someone in a position to intervene. This is especially important if the bully is physically harassing you. Use your documentation as evidence, and try to calmly explain the situation.


If you’re in school, have your parent or guardian meet with you, the principal or guidance counselor, and your bully and their parents.
If you’re dealing with a workplace bully, talk to your boss or human resources department about the problems, and ask for their help dealing with the bully.
If your bully is harassing you in an uncontrolled atmosphere like a public restaurant, library, on a bus, in your home, or in other public areas that do not necessarily have specific authorities, you may need to involve the police."
"
Watch out for students that seem to have a problem with authority (police, teachers, principal etc.),
Know the common traits of both male and female bullies:


Male bullies are often aggressive and assertive, and they do not attempt to hide their aggression.,
If one of your friends starts to bully you, however tough it may be, do not stay friends with them.,
Understand that many school social environments do not condemn bullying.,
Watch out people who bully fellow students.,
As a final note on this topic, male bullies will make use of ""gay"" slurs and crude female scatological references in their verbal bullying, while girl bullies will generally attempt to make their victim think that they are not popular and hated by everyone.

,
Be on the lookout for someone who is commonly violent.,
Keep in mind that bullies do not dislike hiding their actions.,
Know that many bullies maintain an active presence online that you should be aware of.,
Once you spot the bully, avoid them.",How to Spot a Bully," and seem to do their assignments poorly. Most bullies cannot accept authority, and often get into arguments with teachers, guidance counselors, and possibly even parents. Bullies do not generally perform well in school, and get poor grades. You can also sometimes see them talking back to teachers, being mean to others, not listening in class, or just not doing their best during class time.;
, They are typically of an athletic build. They tend to bully other boys and other girls and usually bully physically or even sexually.






Female bullies are still overly aggressive and assertive, but they are often more focused on isolating other girls from their cliques and making hurtful remarks than they are focused on inflicting physical pain to their victim.







, They will only cause trouble and you may get caught up doing something you don't want to do like getting into a fist fight. You will also be a suspect in crimes (whether just school crimes or more serious ones) if that person gets in trouble often simply because you are their friend.

, Elementary school playgrounds are sometimes unsupervised, and most of the bullying goes unnoticed, therefore unpunished. Even worse, when a group of middle school children were sat down for an interview, over a third of them stated that bullying was acceptable if the victim was ""annoying"", and the same amount admitted that resorting to physical violence could be a valid option in dealing with conflict. In the majority of high school environments, it is considered important to be liked by peers, and it has been found that many students are guilty of becoming neutral bystanders (individuals who witness bullying, but say nothing about it). Neutral bystanders provide emotional support for bullies, and bullies crave this more than anything else. Remember that yes, it is important for others to like you, and mostly not hate you, but remember to be yourself and most of all don't be mean or a bully or bystander.

, Bullies love to use language like the following:


""You're trying out for the basketball team? They allow wimps to waste their time?""
""You are ugly, and I am sure that she or he would rather go out with an ape than you.""

,, A bully (even if they do not look like it) will not think twice about attacking you if you attempt to assert yourself while no one else is around. Beware of bullies appearing in empty schoolyards to confront you; always stand up for yourself when other students are near. Do not attempt to engage in ""scheduled fighting"" that involves having a sparring match between you and the bully in an area where your classmates can watch. It is important not to fight back, and be sure to stand up for yourself and say something back that is not mean and rather more mature. If you say something back while standing up for yourself and not being mean, then this can work to stop/lower the bullying.

, They are not ashamed of what they do, no matter how bad it is. They often advertise their actions to peers and are proud of themselves because of the reputation that it gives them. Despite popular beliefs, studies have shown that bullies are not shy; they have high self esteem.

, Girls are more likely to be cyber bullies than boys, because girl bullies like to spread rumors, and the Internet provides them with the perfect venue. However, male cyberbullying is still existent and hardly uncommon. Record the harassment, print out your proof, and show it to a school official. Cyberbullying is becoming a much more serious issue than before, and there is no reason to let it go on. Be sure to block a bully online and don't reply. Also, be sure to stand up for yourself and others.

, Try your best not to go near them, especially if there is no teacher around.

Recognize bullying behavior.,
Don't respond to name calling or mean behavior.,
Avoid areas you know the bully hangs out, if possible.,
Block the bully online.",How to Stand Up to a Bully (for Girls)1," You may not even realize you're being bullied, or contributing to the bullying of others. The first sign is often that you feel bad about yourself when certain people are around.This is especially true of bullies who are girls. While girl bullies may use violence and verbal taunts or threats, they are skilled at using relational aggression to hurt others too.


Relational aggression refers to behavior that aims to diminish social standing and relationships. A bully might spread rumors, try to get you to do embarrassing things, or point out flaws or mistakes to humiliate you, exclude you from group activities, and/or convince others they shouldn't talk to you.;
, Bullies feel powerful because they believe they are able to exert control over the feelings of others.The goal of bullying is to illicit a reaction from the bullied. Refusing to respond diminishes the sense of power the bully feels.


Continue doing your activity without acknowledging a bully's comments. For example, if you are hanging out with your friends, continue your conversation as if the bully wasn't there.
If the bully has positioned him or herself to be intrusive in your activity, turn your back to the bully and continue what you were doing.
If the bully physically attacks you, protect yourself and get away. This type of behavior needs to be reported immediately. Violence is never okay, and this type of behavior typically escalates; reporting it is absolutely necessary for your safety and possibly others'., This can be tricky, especially when the bullying occurs at school. Girls tend to bully covertly, so making a girl bully go out of her way to engage in bullying behavior will expose her.Don't tiptoe around the bully, as this will be perceived as a reaction, but there is no need to hang out in the same area of the quad.
If you have lockers near one another, you can ask school office staff to reassign your locker.
If avoiding the bully isn't possible, ask friends to go with you when you must be in the same area as the bully to create a buffer., Cyberbullying is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly among girls.Change privacy settings on social networking profiles to prevent bullies from contacting you. Refuse to read or acknowledge anything the bully posts online targeted at you.


If you do become aware of threats or attacks directed at you, do not respond, but save the evidence, as it may be important if you choose to report the bully.You might also block known phone numbers of the bully on your mobile phone to prevent unwanted calls and texts.

Emotional bullying is when you manipulate someone for your own gain by making them feel shame or taking away their power and confidence. This includes gossiping, backstabbing, isolating, and leaving people out.

,

Inform yourself of the many bullying incidents that have led to victims becoming bullies or killers later in life, deaths, and suicides.
Know that bullying can lead to suspension, expulsion, or even arrest depending on the severity of the situation.
If you know that you are more inclined to bully people who you dislike, learn more about them to make them less unlikable. You may even make new friends that way!

, Different bullies may have different reasons to bully. They may have learned to be abusive from the environment in which they lived or they may have a feeling of aggressive dislike towards others. They may have also suffered from trauma or be dealing with issues in their own lives, as the saying ""misery loves company"" goes. If that is the case for you, forgive yourself and learn better ways of dealing with this than taking it out on other people.

, Do you hurt others because you're being hurt? Sometimes people bully others because they learned how to do it from someone else. Think about how other people in your life deal with their own insecurities and sense of powerlessness.


If you are being bullied in your home, seek the help of a school counselor, a therapist, or someone you trust immediately.

, Many people bully others because they're insecure with some aspect of themselves. Consider the following questions:


Are you bullying to cover your own weakness? Putting someone else down as a way to hide your own powerlessness is a common reason to bully.
Are you bullying to show off for others? Perhaps you're trying to stay afloat in a harsh group situation by putting on a display of power.
Do you tease someone else about something you dislike about yourself? Bullying someone else who shares an unwanted trait is also common.
Are you hurting other people because you're unhappy with your life? Some people act out against others when they feel powerless to change something about their own circumstances.

, What goes through your mind when you're hurting someone else? What events usually occur to lead to the bullying? If you can thoroughly understand the pattern that happens when you lash out, you stand a better chance of stopping negative behavior.

, Ask yourself how you would feel if you were in the situation in which they are. If you would not like it if someone else hurt you physically or emotionally, do not give others this pain. Treat others how you would want to be treated.

, To stop yourself from bullying, you must be able to communicate how you feel with the victim or the potential victim. For example, if the person was once your friend and a misunderstanding caused your friendship to end, it may be helpful to clear up the misunderstandings.

, People do not normally bully for no reason. There has to be a cause of the problem. There can be many reasons, but here are a few:




Is it to feel superior because you had been bullied in the past?
Is it because you have been in an environment in which bullying is common?
Is it because, you envy someone or want something from them?
Is it because you are trying to ""fit in"" or ""seem cool?""



, If you're bullying other people because you have a temper problem, practice thinking before you act. For example, if someone says something that might usually set you off, take a deep breath and pause before responding.


Realize that with every action you are making a decision to behave in a certain way. Your words and behaviors are under your control.

, If you hurt other people as a way to gain status in a group, that group is having a negative influence on you. Chances are you don't actually want to be hurting others, but you feel you have to for ""survival"" purposes. Remove yourself immediately and halt your bullying behavior.


If the group threatens you into bullying someone else, tell someone you trust that you need help handling the situation.

, Perhaps you're mean to other people because you aren't thinking about things from their perspective. Ask yourself, how would you feel if someone were hurting you this way?


Spend time with people and get to know them on deeper level.
Understand that everyone is equal: you are not better than other people, and they are not better than you.
Appreciate what makes each person unique, instead of judging them for their differences.

, Based on the reason for bullying, change the way you feel about victims or potential victims. Look for positive things in others instead of negatives and reasons to bully. For example, if you are bullying because you want to ""seem cool"" and in-power, them think about how you could be even more popular as someone who was kind to others. Turn into a game of ""finding the best"" in every person you meet––did you know that can actually get through to even the prickliest of people when you work out their good features and highlight those rather than picking on their worst? It's a much more effective way of dealing with others than being mean or offensive. It may even gain you lifelong allies, if not friends.

, If you feel you can't control your bullying on your own, talk to a counselor or therapist about your problem. She or he will provide you with tactics to help you change your behavior.

, When you've gained control of your behavior, you still have a long way to go toward getting people's trust back. Start by thinking through the entire part you have played in the upset; then, offering a sincere apology to those you have hurt. Be vulnerable and courageous. Keep the focus on what you have done/said. Then, let the person know what you can be counted on for in the future and be wedded to the words coming out of your mouth. If you admit that it was wrong to start bullying the victim, then the victim will have less of reason to dislike or fear you. You may even become friends with the person, which an help to make the relationship between you less abrasive.


Don't apologize until you sincerely mean it. People will be able to sense if your words are not genuine.
If you've hurt someone deeply over time, they may not want to talk to you. Respect their space, and realize that relationship may be permanently damaged.

, Practice new ways of understanding and relating to people until it becomes habit to treat people respectfully. If you find yourself veering toward angry thoughts again, remember to pause and think before acting. Focus on what you have in common with people and appreciate their humanity. You can't control other people, but you can control yourself.

Ignore the bully!,
Tell your parents.,
Come back with clever comebacks.,
Learn to protect yourself.,
If after everything they won't give up (which is highly unlikely,) get professional help.",How to Stand up to a Bully(a Kids Point of View)," Especially in cyber bullying. If you ignore them, you will feel so much better because it is like an annoying little brother. If you don't reply to what they say, eventually they will stop annoying you.;
, If the bully is at school, in person make sure they don't find out you squealed. Get help, but if the principal tells them off they will just bully you more.

, If they say: ""Oh you're so ugly, you don't deserve to live"" for example just say ""I have looked in the mirror, I know I am not ugly, and if I don't deserve to live, why am I living? God gives everyone a chance,"" and walk away. Let them know you're not afraid and they will stop picking on you

, If the bullying still doesn't stop, take karate or Tae Kwon-Do if they are physically hurting you, then if you train you will be stronger than them.

, If at any point you are feeling suicidal, depressed, or just terrible, get help immediately. At the end of the day, it isn't about who's popular and who's not. It's about who you are and how pretty you are on the INSIDE, never mind the outside. If the people who are bothering you are teasing you, its probably because they are INSECURE. Just know that you are just styling them and they know that and are afraid!

Tell a friend.,
Tell a trusted adult.,
Tell your story anonymously.",How to Stand Up to a Bully (for Girls)2," Don't suffer silently. Talk to a friend about what you're experiencing. Sharing your pain will help you feel better, and create an opportunity for your friend to offer additional emotional support.


Telling a friend about being bullied will also establish an ally who can help you avoid the bully and create a buffer when avoidance isn't possible.

, Talking to an adult doesn't mean she will intervene. If you would prefer she didn't intervene, you might tell her you'd like guidance, but you want to try handling the situation yourself before adults get involved.She could be a family member, school counselor, family friend, or a coach.


This will put the bullying behavior on an adult's radar, so she can intervene in the event you are in over your head and establishes evidence should you need to file a formal complaint in the future.

The adult can help you decide when it is time to formally report bullying behavior.



, Online forums are a good way to share your experience, if you are too embarrassed to talk to people you know.Many forums have experienced members who may be able to offer encouragement and suggestions to help you manage your situation.


This also creates an opportunity for you to support others who are victims of bullies and may be a source of new friendships.

Identify the appropriate person to take your report.,
Provide evidence of the bullying.,
Share the steps you've taken to prevent or address the bullying.",How to Stand Up to a Bully (for Girls)3," Determining the appropriate agency to report to will depend on the type of bullying and where the bulling happens, but parents are usually the best people to tell first.Your parents can help you decide what needs to be reported and to whom.


If the bully is a schoolmate or the bullying takes place on school grounds, the bully should be reported to school authorities. School officials can then intervene.
If the bullying includes violent attacks or threats of violence, the police may need to get involved. This behavior is very serious and can lead to extreme physical harm and/or property destruction.
Cyberbullying should be reported to the administrators of the sites used, as well as school officials when the bully is a student, and possibly police if online posts violate your rights.

, Providing evidence will ensure your complaint is taken seriously, as the bully will likely deny any wrongdoing. It also may be difficult for the parents of the bully to accept their child is bullying. Evidence will make it impossible for them to continue ignoring their child's problem behavior.Cyberbullying is usually the easiest to provide evidence for. You can save abusive communication and take screenshots of inappropriate behavior. It's best to do this when you see unacceptable posts and not wait until you've reached the point of filing a complaint. The bully will likely try to delete the evidence once she becomes concerned you have or will file a complaint.
You can provide evidence of other types of bullying by telling others when it happens, asking witnesses to give reports, and keeping a dated journal of events as they happen.

, This will help to establish a pattern of behavior by the bully and also show you are not being petty. The need for intervention will be more evident if you show your own attempts to manage the situation have been ineffective, increasing the likelihood of intervention.


This may also help others generate ideas to manage bullies in other circumstances. Your experiences could save others from being victimized.

"
Avoid the bully whenever possible.,
Ignore any inappropriate behavior.,
Use humor.,
Confront someone with whom you spend time with regularly.,
Remain calm.,
Be mindful of your physical and emotional reaction.,
Document any offenses.,
Speak to a superior or someone who can help.,
Refuse to take bullying behavior personally.,
Don’t reciprocate bullying behavior.,
Refrain from getting into a physical altercation.,
Choose not to allow yourself to become isolated by a bully.",How to Respond to an Adult Bully," If you are faced with a bully, one of the best strategies to use is removing yourself from the situation. Take a different route to class. Walk in a group where you are less likely to be singled out. If it is not possible to avoid the bully all together, make sure you are never alone with him or her. The bully may not want witnesses to the bad behavior so even taking the step to have another person with you may help to end the problem.

Be careful to not make it an obvious reaction out of fear that you are avoiding the bully. Bullies often target those they can scare or get a reaction out of. Be stealthy about your avoidance. Do not give him or her satisfaction of having that power over you.
If the bully is finding you on social media, block the profile. Remove any connections you share with the bully on the internet.This works best for the bully you may only know online. If this is the case, he or she will generally move onto another target. If you do block the profile, be aware that the bully may create a new and different profile so be careful about adding new people.;
, A bully may call names or try to embarrass you, but ignoring the taunts may send the message that he or she will not be getting a reaction out of you. The bully will likely move on.This is going to be very hard to do in some cases, but think of it as a game and it may get easierDo not feel like you need to explain or acknowledge you are ignoring the bully. He or she is usually very purposeful of the action and are well aware of what is being done. Telling a bully you are ignoring them only lets him or her know it is bothering you.

, Making a joke at someone else’s expense is often the go-to behavior for a bully. You can take the sting out of this by simply laughing along.This approach also works if the bully uses sarcastic compliments to be mean. Instead of getting upset when he or she tells you that you look nice but in a tone you know is not sincere, say “Why, thanks, Bethany!” as nicely as you can and walk away.
Using humor may seem odd in the case of the bully using you are a joke punchline, but remember your hurt feelings are a huge reward for the negative behavior. If the bully sees you either do not care or do not “get” you are being made fun of, the jokes will stop.

, If you are being bullied by a coworker or a family member whom you interact with frequently, you need to speak with this person privately about his or her behavior.


Be careful about being alone with this person though, talk to them in private but not in isolation if that makes sense. This could mean talking in the break room at work after lunch so others are close by. Enlist the help of another co-worker, if you are at work, who can be close by if needed to get help.Make your comments specific to the behavior without giving the bully feedback about it making you feel bad. For example, say “The taunting is disruptive to my day. I’d appreciate it if you stopped.” Also, if you say anything about going to HR if this is at work, be ready to do just that.

, Bullies often target people they know they can get a rise out of. Do not give the bully what he or she wants. Take a deep breath and continue on with what you were doing, or walk away.

It might help to repeat a mantra in your head to maintain your calm in the face of a bully. Repeat something like “Don’t give him/her a reaction” or “Keep it cool.”

, Studies show that people are less likely to get teased or bullied if they exhibit an assertive attitude. You can stop being a victim to bullying by changing your reaction. Beware of your body language. Lift your chin, keep your back straight, and pull your shoulders back.Showing strong, positive signals like this probably doesn’t come naturally to you. Therefore, it may be helpful to practice your assertive attitude at home while you’re away from the bully.

, Keeping a record of the bully’s taunts will help you to keep dates straight and establish a pattern. You will need to establish a pattern if this goes further and you report the behavior to a boss at work or the police if this is a domestic situation that you need help for.

Saving any emails and taking screenshots of comments left on social media can document cyber activities. Do not expect the bully to leave comments posted on social media up. Take a screen shot right away.

, Make sure this conversation includes a clear picture of the pattern and any documentation. If you are at school, you can tell an instructor or a school administrator.If this is at work, you may come to the meeting with suggestions as to how this can be fixed. This might include moving the bully to a different department or working with HR. Be prepared to be asked what you want to have happen.
If you meet with the person at work face-to-face, follow up with an email documenting when the meeting took place and follow ups so you have it in writing what occurred. This will be included in the documentation if the behavior continues.

, The behavior, not matter how personal of an attack that is used, is never about you. It’s about the need of the bully to get attention or to perseverate behaviors picked up elsewhere.

Understanding the motive of a bully helps you to realize that his or her behavior is not personally-directed at you. Such behavior may stem from jealousy, feeling threatened, or not getting the attention he or she feels is deserved. You’re not doing anything wrong—it’s not about you., This probably is not the first time the bully has acted like this so he or she is probably pretty good at it. You do not want to open yourself up to a situation where the only behavior anyone sees is your reaction and you get into trouble.It may be tempting to react online if this is a case of cyber-bullying, but keep in mind it is very easy to bait you into saying really horrible things online and then the bully can simply erase what started the exchange. Now you are left looking like the bad guy.

, Becoming physical with a bully should be avoided at all costs. Whether you are at school, work, or in another environment, getting into an altercation can mean being arrested and charged with assault.


Physical self-defense should only be used as a last resort when required to protect yourself from the other person. Try to avoid this if you can., The bully may choose to intimidate you to the point that you feel like there’s no one you can turn to. Share the experience with others. See a counselor. Deny this person the opportunity to steal away your voice."

Determine if the teasing is a violation of the law.",How to React when Insulted or Teased1," People who tease and insult others are insecure. Their bullying is often driven by fear, narcissism, and the need to control a situation. Picking on others makes them feel powerful. Recognizing that it’s about them, not you, will help you gain confidence in the situation., Making an effort to understand why a particular person is insulting or teasing you is key to coming up with a resolution to the situation. Sometimes people tease you to make themselves feel better; other times they might do it because they don't understand you or the situation as well as they could.


For example, the coworker who always insults your clothing may feel like you are getting more credit than you deserve from your boss.In another example, your aggressor might be teasing you because they do not understand that your disability prevents you from fully participating in an activity.
Keep in mind that some forms of teasing can be playful and are not meant to hurt your feelings. For example, a relative or close friend might tease you about something, such as a quirk that they find amusing about you.

, Avoiding your aggressor can help minimize the insults and/or teasing you are experiencing. While this is not always possible, come up with ways to minimize the time you must spend in the presence of the bully or avoid contact altogether.


If you are being teased while walking home from school, work with your parents to come up with a safe route home that will help you avoid being teased or insulted.

There are two types of bullies who are dangerous.,
Learn to recognize an openly aggressive bully.,
Avoid the taunting and touching bully by walking with your head and eyes up.,
Focus on where you're going, when around a taunting and touching bully.,
If you've followed the step above and find yourself being approached by the taunting and touching bully a second time, tell him/her loudly not to ""make you hurt them"".,
If he/she takes you up on your offer, make as big a scene as you can: Raise your voice as loud as you can, throw books or items you are carrying to the floor with as much force as you can and begin yelling promises to damage him/her permanently if they do not leave you alone.

,
Bait the bully for as long as you can before actually coming to blows to give adults time to arrive and secure him or her.,
Learn to recognize a manipulative bully.,
Understand how manipulative bullies operate.,
To avoid the bully who enlists adults to bully others on their behalf, you must take care to treat all fellow students respectfully; voice your complaints about a manipulative bully's behaviour to a wide range of adults (not just your parents); and observe which adults he or she has attempted to enlist against you and seek out adults who have greater authority.

,
If the bully make false accusations against you to a teacher, go to a teacher who has greater seniority and tell them what is happening.,
Establish the facts with a few other teachers and/or school administrators so that if the teachers who believe the bully should begin to treat you differently, you can immediately turn to those with whom you've confided your concerns and enlist their help as you fight back.

,
Get your parents involved early on and have them document your complaints against the manipulative bully and the teachers who appear to believe the bully's stories.",How to Recognize a Dangerous Bully," 1) The bully who taunts and hurts others openly, and 2) The bully who enlists adults to bully others on their behalf. Learning to recognize these two types of bullies will help you avoid suffering at their hands.;
, This kind of bully often taunts others loudly and pushes/shoves/kicks in order to get and keep your attention. The danger of this type of bully is fairly obvious. Being taunted with insults can cause temporarily hurt feelings, but the addition of aggressive physical contact takes this type of bully into the dangerous category. These bullies are attracted to those who are popular around them (not often weak or diminutive) and they tend to pursue them openly, despite the presence of adults or physically stronger children. They are difficult to manage and are often a regular presence in detention rooms around the school for their uncontrollable behaviour.

, Make eye-contact brief but meaningful as you pass by them, and greet them as if you are giving a friend a ""shout-out"" (keeping your voice up and cheerful sounding).

, Wave at them with your arm held high in the air if they shout out to you, and laugh and shake your head as you walk away.


Treat shoving/kicking/pushing as aggression initiated and stay solid on your feet as you shove them back. Sending a taunting and touching bully reeling into a crowd creates plenty of disruption for you to make an artful escape, and will give you the extra moment lead you'll want to let an adult know about the altercation.

, Give them the impression that you have a mean streak that has yet to be seen, but that you're willing to offer him a personal demonstration if he continues to show interest.

,, Once the bully is subdued, quietly tell him/her you'll remember them, smile, and walk away. Repeat this as often as necessary.

, This kind of bully taunts others quietly and seeks out adults to enlist their support in bullying you. They are typically unpopular, are physically weaker than their peers, and tend to be known as tattle-tales by other classmates. These quiet bullies lie to unsuspecting adults (as well as physically stronger peers) and manipulate their sympathies to exact revenge against those classmates who dare to not like them. They have a distorted sense of self worth that makes them feel entitled to the respect and friendship of everyone with whom they come into contact.


The danger in dealing with this type of bully is harder to quantify. These bullies are not concerned with hurting others physically or mentally, directly (they are aware that their lack of strength, stature, and sharp wit put them at an extreme disadvantage when trying to intimidate their peers). Their goal is to use others to carry out their intimidation and bullying.

, When crossed, because they tend to enlist the support of powerful adults, the quiet bully can indirectly cause others physical harm (corporal punishment administered by school authorities and/or parents) as well as harm to their enemies' future (via notations added to school files, falsely labelling a student as a ""bully"", which may be used to evaluate their college/employment applications later in life.).

,, After you've done that, go to the school counsellor and explain what is happening to you, and express your fear that this little bully will convince the teacher that you are doing things you haven't done.

,, Should you wind up in trouble, you'll need your parents to argue any addition to your school records made by these teachers under the direction of the bully.

Be willing to forgive after the e-drama, no matter at how angry you may have been at them.",How to Settle Internet Drama," As tempting as it may be to criticize works that you don't like, is it really worthwhile to hurt somebody's feelings for your own personal gain?;
, Is what you're seeing really the drama that's going on? Maybe you're misunderstanding something. There's something you don't know. Or maybe, the seemingly offending side actually has good intents. Either side of the internet drama could be right or wrong.

, You aren't alone. It is natural to be offended by rude posts you see on the Internet. However, you should keep from being emotionally scarred by the situation.

, You don't want to miss your chance to make a difference, rather than let the drama die down by itself.

, It's on most internet forums and other chat outlets for a reason - why neglect using it? Use common sense, but don't be afraid to report to a moderator. Even with mean moderators, you usually will lose nothing from reporting, and what you can gain is convincing a moderator to handle the e-drama.

Ignore the teasing.,
Maintain a calm facial expression.,
Walk away without responding.,
Use humor.,
Use a confident voice to tell the bully to stop.,
Stay in groups.,
Tell someone you trust about the bullying.,
Find a new perspective.,
Act confident.,
Make a list of all the reasons you’re great.,
Manage stress effectively.,
Learn how to use your voice.",How to Respond when a Bully Jokes and Teases You," Act as if you didn’t hear the person at all. Keep doing whatever you were doing. Teasing is only fun for the other person if you react. If you were talking to friends, keep doing that. If you were reading quietly, continue doing so. Don’t allow the bully to disrupt your activity at all.Practice anticipating what the “joke” may be so that it does not catch you off guard. Let's say you know a certain person always teases you about your hairstyle or voice. Prepare yourself by running her usual taunts through your head. At the same time, tell yourself she is wrong and inaccurate. Then, when you hear them from a bully, you are less likely to be as affected by them.
Teasing usually goes for something very obvious and can even be something you have no control over like your name, something physical about you like being short or a host of other personal traits. The bully can't tease you if things like your name rhyming in a funny way or being short is something you already accept.;
, The bully may be hoping for a big reaction—don’t give him the satisfaction. It may be difficult but try not to change your facial expression from what it was before the bully said something.Avoid rolling your eyes or even fake smiling as this could signal you are trying to “appear” okay for the sake of your audience. Instead, keep your mouth flat and your eyes diverted from the person so as to not give him any of your attention.

, Take the power away from the teaser by simply moving to another space. Teasing needs an audience; walking away leaves the person who is doing the teasing without an audience.Walking away is like leaving the punch line off of a joke—it just doesn't work that way. The interaction between you and the person who is teasing you is what keeps this joke going.
Walking away without offering a response defeats the purpose of the teasing and, more times than not, ends the joke. When you do this, you take back the power in the bullying dynamic. You send the message that ""I don't have time to participate in this foolish behavior.""

, Respond with a cool one-liner, such as a question or light-hearted joke. If the person teasing you is looking for a laugh, take back the power and make anyone watching laugh with you. If you are being teased for making mistake, re-enact what happened in a silly way so you own what was funny. You getting attention is the last thing the person teasing you wants. Laughing at yourself also takes away the power of the joke.Getting a funny response or being asked a question is something the person who is teasing you will not expect. She will probably not have a comeback and this ends the teasing.
Say something cool like ""Do you seriously find yourself so funny that the same lame joke makes you laugh day after day? I'm actually ready for you to come up with some new content.""
An alternative to humor is to perfect your ""I'm not impressed"" face. If you can master a deadpan face that says ""I'm not amused,"" that's the only comeback you'll need. Two raised eyebrows and a neutral mouth indicate that you are waiting for the punch line — showing that you don't think it's funny. Ultimately you're putting the spotlight back on the bully and letting her know that you are not affected.

, Confidence is a fast way to end teasing because you quickly show the teaser he is not getting the reaction he wants from you.Using a firm and loud voice to tell the bully to stop also draws the behavior out of the shadows and to the attention of friends or adults around you if you need support. For example, if a person keeps imitating you in every class, you can say “You’re not funny. Stop,” or, “Got it. Please stop now.”

, Walk in a group to minimize your chances of being called out. In-between classes, at recess, or after school, be sure to stick with friends to reduce the bully’s chances of teasing you. Using the buddy system is a great way to avoid giving the teaser your full attention. It also sets you up to have positive support nearby after being teased.Stay engaged with your friends during free periods. Walk to class or wherever you need to go with a group. Just be sure you’re not going to be with people who react or laugh along with the bully. This defeats the purpose.
Being with friends also makes it easier to pretend you do not hear if the teasing starts up again. Your friends may even join in with your ignoring, making it even harder for the bully to get the attention she is hoping for.

, Do not let fear keep you from telling a trusted adult or friend about what is happening. It is even more important if you are fearful of physical violence or threats.Telling adults what is happening can help everyone be safe. If this is an on-going problem and it has happened over and over, be sure to tell this adult about everything that has happened. You can confide in your school’s guidance counselor, your favorite teacher, a coach, or even a friend’s parent if you are worried about telling your parents.
Simply say “This kid at school is always picking on me. I try to ignore it, but it’s getting really hard. What should I do?”

, When you encounter bullying, it's easy to only look from the lens of how the behavior affects you. Aim to look at it from a different point-of-view. Consider that the person teasing you must be in a really bad way to have to constantly belittle and taunt others to feel good about himself.


Research shows that many kids that go to school and bully others are often victims of bullying at home. Even though the behavior upsets or hurts you, try to refrain from perseverating a cycle of bullying., Walk with your head held high and shoulders back. Stand up straight, don't be afraid to make eye contact, and make your posture open and expansive. A bully needs a victim to feel poorly about herself in order to have made his point. If you walk with confidence, you are subtly telling the bully that you are not the victim.Keeping your head up also gives you a full view of what is ahead of you that you would not see if you are hiding or looking down.

, Keep it handy. Focus on activities that you are good at and find friends who share those activities in common. Have fun doing things you are good at.Your list might mention that you’re a great friend, good at basketball and science, and that you enjoy play your musical instrument. Whenever you feel down or upset about the teasing, run this list of attributes through your mind to remind yourself that you have so much to be proud of and happy about.
Recognize that you cannot control how others interact with you but you can control how you react to them. Maintain positive encounters with friends and classmates. Look for friends who value you and build you up. Be this friend to someone else.

, If you are not taking good care of your mental and emotional health, bullying can have an even greater impact on you. Finding healthy ways to cope with stress can make you more resilient and capable of handling teasing.


There are a variety of ways you can cope with stress in your life. You can turn to your spirituality, exercise to release those ""feel-good"" endorphins, read a good novel, or spend time with good friends. Just make time to regularly include stress-management activities into your day or week., Be assertive. A bully wants all the attention focused on what she is doing. Using your voice takes away this attention. Using a calm and stern voice will draw attention to the situation and let the bully know you are being serious.Say “Hey, you keep calling me names and it’s annoying and mean. You need to stop or I will tell the teacher.” Bullies usually do not like an audience of too many witnesses so getting attention by using your voice may be an effective way to end teasing.

Nip gossip in the bud.,
Speak up.,
Leave the conversation.,
Speak up.,
Make friends.,
Offer to stay with them.,
Call the police.,
Offer support.,
Ignore the trolls.,
Let the person know you don't think it's appropriate.",How to Respond to Someone Body Shaming Another Person," Body shaming can take many different forms, so it can be hard to recognize. It can also be difficult to identify you are used to hearing body shaming talk around your friends and/or family. Body shaming is when you make negative comments about:Yourself. For example, self-body shaming might sound like, “I look so fat in this dress!” or “My arms look so weird!”
People in your presence. For example, you might be engaging in body shaming someone in your presence by saying something like, “You are not going to win any beauty contests at your size.” Or, “Your hips are wider than the desk!”
People who are not in your presence. You might be engaging in body shaming of someone who is not around by saying something like, “Did you see her legs in those pants? They looked huge!” Or, “Hey, it could be worse. You could look like her!”;
, If you hear people gossiping about someone's who's not there, nip the talk in the bud. They're not there to defend themselves, and you are. Plus, the more body shaming talk you let slip by, the more likely people are to do it when you're not around.You could say something like, ""Hey, that's not cool. You shouldn't talk about John like that.""
Remind people that body shaming is a form of bullying and that is can cause people to become depressed and suicidal., When you're in a group where one person is body shaming another person, speak up. The person who's being shamed may not want to or be able to do it, but they'll likely appreciate you saying something.If the criticism is veiled or general, you could just make small comment to acknowledge the rudeness of the remark. For instance, if someone says at dinner, ""Maybe we should skip dessert. We're all putting on a few extra pounds,"" you could say, ""Well, I need some chocolate. Anyone want to split something with me?""
If it's more direct, address it directly. If someone says to another person, ""That dress is a bit tight on you,"" you could say, ""That's a bit rude. I think it looks fabulous!""

, You may not be brave enough yet to tell someone to stop body shaming. If you're not, another option is just to walk away from the conversation. If you step away every time someone starts body shaming someone else, they'll likely get the picture at some point. Even if they don't, at least you're not participating., Say something to the person doing the shaming. The person on the receiving end may not be able to or want to speak up. However, most people are grateful when someone else steps in. So try to say what you would want to say if you were in their shows.For instance, if you see someone saying ""You're awfully fat!"" to someone else, you could say, ""Why don't you keep your comments to yourself!""
Tell people the facts about body shaming as well. For example, you might say something like, “These kind of comments and the unrealistic ideals that we place on women in our society is part of the reason why 5% of women have anorexia or bulimia.”
Or, you might say, “Body shaming does not help people; it hurts them. Being overweight or obese is not something that people choose to do and making negative comments about someone’s weight only makes matters worse.”, You can also walk up to the person being body shamed and engage them in conversation. Try sitting next to them, and just saying ""hi."" Then start talking to them about anything, from the weather to what your favorite book is. Basically, you're creating a safe space with the person, ignoring the person who's making inappropriate comments., If the body shamer is being aggressive, the victim may not feel safe alone, even after the other person leaves. Offer to stay with them until they can get somewhere safer, particularly if you're on public transportation. Of course, respect their wishes if they say no., If the body shamer is getting aggressive or getting in the other person's space, it may be appropriate to call the police. Even if you don't want to get involved, calling the police ensures someone will be there to help deal with the situation if it escalates.

, When you see someone being body shamed or even demeaned for defending themselves against body shaming, try to offer some positive support. Reply with something positive about their person or what they've said in the thread. Positive support can mean a lot on the internet.For instance, you could say, ""I think your hair is amazing!"" or ""I agree, Jess, body shaming can make people feel worse about themselves, which is not healthy.""

, ""Trolls"" in internet vernacular are just people who are wanting to stir up trouble for the sake of attention. They'll often say mean things just to get a reaction. Try not to engage with this type of person, as you won't get anywhere, plus you're just giving them what they want, a response.

, If someone you know is body shaming someone else on the internet, let them know you don't think it's okay. Speak up by leaving a comment. You don't have to be mean, just polite and firm.For instance, you could write, ""I know you probably didn't mean to, but calling Jean out on her weight isn't cool. It's body shaming.""

",How to Respond to Mean Girls," If you shiver, look down or act nervous, it would make them happy because they wanted this reaction. But if you just stand up straight, with your head held high and a fearless mind, they'll know that you are tougher than they expected.;
, Every time they bully you, don't look at them, like a dog is barking for no reason. Try to listen to music, talk to somebody or even simply walk away. This will drive them insane, because they want your respect. If you show them that you don't have much respect for them and don't consider them important, they'll stop being desperate. Give them one word answers if they ever try to bully you. This would make them look more like an attention seeker and this shows you are busy. This means, say something short and sweet which would end the conversation. Like, ""Okay"", ""Thanks"", or, ""Gotta go"".

, If you do this, they'll be more upset.

, This will stop the conversation. They may say, ""You're so not welcome"". Then just give a huge grin and repeat, ""Thanks"", again.

Intervene personally.,
Mediate an informal meeting between the bully and the victim.,
Launch a formal investigation.,
Control office rumors.,
Hold leaders accountable.",How to Prevent Bullying in the Workplace1," While bullying is more likely to happen behind closed doors in the absence of leaders, it is essential those leaders analyze the incidents happening in the workplace. Leaders should recognize bullying and measure the impact it has on the organization’s productivity and climate.


Make sure that your employees know that bullying will not be tolerated.;
, When a bullying situation comes to your attention by observation, rather than by having someone report the occurrence to you, ask the bully and the bullied to talk out their differences while you are present. The bully should ask forgiveness for his or her unprofessional behavior. If the person who was bullied accepts this apology, then both employees should past the incident.


Create a record in which you transcribe or write down the meeting between the two employees and record the bully’s apology, as well as the victim’s response.
However, if the bullying continues after this apology has been extended, it is important to implement further consequences.

, If the two employees are having a difficult time coming to a resolution on their own, sit with them and act as a mediator. Ask them both to express themselves, and to talk about how they think the situation should be resolved.


You do not necessarily need to keep a record of this discussion.

, When the bullying has reached an excessive limit, the victim should be encouraged to lodge a formal complaint. This complaint will result in a formal investigation and severe consequences.


Lodging a complaint requires the victim to tell his manager (in this case you), about the incident. The manager would then turn the situation over to HR.
Both the bully and the victim would be called in to HR for a meeting with the managers and representatives from HR. They would then both be asked about the situation.
A formal investigations allows for the bully to apply for an appeal process is he or she feels that the charges are unfair.
After listening to both sides and seeing evidence of the complaint, HR will decide the final action that should be taken (whether this be a pay cut for the bully, termination or some other consequence).

, Rumors are another form of bullying that can really affect an employee’s life. To control these rumors, actively listen to other staff members and ask for feedback from the employee who the rumors are about.Send out a general email to the entire company to remind them that rumors are not tolerated, and that there will be consequences if the rumors are not put to rest.

, As an employer, you should ask your managers and heads of department to help you manage workplace bullying. Work with them to create anti-bullying policies, and implement them."

Make friends with people who are kind and supportive. In school, stick by these friends. The buddy system can keep bullies away.Always have a group of friends nearby. Eat lunch with a group of friends and walk between classes with your friends.
Bullies often target people who seem alone and isolated. If you look like you have a solid friend group, a bully may be less likely to seek you out as a victim.;
, Avoiding places where bullies hang out can help prevent bullying. As you navigate your school, stay away from areas where bullies are likely to congregate.Bullies often gather near areas where there is not a lot of supervision. Bullies may hang out in areas like the locker room or secluded hallways, for example. Try to avoid these areas.
If you have to enter an area where bullies may be gathered, always bring a friend.

, Bullies are more likely to target people in the absence of adult supervision. Try to stay near adults in your school. During lunch, for example, you and your friends could sit near the teachers. Between classes, avoid lingering in the hallway. Go to your classroom right away to avoid attracting a bully., The best means to deflect a bully is often to suppress your emotions when insulted. You want to act like whatever the bully said did not bother you. Showing a reaction will only fuel the bully; however, it can be hard to suppress your emotions in the moment. It's a good idea to have a number of ideas on hand for distracting yourself. This is a good technique if you're stuck in a situation where you cannot simply leave.Think of things you can use to occupy your mind in the event you're targeted by a bully. Could you count backwards from 100? Could you recite a poem or song lyrics in your head? Could you try spelling words backwards?
You should not suppress your emotions forever. If a bully hurt your feelings, you should talk this out with a friend or family member; however, wait until you're in a safe environment to react emotionally.

, If someone makes comments about your appearance, personality, or anything else, just ignore it. When you can walk away without saying anything, do so. Bullies thrive on a reaction and will be less likely to target those who do not react. This is where you can employ certain techniques to distract yourself.Act like you did not hear anything when a bully lashes out at you. Continue with what you were doing and then walk away as quickly as you can.
If a bully sees you do not react to his or her tormenting, the bully is more likely to look for another victim.

, If a bully persists in tormenting you, even after you've tried ignoring them, you should assert yourself; however, do so in a way that is confident without being emotional or aggressive. If a bully thinks they've successfully got under your skin, they'll keep going. A calm and collected approach is best if you need to stick up for yourself.Use a loud voice to say something like, ""No. Stop it."" Then, immediately walk away. You do not want to get stuck in a screaming match with a bully. Tell them to stop, and then continue on your way.
If a bully tries to bait you into an argument after you've asserted yourself, say something like, ""I'm happy to talk this out with you, but I'm not going to argue or fight.""
Use assertive body language. Stand up straight, look them in the eye, and speak in a clear, audible tone.

, Giving physical or verbal abuse back is exactly what a bully wants. It is a reaction, and will only serve to escalate the situation. Never fight a bully, especially not physically. If the situation becomes aggressive, try to remove yourself as quickly as you can., Bullies often target people who do not think highly of themselves. If you have low self esteem, find ways to feel good about yourself. This may naturally ward off bullies.Think about things about yourself you want to change. Maybe you wish your grades were higher. You could work on studying harder, watching less television, and doing your homework after school.
If you feel more confident in your grades, your self esteem will rise. This will make bullies less likely to target you.

, Cyber bullying is a major concern as well. There are certain actions you can take to avoid coming into contact with bullies online.Avoid sharing anything that could be potentially embarrassing for you in the wrong hands, like awkward pictures or videos. Extend this same courtesy to friends. Be careful what you post about others, as cyber bullies may target your friends.
Always keep your password a secret from everyone. If someone gets your password, they could hack your account and post damaging information about you online.
Check your privacy settings. You can avoid cyber bullies by making sure your information is only shared with close friends.

, No one wants to feel like a tattletale, but bullying is a serious problem. If you or your friends are being bullied, this can cause major damage to your emotional well being. If bullying is physical, it can be dangerous to let it go on.Find an adult you trust. A teacher, principal, parent, or a worker in your school can help you address bullying.
You are not tattling over a small matter. Bullying is serious. If you are getting bullied, chances are other students in your school are as well. You are doing everyone a favor, including the bully, by making sure the situation is appropriately addressed.
You can request to change your schedule to avoid bullies.

, You should never stand by and let bullying happen. If you see other people being targeted by bullies, step up and say something. Consider how you would feel in the same situation. You would likely want someone to help you.Show kindness to anyone being bullied. If you know a student who's a frequent target of bullies, try to befriend him or her.
If you notice a student is being targeted a lot, you should tell an adult. This student could probably use help deterring the bully.

Document the issue.,
Stick up for yourself if you are being bullied.,
Seek support outside of the workplace.,
Persuade your boss to create financial consequences.,
Address the issue as soon as it occurs.",How to Prevent Bullying in the Workplace2," By writing down the incident as you saw it, you can help to control and resolve the issue.Be as clear as possible about what happened, including:


How the incident began.
Who the bully was, and what they said.
How the victim responded.
What the end result was.

, Do not be nice or suck up to a group of colleagues who have bullied you. Bullying in the workplace is absolutely not ok, and there should be consequences for the people who think that it is ok to act in this way.


If you are simply nice to them and do nothing, they will think that you will not stand up to them, and may continue to bully you.

, If you have been the target of a bully, you may be experiencing some feelings of depression, isolation and helplessness. However, it is important to remember that you are not alone. Talk to family members or friends that you trust and ask them for advice.Another option is to ask a counselor, doctor, or spiritual leader about what they think you should do, and how they recommend you should handle the situation.

, If you are concerned about appearing vulnerable, and do not want to talk to your boss about the psychological harm the bullying has caused you, discuss the incident(s) in a matter of fact way, and show your boss how the bullying is having a negative impact on your work, and on the finances of the company.


For example, show your boss that bullying is a problem by explaining that the bully has refused to cooperate with you, and thus is preventing you from finishing your tasks on time, and causing the quality to drop.

, If you are being bullied, bring the issue up by personally discussing it with your manager or bringing it up in a meeting as soon as it occurs. If you do not report the situation as soon as it occurs, the bully has more time to continue the bullying, or cover up the bullying in the first place.


Ask the HR department about the policies they have in place to offer protection from retaliation by the bully.

Consider the definition of workplace bullying.,
Recognize bullying behaviors.,
Watch out for subtle behavior.,
Look for covert behavior.,
Recognize actions that are not bullying.,
Be aware that there is a wide range of bullying.",How to Prevent Bullying in the Workplace3," Workplace bullying is a behavior that is ongoing in nature. The bullying is repeated, systematic, and damaging. This damage can come in the form of emotional, mental, or physical harm.


A repeated and systematic offence is when a bully takes a methodical approach to bullying a victim over and over again.

, Examples of bullying behavior could include:


Insulting or offensive language
Attitude or language that humiliates, frightens, criticizes or degrades someone else through yelling, screaming or through soft spoken but demeaning words.
Practical jokes or teasing on a regular basis that hurt the victim, either emotionally, mentally, or physically.
Displaying degrading or offending material.
Spreading rumors or gossip about another employee.

, Subtle behavior may include deliberately excluding a person from routine activities, intruding on employee’s personal space via spying or tampering with their equipment, or intimidating another employee through belittling opinions and inappropriate comments.

, This sort of behavior includes setting unrealistic timelines, overloading another employee with work, deliberately drawing back access to resources and information or giving unfair treatment to workplace entitlements.

, While the person that these actions are taken against may think they are not fair, the following actions are not considered bullying.


A reasonable decision undertaken to transfer, discipline, counsel or dismiss an employee.
Employer’s decision not to promote or benefit an employee based on an objective assessment.

, Workplace bullying may range from verbal and emotional abuse to physical abuse and humiliation. Many of the reported cases have been committed by management that ultimately puts employees in an awkward position.

Talk to a teacher or a supervisor.,
Reach out to a counselor or therapist.,
Confide in a parent, partner, mentor, or someone close to you.",How to Know if You're Being Bullied," One of the most obvious signs of bullying is physical assault in the form of punching, hitting, or striking. The person may physically harm you with his own hands or an object, or he may threaten to physically harm you. Often, a bully will physically assault their victim continuously over a period of time, with each assault becoming more violent and aggressive.Many bullies shove or push their victim. If you are being bullied, the bully may inflict minor or major physical injuries on you in places that they know not very many people will see or notice. They may do this to avoid suspicion from a parent or a supervisor.;
, Bullies can also inflict physical discomfort in more subtle ways, such as invading your personal space on a continual and relentless basis. If you work in a cubicle or an office, for example, the bully may come in and sit right on your desk or stand in front of your cubicle or office door. If you are trying to work in the library at school, the bully may come and sit right on your school books or pull up a chair very close to you.Invading personal space is often done by bullies who are trying to intimidate you or scare you, without using actual physical assault. Bullies may also invade your personal space and then escalate their bullying tactics to physical attacks.

, Making loud noises, pointing bright lights at your eyes, and shoving stinky things in your face can be bullying if the person is doing it with the intent to cause you pain, or ignoring your requests to stop it. They don't have to hit you in order to hurt you.


Causing sensory pain; this may be tailored to a disability such as flashing lights at a photosensitive person or making loud noise in order to watch an autistic person jump and whimper
Trying to irritate an injury, such as prodding a broken arm, or dropping things for you to pick up when you have a painful knee injury
Trying to trigger a medical condition, such as using flash photography to try to trigger a seizure in an epileptic person, or showing graphic content to someone who has PTSD or a phobia

, Often, your body will respond to bullying in psychosomatic ways, which is a physical illness that occurs due to mental trauma or stress. This could be an overwhelming feeling of nausea, anxiety, or stress when you are in the presence of the bully, or more physical symptoms like throwing up, a rapid heartbeat, headaches, and panic attacks.You may experience physical discomfort in the presence of the bully or during times when you are not around the bully. The night before school, for example, you may feel physically ill at the thought of having to see the bully. Or, you may become nauseated and sick on your drive to work because you know you will need to see the bully in the office. These are all psychosomatic responses to bullying and often will only go away if you deal with the bully.

, Verbal attacks in the form of screaming, yelling, or shouting can also be considered bullying. The bully may yell insults at you or mock you loudly in the presence of others. They may also taunt and yell at you when you are alone with them. Often, verbal abuse can be as damaging as physical abuse, as you can be mentally and emotionally hurt by the bully’s words. Verbal abuse can often go undetected if it is done quietly and constantly, so it is important to notice if the bully is causing you psychological pain through hurtful words.

, Constructive criticism is well-meaning, specific, and designed to help you improve. You come away knowing exactly how to do better. While it can hurt if done too bluntly, it isn't bullying. Destructive criticism contains no useful advice, and is often personally insulting.


An example of specific and helpful criticism is ""This article could use some work. It's a stub at this point, and could benefit from an expansion regarding how to ask the guy out.""
An example of destructive criticism is ""This article is useless, unhelpful, and just plain stupid. Clearly the writer has no idea what they are talking about.""
Occasionally, people give ill-meaning advice that appears constructive, but is meant to shut you up instead of help you. This advice may make little sense, and they may flood you with nonsensical critiques intended to frustrate you or erase your agency instead of help you.

, Bullies also tend to defame you to others by spreading mean-spirited lies or rumors about you or by making fun of you to others. They may speak ill of you a professional level, such as spreading lies that you continually miss deadlines or that you cheat on every test. They may also speak badly of you on a personal level by attacking your character through lies about your relationships with friends, partners, and family.You may hear about the bully’s lies through your friends or coworkers and feel a sense of shame or guilt. Remember that you are not responsible for the bully’s actions and you are not to blame for the bully’s bad behavior.

, A bully may draw on existing power dynamics, such as discrimination against Muslims, to attack you. This can make you feel isolated and unsafe, especially when they have the power of general discrimination on their side.


Minority status can include race, religion, disability (including disability symptoms), LGBTQIA status, gender presentation, size, ethnicity, and more.
Or, they may try to insult you by comparing you to a stigmatized group, such as saying that you look girly or that you sound like you're disabled, even if you are not a member of that group.

, The bully may act in a discriminatory manner to you by singling you out in a group. They may then announce that they are going to treat you differently than everyone else. This is another way for them to exclude you from the group and humiliate you. , Maybe you feel that power dynamics are at play, and you're scared to talk to them, or they can stop you from doing things you care about. Conversations with them may end with you feeling powerless, frustrated, or unable to express how you feel and what you want. You might find your mind wandering back to them again and again, wondering how to deal with them or why they treat you this way.


Try explaining your feelings using ""I"" language to the other person. A good person cares about how you feel. For example, if you feel hurt when they joke about your accent, they will stop making those jokes as soon as they find out; they are clueless and not a bully. A bully will tell you that your feelings are unimportant or nonsensical—anything to justify not listening to you.

, Often, bullies in the workplace tend to try to exercise their power over you in overt ways. One way they may try to exercise power over you is to place an unreasonable amount of workload on you so you are set up to fail. They may also continually pressure you over your missed deadlines or upset clients as a way to make you feel small and helpless.The bully may also do this in a school setting, where they get you in trouble with your teacher and causes you to suffer academic setbacks or penalties. They are likely doing this as a way to limit your progress or to prevent you from succeeding.

, Sometimes it can help to get an outside perspective on the situation. Ask your coworkers or close friends if they notice how the person is acting towards you, both physically and verbally. You may want to ensure there is always a coworker or a friend in the room with you when you are near the bully so they can observe the bully’s behavior towards you. They may then be able to deduce if you are in fact being bullied.

, If you feel you are being bullied, it is important that you not keep the bullying a secret or hide it from people who can help you. You may be afraid to come forward and report the bully due to fear of backlash from the bully or rejection from your peers. Or you may feel socially isolated from everyone around you and feel no one cares about your well being. But reporting the bully will be the first step to getting the bully to stop hurting you and can help you to recover from the trauma caused by the bullying.If there is a teacher at your school you feel close to and trust, reach out to them and talk to her about the bullying. You may want to wait until after class or before class so there is no one else in the room and you can confide in her one on one.
If there is a supervisor that you feel you have a good relationship with, talk to her about the workplace bullying you have been experiencing at work. Set up a meeting one on one so you have some privacy and can confide in her in a comfortable environment.

, Your school counselor is trained to address bullying and can often provide professional advice on how to deal with your bully. As well, if you go to a therapist regularly, you may want to talk to her about the bully and discuss ways in which you can address the bullying and make it stop.


If you are not comfortable with talking to your school counselor, you can also talk to someone via a teen health hotline, found here: http://www.teenhealthandwellness.com/static/hotlines. The hotline is run by individuals trained to help people in need and can often offer a sympathetic ear to discuss your issues.

, Parents are often unaware that their child is being bullied and are only aware of the signs of bullying once their child brings it to their attention. Reach out to a parent or a sibling you feel you can talk to. Together, you can both work to find a solution for the bullying and make sure it stops before it gets any worse."

Another option is to ignore the presence of the bully. Whatever they are doing, don’t even look their way. By letting them know you can hear them but don’t care about what they are saying, they will think you are too strong for them to be mean to and leave you alone.;
, If you don’t feel like you can ignore the people being mean to you, try avoiding them. While you can’t drop out of school and stay at home all the time, you can try taking a new route to the playground or classroom. This will lessen their opportunities to tease or be mean to you.


There is also safety in numbers. Have a buddy system where you walk to and from unsupervised areas can help deter a bully from coming after you., Even if you don’t feel confident, fake it. Pretend nothing can take you down and point your head up tall to the sky. By standing tall, you’re showing that you’re proud of who you are and nothing will bother you.Sometimes all a meanie needs to back off is to think you’re strong and won’t be bothered by their immaturity.


Hold in your feelings. If the meanie sees you upset, they know they’ve gotten to you. By holding in your feelings, you’ll look tough and unbothered. The biggest thing a bully wants is a reaction from you, to let them know you are upset by them. Denying them this satisfaction will hopefully make them move on to easier targets.
To try control your feelings, count backwards from 100 or recite the alphabet. By distracting your mind, you’ll be more able to control your feelings or tears.Crying doesn’t mean you are a little kid. You are allowed to cry when sad and no adults will judge you for it. However, a mean person may view it as being an easy target for them to talk down to.

Use sarcasm.,
Make a rude quip back.,
Tease them about their lack of credentials.,
Consider simply not responding.",How to Make Up Comebacks when Somebody Calls You Fat1," Sometimes, people who pick on others don't expect much of a response. Try throwing in some sarcasm, as this may surprise the person bullying you. People often target those they think will just take abuse, so a sarcastic comment can stop a bully in their tracks.For example, pretend the insult was actually a compliment. Say something like, ""Wow! Thank you so much for noticing. I really appreciate it."";
, You can respond to a specific comment with a specific, sarcastic comment. For example, if someone says something like, ""You have such a pretty face. It's a shame about your weight."" Try to respond with something like, ""You have a great face too. It's a shame about your personality.""Be careful, however, not to make comments that are too biting, especially if you're not in a place where you feel safe. You don't want to end up putting your safety at risk.

, Someone else's weight is between them and their doctor. Another person has no right to comment on your weight if they don't have medical training. Call attention to this. This will make the other person feel silly at having raised the issue.For example, say you're in ninth grade and someone in your class says something like, ""You could really use to lose about 30 pounds."" Respond with something like, ""Wow! I can't believe you've been through medical school and you're only 14. Because only a doctor could possibly know how much weight I need to lose.""

, Sometimes, it's best not to offer a comeback. Some bullies thrive on a reaction. If you've responded with witty comebacks and are still getting teased, start simply ignoring the bullies. See if this deters them from targeting you in the future.If someone makes a rude comment about your weight, pretend like you did not hear it. If they continue to make rude comments, simply leave the room.
If you need to cry after ignoring someone, that's okay. It's normal to feel bad if someone hurts your feelings. While you can ignore a bully in the moment, let your feelings out later if necessary.

Ignore the bully.,
Avoid retaliation.,
Be assertive.,
Prepare effective comebacks.,
Don’t become emotional.",How to Make a Bully Bored1," The easiest technique to try if you’re being bullied is to simply Ignore a Bully. It’s no fun for them to pick on someone who ignores them. Avoid replying to any of their insults or threats, and many times you will find that they grow bored of bullying you and will stop doing it.;
, Don’t come down to the bully’s level and retaliate against them. They want to see you lose your cool and fight back physically or verbally. Refusing to retaliate will make your bully bored because they aren’t getting the angry or emotional reaction that they wanted from you., Make eye contact, square your shoulders, and firmly ask the bully to leave you alone. This is especially disengaging for bullies who have counted on you to be a meek, easy target. Showing that you’re strong and unwilling to accepting teasing and taunting might be enough to make the bully tired of bullying you.Even if you feel intimidated or scared, unless you’re in imminent physical danger, assertively standing up to your bully builds confidence, and bullies will quickly grow bored with calm, collected people who don’t respond to their harassment.

, Bullies count on you being submissive to their taunts and harassment. However, if you think about strategic things to say ahead of time to deter the bully, you might make them give up on harassing you.Some examples of good comebacks include “Is that the best you can do?” or “You’re acting like a bully. Please stop.” Laughing and saying their criticisms are ridiculous is also a great way to disengage a bully., Bullies thrive on getting a reaction from the people they harass. Bullying makes them feel powerful and important. However, if you remain calm and avoid crying, yelling, or otherwise engaging your bully, they will eventually get bored of picking on you."

Laugh it off.,
Ask your friends for help.",How to Make People Stop Being Mean to You2," When the meanie is bullying you, speak up and speak clearly. Look them in the eye and tell them “Stop!”Bullies are often looking for a weak target with little resistance. Sometimes all you’ll need is a simple “no” to get them away from you.


If you’re afraid to do this on your own, ask a buddy to stand with you. They don’t need to say anything, but can help give you courage to tell the bully to leave you around.

, Try acting like the bully is being stupid. When they tease you, laugh and shake your head. Act as if they are being so immature, you can’t help but giggle at them. The laughter may catch them off guard and stop them from being mean., It will rarely take a big group of people to stop a bully. Often, if one or two friends tell the meanie to stop, they will. Suggest to your friends they tell the bully they are being “mean and immature”, or that the meanie is “acting dumb.” If the bully sees people calling them out on their bad behaviour, they are less likely to repeat it at all, especially towards you.You should always stand up for someone who is being bullied, no matter who it is. Even if you see someone who is mean to you get picked on, you should stand up for them. By being nice and respectful to everyone, people will be less likely to pick on you, and more likely to stand up for you if you are bullied.

What good does that do for you?"", Not everyone who calls you fat is trying to hurt your feelings.

If I ever wanted diet or nutrition advice, that's who I would ask.""
If the person persists, say something like, ""You know, this really is not an appropriate conversation and I don't appreciate it.""

, No two bodies are the same, and you should remind others this is something to celebrate. Show them you are proud of your body and they may be less likely to harass you. Say something like, ""I like my body the way it is, even if you don't. I'm happy with who I am, so your opinion does not matter much to me."", If you're dealing with a friend or loved one who is calling you fat, establish firm boundaries for the future. No one should have to put up with someone constantly putting down their weight.Let the person know what kind of behavior you will not tolerate in your relationship.

Remind them that what they do on the internet is “real.” Suggest that they refrain from sending messages when they are angry or upset.

, Tell your children that you want them to come to you if they run into problems online. If they are being cyber bullied, you want to know about it.

, Your children may not perceive certain behaviors as “bullying” unless you make it crystal clear. Tell them that sending mean text messages or emails, whether the content is true or false, is a form of cyber bullying.

, Cyber bullies may post embarrassing content via texts, emails, or social media outlets; they may also post embarrassing pictures or videos, sometimes of a sexual nature. These actions are absolutely unacceptable.

, Creating online space for the purposes of harassing, embarrassing, or threatening anyone should not be tolerated.

, Creating fake profiles for someone else or posting potentially embarrassing or upsetting content under another person’s name should be considered cyber bullying.

, For starters, your child should be required to tell you if he or she (or someone else he or she knows) is being bullied online.


It’s a good idea to reassure your child that he or she will not be punished for coming to you with this problem. If, for example, you respond by taking away his or her electronic devices, you will only ensure that your child never comes to you again.

, If your child is being targeted online, you need to get involved. Do not dismiss the problem or wait for it to escalate before taking action.

, If you know who is bullying your child online, consider contacting that person’s parents or the school authorities. Be sure to discuss this course of action with your child, though.


More and more schools have explicit policies about cyber bullying. Check and see if your child’s school does.

, Whether your child is the target or not, he or she should know not to pass along any messages that qualify as cyber bullying. Insist that your child not reply to these messages or try to “fight back,” as this will only exacerbate the situation.

, If your child is being cyber bullied, have them block or “un-friend” the bullies when possible. Direct any messages to specific folders; leave them unread and do not reply. If possible, block the email addresses and cell phone numbers of cyber bullies.

, Save all evidence, including messages, pictures, and text messages

, Let your child know that being victimized online is not his or her fault. Offer your non-judgmental support, and watch your child for signs of emotional distress. Get help as needed.

, If your child is being bullied online, you should report it to your internet service provider, your cell phone company, and the support teams of any websites involved in the bullying.

, Get appropriate legal advice, and, using any documented evidence of cyber bullying, think about going to the police. Contacting the police is especially advisable if the bullying involves sexual content, fraud, threats, or extortion.

Distract yourself.,
Create distance.,
Be mindful.,
Smile.,
Change your thoughts.,
Get social support.",How to Hide Tears at School1," If you haven't started crying yet but think you might, try distracting yourself from your sad thoughts. Play a game on your phone or try to joke around with a friend, or try engaging deeply in your math book or listening carefully and fully to what your teacher is saying., If you are feeling overwhelmed by your feelings and like you are about to cry, try creating some distance between yourself and your thoughts.To gain distance, try imagining yourself as an outsider viewing the situation that is making you sad. You can also try referring to yourself in the third person when you think about your situation., If you are sad about something that is not relevant to the present moment (e.g., something that happened in the past or will happen in the future), try focusing on only the present.


To be mindful, pay full attention to your bodily sensations, all the information coming in through your senses, and your thoughts about those perceptions and sensations., You may be able to improve your mood by smiling, even if you don't feel like it. This is called the facial feedback hypothesis and it suggests that the relationship between emotions and the face is a two way street: though we typically smile when we feel happy, some evidence suggests that smiling may cause us to feel happier or otherwise help us to be less sad.If you have a pencil handy, try putting it in your mouth and biting it with your teeth. This will raise your cheeks and facilitate your smile.

, Try to change your mood by thinking about something really funny or something that makes you really happy. You can also try thinking about what is making you sad in a different way. For example, you could try thinking about something hilarious you saw on the internet or something nice that your significant other did for you.
To think differently about what is making you sad, consider this example. Say you are sad because you received a bad grade on an exam, and that you are upset because you think it means you are not smart. Try instead thinking about your bad grade as a challenge that you can surmount on the next exam by studying harder.

, When you can, find a friend or someone you can confide in and tell them what's bothering you. This may help relieve your sadness and help you to avoid any further tears at school."

Don’t make eye contact with the person.,
Keep walking or doing whatever you were doing.,
Count backwards from 100 silently in your head.,
Make up a funny or inspiring chant to repeat to yourself.,
Maintain a log of incidents.,
Stand up for yourself if ignoring doesn’t work.,
Be compassionate towards the person picking on you.,
Confide in a friend, parent or counselor.,
Report the problem to an administrator.,
Stay near friends or a teacher between classes.,
Use a different route that the person doesn’t take.,
Change classes or buses, if possible.",How to Ignore People Who Try to Pick on You," The bully is looking for your reaction, and making direct eye contact can end badly. Direct eye contact can be seen as an act of aggression. You do not want to push the aggression to the point of becoming physical.Do not give the bully any of your direct attention. Try to stay neutral and not look at him or her.;
, If the bully is just talking mean to you, you can try ignoring him or her as if the person hadn’t said anything. In the case that the bully acts out physically you need to treat this as a serious matter and not ignore it.Sometimes, a bully may pick on you because you are smarter or better at something than he or she is. Ignore negative comments tied to your success and just enjoy the success.
Put your shoulders back and hold your head high as you want past the bully. Do not give off non-verbal signs that you are fearful. Make a phone call. Stay focused on your conversation. Just keep doing your thing to silently shush a bully.

, Finding a distraction as simple as counting backwards can help you to not show a big reaction to the bully and avoid giving him or her the negative feedback that is desired., Think positive thoughts even if you do not feel so great. This allows you to ignore the bully and possibly even deter future behavior.


Say to yourself something like “I will not allow anyone to make my day bad” or “I am the picture of calm.”
You can even read through an uplifting book or put in your headphones to listen to soothing music. These are all positive ways to distract yourself from teasing.

, Write down everything that happens. Do not simply ignore the behavior. Part of defining bullying behavior is establishing a pattern. Keeping a journal or log can help you create a timeline of events to share with an adult who may be able to help you.


There is a difference between ignoring the mean behavior in the moment and letting it go without taking action. You can choose to not react to the negative but still take note of this serious behavior to access help later.

, Be assertive and stay calm. Act with confidence and respect. The point is to end the bullying not to become a bully. Do not engage in the same type of behavior they bully is doing, instead stand tall and address the words the bully is saying head on.Say something to the effect of “Stop!” If the person is calling you a strange name provide them with your name “My name is actually Mark. Please call me that.” If the person has touched you in an aggressive or teasing manner simply say “Get your hands off me.”

, Often the best tool to combat a bully is compassion. Learn to stand strong without putting the bully down or embarrassing him or her. Offer compassion and make it a win for both of you.You can silently wish the person good thoughts by saying repeating to yourself “May you overcome your hatred and have a positive day” while thinking of the other person.

, Counselors at school are trained to help in this situation and can often work with ending the bullying or finding short-term solutions like a schedule change to avoid the issues while it is being dealt with. , Most schools have procedures in place to deal with bullying and the principal will normally do this right away. If there is ever a threat of violence or you know the bully has access to weapons, tell an adult it is an emergency.Some threats may turn out to be nothing, but you have no way of knowing if they are serious. It is better to treat the threat as being real. Sadly, since many school shootings started out as known threats that were not taken seriously, it is always better to ask for help and make sure everyone is safe.
Ask about any apps or special reporting systems your school uses. Some schools use smart phone apps, such as STOPit to make it easier for students to report bullying or get help., Bullies often try to do things in secret so walk with friends and talk to them as if the bully is not there. Bullies thrive on power and intimidation. The balance of power is shifted with teachers or other people around, and the bullies will more than likely lose interest.Neutralize the balance of power—by having someone else nearby— and you may be able to take the impact out of the negative behavior.

, Don’t give the bully a chance to interact with you if you are able to. You can be aware of where the bully is without making it obvious you are watching. Learn habits and schedule of the bully so you can try to avoid crossing paths.Generally your school will have several ways to get between classes. Use a route that you know the bully would not use.
Trying different ways to get from class to class each day will also make you harder to find to be picked on. Most bullies are not going to hunt all over for you.

, The bully is looking for someone close to pick on. Removing yourself from their path often ends the problem. When you ask about these changes, be honest about why they need to be done. You are more likely to get help if you make clear there is a pattern of bad behavior and these small changes may end that behavior.


It is usually easier to ask for a move for yourself than to expect the bully to be removed.

"
Don't make eye contact.,
Sit in a seat by the window, then have someone you trust sit by you, or squeeze in past someone already sitting on the outer seat, so as to stop the bully sitting next to you.,
Make plans with your friend(s) to save a seat for you.,
If the bully is sitting right behind you and is poking you in the head and/or saying insults, ignore them.,
If your friend is beside you, use the 'Invisible Bully Conversation' technique.,
If this fails, reach into your bag and find something to do while the bully is talking.,
Pretend to be asleep.",How to Ignore a Bully on the School Bus (Middle School)1," From the moment you step onto the bus to the moment you step off to get to school, just completely ignore the bully.;
, This puts you in a more hard to reach position and stops the bully from sitting by you.


It's wise to sit as near to the front as possible, so that the driver can witness what the bully is saying/doing so that they can take action. Some buses have video recorders that record what happens on the bus. If your bus has this, use it to your advantage and allow it to capture what the bully is doing to you.

, It is wise to stick with your friends as much as possible on the school bus, since they can prove valuable in helping you to cope with the bully. Also, it's nice to have a friend by your side when there's a bully calling you ""dumb"".

, It's hard, but if you don't respond the bully will eventually get bored and stop doing it. After all, the reason they are bullying you is to get a reaction from you!

, If the bully is saying something nasty to you, turn to your friend and ask them a question naturally, right in the middle of what the bully is saying, acting as if the bully is invisible and cannot be heard. Don't say something like ""The weather is nice today, isn't it?"" really loudly and obviously, or even worse, ""Don't you just hate bullies?"" Start a conversation as you would normally, and casually say something like ""The homework yesterday was really hard, wasn't it? I think I got question 14b wrong.""

, You can find many goodies in your bag to do, such as homework or a book to read. When the bully is saying or grunting something nasty, bend down and casually pick up a book and start reading, or finish your homework. This is useful because it also makes you absorbed in what you're doing and you can easily ignore the bully.

, When the bully is talking, you can pretend to fall asleep and even insert a snore or two. This makes you a pointless target as you're not listening or watching at all.

"
"
Choose your words wisely.,
Another approach is being bold, speaking loud and confidently without yelling, and say exactly how you feel with no remorse.

,
Plan on back-up.,
Put yourself in their shoes.,
If you really feel you haven't done anything wrong, don't apologize for making them mad.,
In this case, the ideal approach would be saying ""I know that I upset you/hurt your feelings by (insert problem here).,
A bully only bullies people for many reasons, some of which are; because you have done something to upset them, to look cool around friends, they are jealous of you, if you are different in some way and they don't like it, or because they are feeling insecure.,
If the person tormenting you is insecure about themselves, try to talk to them and make him or her feel better about himself or herself.

,
Be a friend to the bully.,
Move on.",How to Make a Bully Understand," Some people are bullies because they believe they were the victims first, so they are standing up for themselves. Be confident, but don't yell, because that will only make the bully even more angry. Talk calmly and think about what your going to say before you say it.
,, More students, and maybe even teachers if the situation is that out of hand, will intimidate the bully. Just remember that you want the bully to think of it as an intervention, not a gang-up. You should be the one talking, and have some friends there to protect you.

, Before confronting the bully, think about whether you have done anything for them to be mean to you. Even if you have and they are teasing you every day, it isn't okay, but figure out if you had ever done something to caused the bully to become defensive? Don't jump to conclusions and blame him/her immediately.

, You want to be confident, not vulnerable. If during the confrontation you realize you have done something that ticked them off, find a way to make amends for it., I'm truly sorry and I hope you'll accept my apology. However, I feel that things have got out of hand between us.""

, If your tormentor is trying to look cool, point that out to him or her and explain that being nasty to others is not cool at all, and no-one finds it cool in any way.,, Try to find out why this person is the way he/she is. Is it a family issue? Friend issue? Traumatic experience? The list goes on. Be a friend and stop letting them pick on you by pretending it doesn't bother you to make them stop, and maybe even be a friend to them.

, If you were able to find even ground with this bully, forgive and forget. Maybe you will find that this once-bully is actually a great person to be around. Everyone has a good side. Sometimes it just takes a kindred spirit and some words of wisdom to bring it out.

Say you poked your eye.,
Say you have bad allergies.,
Say you are fighting off a cold.,
Say you are sensitive to changes in the air.,
Say you got something in your eye.,
Say you were laughing hysterically earlier.,
Say you tear up when you yawn.,
Say you are short on sleep.",How to Hide Tears at School2," You could try saying that you do clumsy stuff sometimes and you accidentally poked your eye which made it all watery. Probably most people have done this at some point or another, so this is something that could very believably have happened to you., Some allergies cause tears and puffy faces or eyes. You could say that you have an allergy that sometimes gives you these symptoms. To make it more believable, try following up with something about how it is for you to live with that allergy.For example, to keep the conversation light, you could say that it is super annoying to have allergies that make you look like a puffer fish.

, Sometimes when we get sick our eyes water. You could consider saying that you are getting over a cold that sometimes makes your eyes watery., You could try saying that your eyes dry up then tear up and are sensitive to gusts of wind or sudden changes in temperature., Maybe it was some dust or a bug or some eraser residue; whatever you decide to say, first look for something plausible in your environment you could have gotten in your eye and blame your tears on that.Keep in mind that whatever you do, don't lie and say that you got something dangerous in your eye, like a chemical. If you do this your teacher may rush you to the nurse, which is a waste of everyone's time.
You will also cause people to needlessly worry and you may have to come clean about lying, which could get you into trouble.

, Sometimes we laugh so hard we cry. If you are wanting to hide your tears because you do not want someone to know that you were or are sad, and they weren't around you a minute or two beforehand, you could say that you were laughing about something really funny.


Tell them a funny joke that you know or a funny situation that you encountered in the past to make it more convincing. Who knows, by recalling this funny situation, you may even cheer yourself up!

, Do a fake yawn by opening your mouth wide and breathing in heavily. Rub your eyes together and if someone asks, tell her that you get tears sometimes when you yawn., Whether or not it is actually true, some people think that our eyes water when we don't get enough sleep. If you want to hide your tears from someone who asks about them, tell her that you were up late last night doing homework or something else that you might plausibly have been doing the night before.

Rest your head on your arms.,
Avoid talking.,
Blot your eyes.,
Get a tissue and 'blow your nose'.,
Pretend to get something from your eye.,
Pretend you have to sneeze.",How to Hide Tears at School3," If you are sitting at your desk, place your head down between your folded arms so that no one can see your eyes. Say that you're tired or that your head hurts and you need a quick rest. Let out a few tears while you pretend that you are taking a rest.


Only do this if your teacher won't get upset; she may call on you and draw the attention of the whole class on you.

, Sometimes our voices tremble when we are sad, which will give away your tears. Try avoiding talking while you are sad.


If it is not possible to avoid talking, try talking in a lower tone of voice than you normally do and speak extra forcefully. Because you are sad you will probably sound more normal even though you think you are talking extra loud and deep.

, Find a reason to bend down, like dropping your pencil or getting something out of your backpack, and wipe your eyes with your shirt or a tissue if you have one on hand.

, If you don't have one but are able to go get one, find a tissue. You can pretend that you have to blow your nose, but before you do, discreetly wipe your eyes of their tears.


Try to turn away from others when you pretend to blow your nose; they will probably think you are just being polite being by not blowing your nose in their directions.

, Make it seem that you are trying to remove an eyelash or something else in your eye by blinking a lot or pulling your eyelid. While you are doing this, discreetly wipe away any tears that others may be able to see.

, Do your best fake sneeze into your hands or the inside of your elbow and wipe away any tears that way. If anyone sees any tears remaining and asks about them, you could jokingly say that you sneezed so hard you must have blown a gasket (i.e., you sneezed so hard it caused you to tear up).


If you know that you are prone to crying, consider packing some tissues in your bag for when you need them. Or, if you don't have a bag on you, put a few tissues in your pocket.

Ask to be excused.,
Minimize the chance you will be heard.,
Let it all out.,
Wait for your face to clear up.,
Block others' view of your face.",How to Hide Tears at School4," If you are in class and you feel tears coming on, ask to use the bathroom.You are much more likely to be alone in the bathroom during a class period.


If you are at lunch or recess, move away from others. Try making an excuse by saying something about how you need to clear your thoughts or how you want to run around on your own.

, Once you are in the bathroom, make your way to a stall so that you can be alone. If you are worried about making crying noises, try running the faucet or flushing the toilet when you feel that you need to really let the tears out so people are less likely to hear you.


If you are at lunch or recess, by moving away from others you will be less likely to be heard or seen crying.

, Once you are alone in the bathroom or you have flushed the toilet so no one can hear you, let yourself cry until you can't cry anymore. After you have let out all your tears and you think you are over your sad spell, give yourself a minute to recover.


If you are at lunch or recess, look around and make sure no one is too close by, then let it all out.

, After crying, your face might be red or puffy. Before you head back to the classroom, wait a few minutes for evidence of your crying to disappear.


If you can without being seen, try speeding up the process by running cold water over your face.
If your face is still red and/or puffy when you head back to class, try placing your hand in front of your face and scratching the top of your forehead as you walk back into class and take your seat. This way you will cover up most of your face and it will just look like you had an itch.
When you enter the classroom, you can also do a fake yawn, which will scrunch up your face and help to hide that you were crying. You can try this alone or in combination with scratching your head.
To wait around while at lunch or recess, do your best to stay as far away from your classmates as you can.

, If you are sitting on the left or rightmost side of the classroom, you can continue to hide your puffy face or any additional tears by resting a hand on your face in a way that will help to block others' view of you.


If you are sitting on the leftmost side of the classroom, you can rest your right hand on your face, or if on the rightmost side, your left hand.
Be careful to not look like you are falling asleep when you do this otherwise your teacher may call on you and put unwanted attention on you.

"
If the bully persists throughout the whole journey, turn around and ask them politely but firmly to ""Please stop saying nasty things about me, because it's really irritating and annoying."",
Catch the pranks and respond with disdain.,
When the bully taunts you and calls you mean names, fight back with words!,
Don't listen to what they say.,
Remember that bullies are just bad, sad people.",How to Ignore a Bully on the School Bus (Middle School)2," If they still persist, tell them ""If you don't stop, I will go to the bus driver/teacher/head of school etc."" Don't be like an immature five-year-old saying ""You're mean, I'm gonna tell""; rather, say it assertively and firmly. If they say something stupid like ""Oh, I'm so scared,"" say ""Well, you won't exactly be happy when you get a (form of punishment at your school)"" and proceed to ignore him/her from then on. Remember, bullies are cowards so they probably are actually scared.

, Does the bully always stick out a leg for you to trip up on? Next time they do it/try to do it say 'Wow. Really? You would sink to that level? What kind of freakish joy do you get from tripping me (name of bully)?' Cross your arms, and look the bully in the eye (step 1 doesn't apply here) and wait patiently for the bully to put his/her leg down. You can even laugh a little and shake your head to show that this pitiful technique of the bully makes you laugh. Use the name of the bully so they realize your talking to them.

, Just think about Martin Luther King Jr. and his speeches against racism. If they call you dumb or some other dirty name, reply with something witty like, ""It takes a dumb one to know a dumb one"" or even funnier, ""Stop stalking me! It's creeping me out!"" This would be a good technique if they constantly following you. You can use this technique if they are repeatedly bothering you and you are sick of it, or you feel they have crossed the line and you will not let them put you down, but only respond to them once if you must. Ignoring is a far better technique.

, They don't know who you really are! Why should you care about what they say? When someone calls you dumb (lacking intelligence or common sense) how would they know that? They don't know your test grades. You are yourself and no one can change who you are. Never let bullies trample all over you.

, They are bad to the core because they take pleasure in being nasty to people, and sad because they spend their lives doing it and they're probably only doing it because they're jealous of you or they're taking out their own problems on someone else. If bullying gets out of hand and makes your life a misery, always an adult. It may be hard, but remember this is exactly how you will win against the bully.

Avoid giving a bully the opportunity to bully you.,
Put on your poker face.,
Tune out the bully.",How to Ignore Bullies1," Most bullies will look for easy opportunities to victimize someone, or “easy targets”. Try to avoid being an easy target by being aware of the bully’s movements when you are in the same room with them and focus on keeping to yourself.For example, choose a table further away from the bully at lunch, or a seat in class that is not within eyesight of the bully.
It’s also important to keep an eye on your belongings and avoid giving the bully an opportunity to bully you. For example: maybe you leave your lunch on the table while you go to the vending machine for a drink. When you get back to the table, your lunch is now in the hands of the bully. To avoid this, bring your lunch with you or leave your lunch with a group of friends or individuals you trust.
If you're trying to avoid a bully at the office, plan your lunch so you aren't in the lunch room at the same time or schedule a meeting so you don't have to cross paths with the bully.
By being conscious of the presence of the bully, you avoid leaving yourself open to bullying.;
, Most bullies want a reaction from you, whether it be turning red with anger, pale with embarrassment, or expressing fear with tears. Most bullies enjoy when they can tell their words and actions bother you and will continue bullying you to get the same reaction over and over again.The term “poker face” is used to describe how people make bets in a poker game - they use a blank expression on their faces when betting so other people in the game cannot read their expression or tell that they may be bluffing.
When a bully starts taunting you, put on an emotionless and expressionless poker face to send a message that the teasing and bullying will not get to you. Don’t give the bully the satisfaction of showing a reaction to their hurtful words or actions.

, You want to try to avoid baiting or encouraging the bully to tease or taunt, so deny them any attention to diffuse the situation and force the bully to leave you alone. Even if the bully is making eye-contact, look away.


Try putting on your headphones and listening to your favorite song instead of the taunts of the bully, or close your eyes and silently count backwards from 10.In the office, tune out the bully by walking away and starting a conversation with someone else in the room or at another desk.

Be calm and avoid showing your feelings.,
Pretend you don't notice them.,
Walk away and disengage.,
Distract yourself with something positive.,
Find ways to avoid them in the future.,
Block out a bully on social media.",How to Ignore a Bully1," When a bully confronts you it may be hard to stay calm, but this is key to ignoring them. Avoid showing emotions that you are upset or feel hurt by what they are saying. Learn how to calm yourself in these ways: Start counting to ten backwards. Or try the alphabet backwards.
Take deep breaths and count to five. Make sure your breaths are making your stomach rise and not your chest. This type of breathing has a calming effect.
Look at the bully's forehead or past them. Think about a book you are reading or a paper you have to write for class — something distracting but somewhat neutral.;
, If they try to get an emotional rise out of you, or touch you to see if you will respond, pretend that you are unfazed by them. Look away from them. Find a way to distance yourself in your chair or in the room.Build an invisible wall between you and the bully by visualizing it your mind. See the verbal attack bounce off the wall instead of noticing the bully.If you are not in class and someplace where you wouldn't get in trouble for putting on headphones (like on the bus or maybe in the hallway), drown the bully out by listening to music. If you think the bully might get violent or you need to be on your guard, however, this is not a good option.
Ignore the scathing remarks that you want to say to them. Write them down later if you want.

, Put some distance between yourself and the person who is bullying. Find a place where you can go and have privacy. Once you have gotten away from the person, you can let your guard down. Exit a room where the bully is located. Find a space that is private or with people that are supportive.
If you're in a public space like walking down the street, find a way to get to a safe place or someplace where there are other people around.
If you are being harassed through your computer, social media, or cell phone, learn to block that person so that you do not receive messages from them.

, Bullying can be stressful, so find ways to distract yourself with positive things. Consider these:


Listen or play music. Find a favorite playlist to help you stay calm.
Do something artistic. Write in a journal. Draw. Build something.
Be physically active. Join a fitness group or sports team. Take a walk.
Talk with friends. Hang out with people that support you. Do something fun with them.

, If it's possible, try to avoid seeing or interacting with the bully. This shouldn't mean that you have to give up doing things you love. You have a right to go to school or work without being bullied. But consider these ways to avoid interactions:


Get to class or work in a different way.
Avoid the places where the bully hangs out.
Find people who will walk with you if you have to cross paths with the bully.
Find a different time of day to do certain things.

, Cyberbullying can be just as emotionally draining as verbal abuse. Understand that bullying online, via text, or chat is not acceptable. Bullies online may act a different way than in person because of the safety of anonymity or being disconnected from people in real life. Learn how to ignore them on social media.


Avoid the need to respond to their attacks. If they continue to harass you, consider reporting the incident. Here is advice about how to report and prevent cyberbullying: https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/.
Block the email address of the person who is bullying. Change settings on your email account.
""Unfriend"" or no longer ""follow"" them on sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Tumblr. Change your account setting so that the private information cannot be accessed to them or the public.

Block a phone number. Delete the number from your contact list. Depending on your cell phone type, there are ways to remove a number. Contact your phone service provider for additional options.

If you don't understand the bully's game, you will lose. If you understand the bully's game but play it anyway, you will lose. If you understand the bully's game and do not play it, you will win.;
, All verbal bullies play the same game: they want something from you (respect, distress, counter-insults) and push you into accepting something that belongs to them (their negative attention). Put differently, they are trying to get something from you and trying to give something to you. What do bullies want from you? For you to do the following:


Give them attention
Act hurt or upset
Bully back or run away (fight or flight)

, There are two useful metaphors for this strategy: the ghost, and the CEO.


Imagine an archer (bully) firing arrows (words) at a ghost (you). As a ghost, you are slightly amused and bored by the silly archer. The ghost cannot be hurt by the arrows. The ghost doesn't run away or fire arrows back. The ghost just yawns. What can the archer do to the ghost? Nothing but keep firing arrows that never hit the target. The ghost smiles when the archer finally gets bored or frustrated and gives up.






Imagine yourself as a Fortune 500 CEO who passes a panhandler. You are an important, powerful man with a black belt in karate. You are on your way somewhere and have important things to do. The bully is like a small, weak, and annoying street hustler who is trying to get you to take a paper flower in exchange for coins put in his hat. The CEO doesn't get upset or talk to the panhandler as an equal. The CEO gives a preoccupied smile and keeps walking. The CEO has nothing against the panhandler. It is just that the panhandler barely exists in the CEO's world. This is the attitude you must cultivate. The bully doesn't matter to you (yawn) and doesn't hurt you in the slightest.
The ghost/CEO defense is indirect. It contrasts with the classic direct defense of ""giving the bully a taste of his own medicine."" The indirect defense is more effective because it lets the bully waste his strength without getting any reward. The more the bully attacks, the less you care, and the more frustrated he gets. In contrast, the direct defense gives the bully at least two things he wants: to matter to you and to be attacked with his own weapon of choice. The direct defense only works if you cause the bully so much pain that he does not bother you again, and even then you run the risk of provoking revenge.

, This rule is so simple, yet so often disobeyed. For bullying to occur, two things have to happen: someone has to be around the bully, and this person must appear to the bully as prey. Think of a bullying incident as a battle. Prevent battle whenever possible by either not being around the bully, or being present on the battleground without appearing as prey.


To avoid the bully, learn the bully's habits and associates. If a bully always hangs out in a certain place, then don't go to that place unless you can't avoid it. Be very careful where you go and who you go with. Map out escape routes and even hiding places. Have a plan in your head.
Sometimes you cannot avoid a bully. In this case, think of what prey would look like to this bully, and try not to look like that. Stand up straight, but not rigid and tense. Keep your head and eyes up. Move confidently, rolling your shoulders and hips a little, without swaggering (which may invite bullying). Speak slowly, as if every word mattered. Every move you make should demonstrate a lack of fear. If you can't do this, then you can't. But try.
If a bully has marked you as prey, and you can't avoid battle, then try to choose the time and place of battle. Does the bully like to have a big audience? Then it's better to face him when few people are around. Does the bully stop bullying you when person X is there? Then try to be around X when the bully is near.
If you are forced to engage in verbal battle, try to have more friends with you than he has with him. This might be impossible because bullies are good at isolating their victims.

, A rule of thumb in battle is ""seek higher ground."" If you can, stand while the bully sits; or stand on a step while the bully is below you. Also, keep a distance between you and the bully. Your physical orientation should send the message that you are above and out of reach. Do not hang your head, shrink back, or stare at the ground. Your posture and facial expression should show that you are unafraid, and more importantly, unimpressed.

, Turn your body slightly away from him, implying his insignificance to you. If you can, keep moving so that you are leading (looking over your shoulder) and he is following. If you can, don't let yourself be backed against a wall. An exception is if you are sitting on a stool with your back to a counter or bar, and he is looking up at you.

, If you are bullied, then you can and almost certainly will feel upset. You may feel close to tears. This is completely normal and expected. Don't waste energy being mad at yourself because you feel this way. Conserve your energy. The key to your defense is not to show your feelings. Relax your face and body. If possible, smile. A smile is one of the very best weapons at your disposal because it is exactly the opposite of what the bully wants.

, Deny the bully your upset, your respect, and your ""fight or flight"" stance. Frustrate the bully's expectations. The beggar tries to force the CEO to accept a paper flower and give him coins. The CEO can refuse to take the flower or give the money. By analogy, this rule says ""don't give the beggar coins (upset, attention, insults) and don't keep his flower (insults).""

, To show that you're not playing, avoid saying ""you"" and talking to the bully directly. Why? Because talking to him directly shows him that he matters. Also, don't ask the bully questions. Why? Because then you want something from him--an answer or explanation. If you question him, then not only does the bully matter to you, but you are in a weak position because you are trying to get him to do something he may not do. Remember: You want nothing from the bully. The bully (beggar) doesn't matter enough to you (the CEO) for you to want anything from him. The bully barely exists to you.

, If possible, turn your body away from the bully, and make him talk to your back. If the bully is talking to your side or back, then he attacks from a position of weakness. If you talk to him, do it over your shoulder. Everything you say and do with your voice and body sends the message ""You don't matter much.""

,


Ignoring: If you ignore the bully without looking like you are running away, then this tactic is effective. This tactic works great when you are wearing headphones, talking on a cell, or conversing with someone else. You can glance briefly and quizzically at the bully but turn away. A slight shrug is OK. Act as if you did not even hear what the bully said, or as if he said it in a foreign language.






Dismissing: In this tactic, you acknowledge the bully, but brush him off in a way that shows he doesn't matter. The key move in the brush-off is turning away afterward. You don't want to sit there staring at the bully, waiting for another comment.






For inspiration, imagine yourself as a CEO brushing off a panhandler. You might say, ""How's it going"" or ""Maybe later"" or ""I'll get back to you"" and turn away. One-word brush-offs are good. ""'Sup."" ""Cute."" ""Clever."" ""Right."" ""I see."" ""OK."" ""Huh."" ""Gotcha.""
Nonverbal brush-offs are good. You show the bully he is not worth enough to waste words on. Yawn. Nod. Shake your head. Scratch your chin. Purse your lips. Look puzzled as if someone just spoke to you in a foreign language. Turn to someone else, roll your eyes, and stick your thumb at the bully as if to say, ""Can you believe this guy?""


Misunderstanding: In this tactic, you pretend that you just received a compliment. Perhaps the bully says, ""That's a stupid hat."" Act like the CEO who was complimented by the beggar on his hat. ""Thanks, I guess."" ""Yeah, this hat is great."" ""Glad you like it."" ""You like hats."" Whatever insult the bully makes, misunderstand it as a compliment. You can also turn the compliment into a joke. ""Like it? When I get my hat business going, you can be my distributor.""

A variation on misunderstanding is mishearing. You never can't make out what the bully is saying as if you are hard of hearing.

BULLY: ""You have a stupid shirt.""
YOU: ""Did someone say something?""
BULLY: ""Yeah, I said you have a stupid shirt.""
YOU: ""Sounds like someone is saying he has a stupid shirt,"" or ""You're shirt is a little dated, but it's not stupid. Don't be so hard on yourself.""
BULLY: ""Loser. Idiot. You know what I'm saying.""
YOU: ""I hear this high whining sound, like an insect. Or is that someone talking?"" BULLY: ""Shut up, jerk, you know what I'm saying.""
YOU: ""I wish this guy would make sense. Who knows what he's even talking about.""




Agreeing: In this tactic, you agree with what the bully says, and make a joke of it. This tactic works well if a bully has a sense of humor. Say the bully says, ""That's a stupid hat."" You say, ""If you like this one, you should see the one I wore yesterday. It was 2 feet (0.6 m) higher."" Or, ""I'm thinking of adding stripes to it."" Or, ""It's biodegradable."" Basically, say anything that people listening would find funny. The bully himself might even laugh. In this case, his attack was rendered completely harmless.Note that that firing a joking insult back is not an element of the indirect defense. However, sometimes you can insert an insult into a joke. If the bully says, ""You have a stupid haircut,"" you might laugh and say, ""Yeah, I agree. I told your boyfriend how to cut it, but he messed it up anyway."" If you use this tactic, be careful. You are on the verge of playing the bully's game.






Ribbing: In this tactic, you rib the bully for his verbal ineptitude. Imagine that a goofy friend asks you for a game of one-on-one basketball. He dribbles with two hands, the ball slips out of his hands when he tries to shoot, he is immediately winded. He has no clue! You could bust up laughing and then walk away, saying nothing. The ""laugh and go"" approach can be very effective because it shows the bully he is too ridiculous to warrant a comment. Shake your head and keep chuckling to yourself as you walk away.






Reflecting: You can also use words. You might chuckle at him good-naturally, shake your head, and say, ""Man, is that your best game? You need work."" Or, ""A for effort. Come back and see me when you've got skills."" Or, ""Your game needs serious work. I can hook you up with some trainers."" Or, ""Dude, that was just lousy. You can do better."" Or, ""Your game definitely needs work."" You get the idea.






Remember, all bullies give you something (their attention) and try to get something (a negative reaction). One effective tactic against persistent bullies is to make fun of all the attention the bully is giving you. This is like holding up a shield when the bully throws a ball at you: the ball bounces back and hits the bully. The more balls he throws, the more he hits himself.



, Do whatever works right now. Any of the tactics may work or fail to work at a given time for a given person. The basic guideline is ""Experiment, and be free to change at a moment's notice if something doesn't work."" For example, ignoring may not work if the bully is persistent and calls you a coward. You might come back with reflecting. Or alternate dismissing and agreeing. There are no rules. Just experiment and go with what works best in a given situation.

, If verbal bullying turns into physical bullying, then it's fight or flight. Know what to do, which is the steps above. Be aware and keep in mind to stand up for yourself and for others! Also, be sure not to fight back when the bully starts to go rough on you.

, If someone says a mean insult, no matter how and when you are always the better person. When someone bullies, they are showing a sign of weakness and insecurity. Even if it's just a one-off insult by someone, they are still showing a sign of them being weak and insecure. Do your best not to feel sad and upset, because what bullies do is they try to transfer something that makes them upset to you. Always remember that you are a wise person that has chosen not to go down the path that unfortunately, most people take."
"
Don’t bully back.,
Use a comeback line.,
Remove the bully’s audience.",How to Ignore Bullies2," Avoid reacting to the bully by hitting, kicking, pushing or name calling. Fighting back usually only encourages the bully to continue taunting you and can be dangerous as someone will likely be injured or hurt.If you’re dealing with a bully at school or at work, bullying back may also get you in trouble and give the bully the satisfaction of seeing you in the principal’s office or detention.
In an office setting, bullying back could lead to an awkward meeting with your boss about your reactive behavior or embarrassment in front of other co-workers for responding aggressively to the bully.

, While this is a more active way to deal with bullying, a good comeback line can diffuse the situation and force the bully to realize they are not going to make you visibly angry or upset.For example: a bully may come up to you and yell a cruel or threatening remark. A brief response like “Why would you say that?” takes the focus off the insult and places it back on the bully, while still avoiding name calling or an angry remark. This kind of comeback can throw the bully off guard and make them so uncomfortable they will likely leave you alone.
A simple response such as “Really?” or “Seriously?” as well as a bored-sounding response like “whatever”, or “uh huh” can also show you don’t take the bully’s remarks to heart and aren’t going to engage in an aggressive interaction with them.
If the bully is threatening you with physical violence, it is always best to not engage with the bully at all. Walk away and find a safe space around an adult or an authority figure.If you are a parent who is trying to teach your child how to deter a bully, practice several good comebacks with them at home. Role playing with them will allow them to assert themselves and confront the reality of bullying. It will also let them know they can come to you if they are having any further problems with bullies., Most bullies enjoy bullying someone around others to establish their power and dominance and send a message to others that they are in charge. It’s important to work on deflecting attention away from the bully’s actions so they do not have an audience for their taunting and teasing.Using a good comeback line to diffuse, rather than escalate, the situation with the bully can help remove their audience. While a fight or loud shouting with the bully can lead to more attention, a passive action can lead to less attention.
For example, if a bully is taunting you on the bus, deflect attention away from the bully's words by moving seats to sit next to someone else or striking up a conversation with a friend sitting nearby.
If you are in a work situation with a bully, another tactic might be to change the subject or shift the conversation away from the bully’s remarks. This will indicate the bully has no power in the conversation and will remove any chances they may have to gain attention for their bullying behavior.

"
Make a buddy.,
Focus on building your self esteem and self worth.,
Talk to an authority figure.",How to Ignore Bullies3," Most bullies tend to single out loners or individuals who do not seem to have a community of friends or allies. So find a buddy and vow to stick together to avoid being bullied.Walk with a friend on the way to school, or make a plan to meet up at recess or lunch so you can show bullies that you have strength in number and have allies to back you up.
If you are dealing with bullies in the office, look for co-workers you feel you can trust and rely on to help you deflect or ignore bullies.

, Another way to ignore a bully is to find an ally in yourself. Work on building your self esteem and self worth so that when a bully comes up to you, ready to insult you or taunt you, you can feel strong and secure enough to ignore them.Think about a skill you’re good at or would like to get better at, like a sport, a creative art, or a craft. Put time and energy into improving your abilities in a certain skill so you can feel good about yourself, despite a bully’s taunts or hurtful actions.
You may also feel good by doing small things as part of your daily routine, like showering in the morning before school or setting aside time to choose an outfit and get dressed or groom yourself in a way that makes you feel confident and strong.

, Though this may not fall under ignoring a bully, it is very important to tell an adult if you are being bullied, especially if you have already tried other passive ways of dealing with the bully and they still will not leave you alone. Find someone you trust, like a teacher, a parent, or a manager, and let them know you are being bullied. Use the allies around you to help you deal with the bully.Remember that telling is not the same as tattling. Tattling is meant to make someone else look bad, as there is no victim involved when you tattle. But telling or reporting is done in the service of others, as it's meant to help someone.It’s a heroic thing to stand up for someone who’s being hurt. Bullying is wrong and it can only help the situation if you speak up and let an authority figure know you are being bullied or someone you know is being bullied.

"
"
Stand up for yourself.,
Be confident.,
Avoid the need to fight back.",How to Ignore a Bully2," Consider ways that you can advocate for yourself. If you are alone with the bully, you may be able to get your voice heard better than if you are in a group setting. Find a calm but strong way to make your voice heard. Consider these:Say that you want them to back off, such as ""Stop messing with me,"" or, ""Leave me alone.""
Consider using a bit of humor. Just avoid using humor to put them down. You might respond saying, ""Apparently you are very concerned about my style and appearance. I had no idea you cared so much!""

, A bully is more likely to attack if you come off as weak or not knowing how to handle yourself. Remember to think positively about who you are, and that you are no better or worse than anyone else.


When someone is bullying, think to yourself, ""I'm better than that. I don't have to pick on other people to feel good about myself."", Avoid the need to use violence as a way to handle the situation. It will only escalate the situation further and may do more harm than good. Walking away or being assertive verbally are better solutions.If you are being attacked and feel that your life is at risk, do your best to run away, but physically protecting yourself may be necessary if you are in danger.
Be safe and avoid any injury to yourself or others.

"
Avoid self-blame by finding ways to cope.,
Get support from friends and family.,
Talk with an adult or authority figure.",How to Ignore a Bully3," You are worthwhile. Bullies often act out as a way to cope with their own insecurities and stressors. Being bullied often has little to do with you. Focus your time and energy on positive things rather than dwelling on the negative. Consider these ways to cope: Try martial arts. Martial arts is often more about self-confidence than about learning how to fight. Karate, judo, and other forms of martial arts can help you redirect that negative energy.
Join a club or team. Get involved as part of a team. Being part of team can help you feel included rather than excluded. Consider trying out for a sports team, joining an outdoors club, or being part of language club.
Let out your creative side. Find ways to calm your stress. Put your photographs in an art show. Draw. Paint. Sculpt. Make or build something.

, Remember, you don't have to bear this alone. Avoid isolating yourself, as this will likely make you feel worse. Seek guidance from friends and family that you trust.Talk openly about what you're feeling. They care about you.
Family or friends that you trust may have gone through bullying too. Get their support and advice about ways to deal with the situation. They may be able to offer you advice you hadn't considered.
Spend more time with friends and family. It will likely be better to surround yourself with people that care about you even if you're not feeling your best.

, Remember to speak up and get help. If you don't know what to do or feel as if it isn't working, get help. These people may be able to help stop the bullying or provide guidance about what to do next:A teacher
A guidance counselor
A parent, grandparent, or relative
A mentor through a community group
A supervisor or leader at your place of work
The police, if there was a serious injury
A pastor or leader at your place of worship

"
"
Make a parent aware of the situation.,
Reach out to a teacher or school administrator that you trust.,
Follow the suggestions of the adults first.,
Follow-up if the behavior does not change.",How to Defend Yourself from Bullies1," Your parents can often speak out on your behalf to the teachers and school administrators. Parents often exist within the same community, and your parents may be able to have a talk with the parents of the aggressor., Many kids, especially those who are not very popular, may have a few choice teachers they really like. If you have someone like this at the school, talk to this person about the bullying incidents.


If you are nervous about speaking to a teacher or school counselor on your own, ask a friend or parent to come with you for support.
Don't fear retaliation.Telling someone can result in the situation getting better. It cannot improve if you keep bullying a secret.
Don't view yourself as a tattletale. Bullies need to be stopped because they make one person's educational experience unsafe. By telling an adult, you are doing the right thing.

, Some schools have very serious protocols in place to act out against bullying. Speaking to adults first may get the situation under control before bullying goes too far.

, It may be necessary to take greater measures if bullying does not stop after parents and teachers are involved. You need to be persistent with updating them on the situation so they will know if further actions need to be taken.

"
Make it clear that you consider this behavior harassment.,
Tell the person to stop contacting you.,
Stop answering the person's calls, emails, and other messages.,
Delete the person from your phone and social media accounts.,
Keep records of the harassment.,
Talk to the administration at your school or workplace.,
Call the police.,
Get a restraining order.,
Have your phone company set up a trap.,
Report violations of the restraining order right away.,
Tell your friends and family what's going on.,
Don't publicize your location and daily habits.,
Change the locks on your door and take other safety measures around the house.,
Learn self defense skills.",How to Deal with Someone That is Harassing You," If you are generally a polite, reserved person who hates hurting someone else's feelings, the harasser might think his or her behavior is actually welcome. It might be hard to believe, but it's possible the person harassing you doesn't realize his or her behavior is bothering you this much. Sometimes just telling the person outright, ""I consider this to be harassment"" can prompt an embarrassing wake-up call. A decent person will immediately apologize for his or her behavior and back off.

If you have trouble with face-to-face confrontation, or if you have no desire to actually see the person, you can write it in an email or a letter instead of talking in person.
Do not apologize for calling out the behavior for what it is - you're not the one who has done something wrong. Don't couch the accusation in sweet, friendly terms. You need to make it absolutely clear that this is harassment, or else the person might not get the message.
Name the behavior and state that it is wrong. For example, say, “Do not whistle at me, that is harassment,” or “Do not touch my butt, that is sexual harassment.”
Attack the behavior, not the person. Tell them what they are doing that you do not like (“You are standing too close”) rather than blaming them as a person (“You are such a jerk”). Avoid cursing, name-calling, put downs, and other actions that may escalate the situation unnecessarily.;
, If naming the harassment for what it is doesn't help, and the person continues the bad behavior, it might be time to break off contact. Making your opinion and wishes crystal clear can sometimes get through to the harasser. Tell the person that you expect him or her to stay away, and that you will no longer be answering correspondence. Be clear that if the person continues harassing you, you will take steps to put a stop to it.

Do not get into a dialogue with the harasser, or try to reason with them, or answer their questions. You do not need to respond to diversions, questions, threats, blaming, or guilt-tripping. Stay on your own agenda. Stick to your point.
If the harasser is someone you have to see frequently - say, someone at school, or someone who works where you do - you can still set new boundaries that make sense for your situation. Tell the person to stop hanging out by your desk or approaching you at lunchtime, for example.

, Now it's time to make good on what you told the harasser by stopping correspondence on your end. If he or she tries to get in touch, don't answer his or her calls, emails or texts. At this point you've made your position clear, so if that person contacts you again he or she is explicitly going against the boundaries you've laid out. You have no obligation to explain yourself, apologize, or keep the relationship going.
, This way you'll ensure the harasser no longer has access to you or the information you share with other people. Delete the person from your phone, and set up a block on that number if possible. Unfriend the person from your Facebook and block him or her from your Twitter.
, If you continue getting harassed, keep a record of every incident that occurs. At this point the harasser's actions may be considered illegal, and if they continue you're going to need to get other people involved. You'll need evidence of the harassing behavior to show others who can help you.

Keep all email and text correspondence you have received.
Write down an account of what has happened, noting the date and place of each incident.
Keep the names of other people who have witnessed the harassing behavior in case you need to ask them to verify your account of what occurred.

, You don't have to deal with harassment alone. Before things get even more out of hand, talk to your human resources department, your principal, or someone else you trust. Most administrations have policies in place to deal with harassment. If the person in question is a student or an employee, involving the administration may put a stop to the behavior.
, If the harassment reaches a threatening level and you no longer feel safe, call the police right away. If the harasser is physically near you, having the police come will put you out of harm's way. Never hesitate to call the police if you are feeling endangered; that's what they're there for. Get the badge number of the police officer to whom you speak.
, You can also get a restraining order to protect yourself and your family from the harasser. You'll need to file a petition for a restraining order, have it served to the person harassing you, and have a court hearing during which a judge will rule on what specific protections the restraining order will provide. You'll then receive restraining order papers that you should keep on hand in case the person ever violates the order.

A restraining order usually specifies that the harasser cannot make contact with you or come within a certain distance of you.If you are in immediate danger, you can get a temporary restraining order that will prevent the person from being able to legally come near you or get in contact with you at least until your court date.
Consider getting a lawyer involved. You can file your petition and attend your court hearing on your own, but it's always better to have legal advice so that you can be sure you're filling out the forms correctly and getting the protections you need.

, Call your phone company and ask them to set up a ""trap"" in order to track phone calls coming from the harasser's number. The phone company can then share this record with the police department, and they'll be able to use it to help them track down the harasser if necessary.
, Every time the harasser violates the terms of the restraining order, report it to the police department. They'll keep a record of each violation. Violating a restraining order is a crime, so it is possible that criminal charges will be brought against the harasser in the case of a violation., Going through this experience alone is dangerous, both physically and emotionally. It's important to tell the people in your life that you are being harassed, and that you're fearful for your safety. Keep people in the loop about where you are on a daily basis so they'll be aware if something out of the ordinary happens.

Tell people you trust if you go out of town or need to miss work.
Make sure people know not to give the harasser any information about you.
Have friends stay with you when you're feeling unsafe.

, If you're a big Twitter and Facebook user, it might be time to take a break from publicizing your habits. Even if you deleted the harasser from your accounts, he or she might have a way of checking them through someone else's account.

Don't use FourSquare and other apps that tell people exactly where you are.
Don't publicly say that you're going out of town, or that you'll be alone for a certain amount of time.

, Err on the side of safety and get your locks changed. You might want to get a bolt-style lock to make it harder to enter your doorways. In addition to making sure your doors are secure, consider these other safety measures:

You can install motion-detector lights that turn on when someone is walking near your house at night.
Look into getting security cameras you can set up around your property.
You might want to consider getting an alarm system that will alert the police department if an intruder enters your home.

, You'll feel safer knowing that you can defend yourself if you ever need to do so. Take a class in self defense and learn the right ways to punch, kick, and poke someone who is trying to attack you.

Consider carrying a keychain alarm, whistle, or pocketknife.
If it's legal in your jurisdiction, you might also want to carry pepper spray.

Realize that you don't deserve to be bullied.,
Do not be taken in by people who insist you brought this on yourself.",How to Deal With Verbal Bullying1," Also be aware that you do live within a cultural time that values competitiveness as a virtue. One unfortunate side effect of that pressure to always perform, succeed and be some sort of ultimate is that some people feel that bullying is an okay way to behave. It's never okay and fortunately, there are ways to manage the situation to allow you to cope and even thrive despite the bullying person or culture to which you're being subjected.;
, The concept that someone has been bullied because of some weakness or inability to show grit in the face of witty barbs is born from the opinion of bullies themselves, the people who would like to excuse this disgusting behavior as ""normal"". Human beings are meant to get along with one another to ensure the species' survival, which does not mean spending inordinate amounts of time tearing one another down. You do not have to change who you are to satisfy the odd insecurities or failures of the bully. What you do need to do is find ways to manage this person effectively, so that he or she isn't constantly dragging you down.

Ignore them.,
Walk away.,
Take some deep breathes.,
Compile a list of uplifting quotes.,
Call or text a friend.",How to Deal With People Who Make Fun of Your Appearance1," When being teased, you might feel that your blood is boiling or that you are on the verge of tears. To avoid reacting, ignore their comments completely. Put in ear phones, think of something funny that happened recently, or scroll through some memes on social media.If you are at work, you might shut your office door, work on emails, or call a customer/client.;
, If ignoring their comments is not effective, walk away from them. Walk towards a crowd of people or towards other friends. They will likely not tease you as much if you are around your support system.

If you are in school, walk towards a teacher or administrator.

, Deep breathing is a calming technique often used to combat anger or frustration. Instead of reacting, take ten deep breaths. Breathe in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth., It can be really tough to have others pick on your appearance, especially if they are teasing you about things you can’t really change. However, it’s important to find ways to keep positive and to build yourself up. Make a list, either on paper or in your phone, of uplifting quotes or compliments that you have received. Read over this list in the mornings or when you are being teased.

One quote you might list is from Eleanor Roosevelt who said “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”
If someone has told you that you have nice hair or clothes, write that down, too.

, When someone is being mean to you, it can be tempting to be mean back or to lash out in anger. However, this usually will only make the teasing worse, as most bullies are looking for a reaction. Identify a friend or family member who is level-headed and who gives good advice and call or text them. They can help to get your mind off things or give you advice on what to do.

You might say “Hey girl, remember that kid from my school who I told you keeps making jokes of my glasses? He just did it again. What would you do?”
You might also talk to a coworker who you you are close with.

Get with a friend who can serve as a source of strength.,
Role-play with your parents.,
Use verbal defense strategies.Bullies count on your fear and discomfort to make them feel powerful.,
Use a strong voice.,
Use humor.,
Be a role model for other kids who experience bullying.",How to Defend Yourself from Bullies2," Just because you have been the victim of bullying, you do not have to act like a victim. This gives the aggressor more power over you and the situation.


Walk with your head held high, your chin up and your back straight. Project self-confidence rather than a lack of confidence; this makes it harder for someone to perceive you as weak., Stay away from students who seem to be trouble-makers. When a bully approaches you it's a good idea to stand near a teacher or any adult to deter them from teasing and taunting.


Sit near the bus driver on the school bus.
Choose a different route to class or home to avoid the bully.
Refrain from being in unsupervised areas of the school alone with the bully such as bathrooms or locker rooms.
Leave expensive possessions or excess cash at home to avoid confrontation.

, When you cannot prevent being in the same area with the bully, having a friend nearby can give you the courage you need to stand up to the bully or ignore the taunts.

, If your parents suggest that you use certain tactics to deter bullying behavior, it's a great idea to practice these skills when the pressure's off. Have your parents act as the bully and practice avoiding, ignoring, or appropriately responding to bullying, so that you will feel confident doing it in real life.

, Rather than playing into their hands, employ verbal strategies that will show them you are not fazed by their tactics.


Bully approaches in the hall: ""Hey, you loser! What did Mommy pack you for lunch today?""
You: Smile and say, ""Hi, there. See you later!"" Walk away calmly and confidently.
Based on the phrase ""kill them with kindness"", a bully may be deterred from picking on you if it seems like the bullying behavior is not effectively scaring you., Speak confidently and assertively against the person bullying you.Practice doing this with a parent or close friend so that you are fully prepared when the situation arises.


Bully: ""You can't sit here.""
You: ""There are no labels on these seats. I am free to sit where I please.""

, Bullies often seem very frightening. Visualizing the bully with bright purple hair or a pig's nose may take away some of the fear this person causes you.

, Handling bullying in a healthy way can encourage others who are being terrorized by bullies. Standing up to your bully may give someone else the strength to do it, too.

Learn self-defense.Take a general self-defense class or martial arts.,
Train in the gym with a personal trainer or train for a sport that you enjoy.,
Walk away.,
Use physical force as a last resort.,
Beware of falling into the bully trap.",How to Defend Yourself from Bullies3," These types of skill-based training courses not only help you defend yourself physically against aggressors, but they also teach you to avoid potentially harmful environments, how to read potentially unsafe people, and how to de-escalate a fight before it starts.

, Gaining physical strength and mastery can help you to project self-confidence rather than weakness.

, Never fear looking like a wimp or loser for retreating from a bully. Practice flight rather than fight. Saving your life is far more important than saving face with schoolmates.

, Avoid a fight whenever you can because there is no way to control whether someone will get hurt or injured. Plus, if you engage in a fight, you may end up getting in trouble or suspended from school, too.


Only fight back when you are in immediate danger of being harmed or when you are in an environment when you cannot call for help.
In cases where defending yourself physically cannot be avoided, stand with your legs wide and guard your face with your arms and hands. If a bully sees you preparing to defend yourself, this may catch the person off guard. The bully may decide that a fight is not worth it, after all., Gaining the courage and strength to defend yourself against bullies can be empowering. However, you should never use your new-found confidence against others and become a bully yourself.

Know that bullies get off on power.,
Think about how bullies fit into the social hierarchy.,
Realize that bullying doesn't just happen with kids.,
Consider that some bullies are also bully-victims.,
Don't assume it's personal.",How to Defend Yourself from Bullies4," Bullying happens due to an imbalance of power. Bullies tease and pick on kids who are smaller or younger than them. Plus, bullies target peers who are not as accepted socially as they are.A bully is unlikely to pick on a kid who is popular and well-liked. Instead, these individuals pick on kids who are relatively unknown or socially ostracized because other kids are less likely to stand up for them.
Some bullies may come from families who have financial difficulties. They may grow up without many superficial items that other kids have so they end up bullying kids who appear to be richer than them.

, Bullies generally pick on kids who they perceive to go against the norms of the school environment. You may have different hobbies or likes than the masses and be targeted for being different.For example, if the school is big on sports and one kid performs very poorly in sports, this kid may be picked on for failing to meet the social expectation that students at that school are good in sports.
Kids who are observed as seemingly gay or lesbian are also known to be targets of bullying. At home, the bully's parents or the community may have a strong opposition to individuals with sexual orientations other than heterosexual. Therefore, parents can often model unacceptable behaviors that their children imitate at school.
Some kids are bullied because they are socially awkward. Perhaps, they have developmental delays or learning disabilities. Other kids may tease these students and refuse to allow them to join in on activities or sit with them at lunch., Since bullying exists because of an imbalance of power, it can happen in various situations, even to adults. Individuals with higher rank or better connections may engage in bullying behaviors in the workplace, selecting an employee perceived to be weaker and hitting, teasing, or intimidating this person., Children often are modeled behaviors in the home that result in bullying in schools. For instance, some children are physically or verbally abused by their parents or older siblings at home. These kids may go to school and act out those same behaviors with kids they see as weaker.Bully-victims frequently have trouble fitting in, have greater emotional problems, and feel unsafe at school.

, Even though a bully may pick on you because you are different or socially isolated, that does not mean it's about you. Bullies simply choose targets to humiliate and intimidate because they get off on this kind of behavior and it makes bullies feel better about themselves.


Being the target of bullying can be a difficult experience emotionally and mentally. It will not help your situation to internalize it and beat yourself up. Remember, it is not your fault.

"
"
Ignore the verbal bullying.,
Be aware that you may have to deal with friends or allies backing up the bully.,
Give no reaction to verbal bullying.,
Walk away.,
Treat the bully with kindness.,
Be disarming with positive comments.,
Try your best to remain civil, no matter what.,
Avoid the bully.",How to Deal With Verbal Bullying2," The problem with responding is that unless you can manage a total shutdown comment, you are simply entering the fray and making it even likelier that the bully will keep up the comments. Instead, ignore the insults the bullying person says to you. While it is definitely hard to shrug off the insults, rumors, and remarks, if you make it look like the name-calling and insults have no effect on you, the person bullying you will have little else to go on, causing that person to lose power and confidence in the results. It doesn't mean that the person won't try again, as some people are dreadfully persistent, but it does mean you buy time to get away and it looks as if you're going to be too much trouble to hassle out in future.

, In this case, the bully is the ringleader and the friends follow suit. It is typical in this case for a verbal bully to have their friends join in the ""fun"". To put a stop to this, don't even consider the friends or allies of this person, as they are the sideshow, they're weak without their ringleader. Pretend they're not even there and this will further weaken the impact of the ringleader bully.


Do not tell anything to these sidekicks in confidence when away from the main bully. They'll only use this as ammunition by running and telling the confidence to the main bully, which will then be used against you. Do not trust any of them with your personal secrets, wishes or hopes. They have lost their right to be trusted by you.

, Carry on as if you didn't hear what was said, and either continue on your way, or continue with your conversation, presentation or discussion as if you heard nothing. You will feel jumpy inside but try your best to not let that show outwardly. Bullies only hurt others so they can cause somebody to have negative feelings about themselves or their performance. Showing that the bully's words hurt you reveals that the bully found your vulnerability and will cause the bully to keep trying to exploit it. However, if you do nothing, then they will get bored and go bully someone else.


If ignoring them seems hard to do, act dumb. Simply act as if you haven't understood what was said at all, and that to try to understand it would be wasted effort.

, Instead of putting up with the hate, you can just walk away from it and try to ignore. Walking off without responding, gesturing or even sighing will make the bully think you're not worth the effort because you fail to give sufficient reaction or break down. Do this if the insults really hurts your feelings, so that you can walk away and deal with it yourself. Find a friend or a quiet, private spot to help you to calm down and cope better.

, It might be tempting to teach the bully a lesson, but it doesn't do any good. Many bullies are victims of bullying themselves, or they're being poorly treated in some way; in the workplace, they may have bought into a culture of bullying that sees them rewarded and promoted for being a bully. They are treated with hate, so that is how they treat other people, it's the only way they've learned to perceive and deal with the world. Many bullies have forgotten what kindness feels like. But if you are kind to them, they might thaw a bit, and become nicer. Of course, this isn't guaranteed but if you stick to always been nice in return, it gets harder and harder to assault you with verbal unkindness.


If they insult you or say mean things, such as ""Did you get your clothes from the dumpster?"" kindly answer and ask them for advice. The bully will be puzzled.

, Sometimes you may be able to make the bully appear small and ungracious by saying that you expected more of this person, by way of a compliment. In this case, you inform the bully that you have noticed their good points only and that you're not going to play this game of attack the vulnerabilities until one person is decimated. Some examples of how this might be done include:


""Really? I always looked up to your amazing skills to help inspire me.""
""I'm saddened to learn you'd think that ill of me. I've always admired you.""
""I've always liked your style. I'd be grateful for your suggestions.""
""You're a really cool person. I know you can see things differently if you choose to.""

, Getting aggressive might provoke them to use physical bullying or to threaten your stability in some way (such as removing you from a team, sacking you or harassing other people you care about). If you're downright rude and insulting yourself, you could get in trouble with your parents, school, workplace or club. Moreover, dealing with the insults in a civilized manner will often make the bully seem immature in comparison, especially when in the company of others. People don't like to see a civil person continuously insulted.

, There's no need to go out of your way all of the time but there's no need to put yourself in the pathway of this person either. While you're shoring up your own defenses to cope with this verbal trickster, rearrange things to keep meetings at a minimum. If you're at school, take an alternate route or catch your transportation at a different time. Or, sit somewhere different or walk/bus with friends. For those at work, don't hang out where the bully does, try to deal with coworkers you trust and keep any interactions with the bully civil and short. However, realize that avoidance cannot go on forever; once this person disrupts your life considerably, they've won through intimidation. You must resort to managing the problem in the long run, and only using avoidance as a short-term measure to buy you time to strengthen your determination and to deal with feeling upset.


If you're avoiding the bully out of fear of physical violence, don't delay in getting help. Tell someone in authority immediately so that this can be dealt with properly and swiftly.

Don't listen to the rumors that the bully says about you.,
Remind yourself that the bully is the one with the problem.,
Read about bullying and management of it.",How to Deal With Verbal Bullying3," Don't defy the rumor - it may make you sound like you're trying to cover up something. Instead, just ignore it.

, This can be so hard to remember when someone has wounded you to the core and has found that element about yourself that you feel uncertain about. However, it's so important to remember because it helps you to realize both that you are not lacking as the bully is trying to suggest and that the lack actually comes from within the bullying person. That person feels so ashamed, disappointed, angry, down or confused that it's easier for them to pick on another than to deal with the issues confronting them. This can be especially the case where the bully has bad role models and is emulating the poor behaviors of others and has nobody else to guide them on the straight and narrow. Don't blame yourself, do be as compassionate as you can be, and do protect yourself.


Realize that a bully will always place their own needs ahead of yours. This is a survival mechanism, a cry from a very hurt heart. As such, even if the bully seems nice at times, be aware that this can change swiftly. It pays to stay neutral and polite at all times, especially in the workplace or social group contexts.
Bullies often have poor interpersonal skills. Having tried bullying and realizing that it works, in a weird way, they are often reluctant to let go of this bad habit.
The worldview of a bully is often rigid. This means they see things in terms of black and white, and anything that fails to fit their sense of the world is deemed odd or despicable. This can a reason behind the insults; while this does not excuse bad behavior, it may help to explain it.

, Having knowledge is a form of great power, as it helps you to realize that you're not alone and that others have dealt with bullying in effective ways. There are excellent articles available online through such sources as government, anti-bullying organizations and academic journals that will give you a range of experiences and tools that others have used to defeat the bully in their midst. Use this knowledge to your advantage and keep strong.

Hang with friends, in a group.,
Tell someone how you feel about the insulting occasion.,
Get help from people in a position to do something.",How to Deal With Verbal Bullying4," Always have your friends around you. It's much more intimidating to a bully to deal with the group than with an individual. Of course, it isn't always possible to be with your friends, so don't be surprised if the bully works out just those moments when you are alone and tries to make the most of them. In this case, resort to some of the methods suggested in the previous section, or seek help, as discussed next.

, It can be helpful to talk to a family member or close friend, as they will give you reassurance that you're a great person (you are anyway but it's nice to have someone tell you face-to-face). Even if they are not in a position to solve the problem, they can help you cope.

, Tell a teacher, school guidance counselor, trusted adult, parent, human resources officer, trusted friend, etc., if the bullying continues. You could ask if it's possible to be kept anonymous but in order to deal with this properly, a little courage will go a long way. Remember that the bully has problems that need tending too, it's not just about needing to protect yourself.


At school, ask your principal for help. He/she will most likely call whoever bullied you and confront them.

"
"
Approach them away from others.,
Tell them how you feel.,
Reverse the insult.,
Make a joke about it.,
Make them look silly.",How to Deal With People Who Make Fun of Your Appearance2," If you have tried ignoring the issue and the bully is still taunting you, you might need to address the situation head on. Go to them and ask to speak to them in private. Try to have this conversation within a day of them teasing you.Say something like “Hi, Frank. I would like to speak to you today in private at some point. Could we talk some time after lunch?’
If you are afraid of what they’ll do, have a friend nearby to intervene if necessary.

, Be open and honest and avoid being overly emotional. Though emotions are necessary in some settings, a bully will use them against you. Be direct about your feelings on their negative comments and ask them to stop.Say “Jess, every time I see you and my hair is curly, you always make a negative comment about it. I never make comments about your hair, because it is none of my business. I would appreciate if you would stop with the teasing.”

, If confronting them doesn’t work or if you prefer other solutions, try defusing their insult. If a bully feels that their words don’t affect you, they may stop the teasing altogether.

Say things like “Oh you don’t like my freckles? That’s okay because I love them! I get compliments all the time actually and there are lots of makeup tutorials of girls drawing them on now.”

, You can also try owning the insult that they throw at you. Even if you are insecure about the thing that you’re being teased for, it is still a part of you. Make a joke about it, too, and work to improve the things about yourself that you don’t like.The bully might tease you for having braces and call you names. In reply, say “Metal mouth? Yea, I guess that’s me.”

, If this person taunts you over very obvious things or about the same things each day, call them out on it. A bully who cannot come up with any new material is both not very clever and also very repetitive. Use that weakness against them to get them to leave you alone.Try saying things like “Really, Roger? You just noticed that I have glasses? I have had glasses for three years. Perhaps you need some because your vision is clearly off.”

"
"
Tell someone you trust.,
Avoid being alone.,
Spend time with friends.,
Take care of yourself.,
Report the bullying.",How to Deal With People Who Make Fun of Your Appearance3," Confide in a friend, family member, coworker, or staff person at your school. Tell them about what has been going on with you and this bully. Though it might be embarrassing for you, holding it in will only hurt you more in the long run.Go to someone like your Mom and say “Hey, can I talk to you about something? I’m having a hard time with this girl at school, but I don’t want you to call the principal. I want to deal with it on my own, but I need someone to talk to about it.”

, If you know that you will have to walk by the person who teases you or interact with them in any way, bring a friend along. Having others beside you who support you can be very encouraging. If you can’t bring a friend, then only interact with them in public or in the proximity of someone who will intervene.If you have to meet with this person, keep your office door open or meet in a public space.

, Being teased can sometimes make you feel so sad that you don’t want to be around others. However, know that isolating yourself will only make the problem worse. If you only hear the opinions of those who are mean to you, you won’t have any positive comments to counteract them. Spend time with your friends by going to the movies, going out to eat, or just chatting on the phone., Being teased can really take a toll on your self esteem. You might feel like no matter what you do to your appearance, you will still be teased for it. Remember that you are beautiful and wonderful and there isn’t a single person in the world who is just like you. Take care of your body and your mental health during this time so you can face your bully with strength.Exercise, eat healthy foods and meditate or pray daily. Be good to yourself.

, If the teasing is getting worse or violent in any way, report it immediately. Do what you have to do to protect yourself. Tell a teacher, administrator, or supervisor what is going on."

Realize that some bullies are bullied at home.,
Know that being the victim of bullying does not make it your fault.",How to Deal with Name Calling Bullies," Try not to engage in an argument or get too emotional, just tell the person what he or she is doing and that it needs to stop.A bully may try to make it seem like the name he or she is calling you is some sort of nickname and it is harmless. It is not harmless if it hurts your feeling. No one has the right to give you hurtful nicknames or dehumanize you.
For example, a bully says ""Hey, big head, you're walking too slow!"" You can respond by exercising assertiveness and say ""My name is Carlton. I'd appreciate it if you called me by my name.""Do not allow the bully to dismiss your request. You have the right to ask him or her to only call you by the name you go by. That is not unreasonable or overreactive on your part. You are not being too sensitive to not want to be called names.;
, In most cases, you do not need to interact with the bully unless you are in class or an activity with him or her. Making yourself less available to be picked on can make the bully lose interest very fast.


Even if you can’t completely stay away from this person, walking in a group or sitting near the front in your classes may deter bullying behavior.
Avoidance can work for cyberbullying, too. If a person is calling you names online, it is smart to document any behavior by printing the evidence or taking a screenshot. Then, block the bully from all your profiles so that you no longer have to make contact with the person., Don’t assume just because the bully says you are stupid that anyone believes that. If you know that is simply not true, everyone else probably does to. Often times a bully is going to pick on the most obvious thing about you that he or she thinks will bother you. Instead of taking it as an insult recognize it for what it is.


For example if the bully is calling you four eyes, brush it off since all he or she is really saying is that you happen to wear glasses. It is a fact you wear them and really nothing to be bothered by. Shrug it off and walk away. Doing this immediately takes the power away from the bully.

, Sadly, if you react in anger, the bully will probably continue and you may also end up in trouble yourself. The bully wants to push you to react, either out of anger or sadness. The reaction is the reward for all the negative behavior so avoid that if at all possible. Try these strategies to keep anger at bay.Count to 10 slowly in your head.

Breathe deeply—in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Repeat to yourself “I am the picture of calm” over and over again.
Imagine something funny happening to the bully, like a giant container of slime being poured over his or her head. Try not to laugh, just think this in your head to fend off getting mad.

, Telling an adult and asking for help is important in cases where you have tried to make it stop and it doesn’t. This is also extremely important if you feel like you are in danger.Telling just one adult should be enough. If it doesn’t seem to change things, tell someone else until you get the help you need. You can simply describe the behavior: ""Jodie has been calling me rude names during practice. It's embarrassing.""

, If a bully is calling you names, you can help eliminate the behavior by finding support. Bullying behavior tends to decrease when other kids do not support the bully.Ask your friends to walk with you to classes. Request that they ignore any name-calling, or stand up for you. If they don't play into the behavior by laughing or paying attention, the bullying may stop.

, The signs of someone being called names may include sudden social isolation, changes in school habits or even lowered self-esteem.Remember no matter how silly a name is, if it is hurting the person being called that name it is not OK and not a joke. Ignoring name-calling can lead the abused into depression and in some cases even to making a suicide attempt.

, Some people who are bullied feel like no one cares or even notices their pain. Seeing another person stand up and take notice will help the person not feel isolated and like he or she needs to keep those painful feelings secret.Children who are bullied and feel hopeless may make attempts to handle the situation on their own that have dire consequences like suicide. Ignoring any name-calling you witness could make the victim feel alone in the bullying and result in serious consequences.
Something as simple as “Hey, why don’t you leave him/her alone?” should do the job. It calls attention to the misconduct and tells the bully this person has support.

, No one needs to feel like they are weak for talking about name calling or being too sensitive. If a child comes to you to talk about a bully calling them names, listen and do not say that the words shouldn’t hurt, which diminishes his or her feelings. It is not up to you to tell anyone else how something should make him feel. The child wouldn’t come to you to talk if it wasn’t hurtful.


Reinforce that each child has the right to feel safe and respected. Model this behavior by not only encouraging the kids to talk about bullying but also by taking action to resolve the issue. You can say ""If you're being picked on at school, it's important for you to tell someone. You won't get in trouble for telling. In fact, telling someone is really brave.""

, Sometimes the biggest difference in a bully situation is made on the playground with the peer group. Positive peer pressure can go a long way to create a zero tolerance space for bullying. Encourage other students to seek out children who appear lonely and offer friendship. Having even one new friend may make a bully situation seem less serious to the person being called names.


For example, you might tell a reasonably well-liked child to team up with a child who is being bullied for an activity. When others see this person interacting with the victim, they may be more likely to befriend him or her, too.

, Being called names can do a lot to break down anyone’s self-esteem. Having a source of support in you will do wonders, but it also might help to show the child that he or she is worthy and valuable in many ways.You can encourage the child to join in activities they excel in to give them plenty of chances for positive feedback. Recognize their strengths in front of peers and show them they have a lot to be proud of.

, Bullying can be name-calling, encouraging others to not like someone by spreading rumors or even things posted online that are hurtful.Many people assume there really isn’t any harm of being bullied unless it gets physical and this simply is not true. It can be just as hurtful if not more so to be bullied by emotional abuse.
Any threat needs to be taken seriously, it is not up to you to decide if the bully will carry out the threat. If he or she says harm will come to you take that as a threat and get help.

, You can change this by walking with your chin up and shoulders back. Act brave, even if you don’t always feel that way.Being weak isn’t always about size or strength either—it can be something as simple as finding a classmate that is often alone. A bully usually does not want a lot of witnesses so just making sure you have friends around throughout the day can drive away a bully.
A bully may also pick on someone they see as an easy target if there is a low blow they can make fun of. Instead of reacting with sadness or anger towards the insults, you can either ignore the put down or if it is made as a joke laugh along. The bully will probably leave you alone if you aren’t allowing him or her to make you the punchline.

, Bullies are often abused at home. Then, they leave the home environment and take out their anger and frustration out on someone weaker like they see modeled at home.A bully taking things to a hurtful level may be the only way he or she knows how to get attention for the abuse he or she is suffering from. Being aware of possible abuse is important if adults are considering involving the parents of the bully in the solution as this can be dangerous for the bully.
All parties involved deserve to be safe and secure in their environment, this includes any child that is being called names and the bully as well. Giving the bully a safe place to express emotions is just as important as being open to talk to the victims.

, For the most part, you are being bullied for a reason that is much bigger than you are. Bullies act out for attention, out of fear or even low self-esteem.Bullies act out to gain power over someone who they see as being weak, often because they lack the self-esteem or personal power to be secure on their own. You just happen to be a victim that was available and perhaps initially gave the bully the reaction he or she was searching for.

Find effective ways to deal with comments online.",How to Deal With People Calling You Skinny1," Although it’s tempting to return the taunts, try to rise about the temptation. Returning taunts with insults of your own will only serve to escalate the situation. Do your best to remain calm.It can be helpful to count to 10 when you hear a comment about your body or weight. This can give you a moment to think and avoid snapping.
Consider three things when you hear what is perceived as a negative comment. Is the comment true? Who made the comment? Why would they make this comment?Some people may put others down due to their own insecurities. However, if the comment came from a friend or family member they may be genuinely concerned about your weight and coming from a place of support. Understanding the reasons behind a comment can taper some of the anger you may feel in regards to it.
Consider the person behind the comment. Is this person often negative? If so, try to let it go. Their comments reflect their own problems, not yours.;
, It can be hard not to lash out in frustration when getting comments about your weight. It might be helpful to think of a variety of witty comments to use in response when someone calls you skinny.


You can make quick, somewhat factual comments to combat rude remarks about your weight. If someone says something like, ""How do you stay so thin?"" or ""How can you eat that and not gain weight?"" respond with something like, ""Everyone's metabolism is different"" or ""It's just the way my body works.""You can also respond to a comment with a question. This can call attention to the inappropriate nature of such comments. For example, if someone says ""You are so skinny!"" say something like, ""Why does that matter to you?"" or ""Why do you need to comment on that?"" Vague, open-ended questions can also be helpful. Respond with something like, ""Why do so many people put value on appearance?"", The person teasing you will not expect this response, but it will certainly disarm them. It shows you are confident and uninterested in their impolite and unwanted insults.


You may feel unable to be funny on cue. Many people struggle with thinking of humorous comments in the moment. It can help to write down a list of the most common comments you get on your weight and spend some time thinking up funny responses.
It can be helpful to exaggerate the insult or comment to call attention to its inappropriate nature of the comment. If someone says something mean about your weight, say sarcastically, ""Wow, if you think my appearance is bad it's a shame you're not taking time to get to know my personality. That would give you some great material."", Sometimes, the best way to respond to unwanted comments is simply by disengaging. Try your best to ignore comments about your weight.


While it may be difficult, try not to take offense at insults. People who want to make you uncomfortable or feel bad thrive on your response. Ignoring comments will make them realize they're not getting the reaction they want. It shows you're more powerful than the aggressor.If someone continues to make aggressive comments to you even as you ignore them, remove yourself from the situation. This is sometimes the best way to deal with teasing. Simply leave the room or environment to show the teaser you do not find their comments to be acceptable.

, Teasing can sometimes get out of hand in social media forums. People may feel more bold in their teasing when it’s not face-to-face. This kind of “cyberbullying” needs to be addressed.


Don’t respond in any way to the teasing and comments. Engaging with bullies online only encourages their venom.
Use the block functions of your social media outlets and email to stop future comments and get rid of aggressors.
Keep examples of the online teasing as a screenshot or email in case you need to show someone as evidence. In rare cases, cyberbullying gets intense enough that it requires police intervention.

, But look at your glossy brunette hair. Or super-skinny guys, look at your elegant slender, tall form. Take no notice; it is just they cannot see the hidden beauty which we can.

, If someone punches you in the stomach, tell but before you go with a shake of your head,say, 'Nice muscles. But your fist is so tense. Loosen the muscles there.'

, Don't lie. Please!

, For example... Girl; ""Like that hurt?"" Boy; ""Oh, I'll punch you again to make it hurt then, poo-face."" *Punches girl's stomach.*

, Two and-a-half stone? Two-and a-half Pounds?"" That will give you time. Run away, and the bully will be surprised.

,, When some bully comes up to you in your new tough look, let them insult you once. Then say, in a tone that's got the edge of whisper, ""I hate being talked to in that way,"" and raise your fists slowly. If people surround the fight, do not look around for help. It makes you seem weak. Let them help the tough best side: you. Bully: ""And what are you going to do, chicken?"" You then say, ""Well, goodie-goodie, hang around much longer and you'll find out. The bully may back off or stay for a fight. Tips on fighting are below, and this is a dangerous subject. Make sure you have not been over-ambitious!

,


Always defend the most important parts of you: your head, neck, and jaw. Eye sockets are painful for the bully to punch. You will get a black-eye, maybe! But, keep it up.
Remember the penis (!!!) is a very painful part to hit. You may seem wrong, but it does hurt.

Get support.",How to Deal with Mean People," You may not be able to control that person’s behavior, but you can control how you respond to it. Sometimes, people are mean just to get a reaction, you can control whether they get it or not. You are in control of how you react and where the situation ends up.You also control some of the times you may interact with the mean person, while not everything is within your control you can keep your distance from social times or break times. Draw a clear boundary as to when you will not be interacting with the mean person.
If you are the type of person who tends to be very positive, you may choose to overwhelm the negative behavior with positive. Instead of avoiding the mean person go out of your way to be nice and create a better interaction.;
, There may be a deeper issue that the mean person is using negative behavior to hide. Sometimes, the biggest bully is the one that has suffered unthinkable abuse elsewhere.Meanness may be displayed through frustration, irritation, or impatience. If you spot a mean person experiencing such an emotion, you might say ""Looks like you could use a break. Why don't we take 5 minutes?"" Or, you can try, ""Is there something I can help you with?""
Taking the time to get to know the mean person may clear up some things for you. There is a chance you are taking things too personal or maybe the mean person is just misunderstood. Taking a compassionate approach can help to show the other person that you actually see the person and not just the behavior., Assertiveness means standing up for yourself and your needs while also respecting the needs of others. At some point, you might encounter a mean person who doesn't respond to compassion and you can't simply take the ""high road"". In these types of situations, it's best to be straightforward and let the person know that you will not allow yourself to be walked over.


For example, imagine you are in a school and another kid drops his tray beside yours and tells you to do dump it. You might respond in an assertive way by making eye contact, keeping your voice calm and steady and saying ""I'm not going to do that."" The other kid might constantly ask you to do it and you can simply keep repeating ""No"". He will get the message when you stand firm in your refusal., Being within proximity of a mean person often requires proper armory. You know, at some point, the individual might throw something vicious your way. Feel the emotions that come with being around such a person. Don’t push these feelings away or act as if they are irrelevant. Name them.It’s easy to dismiss your feelings but this isn’t really fair to you or the mean person. You just end up bottling things up that some point might explode.
Addressing your feelings might give insight as to why this is happening. Does your reaction fuel the fire and give the mean person more reason to pick on you? Sometimes, the mean person may target another simply because he or she gets so upset and it is comical or a power play.
Take a moment to step back and observe how the mean person interacts with others. Is the behavior only happening with you or is it how he or she generally acts?

, Care for yourself. Do a self-soothing exercise. Preparing yourself for a necessary interaction can also help to take some of the sting out of what he or she might say.


Deep breathing coupled with positive affirmations can help to calm your nerves after a run in with the mean person. Getting upset can be the exact reaction the other person is hoping for, so it is in your best interest to learn to step away from the interaction without reacting in the moment.

, This means taking the time to focus on your body, how it handles stress and a way to focus on relieving that stress through meditation or concentrated thought. Dealing with a mean person can be stressful and exhausting—this is a way to let that go.


Try a body scan exercise to release the tension. To start, you lay down on a flat surface which could be a bed or floor. If you are in the office, it can be done in your chair if it is not realistic for you to lie down. Clear your mind of everything except what you are feeling in your body. Start with the tension in the tips of your feet, first tensing up and then relaxing. After each area is tensed and then relaxed move up the body until you have completed the full body. This usually takes about 15 minutes.You can also download many relaxation videos on YouTube if you prefer to listen to something that will guide you through the process.

, When you go to confront a person who is being mean, you must come off as brave and confident. Pull your shoulders back. Lift your chin and meet the person’s eyes.


You can choose to either stand up to the behavior in a confident way or use your confidence to defy the behavior. That is up to you, but confidence is the key., Tell the person what you thought of his or her words or behavior.Many times the mean person is masking an underlying feeling with negative attention, so avoid making this a personal attack. He or she needs to know that you were upset by the behavior but not the person.

""Hey, I felt humiliated when you teased me in the meeting earlier."" Something straightforward and to the point should do the trick.
Avoid being vague, do not tell the mean person that he or she is mean for example. Saying this does not specify which action was not OK. Instead tell the mean person that the way he or she teased you in front of others at the last staff meeting was demeaning, for example. That is clear and to the point.

, Instead of simply telling the person what he or she did wrong, explain how the situation could have been handled in a more kind way.


An example might be ""The next time you have some suggestions for my work performance, can you please share them with me privately? I'd greatly appreciate that.""
Another way to redirect the situation is to ask for the help of the mean person so he or she can showcase talents instead of seeking negative attention. Letting the mean person know that you recognize the value of a key skill can start a better working relationship.
Be the first one to extend the olive branch and offer kindness, creating a friendship can help to fix a negative problem. If the mean person is able to gain positive attention, often the mean behavior will stop. , This should only be done after you have tried other approaches since it may affect the relationship long term with the other person. If this is someone you only interact with for a small bit of time every once in a while it may not be worth the extra involvement.


Bullying, for example, is against the rules in most schools and work environments. If you feel like you are the target of bullying, reach out to someone you trust who can help you put a stop to the behavior., In some cases, you cannot avoid interacting with the person, but you can keep the time you spend with him or her to a minimum. Keeping your interaction short and sweet is key.


For example, if you feel like this person has a snappy attitude each time you engage with him or her, you might try to mainly communicate via email.
When encountering a mean person face-to-face, prepare your statement ahead of time so that you can steer the conversation to a quick end. ""Hey, I'm headed to a meeting, but I wanted to check in to see how the report was progressing.""

, This is a big part of having an exit plan. If you have to ask for his or her help, do it on the way out to lunch, so you do not have time to stay for any negative feedback.Your exit strategy should be very obvious, like having your coat on and walking out the door. You are in control of this interaction and can simply walk away after the short conversation as if you are busy. Don’t give him or her enough time to be mean.
You can say something like ""Oh, well. I'm running late for my lunch break. I'll catch you later.""

, You may have a choice in some cases like avoiding a mean cashier at the local grocery store but in other cases like the mean person being your boss you may not be able to avoid him or her altogether. Mean people can spread their negative energy, so keeping your distance allows you to preserve a positive outlook.For those whom you cannot avoid, consider each encounter as a challenge for you to show compassion and practice patience. Just as mean people can spread negative energy, you can spread the positive.

, Being around mean people can be draining. Just as you should try to avoid a person who is mean to you, you should also make an effort to be around people who are nice and supportive. Doing so can provide you with much-needed nurturing and counteract the negative energy a mean person gives off."

Get an authority involved.",How to Deal with Intellectual Bullies As an Adult," You don’t need to respond to someone’s bullying right away, especially if it occurs on the internet. Take a moment to cool off, especially if you feel angry or upset. While you might feel inspired to respond defensively, take a few moments to decide whether that’s actually a good idea.Take some deep breaths or go for a walk to cool down.
If you’re talking to someone else or in a group, say, “I’m a bit taken aback by your comment and would rather not discuss it right now.”;
, If another adult is behaving inappropriately, ignore the behavior. If the interactions happen in-person, walk away or ignore them. If it happens online, don’t respond to rude or condescending comments. Make it clear that you are not willing to get involved in a discussion with a person who is disrespectful or aggressive.If the person eggs you on, be clear in saying, “This isn’t a discussion I want to have.”

, You might think there’s something to learn from the situation or from the person who is doing the bullying. If you choose to engage, agree to some ground rules. Say that you’d like to discuss the item further, but only through a respectful conversation. Be courteous and kind in your responses and don’t let your own emotions get the better of you.


If you’re willing to engage but only if they behave appropriately, say, “I’m only interested in talking if we can both respect each other’s knowledge and opinions.”

, If someone has said something offensive, start by taking a soft approach. Gently point out what was offensive, then offer some feedback. Keep the interaction calm and productive. Your goal is not to start a fight, but to point out something that hurt you.For example, if someone calls you a name, say, “I’m not sure why you’re making an insult, as that has nothing to do with the topic at hand and is hurtful to me. I’d like to stay on topic, please.”

, Many intellectual bullies are knowledgeable and offer good information. However, they go about their interactions in a rude or aggressive manner. If the person has said something beneficial, point it out and thank them for their feedback or opinion. You can choose to ignore their outburst or gently point it out.For example, you can say, “I appreciate your feedback on how to go forward with the project and find that helpful.”
You can also say, “Your contributions are helpful, however, please keep comments respectful.”

, Notice the things you agree upon and highlight them. Even if the person is outright disrespectful, offer some cohesion by discovering connections and discussing them. Show that you are also informed and willing to engage in a respectful debate or conversation.For example, say, “While we disagree on how to change the government, we both agree that changes need to happen.”

, If the person is expressing a strong opinion in an unpleasant way, find out a bit more from them. Ask what has influenced them to feel this way. Show curiosity and avoid stirring their defenses. Keep the focus on the issue and not on the person’s intensity or offensive remarks.For example, if someone blasts you for your political views, say, “I know we differ, but I’m curious about your beliefs and would like to know more about your stance.”

, If someone says something to you that’s rude or offensive, you have the option not to respond. The person might have a reputation for strong opinions or abrasive interactions.

Don’t let someone else’s anger ruin your day.If the interaction happens over the internet, don’t respond to the comment, especially if it’s from someone you do not know. If you do know the person, think about how your potential response may help or hurt the discussion.

, The internet makes it easy to immediately fire back a cold or aggressive remark without feeling the consequences of hurting someone’s feelings. Because you know you will likely never meet this person, you might feel more emboldened to say mean or aggressive things right back to them. However, don’t make the situation worse. You don’t need to contribute to hateful or hurtful messages.


Deal with your emotions from the bullying on your own without taking it out on the other person. Remind yourself that their comments aren’t personal.

, If someone is saying something offensive, let them know how you feel. The person may not know that their comments are hurtful or offensive. Express why the comment was hurtful. Stay neutral in your words and try not to make accusations.For example, say, “I know I have different views, but it hurt my feelings when you called me stupid. This doesn’t add to the discussion and it upset me.”

, If someone is attacking you online, find a way to block contact with that person. For example, if the bullying is occurring over social media, use your privacy settings to block them from further contact. Especially if the person continually goes after you, this can stop them from contacted you.If you are a friend or contact with the person and do not want to remove that connection (say, if they’re a family member or they live in the same small town), stop following that person on social media. You will still remain connected, but you will not actively see their posts.

, If you know certain sites or forums are ripe with intellectual bullies, consider taking some time away from these sites. You might want to read news articles but not read the accompanying comments. If someone posts a controversial article, don’t immediately comment on it. Ask yourself if you want to get involved in a potentially heated discussion.For example, if you hold certain political beliefs yet your family holds different beliefs, don’t comment on articles they post as this will likely cause a stir.

, If the bullying is out of control and you feel hurt by the remarks, keep a record of the comments. If the bullying occurs over the internet, your comments or messages might be saved. If they’re not, take a screenshot with your phone to document what was said.Your documentation may be useful if you decide to take the comments to the police or proper authorities.

, If people have witnessed the bullying, ask them to support you in dealing with the actions you want to take. These might be people who have witnessed the bullying or experienced bullying from the same person. They can help you collect evidence and bring it to an authority, as well as affirm your experience. They can also help support you emotionally.Don’t feel like you have to experience this on your own. Reach out to your friends and family for support. If you want to talk about it, reach out to someone who is a good listener and talk about how you feel.

, You may wish to get someone in power or authority involved in the bullying situation. If you do this, make sure you have some evidence of the bullying. You might go to a forum moderator, or, more severely, the police. If you feel threatened by someone, don’t keep this to yourself. Make sure someone can help you.If the bullying is occurring at your workplace, alert your manager or human resource department. Even if the employee is knowledgeable and an asset at the company, it’s important that you feel safe while at work.

First, find out if they are upsetting you on purpose.,
Notice if it is a habit.,
Think about what people say to you.,
Think about if they are hurting you, or getting in your personal space.,
Think about what they do to your stuff.,
Notice if they ask you to do something that doesn't seem right.,
Understand that bullying is caused by people choosing to be bullies.",How to Deal with Bullies when You Have Down Syndrome1," Sometimes, people tease you to be silly, and don't know that you feel bad about it. Try telling them how you feel and asking them to stop. A friend will stop if you say you don't like it. A bully will not stop.

Say ""I feel sad when you _______. Please don't do it anymore.""

, Bullying is when someone treats you badly, and they do it more than once. Other times it is acting out or misbehaving, when they do something bad that they don't usually do. Misbehaving isn't really bullying, but it is still not okay.

For example, if Jordan gets upset once and pulls your hair once, this is not bullying. But it is still bad, and you can still tell an adult and ask them for help.
If Amy started pushing you and calling you names, and does it again and again, this is bullying.

, People who try to put you down or make you feel bad are bullying you. They want to hurt your feelings, and they don't stop when you ask them. This can include...

Making jokes about you that you don't like

If nobody else is doing that thing, and if they are laughing or seem excited about it, that might mean that the thing they're asking you to do isn't okay., If someone is bullying you, this is not your fault. It is the fault of the bully, because they chose to be mean. Bullying does not mean something is wrong with you. Lots of good people get bullied sometimes. It is not your fault.

Down Syndrome does not cause bullying. People with Down Syndrome don't deserve to be bullied. Bullies might choose to bully people with Down Syndrome, because they think it is easier. But they are the ones who made the choice to be mean, so it is their fault, not yours.

Support victims of bullying.,
Speak up.,
Become active in your community.One great way that you can deal with homophobic bullying is to speak out against it and participate in your local LGBT community.",How to Deal With Homophobic Bullying4," Don’t ignore bullying of any kind. You can deal with someone else being bullied because of their sexual orientation if you take action. Just knowing that someone cares and is there for them can help someone that is experiencing homophobic bullying.Hang out with the bullying victim. This may help them feel better about themselves. It can also discourage the bully from bothering them anymore.
Tell the bully to stop. You could say something like, “Bro, leave him alone. He hasn’t done anything to you.”
Immediately tell someone of authority like law enforcement, religious leaders, or teachers if the bully is threatening to physically hurt or does hurt the other person.

, If you are comfortable doing so, then say something when your friends, family, or others are saying or doing things that are homophobic.This is a good way to deal with homophobic bullying because it lets the bully know that what they are doing isn’t okay.


You could look confused and say, “I’m sorry, but what does being gay have to do with anything? No one cares about that type of stuff anymore” if you hear someone make a homophobic comment.
You don’t have to confront the bully, but you can do something like make a joke to break the tension of the moment.
For example, you might say with a laugh, “That reminds me of my grandma – talking about sexuality and stuff like that. She can be so old-fashioned. She even calls DVDs silver movies.”
This takes the pressure off of the bullying victim and expresses that homophobic bullying isn’t cool without directly confronting the bully.

, Educating people about bullying and about homosexuality can go a long way in ending homophobic bullying.


Plan an event or participate in one for International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on May 17th.Work with your school or work leaders to make sure anti-bullying policies are in-place and that people are trained to deal with issues such as homophobic bullying.

Plan ahead.Contact the reunion committee -- the group that organized the reunion -- and have them email you a full list of everyone who will be attending.,
Think about what you have to gain by confronting the bully.If you lived each day of your high school career in fear of going to school because of a bully, you might feel an increased sense of agency and power by finally confronting this demon from your past.,
Stay grounded.,
Remember you’re not in high school anymore.,
Consider how you’ve overcome (or not overcome) the bullying.",How to Deal with Former Bullies at a High School Reunion1," If the bully’s name is on it and you really don’t want to see them, there is no shame in not attending.


However, you should carefully weigh whether avoiding a former bully is more important than the chance to meet other alumni from your graduating class.
When you contact the organizing committee, thank them for their hard work in putting the reunion together.;
, However, speaking with your bully might also be anti-climatic, or lead to new feelings of frustration. Before confronting your former bully, be sure that it’s what you really want.


Seeing your personal bully again can help you contextualize both your life and the bully’s. For instance, if you see your bully has accomplished very little of value since high school, while you have accomplished a great deal, you will feel proud of yourself and take pleasure in how pitiful the bully has become.
If your bully has changed or is apologetic, you might be able to put the past behind you., Talking to or even seeing your former bully might inspire feelings of anger, sadness, embarrassment, or emotional pain. Prepare against these feelings before heading to your high school reunion by getting in the right frame of mind.


Use one positive word to describe your own attitude and behavior, and repeat it over and over again like a mantra.For instance, you might repeat “compassion” or “peaceful” over and over and picture yourself in a beautiful, green meadow by a lake. This way, you will remain calm and won’t become agitated or angry when you see the bully again, even if you only see him or her from a distance.
You could also take a big breath in, then let it out slowly through your mouth over the course of five or six seconds. Do this several times to calm your mind and reduce your heart rate.

, Seeing your bully again may make you feel like you are back in high school again. Try to remind yourself that both you and your bully have gone through many changes. Even if it has only been five years since your high school graduation, you and your bully may have both had a series of jobs, relationships, and other important experiences that shaped and changed you.


Your bully might no longer be the same person. The things your bully has experienced might have transformed them into a totally different person.
Evaluate your current stance on moral and life issues, your values, and your interpersonal relationships. How have you changed since high school? Would your current self even be bullied? Would your current self allow it?

, Bullying has many near and long-term impacts.Take time to think about how being bullied has or hasn’t impacted your life. For instance, you might:


engage in bullying yourself
be less healthy than other people your age
have clinical depression
take up smoking
feel angry
become socially withdrawn

Ask them to stop it.,
Don't be mean back to them.,
Walk towards an adult.,
Write down what happened afterward.",How to Deal with Bullies when You Have Down Syndrome2," Say ""please stop,"" ""leave me alone,"" or ""you're bothering me."" Say it lots of times if you need to. Keep repeating, and get louder if you need to, so that other people hear you. If they notice what is going on, they might help you.

You don't need to say anything fancy. Just keep repeating. This is called being a ""broken record,"" and it is a good way to deal with bullies.
Sometimes people aren't paying attention, or they are very scared of the bully. This means they might not help you right away.

, You might wonder if you should treat the bully the same way they are treating you. This is usually a bad idea. The bully wants you to fight back because they think it's fun, even though it's not fun for you. And the grown-ups might think you are a bully too.

Don't call names or be rude.
Don't push the bully.
Don't say something nasty about the bully, like telling them that they are mean (even if it's true).
Don't fight.
Keep repeating your magic words: ""please stop,"" ""leave me alone,"" and ""you're bothering me.""

, Start going towards someone who is in charge. The bully might stop if they see that a grown-up is nearby, because they don't want the grown-up to know that they are being a bully., Write down the day and time, and the facts of what happened. Keep the journal somewhere private, where bullies won't find it. If you can type it, that's better, because it's harder to get lost or stolen. You can show the journal to an adult when you need help."
"
Ask to talk to them.,
Tell the grown-up exactly what happened.,
Say how you feel, if you want to.,
Cry if you need to.,
Ask the adult for help.,
Talk to a different adult if the first adult doesn't help you.",How to Deal with Bullies when You Have Down Syndrome3," Tell them that you have something really important to tell them. It's okay if it's hard. You can tell them that it's hard. If they can't talk to you right now because they're busy, ask them when they would be able to talk to you. Here are some examples:

""I have something really important to tell you. Do you have time to talk?""
""I need to tell you about something that is happening to me. It's hard for me to talk about it, but it's important, so I want to tell you. Is now a good time?""
""I know you're busy right now preparing for Grandma visiting. I need to tell you about something important this weekend. When is a good time?""

, Give them the facts. Don't call the bully names, or they might think you are a bully too. Instead, tell them the truth. Here are some examples:

""I was painting quietly by myself, and April was painting next to me. She called me 'stupid-eye' and told me that my painting was dumb. I said I was concentrating, and asked her to please leave me alone. Then she reached over with her paintbrush and painted a big black stripe on my painting!""
""Zak likes to pinch my waist because it scares me and makes me scream. Then he laughs.""
""Corrie knows that I love dogs. So she shows me pictures of dogs that are hurt, and tells jokes about dogs being hurt. I ask her to stop and she doesn't.""

, You might be feeling sad, angry, scared, embarrassed, or lots of other different feelings. You might have many emotions at the same time. You can tell the adult how you feel about the bullying. This helps them understand you, and understand that it's important.

""I was angry and upset when April ruined my painting. I don't know what to do anymore!""
""I feel embarrassed and sad when Zak pinches me. I don't think it's funny at all.""
""I feel sad and upset when Corrie keeps telling me about dogs getting hurt. It bothers me a lot. I get really upset and I don't know how to make her stop!""

, You might feel like crying because bullying is upsetting. This is okay, and you're allowed to cry in front of an adult. They will understand, and they might help you feel better. You can cry as much as you need to., You can tell them that you don't know what to do, and ask them if they know how to make it better. Sometimes the adult will handle the bully, and sometimes they will tell a different adult who can do a better job helping. (For example, if the bully is at your job and you tell your mom, your mom might help you tell your boss.)

""I don't know what to do about this, and I'm so upset. Can you help me?""

, Some adults don't know what to do about bullying, because they get confused. A few adults don't believe people who say they are being bullied, even when the bullying is real, so you need to find a different adult who is good at listening.

Some adults think that bullying isn't real, even if it is. They might tell you that it's not a big deal, or that they can't help you. But if you're really upset, then it is a big deal. This just means that the other adult isn't very good at listening. So you need to find an adult who is a good listener.

Ooze confidence.,
When possible, travel in a group of friends.,
Be nice and stay nice.,
Ignore them.,
Confront mean girls using the divide-and-conquer approach.,
If the mean girls are relentless, causing you to become depressed or anxious, or threatening to get physical, involve your parents and the school faculty.",How to Deal With Hostile Girls," No matter how intimidated you may feel on the inside, do your best to exude confidence on the outside. Standing up straight and maintaining eye contact will send the signal that you’re not a doormat. Mean girls single out targets they deem weak, but often stay away from confident girls.;
, Mean girls tend to shy away from packs, instead focusing their attention on solo prey.

, If you’re in a class or after-school activity with a mean girl, compliment what she’s wearing or nonchalantly offer help with a math problem. If you can get one mean girl on your good side, the rest may fall in line.


Ask a parent or older sibling for advice. Almost everyone has had at least one experience with bullies.

, Mean girls thrive on reactions, so if you’re not making any headway, go into “ignore mode” and pretend you’re immune to everything they say or do. This will probably only work a few times, though. If the mean girls are really determined, ignoring them is not a long-term solution.

, Calmly talk to an influential girl one-on-one, and ask her an up-front question like, “Did I do something that made you mad?” Use “I” statements rather than “you” ones. A mean girl can easily deny anything you say about her, but she’ll have a harder time arguing against your personal feelings.


Before your conversation, rehearse your replies, imagining how you’ll firmly, but politely, stand your ground and stay confident no matter what.

, Though it may not seem like it, popular kids don’t actually run the school. Those who do run it can help put any mean girls in their place.


Try to feel pity for the mean girls. Insecure people are insecure and mean for a reason, usually not a good one, and there is probably something in their life causing them to be less-than-kind to others.

Meanness makes people look and act ugly, and you can see a side of them that is very ugly. That in itself is a reassuring fact which you can use to your advantage to bolster your sense of well-being, knowing you're not falling for the same behavior.

Don't feel obligated to engage with former bullies.Some wounds never heal.,
Observe the former bully.,
Move on with your life.Just seeing your bully, whether he/she is well-adjusted and pleasant or still a jerk, may give you a sort of catharsis.",How to Deal with Former Bullies at a High School Reunion2," If you’re preoccupied with unpleasant memories, you won’t have fun at the reunion. Instead, eat, mingle, and act normally. Cherish the opportunity you have to reconnect with old friends and classmates.Instead of focusing on the former bully, focus on the good people whose company you enjoy.

, It simply means you realize that they are not worth your time and energy.Don’t let your pride or emotions push you to confront the former bully unnecessarily.


Also keep in mind that your bully will likely not engage with you either, so not approaching your bully is nothing to worry about. Focus on reconnecting with the people you enjoyed spending time with in high school and who treated you with respect.

, If your former high school bully reaches out to you either before or during the reunion, you are under no obligation to speak with them.You don’t owe them anything, and you should not be made to feel that you do.


If a former bully tries to engage you in conversation -- even pleasant conversation -- you are perfectly within your right to excuse yourself.
You can be direct or indirect when excusing yourself. You might simply go get something to drink, or you could be direct with the former bully and say what’s on your mind.
For instance, you might say, “I’m not really interested in speaking with you because you were rotten to me when I was growing up. Good day.” Turn on your heel and walk away.

, Are they still a loudmouthed jerk? Or have they softened with age?Watch how they behave from afar.


Do they talk pleasantly with everyone? Or do they exclusively stick with their old clique? If they’re talking with everyone, they might be less combative and mean-spirited than they were back in high school.
If you can, try to pick up on a bit of their conversation as well to figure out if they've changed for the better.
If you think they are reformed, consider talking to them about your feelings.
If they seem to be unchanged and obnoxious, stay away from them.

, Even if you don’t speak to your former bully, seeing them might make it easier to accept that the past is past. After the reunion, work to address any lingering impacts the bullying may have had on you.

"
Address their bullying.The impact of bullying on teens and adolescents can last a lifetime.,
Don’t try to hurt the bully.,
Accept the former bully’s apology.In the best case scenario, your former bully will reflect on what you’ve said and realize how wrong they were.,
Leave if you feel uncomfortable.If you’re unhappy at your class reunion because of the presence or behavior of the former bully, you don’t need to stay.",How to Deal with Former Bullies at a High School Reunion3," Sometimes telling the former bully how you felt growing up in high school and/or how you still feel can help you heal old wounds.


Be honest when expressing yourself to the bully. This might be your only chance to tell them exactly what you think. Let them know that what they said and did to you was hurtful and wrong.
If you choose to unburden yourself to the former bully, don’t expect them to care. While you might hope that the former bully will repent and ask forgiveness, they might be totally unreformed. You might hear them say that the events that made such an impact on you were “No big deal” or “A long time ago.”

, Be mature when talking to them. Don’t let your former bully’s bad behavior become a license for you to sink to their level. Don’t hurl insults their way, or criticize the way they dress. It might feel good in the moment, but you’ll be disappointed in yourself later.Control your nonverbal behavior, too.Don’t roll your eyes or make a mean face at the former bully.

, As hard as it may be, you should accept their apology gracefully.Accepting an apology, especially from someone who caused you significant emotional and/or physical pain, shows strength of character.


Do not accept insincere apologies. If the bully laughingly says “Sorry about that one time I broke your jaw and left you in the hospital for two weeks,” let the bully know that what they did was very wrong and that sort of apology isn’t good enough. Say, “I see you’re still the same. Too bad.” Walk away and don’t engage with them further.

, Do what’s right for you. Bid a polite farewell to friends and acquaintances and make your exit.


Hopefully your bully has matured enough not to physically confront you, but be aware that they might be just as immature now as they were back in high school, especially if alcohol is involved. If they try to get physical with you, don’t provoke them. Just get out of there and contact the authorities.

Be assertive.Assertive communication will help you express yourself clearly and maintain self-respect; it can help you feel more positive about yourself and your abilities, also.,
Ask why.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Show through your actions.,
Avoid responding to rudeness.,
Focus on your goals.,
Keep your goals reasonable.,
Work hard on areas of challenge.,
Recognize and refute negative self-talk.,
Remain committed.,
Understand what being underestimated and criticized can do to you.,
Ask yourself why someone would underestimate you.,
Go easy on yourself.,
Avoid drawing conclusions too quickly.,
Don’t expect perfection for yourself.",How to Deal With People Who Underestimate You," This style of communication can even aid you in your own self-perception, because you are outwardly describing your thoughts and expressing how you feel. Finally, it can help other people understand you better, because you aren't keeping them in the dark and leaving them to guess about what you are thinking or feeling. If someone is underestimating you, being assertive is a great way to stop her in her tracks. Here are some tips for more assertive communication:


Use ""I"" statements. This is a great way to put your feelings out there without blaming anyone else. For example, you can say, ""I think I'm perfectly capable of dealing with these new job responsibilities"" rather than, ""You're wrong about my capabilities."" This strikes a great balance between expressing yourself while not being too grating or confrontational.
Rehearse what you want to say beforehand. Practice will make you more confident in your communications, because you know you've prepared for the situation.
Try your new skills on a small scale first. Avoid immediately going to your boss and telling him how you feel. Try being assertive with your friends, family, and peers, when it's appropriate.;
, Although you shouldn't always listen to people who underestimate you, it may be useful to hear them out when it comes to their criticisms.You may be able to use their criticism constructively, whether it's intended that way or not. If you can avoid letting the criticism injure your self-esteem, it can end up motivating you and being a valuable source of information.For example, you can say ""I hear what you're saying. Why do you think I'm not capable of doing well in this job position? I'd like to hear your views so I can improve.""
This strategy is best for people who underestimate you but aren't trying to be mean to you, such as in cases where your boss might question whether you're capable of performing a task because he's seen you fail at it before. You don't need to buy into it or agree with her about your capabilities, but you can use the criticism constructively.

, Take a few deep breaths, inhaling so that your stomach expands while your chest stays in place. This is a quick and easy way to calm yourself that requires little effort. You can do this right before responding to people who underestimate you, so that you can handle their critique of your abilities with less tension and more calm confidence.Deep breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system in your body (the “rest and digest” branch), which is in charge of helping you feel calm.

, One of the best ways to counteract critics who underestimate you is for them to see you succeed at the thing they're underestimating you on. If someone is underestimating you, try to ignore and just focus on mastery of the task you're working on. This is a great way to use their underestimation of you as motivation. Remember though that if you fall short of your mark, what matters is how you feel about it, not others.


For example, you can say ""You're certainly entitled to your opinion, but I'd rather let the outcome speak for itself, rather than let you decide whether I can do this or not.""

, If someone is really harsh in underestimating you, avoid giving her the satisfaction of a reaction.


For example, if someone tells you that you'll never amount to anything, simply ignore the comment or walk away. There's nothing to be gained from engaging with people who say this kind of thing. You can prove her wrong with your actions, but you don't need to talk to her about it. , It's easy to get swept up in the painful experience of being underestimated, but the best way to prove your critics wrong is to focus on what you want to achieve. Instead of obsessing over what someone says, use the anger or sadness as motivation to work that much harder on pursuing your interests and responsibilities.


Avoid taking it so personally that it negatively affects your performance. Focus on your own life instead, putting her critique on the back-burner. Putting your attention toward positive goals and dreams can help you be more creative and open to new ideas, which will help you prove wrong anyone who underestimates you. , One of the biggest challenges to being successful is figuring out how to set goals that are actually achievable. Often, we set goals that are, instead, unachievable. Many New Year's resolutions fall under this category, such as going to the gym every day or never making another mistake at your job. Aiming high like this can actually cause you to fall flat, because when you do fail to reach the bar, you'll likely get frustrated and give up. Setting smaller, more concrete goals can help you make progress without focusing so much on perfection.Set concrete goals such as ""walk 1 mile (1.6 km)"" or ""try to make fewer than 3 mistakes on the job per day."" Goals like these will help you feel the satisfaction of achievement while also working toward bigger things.
Reward yourself when you meet a goal. This is especially important for activities that don't involve their own immediate reward, such as writing and publishing an essay or work of fiction. Many goals have delayed rewards, which means that you might not associate them with the positive feelings you receive later on. Reward yourself immediately by having some chocolate, seeing a movie, or hanging out with friends.

, Sometimes it's best to focus on improving your weaknesses rather than on making gains in areas where you’re already competent. If someone has identified something you could legitimately improve on, take this seriously and work to become better than you were before.


For example, if you work in retail and you're amazing at customer service, but you don't feel entirely confident at the register, devote time to learning the ins and outs involved at the register.

, It's easy to sabotage ourselves with old beliefs that we carry over from when we were younger. We sometimes continue to adopt negative views we learned about ourselves from parents, siblings, peers, or someone else; sometimes we may not even be aware that we are holding these views.Examine the truth of these messages. For example, if someone told you that you're naturally not good at math, try to look for objective information that may indicate whether or not this is true. Were you bad at math before people started telling you what you're capable of? Do you really think you're incapable, or does the belief influence how you act toward math?
Counter the lie. If someone told you that you're bad at math, but you think that may not actually be true, go out and prove her wrong. Take an extracurricular math class so you can study up and become a math wiz. Alternatively, work some math lessons online or hire a private tutor. Avoid letting these kinds of messages you received earlier in life dictate how you live now.

, Even if you do make mistakes and fail at a task, avoid giving up. Errors are often inevitable and even necessary on the way to being good at something. Mistakes can lead to deeper insights about yourself and your life.Many of the world's most successful people were not instantly successful, such as Michael Jordan, Stephen King, and Albert Einstein.To stay committed to a task, keep the end goal in mind. Think about how your life or the lives of your family will be better if you succeed. Think about the people
Remind yourself that mistakes are learning opportunities, this may make you less likely to give up upon initial failure.
Make your goals explicit. Whatever you are being underestimated on, make it explicit so that it has a clear answer. Vague goals are associated with a lack of commitment.For example, if someone is underestimating you on your math skills, set specific goals for how to improve, such as solve 10 math problems from your textbook a day. This will provide a more explicit, actionable, and concrete way to remain committed when someone is underestimating you rather than something vague such as ""be good at math"".

, Being underestimated and criticized can cause us to feel badly about ourselves. The resulting sadness can close us off from seeing available options, ultimately causing our performance to suffer. Keep this in mind when you are reacting to being underestimated. If you feel like you can't handle what someone is saying and it's getting you down, respond appropriately, such as refusing to engage with her. It may seem like you should be able to control how you feel about what she says to you, but it's not always that easy., An easy way to defuse someone's criticism of you is to understand her underlying motivation for doing so. Sometimes, people believe that others can't do something in order to protect their own lack of self-confidence. If she doesn’t think she can do it, then it might make sense for her to think that you can't do it either. Be on the look out for the kind of people who belittle others because of their own feelings of inadequacy. Avoid taking it personally when you come across them and get a taste of their insecurity.

, If you have trouble not taking it personally, have some self-compassion. Perhaps you haven't had enough people believe in you in the past. Did you have a critical parent or friend who would knock you down and tell you that you couldn't achieve your goals? It's hard to recover from those kinds of experiences, but with dedication and self-compassion you can begin to believe in yourself.For example, say to yourself ""I understand why I'm hard on myself. It isn't my fault. I know I can become more compassionate toward myself.""

, Many people are quick to jump on someone's ""weaknesses"" without really observing them for a long time. Just because you make one mistake doesn't really provide that much information about whether you are bad at something. In fact, making a mistake, or otherwise doing something not that smart, is not very indicative of your abilities. The fact is, intelligent people do silly, unintelligent things all the time but unintelligent people rarely do really intelligent things; that is to say that, making a mistake is not that diagnostic of your abilities.Also, don’t make mountains out of molehills and watch for other people doing it to you as well. You may even want to say to her, for example, ""You've only seen me perform this task once or twice. I don't think you can really give a fair assessment right now.""

, If people criticize your abilities, it can be good to take this as a challenge and work toward bettering yourself, but also keep in mind that no one is perfect. There will naturally be areas in which you excel and areas that present a greater challenge to you. This doesn't mean you shouldn't try to improve, but at some point it can be helpful to accept where you're at rather than strive 24/7.


Try to find a balance between working on improving your abilities and accepting yourself the way you are. Perfection causes people to be self-absorbed and can even result in problems with anxiety or depression.To challenge perfectionism, it helps to first recognize it in yourself. Ask yourself the following questions: ""Do I have often fail to meet my own standards?"", ""Do I often get depressed, anxious, or frustrated trying to meet my standards?"", ""Has someone told me my standards are too high?"", ""Do the standards I set for myself get in the way of other parts of my life, such as my social life?"" If you answered yes to any of these questions you may have trouble with perfectionism.Fight against perfectionism by trying out positive realistic thinking. For example, when you are working on a task, try saying to yourself ""no one is perfect"" or ""I can do my best, nothing more"", or ""it's ok if not everyone likes me"".You can also try looking at the big picture as a way to challenge perfectionism. Try asking yourself ""what is the worst that can happen?"" or, ""will this still matter tomorrow? Three months from now? A year from now?"""

Talk to a trusted adult or authority figure.,
Call a bullying hotline.,
Keep a diary.,
Avoid being alone.,
Join groups based around your special interests.",How to Deal with Bullies When You're Autistic1," Bullies will try to convince you that if you ""tattle"" on them, they will make things worse for you. They may even tell you that you will get yourself in trouble. However, talking to someone who has the power to stop the bullying should always be your first course of action.Any aggressive, threatening, or violent behavior should be reported to the police immediately. If you fear for your safety or your life, call 911.
Bullies often target people who they believe won't tell on them, or who they believe they can convince not to report their behavior.
If a bully gets in trouble for their actions, they are unlikely to repeat them. You may be afraid of getting someone else in trouble, or tell yourself that what they're doing isn't really ""that bad."" However, if it's hurting you or making you feel uncomfortable, it's worth telling someone about.
Choose someone you trust, and who you know will believe you and take action on your behalf. For example, if you're getting bullied at school and you don't trust your teacher to stop the bullying, you may be able to talk to another teacher, coach, or school administrator with whom you have a closer relationship.
If you're an adult and are getting bullied at work, it may be more difficult to find someone to tell – especially if the bully is your immediate supervisor. In that situation, even telling a co-worker you trust can help, because they can go with you to present a united front.;
, Many autistic people have social anxiety or other issues that make it difficult to trust others and seek help from them. Search online for bullying hotlines in your area where you can talk to someone who will help you.People who work at bullying hotlines are professionally trained to talk to victims of bullying and help them, so you know you can trust the person who takes your call.
Even if you're calling a hotline specifically designed to take calls from autistic people, tell the person who takes your call that you are autistic. If there are any accommodations you require that will make it easier for you to talk on the phone, let them know.
If you don't want to use the phone, look for a hotline online that will allow you to submit your statement in an online form or by sending an email.

, Get yourself a special notebook for recording details about the bullying you are experiencing. As soon as possible after an incident occurs, write an entry in your diary that explains where you were, what happened, and who was there.A written record can help you establish the bully's pattern of behavior, especially if the incidents typically take place when there aren't many other people around to witness it.
If someone is bullying or harassing you online, take screen-caps of the messages or comments from the bully so you have a record of the behavior even if it's later deleted.
Share your diary with a trusted friend or family member so they can help you. It also may help to show the diary to an adult or authority figure so they understand more about what's going on.
Particularly if you have problems communicating with people, or have social anxiety issues, they may understand more about the threat you're facing by reading your diary than you could tell them yourself.

, Bullies are less likely to bother you if you are surrounded by other people. If you are in school, try to stay close to a teacher or other adult as much as possible. Bullies are much less likely to act if someone with authority is nearby.As an autistic person, you may not have a lot of friends. This can present challenges, especially if your friend has a different schedule than you do. Explain the situation to your friend and ask if they can introduce you to other people who will be with you when they are not to provide ""safety in numbers.""
Especially in a school situation, stick close by adults, even if you don't know them very well. Teachers and other adults have a responsibility to monitor student behavior, and bullies will seldom act out against their victims when an adult is present.
In a work or extra-curricular situation, try to avoid situations in which you can be isolated. For example, you might want to ask a trusted co-worker if they will go to the bathroom with you so you don't give the bully an opportunity to get you alone.

, Your special interests are a powerful tool that you can use to make friends who will appreciate your skills and knowledge in spite of your differences. These people can help protect you from bullies.Participating in a group also can enhance your self-esteem, particularly if the group revolves around something that you enjoy and have researched extensively.
If you have difficulty communicating, try to find a single person in the group who you can use as your ""point person."" Communicate to them and let them help you connect to the other people in the group.
When you make valuable contributions to the group, the members of the group will find you important and valuable. This will make them more inclined to protect you and stand up against others who might try to bully you.

Recognize the beauty in ginger hair.,
Appreciate your unique beauty.,
Identify any securities or internalized self hate you may experience.,
Research red hair.,
Question someone when they make a discriminatory joke about your hair.,
Respond unpredictably.,
Voice your opinion.,
Walk away.,
Distance yourself from discriminatory and insensitive people.,
Remind yourself of your positive traits.,
Spend time with people who make you feel better about yourself.,
Ask for support when you need it.,
Talk to an authority figure if needed.",How to Deal with Ginger Discrimination," We live in a society where people make jokes about being ginger and it's thought to be a disadvantage or something to be ashamed off, but this is simply not true. Being a certain hair color does not identify you as a person and it shouldn't be something to joke about.;
, Look in the mirror and find at least 5 good things about yourself. Maybe you have a shapely nose, freckles like stars in the sky, or hair that reminds you of firelight.

, Some people feel that their hair makes them weird or bad. If you are struggling with this, it may be worth finding a ginger mentor who can help you handle these difficult feelings.

, Learn about the DNA that makes you unique, redhead culture, and other ginger people's experiences. Learning more about people like yourself can help you feel like you belong.

, Hateful jokes are widely considered unacceptable, when said about race or skin color, but when it comes to ginger people it's a different story. Making any type of sweeping and hate-based joke should be unacceptable, as they are all forms of discrimination.

, If you are afraid to stand up for yourself, then try a less direct way of handing the bullying. Here are some tactics to surprise a bully and make it clear they are being ineffective:


Confusing kindness—Pretend that they complimented you. Smile and say ""Thanks. And I like your shoes.""
Failure to understand—Pretend to get the message mixed up, such as ""You don't like your hair? That's too bad; I think it's very pretty."" Or, pretend not to hear them and say ""What? What?"" until they give up.

, People often won't even realize that what they are saying is discriminatory, or hurting your feelings, as comments about hair aren't considered racist. Tell them your side of the story and why what they are saying is unacceptable. Helping people to understand why something they said offended you is a great way to help prevent it happening again.

, Sometimes walking away is the best option, as if you respond the wrong way to negative comments, such as saying something mean back, then the bullying is more than likely to continue.

, Even after explaining why a comment or joke someone said about your hair was cruel, some people may continue to make hurtful comments towards you. Distancing yourself from negative people is a good way to make someone realize that they are upsetting you and it could also help to lift your mood.

, If you find yourself feeling worthless or obsessing over something bad, stop. Count off 5 good things about yourself on your fingers.

, Look for friendly, positive people who treat you with respect. Focus on your relationships with them, go to them when you are sad, and have fun together.

, It's okay to feel sad, be hurt, and cry sometimes. Having someone there to listen to you and offer kind words can be incredibly helpful. Let yourself be vulnerable. If you're feeling really down, make time to talk to someone about what you're dealing with and how you feel.

, If someone keeps making fun of you, harassing you, or bullying you, then this is a serious problem.

Ignore them.,
Project confidence.,
Avoid the haters.,
Prove them wrong.",How to Deal With Being Hated1," If possible, don't even bother to engage with your haters. Bullies often feed upon the thrill of provoking a reaction. Quite often, haters are trying to validate themselves by making you feel bad. This can spiral into a vicious circle where the hater insults you, you react, and the hater reacts to your reaction.Bullies are a special type of hater. For someone to be a bully, their actions must be repetitive and there must be some type of power imbalance involved.While all bullies are haters, not all haters are bullies. For example, your little brother can call you names without being a bully, since you're probably bigger and stronger than he is. Likewise, if a classmate says one nasty thing to you, then she isn't a bully. In general, passive methods are better when dealing with bullies, while confrontation may be best to address other kinds of haters.
If your hater is annoying you in class, pretend you can't hear him or her. If your hater provokes you or tries to get your attention, do not respond in any way.
Remember that ignoring hate is not best in all circumstances. If the person who hates you starts to physically or verbally assault you, it is best to get other people, especially an authority figure like a teacher or work supervisor, involved.;
, Self-confidence is your best weapon against a hater. Laugh off insults, drop witty comebacks, and stay positive. If you don't let your confidence slip, a hater is more likely to get frustrated simply start leaving you alone.For example, if someone insults your art, take the high road. Try saying: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but art is subjective. I'm just doing my best to improve, though, so I would appreciate any constructive criticism you may have.""
If someone calls you ""weird,"" you could say: ""Maybe a little, but I like who I am. What's wrong with being weird?""
When you are walking by someone who hates you, don't look down or lean the other way. That kind of posture tells the hater that you're afraid, that you're giving the hater what he or she wants. Instead, stand up tall with your head held high.

, This does not mean that you should hide from anyone. You should never let bullies rule your life. Simply try to put yourself into situations that don't require you to interact with these haters.


When you're young, you will especially get a lot of hate from people who don't understand your interests and passions. Instead of hanging around these sorts of people, look for ways to pursue these passions outside the scope of their negativity.
If you are dealing with especially malicious haters in one of your classes, ask if you can transfer to a different one. If you are facing haters in a club or group, consider whether you can find another group that is not so negative.
If you know that a particularly nasty person is always in the same spot every day, do not go to that spot. Find a way around or ask a group of your peers to go past the spot with you.
Avoiding the haters is also a great way to boost your self-confidence. This gives you an opportunity to pursue your interests without the flood of negative thoughts.

, If your haters are saying that you can't do something, the best way to shut them up might be to show them up. Do the thing that they say you can't do, and do it well. Use their hate to fuel your drive.


For example, if your haters tell you you'll never be good at sports, you can prove them wrong by working hard. Join a team in a sport of your choice if you don't already belong to one and throw yourself into practice.
If haters think you are too scared to talk to your crush, let that motivate you into finally asking him or her out.
Be aware that proving haters wrong does not always make them stop. In some cases, your success could make the haters even more jealous. This is not a reason to keep yourself from succeeding, but don't do anything just to show them up. Live life for yourself.

Ignore the bully.,
Display confidence.,
Learn about the bully.,
Reach out to the bully's friends.",How to Deal with Bullies When You're Autistic2," Often it's easier said than done, but remember that most bullies are trying to get attention and get a reaction from you. If you deprive them of the reaction they crave, they may move on and stop bothering you.Often, a bully won't see any point in harassing you if they don't get any reaction. They won't you to be afraid of them, or to get upset as a result of their behavior.
As difficult as it can be to ignore their behavior, try your best not to show them that you are upset or afraid. Start small, making your reaction to each incident less than it was the time before. If you have problems with self-control, this smaller goal can make it easier to manage.
Don't draw attention to the fact that you are ignoring them. For example, if you stick your fingers in your ears and say loudly ""I can't hear you! I'm ignoring you!"" that is a reaction. The bully may only see it as a challenge.
When you are going to be alone, make sure you have something with you on which you can focus, such as a book or an electronic device. Directing your attention elsewhere will make it easier for you to ignore the bully.

, Use your powers of observation to study confident people carefully. Pay attention to how they stand, the tone of their voice, and how they interact with others. Then you can practice and mimic that behavior yourself.You also can get ideas on how to display confidence by reading books or watching movies or television shows that feature strong, confident characters. Watch the way the act and the things they say so you can copy them. Think about how they stand, how they hold their head, and what they do with their eyes.
Eye contact is one way to display confidence, but it can be a difficult thing for many autistic people to master. Practice in a mirror, staring your reflection deeply in the eyes. You also might practice eye contact with a friend.

, Many bullies are acting out because of difficulties or insecurities they have in their own lives. If you can find out information about your bully, you may be able to understand more about what motivates their behavior and find the best way to deal with them.Many autistic people have difficulty with empathy. Learning more about someone's background gives you more information you can use to put yourself in their shoes.
For example, suppose you find out that your bully is abused at home by an older sibling or parent. There are two possibilities at work here – the bully may be taking out their frustrations on someone else (you), or they may believe that their behavior is appropriate because they've seen adults at home acting that way.
Often bullies feel misunderstood, or may be working through difficulties of their own such as learning disabilities. By making someone else feel bad, they feel better about their own situation. However, if you can find a way to make them feel better, maybe they won't feel the need to bully you.
For example, if you find out that your bully is dyslexic and has trouble reading, you might offer to help them work on reading after school until they get more comfortable with it.

, Bullies typically have a group of friends who support and encourage their behavior. If you can convince those people to join your side against the bully, they may decide to stop targeting you.If just one of the bully's friends says something about the bully's behavior, it may be enough to get the bully to stop. Bullies tend to target people who are all alone and relatively defenseless. Getting people the bully likes on your side can help remedy the problem.
Use your observation skills to watch the bully and their friends as they interact with one another. You should be able to identify the one who seems most sympathetic, or most likely to listen to your side of the story.
Focus on the bully's actions rather than describing how they make you feel. For example, you might say to the bully's friend ""Can we talk about why your friend Suzy seems to be out to get me? If I've done something wrong to her I want to know.""
You may want to bring along a trusted friend for support. If you find talking to the person yourself difficult, see if a friend or classmate is willing to talk to them for you.

Block bullies on social media.,
Keep your social media account information safe.,
Identify locations where you are most at-risk.,
Line up alternative activities.,
Get yourself out of the situation.",How to Deal with Bullies When You're Autistic3," All social media platforms include a process by which you can block someone who is bullying you. Once you've blocked them, you will be unable to see their posts or comments when you go online.Check the privacy and security guidelines for any social media site where you have an account, particularly those you use regularly. Make sure you understand how to block someone if you need to do so.
You may want to practice the blocking instructions on a friend or family member first, so you know how they work. This can help if you have difficulty following step-by-step instructions written in text. Have the person with you so they can help you if you do something wrong.
Keep in mind that typically, the person you've blocked will not be notified that you did it. They may eventually find out when they don't get any response from you, but by then they likely will have moved on.
If you block someone for bullying behavior, let your close friends and family members know as well. They may want to block the person on their accounts as well, or avoid interacting with the person.

, Sometimes online bullies will ""hack"" your account to post abusive or threatening messages to you, or to write posts that appear to have come from you.Use an email address for social media accounts that isn't commonly known. This can keep real-life bullies from finding your social media accounts and moving their bullying online.
For example, if you have a school email address that is shared with teachers and other students, don't use it to set up your social media accounts. A bully can easily access or guess that information. Instead, create a free email account and use it only for social media.
Make sure your password is complicated enough that it can't be guessed easily, and change your passwords every few months. This will help keep bullies from getting into your accounts.

, If you've kept a diary of bullying incidents, you can use that information to narrow down the specific places where the bullying is most likely to occur. Once you know where those places are, you can take steps to avoid them.For example, suppose you walk to school every day. On a particular part of your route, there is a bully who frequently comes after you. Work with a parent or other adult to adjust your route to school so you can avoid that place.
If your bully is online, you may have to take additional steps to avoid them, such as deleting your account on the site where they bully you. Make a note of the people you want to keep in contact with (preferably who don't have the bully in their contacts) so if you start a new account you can reconnect with them. Enable strict privacy settings on your new account so the bully cannot find you again.

, If you are most likely to be bullied at certain times of day, such as during lunch or at recess (if you're in school), you often can avoid the bully by making arrangements to be somewhere else during those times.Bullies often are more likely to act during non-structured parts of the day. Building structure into those times can get you away from the bully.
For example, if a bully is harassing you during lunch time, you may be able to eat in a teacher's classroom during that time, or go to the computer lab, library, or another place where you feel safe.

, As a last resort, if nothing else has worked to eliminate the bullying, find out what you can do to move to a different location where the bully will not be present. This may involve requesting a transfer from administrative officials.If you're a student, keep in mind that changing schools can be complicated, and will require help from your parents.
Some students who face bullying at school have good results being home-schooled. Talk to your parents to find out if this arrangement could work for you.
If you're being bullied at work as an adult, you may be able to request a transfer to a different shift or department that will keep you away from the bully.
To completely remove yourself from an online bullying situation, you may have to take a break from social media. Deleting your accounts is a sure-fire way to get away from online bullying – however, it can be difficult to do if you enjoy social media because you have a hard time interacting with people face-to-face. If that's the case for you, delete your accounts and take a break for a few weeks before starting new accounts with heightened privacy.

Speak up.,
Don't be rash.,
Avoid physical violence.",How to Deal With Being Hated2," If you can't take it anymore, don't. Avoiding haters doesn't always resolve the problem. Find a moment to speak honestly with these people, and try to explain where you're coming from. Speak with each hater as a mature and conscientious equal no matter how rudely the other person has been in the past. This is especially important for passive haters who may not insult you directly.


Try telling your hater: ""I've been getting a lot of negative energy from you recently, and I'd appreciate it if you kept those thoughts to yourself. It's childish, and I don't want to have to deal with this anymore.""
Try to understand why your hater is acting this way. Ask him or her: ""Have I done something to personally wrong you? You seem to be taking a lot of negativity out on me, and I don't understand why.""

, Haters feed on your emotions. If you respond quickly and emotionally, there's a good chance that you won't be able to make a strong point. If you lash out, you will only give them more reason to make fun of you. Do not let your words be clouded by anger and frustration. Give yourself the time to cool down before you respond.

, Resolve conflict with measured words and confident maturity. If hatred is fire, be like water and extinguish it. Be cool and collected. Fighting fire with fire doesn't work.


While you should never start a fight, don't let a hater hurt you. Learn self-defense and protect yourself. Turn your attacker's strength against him or her.

Don't respond to trolls.,
Protect your privacy.,
Tell someone if you feel threatened.,
Take criticism gracefully.",How to Deal With Being Hated3," Haters you run into online can sometimes be even more persistent than the ones you see every day. However, remember that their motivations are usually the same: they're looking for a reaction from you. Luckily there are many ways of shutting down cyberbullies.


Block harassers.Most online platforms allow you to block communication from certain users. Use this feature to keep your hater from contacting you. On many forums, this feature will even hide his or her public posts from view to keep them from ruining your day.
Check the rules of the game or website. Most prohibit trolling, threats, and other inflammatory communications. Instead of responding to such attacks, report them to a moderator.

, Don't use your real name outside of Facebook and professional websites. This is especially important if you have a unique name that can easily tracked through a search engine. Use a nickname when playing games and posting on forums. Consider using different nicknames to keep dedicated trolls from following you to multiple websites.


Always remember that anything you put on the Internet can potentially be accessed forever. Even if you think a forum is private or you delete something, a hater can easily download or screenshot it for later use. Think before you post.
Especially if you are a minor, be extremely careful what type of information you give out online. Don't post things that could tip a stalker off to your home address or typical daily schedule.

, If a hater goes from petty insults to direct threats, then simply ignoring them may not be enough. If this happens to you, tell someone you trust. If you're a minor, be sure to tell a parent or guardian.


Don't delete anything. Although you may be tempted to make these hurtful words disappear, it's better keep them. Save all emails, messages, and chat logs. Certain types of cyberbullying are illegal. If things escalate to where authorities need to get involved, you will need to have proof of what happened., If you run a business, you are likely to get some negative reviews online. The anonymity of the Internet can encourage disgruntled people to speak much more harshly than they would to your face. Don't let their words destroy your confidence, but do consider them carefully. Just because something is said in a negative way doesn't mean it's wrong. It's better to think of this type of ""hater"" as a harsh critic instead. The same thing goes if you are a writer or artist and post your work online. Nasty comments like these are distinct from harassment and should be dealt with very differently.


Try reaching out to critics with personalized comments. Be empathetic, logical, and polite. Offer solutions. Try not to respond out of anger with poorly-thought-out words.Consider not engaging at all. It's hard to please everyone, and it's hard to meaningfully connect with someone over a comment board. This is especially true when a person has a habit of making hateful remarks. This is the nature of having an online presence. Some people may hate you for the very things that others love."

Maintain perspective.,
Remember that the experience is temporary.,
Forgive the haters.",How to Deal With Being Hated4," These haters may be incredibly annoying right now, and they may even be making your life miserable, but think about how much that really matters. Odds are that before you know it, you'll be in a completely different headspace. Life is change, by its very nature. Do not let these haters dominate your life when they can be a minor unpleasant aspect of it., Think about how long you'll have to deal with these haters. Imagine yourself in five years. Consider where you want to go and what you want to do. Ask yourself whether these haters will still be a part of your life then.Odds are, you know your haters through school. There's a good chance that, after a few years, you'll never have to see these haters again. Persevere until then.


If these haters will still be a part of your life in five years, ask yourself what you can do to change that. Can you change schools? Can you change yourself? Can you confront them now and take care of the problem?
If the haters will not be a part of your life in five years, think about why. Perhaps you're going away to college, or you're switching to a different job, or you're shifting your social circle. Is there any way you can make this transition happen sooner?

, Understand that hatred reflects back upon the one who spreads it. These people are likely not hating on you because of any wrongness or deficiency on your part. Odds are that on some level, they are uncomfortable with their own identities. Some people even act hatefully because they are jealous, or because they don't stop to think about how their words impact others. Find the empathy to open your heart.If you forgive your haters, you may find that their words no longer bother you. Try to understand where they're coming from. Expand your awareness beyond your own experience and your own insecurities.Do not mistake belittlement for forgiveness. Avoid telling yourself that these haters are just stupid, or petty, or small-minded even if these things are true. Remind yourself that even haters are human beings with their own thoughts and feelings.

Avoid a strong reaction.,
Ignore the bully.,
Practice effective responses.,
Avoid running into a bully when you’re alone.",How to Deal With Bullies as a Teenager1," Most bullies want to get a rise out of you and show that they can manipulate your emotions.

You don’t have to pretend that nothing is happening, but make an effort to keep cool.Take deep breaths. If you feel yourself getting upset, breathe slowly and count to ten. Try to be present and calm by noticing your breath and your surroundings.Avoid passively accepting the bullying or the bully might think that they can get away with it. You can demonstrate to the bully that their behavior is unacceptable without getting into a confrontation.;
, Walking away or ignoring rude comments on social media is not always easy, especially when peers encourage you to retaliate. Instead, ignore the bullying to show that you don’t care what people think of you. By walking away or ignoring rude texts you are showing the bully that you are unaffected by their actions.Stand tall. If you walk away, do so with confidence. Keep your chin up and stand straight. This type of body language gives the appearance that you are a confident person.
Seek safety. When you walk away from a bully, go in the direction of safety. Walk towards a teacher’s classroom, a group of friends, or to a business where the owners know you., Sometimes walking away just isn’t enough. It is sometimes appropriate to let the bully know that you do not care for their words or actions. Remember to respond in a calm, firm, and neutral tone. You don’t want to get into a verbal or physical fight. Simply state your piece and walk away.


Try practicing a few responses with a trusted friend or family member. You can even stand in front of the mirror and practice a strong facial expression.For example, you might say, “I don’t appreciate that,” or “Stop talking about me like that.”Use humor. If you feel comfortable doing so, use humor to highlight how ridiculous the bullying behavior is. Only do this if it feels right in the moment. Try chuckling and saying, “Wow, you really think you’re funny.”, If you are in physical danger, avoid the bully at all costs. Your safety is most important. In the event that you do encounter the bully, do everything possible to protect yourself.Stick with friends. If you and the bully attend the same school, make sure you walk the hallways with friends. Find a buddy to go home with and avoid problems on your way home.

If you are dealing with some mean girls on a daily basis, then it is important to practice self-soothing on a daily basis as well. You can do this by:



Engaging in a favorite hobby. Make time for one of your favorite hobbies after school, such as drawing, knitting, playing an instrument, or writing. Whatever you enjoy doing, make sure that you set aside some time to do it.

Pampering yourself. Another way to help yourself feel better is to do nice things for your body, such as taking a relaxing bath, giving yourself a manicure or pedicure, or doing some self-massage to ease tension in your muscles.

Practicing relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques can help you to relax and feel better as well.

If you are disappointed about these girls being mean to you, then it is important to deal with your disappointment in a healthy way. Some things that you can do include:Managing your emotions. It is important to stay calm and to avoid letting your emotions take over. Try doing something to express your emotions, such as writing in a journal or talking with a parent or school counselor.

Not taking their mean behavior personally. Remember that when someone is mean to you, it is their issue and not yours. You didn’t do anything to cause someone to be mean to you.

Reflecting on your expectations. Taking a moment to reflect on what you thought might happen and how realistic it was can also be helpful. For example, did you expect everyone to want to be your best friend? If so, then this is not a realistic expectation.

Thinking realistically about how this might impact your life. Consider what kind of impact this experience might have on your life as a whole. For example, you might determine that some girls being mean to you is not going stop you from achieving your life goals, such as becoming a veterinarian. It is just a temporary issue.

Looking for a new solution. It is also important to look for different ways to approach this situation to head off more disappointment. For example, it might be easier to expect these girls to be mean and to just prepare yourself for those encounters, rather than expecting them to suddenly be nice to you.

, When people are mean to you, it can affect your thoughts and cause you to beat yourself up sometimes. However, it is important to challenge these unhelpful and unrealistic thoughts. Work on recognizing unhelpful and unrealistic thoughts so that you can reframe them.


For example, if you find yourself thinking, “Nobody likes me!” then you might ask yourself, is this realistic? What is my evidence for this thought?After answering these questions, you might determine that the thought is not actually realistic.
Then, talk back to yourself and reframe this thought into something more realistic. You might respond to yourself, “Well, that is not true. There are plenty of people who like me a lot, such as my mom, my teacher, my best friend, and my grandparents.”

, The best response to mean girl is lack of interest. If she doesn't think she can bug you, she'll stop trying. Put your bored face on when a mean girl is bugging you.


If she says something mean in passing, act like you didn't hear her, or just roll your eyes and say nothing.
Shut down mean comments with some bored sarcasm: ""That's fascinating, Jeannette. You have so many…opinions.""

, If the mean girls says something that is obviously an insult, call her out. Say ""That's mean,"" or ""I don't like it when you speak to me like that.""


Act confident. Even if you don't feel confident, act it. Take a deep breath and sit up straight. Remind yourself that nobody deserves to speak to you cruelly.
Speak loud and clear, neither whispering or yelling: ""I don't need your negativity.""
Maintain eye contact when you speak to her. This will help to make you seem more confident, which will help to send the message that you will not put up with this kind of talk.

, Keep a record of all instances of teasing, cyberbullying, physical aggression, and insults. If the mean girl gets more aggressive, or never lets up, you'll have proof that her cruelty is a pattern.


Write down the date, the time, the location, what was said or done, and who might have heard it.
Take screenshots of mean texts and emails.

If you're afraid your parents will take away your phone or computer, explain to them that you were afraid to tell them because you thought they'd take your devices away.

, If you're being bullied online, block any of the commenters who say unkind things to you. You can make most social media sites friends-only. Don't be friends with the people who are unkind to you.If they give you a hard time about it, say ""Oh, I decided I only want to follow close friends. There's so much extra stuff I don't care about on that website!""
There are a few different ways to block someone on Facebook, such as using your privacy settings menu, going to the person’s page and using the dropdown menu, or using your mobile app. You can also block someone on Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Snapchat.

, Avoid talking to, sitting near, or otherwise engaging with mean girls. If you have to talk to them, act uninterested and exit the conversation as quickly as possible. Avoid them in the halls, or ask friends to walk with you.You don't have to hide, but do try to stay out of their path. You can't be the target if you're not in their sight.

, You'll be a less vulnerable target if you are with friends. You'll also feel better if you have supportive company after a nasty incident. Tell your friends you're having trouble with mean girls, and tell them it would mean a lot to you if they looked out for you.Ask friends to walk with you in between classes.
Make friends with people in each of your classes, and make a point of always sitting with them.
When something unpleasant happens, tell your friends. If they're true friends, they’ll sympathize and support you.

, Have a few places you know you can go if you're being bothered in the hall, at lunch, or before and after school. You can always duck into the principal's office or the nurse's office, but think of other spots as well.


If you have any teachers who keep their rooms open at lunch, or if you can join clubs that meet at lunch, you can seek refuge there.
Check out the rooms that are open to students outside of the main areas, and try hanging out there instead. Your school might have a gym, auditorium, or courtyard that you can hang out in outside the main gathering places.

, If you are new to a school or if you just don't have many friends, consider joining a team or a club. What are some of the most involved groups on your campus that don't have any bullies? Consider joining a sports team that meets often, an artistic extracurricular community that involves lots of work (like theater, choir, or a literary journal), or any other groups that interest you., Mean girls might imply that there is something wrong with you, which may either nag at you or push you into insulting yourself. Act like you aren't interested when a mean girl is picking on you. Don't put yourself down as a way of ""agreeing"" with them, or showing that you don't care about insults. It will just encourage them.


For instance, if she says ""You must love that shirt! You wear it like, every day! You don't even need to spend money on new clothes, because you have like, a favorite same outfit, right?"" avoid responding.
Good responses might include irony: ""You sure are interested in my shirt,"" ironic silence (you can raise your eyebrows and smile), or a blunt factual statement: ""I do like this shirt."" Then turn and talk to someone else.
Avoid questions or comments that show interest in what she's saying: ""Do you mean I wear it to much? Are you saying I'm too poor to buy new clothes? Do you hate my shirt?""

, If you participate in the meanness, you'll end up feeling terrible, and you'll probably just give them more material to tease you with. Besides, mean girls practice all the time—if you sink to their level, they'll dominate. Rise above, and they won't be able to get a satisfactory response from you., Don't believe the bullies. Mean girls exaggerate, make things up, and take a negative view of even the most positive things. Remind yourself every day that you are great.


Do things that make you feel good about yourself. Think of anything that makes you happy, and do it more: this might include hanging out with certain friends, wearing the outfits you like the best, developing your talents, and spending time alone with nothing scheduled.

, You may long for a mean girl to like you, but this isn't the way out. Mean girls are meanest to their friends. If she thinks you want her approval, she'll use it against you. It's better to build your own life and not think about her.


When you think about the mean girl, turn your attention to something else instead—someone nice, or an activity you enjoy, or an event you have coming up.

Talk to someone you trust.",How to Deal With Being Bullied," Sometimes removing yourself from the possibility of a run-in with a bully can help avoid these negative situations entirely. Try taking a different route when leaving class, increasing your privacy online, or making sure you’re never alone with the bully. Also, try to sit away from them in class and in the cafeteria, if possible.


Sit with a group of friends when possible. Some bullies may be less likely to antagonize you when you are surrounded by others.
Let your teacher know what is going on and ask for their help to find a solution to avoid hallway encounters.;
, The bully is looking to control you by forcing you to respond to their negativity. Giving in can feel like a victory to them. Don’t allow a bully to influence you so much that you become a bully yourself or that you behave in ways that you will regret.


Take a moment to step back from the situation emotionally. Count to ten in your head if you need to in order to calm down and prevent reacting negatively, then walk away.
For instance, if the bully says something negative to you about your glasses, you can say something like “Oh wow, I’m sorry you don’t like them because these are my favorite pair! I wear them almost every day.”
If the bully makes a sarcastic, fake compliment, thank them. This will throw them off as well.

, Write down everything. Record what happened: when, where, how, and who was there. Write it in your journal or diary. This is important if you want to have a logical conversation with the bully or be able to demonstrate to an authority figure what has been happening., When possible, walk everywhere with a friend or two. The bully may find it easy to bully you when you are alone, but it is more difficult if you are surrounded with friends. Your friends can help insulate you from the bully and prevent any physical or verbal attacks., Sometimes, you may be targeted because the bully may want something that you have. You could be wearing expensive jewelry or carry around more money than the average person. If the bully has talked about taking these items in the past or has actually taken them, limit or eliminate wearing or carrying valuable items on you. This way, the bully will be unable to take your things.If a bully ever takes anything that belongs to you, report it to a teacher immediately.

, Though you will want to manage the bullying in the most mature and calm way possible, you should not allow others to treat you unkindly. A bully is looking for someone they can push around, so don’t be that person. A bully is more likely to show kindness to someone that they respect, so stick up for yourself and show them you won’t allow them to treat you badly.Say something like “It’s not okay to talk to me that way. Do not talk to me again.”
Redirect the focus away from the insult and onto the attacker, without bullying back, with a brief response such as ""Why do you say that?""

, Come up with some responses and practice saying them in the mirror. Planning a response will help you be ready and know what to do when you encounter the bully. Do some role playing of the kinds of situations that might come arise, like having to interact with them at lunch. It can be helpful to visualize yourself saying or doing what you plan. That way you won't forget in the heat of the moment and it can help you feel more confident.For example, if a bully says hurtful things, think of how you will respond. You may choose to assert yourself, ignore them, or walk away.
If your emotions are running high when the bully is not around, it may be time to get some extra help. Consider talking to a trusted friend or adult.

, This helps the bully understand what is okay and what is not. Part of working out a bullying relationship is setting these limits with them. Being verbally assertive helps communicate these boundaries and making these limits clear and plain can help change the conscience of both the bully and others watching.Assert yourself with words such as: “Please stop that.” “It’s my turn.” “Please don’t touch.” “It’s not okay to do that.”Report the bullying formally to a teacher or administrator.

, Cancel out something hateful that a bully says with something uplifting. This will throw the bully off of their typical bullying routine as they are not likely to have ever experienced this kind of positivity after they say something mean. If they find that their bullying is unsuccessful in making you feel bad, they will likely retreat from you and the situation., Though you are likely hoping to end this bullying on your own and probably don’t want to get anyone into trouble, your peace and happiness is much more important. If you feel fear of the bully, you should go to an adult and they will be able to help you address the issue or perhaps even address it for you.Consider going to your teacher and saying “Hey, I wanted you to know that Marcus has been bullying me and I tried to ignore it for a while, but now it’s really bothering me.”
You can go to your parents, as well. Explain what’s going on and ask for their help and advice.

, If the bully attacks you physically, it may be necessary for you to fight them to prevent harm to yourself. Though you should never initiate the first hit, you should not allow yourself to be beat up, either. Protect yourself at all costs. If possible, restrain the bully and then get out of the situation.Avoid hitting the bully in the face unless necessary. Hit instead in the chest, shoulders, or shins.
Never use a weapon.

, Bullies are often looking for an emotional response from their victims, so it helps if you avoid bringing emotion when and if you do respond to them. You can protect your feelings from hurtful insults by ignoring the unkindness or by using positive self-talk or by walking away from the situation.Breathe deeply. Deep breathing can help you maintain your cool in tense situations. Breathe deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth.
Another way to remain calm is to reflect back on a time when you felt happy or at peace. It can be helpful to think back on a recent vacation or moment with friends to recenter yourself back to happiness.

, Often times, a bully is hurling so much meanness at you that it can be difficult to think positively about yourself. It is important that you don’t let yourself get caught up in the message of the bully and that instead you develop positive messages about yourself.


Sometimes it can be difficult to come up with positive things about yourself. Start by asking yourself what you are really good at, or what your friends think is your best quality.
For instance, if a bully tells you that you are dumb, try looking in the mirror at yourself every morning and night and repeating something like “I am smart. I am strong. I am worthy.” Tell yourself this repeatedly until you begin to acknowledge that it is true.
Remember that the message of the bully is an opinion. How you feel about yourself is more important.
Meditate in the mornings and at night before work or school. Meditate on principles of positivity and gratefulness. Make a list of things that you are grateful for, or a list of all the things that are going well. These messages will give you strength as you start your day.

, Though the bully may count for one interaction in your daily life, make sure that they are not the only one. Surround yourself with positive and affirming people who will lift you up so much that the bullying will begin to affect you less and less.


Seek community at church, with your current friends, with family, and with others that you trust and who love you. You never know if someone you speak to has been bullied before and may be able to give you advice on how to handle it with grace, respect, and assertiveness.

, Being kind to others is intertwined with showing kindness to yourself. Take time to yourself when you are alone to do things that you enjoy like reading, watching films, or exercising. These things can often get the bullying off of your mind and help transport you back to a place of joy and positivity, despite the bully’s actions.


Remember that you can’t help others unless you are good to yourself first.
Take a nice hot bath when you get home each day.

, You may find the the bully can overwhelm you. If you feel that you are becoming depressed, seek out help from your family and friends. You may find it necessary to seek the help of a therapist. There is no stigma in reaching out for help when you need it!

Remember you are not alone.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Deal With an Annoying Boy," For example, write down what he is doing that makes you frustrated. Some of his behaviors could hurt your feelings. For example, does he call you names? Other behaviors might be pesky but are not hurting you. For instance, does he constantly ask you to do things with him? For either type of behavior, there are ways to help.;
, Harassment is when someone behaves in a way that makes you feel distressed, humiliated, and/or threatened. Examples of harassment include unwanted phone calls, text messages, letters, emails or visits. Stalking, verbal abuse and threats, and using animals to frighten you are also forms of harassment.If the boy is harassing you, physically hurting you in any way (e.g. pulling your hair, throwing things at you), or making you feel badly about yourself, tell a trusted adult immediately. If no adult is available and you feel in danger, call the police.
Peer-on-peer harassment that is related to your race or disability is illegal. Sexual harassment is also against the law.You should discuss these forms of harassment with a teacher immediately.

, Has he only annoyed you once? Is he teasing you constantly? If the behavior is ongoing and causing you distress, seek help from an adult. Repeated harassment can lead to depression and anxiety, losing sleep, and lower grades at school., The boy could be trying to hurt your feelings. He could be jealous of you. He also might want to be your friend. Although it seems odd that he would annoy you for that reason, perhaps he does not know how to approach you. If he is your brother, he might miss spending time with you. Some boys also think making fun of you is funny. They expect that you will find their behavior to be a good joke.Ask yourself these questions:


Do I want to be his friend? If so, think about ways to interact with him more positively.
Is he mean to other people around me? If he is mean to others or annoys them intentionally, he might be a bully. In this case, talking to your teacher is a good idea.
Has your relationship changed? This is often the case with little brothers. Did you use to spend time with him? Have you stopped now? Could he be feeling left out?

, If you feel safe doing so, ask the boy why he is bothering you. Maybe he does not realize he is annoying you. Then you can ask him nicely to change his behavior. If he wants to be around you all the time, tell him politely that you are not interested in his company. Be kind but firm. If he is unwilling to speak to you, talk to a teacher or another adult about his behavior.


For example, in dealing with a pesky boy, you could say: ""Hi, Dylan. Why are you always throwing paper balls at me? It distracts me from doing my homework. Please stop. If you need something from me, please ask me nicely.""
If there is a boy who wants to be your friend but you don't like him, you could say: ""Hi, William. I appreciate the fact that you want to hang out with me. I think you are a nice person but our interests don't match well. Please stop calling my house every day.""
If the boy is your brother, he likely looks up to you. You and he will have a relationship the rest of your lives. Schedule time to hang out on a specific day. Ask him, though, to respect your need for time alone or with your friends. By showing him you care, he will less likely annoy you at other times. You could say, ""Hi, Logan. I love you very much. I need some time alone, though. Can we plan to take a bike ride on Saturday morning?""
You do not have to play or be friends with anyone. You are free to choose your friends and others must respect that.

, If you have tried talking to the boy and he will not stop his behavior, ignore him. Unless his actions are hurting you or causing you distress, this can be a good alternative. If you no longer react to his behavior, he might stop.

, Perhaps your friend has an idea as to why the boy bugs you. He or she might be able to talk to the boy for you. Your friend also can stand up for you to the boy. If the boy sees that others recognize his behavior, he might be more willing to stop. In this case, positive peer pressure can be effective.

, If the boy’s behavior is bothering you, tell a trusted adult. Your teacher or parent can help you find a solution. You should tell them when you are uncomfortable at school, at home, or in your neighborhood.

, Many children who are annoyed or harassed by others blame themselves. They think they have an internal defect that causes others to bully them. Perhaps they are shy or less likely to fight back. That does not make being picked on right.You are unique and special. No one has a right to be mean to you.

, There are friends, family members, and teachers available to help you. Additionally, forty to eighty percent of U.S. school-age children experience peer harassment at some stage. Because of this, counselors are well-equipped to help children handle these struggles.

, When facing an annoying boy, it’s a good idea to surround yourself with friends. They can take your mind off the boy. They also can act as a buffer system between you and him.

Doing this also shows that you acknowledge the offensive action and aren’t willing to let it happen., To avoid starting the conversation with your sibling being defensive, make sure to leave the word “bully” out of your vocabulary during the talk. Instead, simply describe how you feel when your siblings says something or acts in a bully-type manner. Try to maintain a calm, non-accusatory tone to try to keep the conversation productive and non-heated.


For example, you could say, “When you put me down, it really hurts my feelings. I would appreciate it if you could stop saying negative comments to me.” They may become upset at first, but hopefully after they think about it, they will understand and sympathize with how you feel and stop.Keep in mind that this does not have to be a long drawn-out conversation. Keep it brief and then move on. Allow your sibling some time to process what you have said.

, Bullies tend to pick one subject and use that as their “go-to” when they criticize. This allows you to plan an effective response to what they say. Once you speak up when they misbehave, they will likely back down.


For instance, if they tend to pick on you because of the career path you’ve chosen, you can say, “I do something I enjoy. I’m sorry you don’t like it, but this is what I’ve decided to do, and I’m going to keep doing it.” Practice your response several times so that you are authoritative when it comes time to say it., Ask your sibling to attend a therapy session with you. Going to a counselor may help you and your bully figure out why the hurtful behavior occurs. It may be difficult to encourage them to go, but you may be pleasantly surprised if they agree.


To get them to go with you say, “It’s no secret that you and I don’t get along very well, but I would like to change that. I think if we went to a family counselor, we may be able to work through our issues and have a good relationship.”"

Take assertiveness training.,
Stop blaming yourself.,
Perform self-care.,
Leave the relationship.",How to Deal with Adult Sibling Bullying3," If you’re uncomfortable standing up for yourself, a class on assertiveness may help. This type of training can increase your self-esteem and help you assert yourself in a non-hostile, authoritative manner. In addition to helping you with your relationship with your sibling, it can also improve your assertiveness in other areas of your life, such as with your job, other family members, and friends.


A quick Internet search can inform you of any assertiveness training classes in your area. If you aren’t able to find any locally, you may be able to find one online.You can also work with a counselor to develop your assertiveness.

, You didn’t ask to be bullied. Also, you probably didn’t do anything to illicit this type of behavior. Remember, you’re not the problem here; it’s likely because of issues the bully is going through.When you find yourself being self-defeating, recite a positive affirmation, such as “I welcome positive, uplifting relationships into my life” or “I try my best to be a great sibling.”

, Being the victim of bullying is stressful. The constant stress can cause both emotional and physical problems. You owe it to yourself to do what you can to relieve this turmoil.


Often, physical activities are just what you need to remove the stress from your body. You may find that meditation, yoga, running, or another type of exercise can help. The results you see may also improve your self-esteem in the process.Taking good care of yourself in other ways, such as by eating healthy foods and maintaining good hygiene, may also help to improve your self-esteem and make it easier to withstand the bullying.

, Despite your best efforts, you may not be able to make the relationship work. If you find that trying to stay only makes you feel worse or isn’t healthy, it may be time to move on. Accept that you can’t change the relationship, and distance yourself from the sibling.


Removing your sibling from your life is a drastic step. Ensure you have thought through your decision and that this is what you really want to do before you make the move. This may mean that you cause tension with other family members, but if your life has become toxic because of this person, it may be exactly what you need to do.If you do decide to go this route, it is best to do so with the guidance of a therapist who can help you to manage the family dynamic changes.

Tell your parent(s) about the bullying.,
Report bullying and victimization incidents to the school.,
Talk openly about bullying.,
Don't be afraid to speak up.",How to Deal with Bullies at School1," If you are being bullied, it's very important to tell an adult first and foremost. Tell your parents the entire story. Parents are here to help and want to know what is going on with you. Your parents, moreover, may then be able to get in touch with staff at the school in order to try to stop the bullying. This is important particularly if you don't feel comfortable telling your teacher or fear retribution from the bully.
It's useful if you keep a diary of everything that happens. That way you can let your parents and other adults know about specific incidents.;
, Inform teachers, principals, and other school helpers.These individuals have the power to intervene and help stop bullying. Sometimes bullies stop as soon as a teacher finds out because they're afraid they'll get in trouble.


Teachers are especially important resources if you're being bullied. They can provide protection from bullying by letting you stay in the classroom during recess or by setting up a buddy system on your behalf.
It's important to let your school know about any bullying incidents because there may be other kids being bullied by the same person., Just talking to someone about your experience can bring you a bit of relief. Good people to talk to include a guidance counselor, sibling, or friend. They may offer some helpful solutions, but should not be approached in lieu of telling your parents or school personnel. Just talking about what you're experiencing and feeling can help you feel less alone.


Some children have reported real success from peer counseling programs at their schools. , Telling an adult is not tattling. Bullying is not a small or trivial matter; it is wrong and it helps if everyone who gets bullied or witnesses someone else being bullied speaks up.Remember that you cannot tackle bullying by yourself. No one can, not even adults. Getting help is the right thing to do when dealing with abuse, bullying, harassment, or assault.

Avoid the bully wherever possible.,
Feel good about who you are.,
Stand tall and keep your composure.,
Use the buddy-system.,
Ignore the bully if they say or do something to you.",How to Deal with Bullies at School2," Don't give him or her a chance to bully you by preventing run-ins between the two of you.Think ahead about where you usually run into the bully. Avoid those places.
Try taking a different route from your home to school and also different routes within the school itself.
Don't skip classes or go into hiding. You have a right to be at school and benefit from education.

, Ask yourself what makes you feel and look your best. Emphasize your strengths, talents, and goals.For example, do you want to be more fit? If so, maybe you decide to spend less time on the couch watching TV and more time exercising.
Feeling good about yourself will make you feel more confident and help build your self-esteem. It will also help you be more self-assured at school and perhaps less fearful of running into the person bullying you.Spend time with friends who have a positive influence. Playing sports or participating in clubs are good activities to help build positive friendships and confidence., Sometimes just acting brave is enough to stop a bully from approaching and intimidating you.By standing tall and holding your head high, you send the message that you are not to be messed with.Acting and even feeling brave is easier when you feel confident and good about yourself. It is also something you can practice. Practice walking with your head up, looking at people, and greeting anyone you know who looks back at you. Practice using a strong and assertive tone of voice (and not shouting). Remember, practice makes perfect. , If you're trying to avoid being bullied, two people are stronger than one. For example, walk with a friend or a group of friends to school, or hang out with them at recess. In other words, make sure to have friends surrounding you wherever and whenever you think you might run in to the bully.If you have a buddy, remember to be a buddy. Offer to be there for a friend if you know he or she has bully trouble. Act if you see a friend being bullied; after all, you know how hard it is to be bullied. Tell an adult, stand with your friend being bulled, and tell the bully to stop.Support those you see being being hurt with words of kindness., As much as you can, try to ignore the bully's threats. Pretend you can't hear them and try to leave the situation immediately and go to a safe place.Bullies are always looking for a reaction to their teasing. Pretending that you don't notice or care (even if you do care on the inside) may stop a bully's behavior because they are not getting the reaction they expect and want.

"
"
Recognize that you have a right not to be bullied.,
Say ""no."",
Shield your feelings.,
Don't bully back.",How to Deal with Bullies at School3," It is not your fault that you are being harassed. You, like everyone else, deserve to feel safe., Tell the bully ""No! Stop it!"" in a loud, assertive voice and then walk or run away if you feel you need to.Standing up to the bully, simply by saying ""no,"" sends a message that you are not afraid and will not accept his or her behavior. Bullies tend to go after kids who don't stick up for themselves and who they think will take their abuse and do whatever they say.
There's always strength in numbers. Kids can stand up for each other by telling a bully to stop teasing or scaring someone else, and then walk away together.

, Plan ahead. How can you stop yourself from getting angry or showing you're upset?


Try to distract yourself. Count backwards from 100, sing your favorite song inside your head, spell words backwards, etc. Keep your mind occupied until you are out of the situation so that you can moderate your feelings and not give the bully his or her desired reaction.

, Don't hit, kick, or push as a way to deal with someone bullying you or your friends.Fighting back satisfies bullies because it shows them that they can get to you.


Fighting back can also be dangerous. Someone could get hurt and you could get in trouble. It's best to stay with others, stay safe, and find the nearest adult.

Get everyone on board.,
Put words into action.,
Create greater surveillance.",How to Deal with Bullies at School4," This means getting the entire school -- teachers, administrators, and the students -- to agree to make your school a bully-free zone.Even those indirectly involved in the school, such as bus drivers, need to support and receive training on anti-bullying measures., It takes more than an assembly or a bunch of signs pronouncing a bully-free zone to truly create a bully-free environment for students.


Change how kids think about other kids. For example, creating an anti-bullying program may involve creating lesson plans whereby children learn more about other kids, especially those who come from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures, or different learning styles or abilities.Or, teachers might teach cooperation by assigning group projects, which help students learn how to compromise and assert themselves without being too demanding.Rules about bullying and its consequences should be discussed and posted publicly in the school, sent home to parents, and put in community newspapers to create a universal awareness of the issue. This will begin the process of large-scale transformation., Most bullying in schools occurs in areas that have less supervision by adults, like school buses, cafeterias, restrooms, hallways, and locker rooms.Schools need to address these areas by enhancing the monitoring of these spaces by additional adults or using enhanced security techniques including closed circuit cameras.Schools can also establish anonymous reporting tools like suggestion boxes or hotlines where students can send text messages or leave voicemails."

Understand why they are jerks.,
Avoid conflict.,
Don't be a jerk yourself.,
Be nice to the jerks.",How to Cope With Jerks at Your School1," Oftentimes, jerks and bullies treat other people badly because they have low self-esteem or because they are being treated badly by others also. While this doesn't excuse their actions, it may help you feel better to know that the bullies you're dealing with probably aren't as confident as they want you to think., You shouldn't live your life in fear of running into a jerk at school, but you'll be better off if you try to avoid interactions with negative people as much as possible. Just walk the other way when they come near.Negative people can have a seriously bad effect on your overall well-being. Studies have shown that negativity around you can reduce your productivity, which is why it's so important to steer clear of these kinds of people. Conversely, spending time with positive people will make you feel energized and optimistic., It may be tempting to pick on people who are more vulnerable than you in order to become more popular or gain a reputation for being tough, but this is a bad idea! Rise above bullying by being nice to other people, even if they are different than you. This will help you make genuine friends and it will make you feel good about yourself, so it won't matter what the jerks have to say about you.


Even if you have a tight group of friends, be open and inviting to others as well. Making people feel like they don't belong or aren't welcome in your group of friends can be just as mean as insulting them. (If you have dealt with cliques at your school, then you probably know how it feels to be excluded.)

, If you must interact with the jerks at your school, be polite. There is no reason to sink to their level, and insulting them will likely only make you more of a target for them. Show these jerks that you have no interest in letting their negative attitudes have any effect on your behavior."
"
Speak to the person privately.,
Inquire about the intent behind the insult.,
Set boundaries.,
Use humor.,
Laugh.,
Agree with the person.Bullies are typically looking for a reaction or disagreement from you to fuel their desire to cause you pain.,
Walk away and ignore the bully.,
Resist returning an insult.,
Conceal your pain from the insulter.,
Avoid internalizing the insult.,
Avoid reacting without thinking first.,
Allow yourself to be upset.,
Reflect on your reaction and response.,
Consider whether or not the insult is valid.,
Acknowledge if you are at fault and apologize.",How to Cope With Hurtful Insults," Oftentimes, it is beneficial to privately address the individual who has insulted you. Speaking privately is best to avoid the situation from escalating in front of others and to lessen the insulting person’s likeliness of becoming embarrassed or defensive. Before speaking with the individual, take a deep breath, and calmly ask the person to speak with you privately.


Once alone, let the person know that you did not appreciate his insult, and inform him of your expectations and what action you’ll take it happens again. For example, you might tell a coworker, “I felt hurt and insulted when you me stupid. I want you to speak to me in the same respectful manner as I speak to you. I’ve asked you not to call me names before. If it happens again, I’m going to file a formal complaint to HR about your harassment.”
Sometimes saying less is better. You can address the insult by briefly addressing the problem.For example, you could say, “That statement was completely uncalled for. I won’t stand for you talking to me in that manner; if it happens again I will no longer invite you to family gatherings.”;
, An effective strategy for responding to an insult is to inquire about what is actually at the heart of the insult. Do this by asking the individual what has led her to make a comment that could be potentially hurtful.Like a counselor, you are getting the individual to personally reflect on the root causes of her actions, which forces the person to accept personal responsibility for her words and actions. Be sure to focus on the actual intent behind the insult, and not the actual words that were said.For example, you might say, “Can you help me understand what is going here? What happened to cause you to want to hurt me by insulting me like?”
You could also take a guess at the underlying feeling of insult. For example, “I understand that we don’t agree on this topic and that upsets you; however, I’d prefer that you stick to the topic rather than resorting to personal insults.”

, It’s critical that you establish communication boundaries when dealing with people who resort to personal insults. Sometimes it requires directly stating what topics of conversation the person is allowed to engage you in. In addition, you might also might need to set boundaries for when the person should speak with you.If you are dealing with a coworker who tends to launch insults, you could tell him, “Sean, I am asking you very kindly to please not bring up my personal life during our staff meetings. In fact, I would prefer that we engage in professional conversation at all times here in the office.”

, Humor can oftentimes be an effective way to respond to an insult for several reasons. It weakens the insult, it lessens the tension in the situation, and it gets others on your side. Consider using humor the next time someone puts you down. You might find it appropriate to even exaggerate or extend the put down, which serves to further lessen the power of the insult.For example, if someone insulted you with the comment, “Your ears are so big,” you could offer a humorous response by saying, “Oh yes. The better to hear you with, my dear” (a reference to Little Miss Riding Hood).

, Laughing at an insult can be a very powerful response. Laughter makes the insult seem insignificant, and it also communicates that you were not hurt by the insult.Furthermore, it takes away the emotional power that the insulting person was hoping to gain from putting you down.

, Instead of giving the bully what she is looking for, give her the unexpected by agreeing with whatever she said to insult you. Just say something like, “You are so right. I couldn’t agree more,” and keep agreeing as she continues the insult. She will get bored of teasing you of you don't provide a reaction.

, The person launching the insult is probably seeking for you to engage negatively. By walking away, you are essentially ignoring the person’s insult and the individual himself.Try to walk away the next time someone says something unkind. If you want, you can provide a brief comment as you walk away.


For example, if your spouse were to say, “You are such a slob,” you response could be, “Okay,” and then walk away.

, As tempting and second-nature as it may be, avoid responding to an insult with an insult of your own. It only brings you down to the same level as the insulter. You become just as much of a problem as the person who initiated the attack.Instead of returning an insult, simply choose to ignore or even acknowledge it. This sends the message to your offender that her insult was completely insignificant and powerless.

, Nothing excites a bully more than seeing the hurt and pain that he has inflicted on his victim. Don’t give a bully the pleasure of witnessing your pain. Doing so only confirms that his insult worked just as he planned. Instead, keep a smile on your face, and tell yourself, “I will not allow this person to see my pain.”

, Chance are, the insult is really not about you but about the other person’s insecurity. Bullies will oftentimes try to make others feel bad as a way of feeling better about themselves. Remember that you are not defined by someone else’s opinion of you.If you find yourself replaying hurtful words in your mind, replace the negative words with positive thoughts or words. For example, if someone insulted you by calling you ugly, tell yourself, “I am beautiful both inside and outside,” or imagine yourself standing in the mirror wearing your best outfit.

, Regardless of how tempting it may be to blurt out the first comment that comes to mind or to quickly put up your forbidden middle finger, think before you respond.Delay your response by taking a deep breath and slowly counting down from 10 to one. This will give you enough time to be in more control of your emotions.

, It’s okay if you are upset when someone says hurtful things; feeling hurt after being insulted is natural. Be okay with truly allowing yourself to feel the hurt. It’s unhealthy to not personally acknowledge and accept when someone has hurt you. Take the alone time that you need to privately deal with your pain. Just try to avoid dwelling on it.


Don’t hesitate to talk to someone you trust if you find that you are really struggling with getting over your hurt feelings. This will help you to vocalize your feelings, and as a result, it might allow you to finally move on.

, You can respond and react to an insult in a number of different ways. For example, you might feel angry, sad, vindictive, or maybe even resentful towards the individual who insulted you. You might have responded by retaliating with an insult or by bursting into to tears. Take time to analyze why you reacted and responded in the way that you did.


If, for example, you recall that the insult made you so angry that you couldn’t think clearly, take time to reflect on why. You could ask yourself, “What caused me to feel so angry and enraged inside? Was it the embarrassment of the insult, or do I feel that the insult was unwarranted?”

, When someone insults you, it’s helpful to take time to consider a few things. Think about who the insult came from, why it happened, and whether the insult is actually true. Usually, if the insult came from someone you respect like a parent, teacher, or best friend, taking the insult into consideration makes sense. On the other hand, if you were insulted by someone who you don’t respect, it makes sense to not consider the validity of the insult.For example, if your mother said, “Stop being lazy and try keeping a job past 30 days,” take time to reflect on what she said. If in fact you are now unemployed and just quit your third job in six months, the statement is actually not an insult but the truth, though not stated in an ideal way. You can use that revealed truth for self-improvement.

, Sometimes it’s hard to admit and accept when you are deserving of someone’s hurtful words. It takes courage to admit and offer an apology when you are at fault; however, you must acknowledge and admit to your mistakes so you can be a better person.For example, your brother suffered life-threatening injuries after being in a serious car accident; when you call him two days later, he calls you a heartless human being for choosing to attend a party instead of visiting him in the hospital. You’re best bet would be saying, “I’m deeply sorry for my selfishness and not putting you first when you really needed me the most. I hope in time you will forgive me.”

Ignore them!,
Stick with your friends.,
Get involved.,
Develop your own style.,
Exude confidence.",How to Cope With Jerks at Your School2," Try your best not to let any negative comments affect you. Even if you are affected, make them think that you really don't care about their opinions.No matter how bad the jerks have hurt your feelings, try to keep your cool and avoid yelling or crying. If they get a reaction out of you, they're more likely to bully you again. If you don't seem to care, it won't be as much fun for them, so they'll probably leave you alone.
If you choose to respond at all, try saying something simple like, ""Whatever"" before walking away, to show your apathy. You can also just walk away calmly without saying anything at all.

, There is strength in numbers, so try to be with a group of friend if you know you're likely to run into some jerks. Not only will you seem less vulnerable to others when you're with friends, but you will also feel more confident., Pursue your interests by joining clubs, playing sports, and participating in activities. Don't let the possibility of having an interaction with a jerk at your school prevent you from doing something you love.Don't let cliques at your school get in your way. If a clique is dominating a certain activity, join in with confidence and let them know that you have every right to be there. If you're afraid to do this alone, try to get a friend or two to join with you.
Jerks like to prey on people who seem weak and vulnerable. By excelling at something, whether it's drama club, softball, or academics, you're showing them that you're strong and capable.
Getting involved at school is also a great way to meet new friends, which will help your confidence and give you more of a support network to ward off jerks.

, Show the jerks at your school that you don't care what they think of you by being truly unique. Instead of doing what everyone else is doing, stay true to yourself.


There are lots of way to be unique. You can express yourself with the way you dress, the music you listen to, and the activities you participate in. You can also distinguish yourself as being really smart, really fun, or really nice. Don't be ashamed of who you really are!

, This may take some work, but there are lots of simple steps you can take to feel more confident. Remind yourself every day that you are a wonderful person with a lot to offer, and that anyone who doesn't see that is not worth your time.Walk through the halls with your head held high.
Look people in the eye when you talk to them.
Pay attention to any fidgeting you may do when you get nervous, whether it's twirling your hair or moving your hands. Once you notice the behavior, do your best to stop it so that others will not notice when you are nervous.
Even if you don't feel very confident, you can still act the part! Start working on your body language and people will begin to believe you are confident even if you aren't. Before long, you'll be feeling pretty confident too.

Tell them to leave you alone.,
Stay true to yourself.,
Avoid the urge to fight.,
Report serious bullying.,
Stand up for others too.",How to Cope With Jerks at Your School3," If someone says something really mean to you, it's okay to respond in a calm and collected tone. You can say something like, ""Leave me alone"" or, ""You shouldn't talk to people like that.""Yelling at the jerk or responding with an insult will likely only make the situation worse. Your goal should be to defuse the situation while letting the jerk know, in as polite a way as possible, that you find his or her behavior unacceptable.
Maintain eye contact while talking to the jerk. This will make you seem much more assertive and self-confident.
Try reminding yourself at this moment that the jerk you are confronting is probably really insecure in all reality. Don't tell him or her you know this, but smile to yourself with the thought.

, Cliques often operate by controlling their members and threatening them with exclusion if they fail to conform to the rules of the group. If people who you think are your friends start to dictate your actions, you should seriously reconsider your relationship with these people.Having friends in multiple different circles is healthy. Real friends should be okay with you spending time with other people and pursuing a variety of interests.
If your group of friends begins to exclude others, speak up for what is right and encourage them to make new friends.
Never let your friends tell you how to act or what to believe. It's perfectly fine to disagree with your friends sometimes, and real friends will not try to change you.

, No matter how badly the jerk has pushed your buttons, you should always walk away from a fight. If the jerk asks you to fight, just say you're not interested.


Fighting is not only a poor way of managing conflicts, but it can get you into a lot of trouble. No matter who started it or what the outcome is, there is a good chance that you will get detention or get suspended from school for fighting. If you injure the other person, you could even get into trouble with the law.

, In many instances, you may be able to deal with jerks on your own without any help from your parents or teachers, but know when to ask for help. If you are being harassed, stalked, or physically harmed, you need to tell someone about it right away. Don't worry about being a ""snitch.""If you need to talk to someone about bullying, there are plenty of free crisis hotlines available. If the bullying gets so severe that you feel suicidal, call a hotline or see someone for help right away.

, Don't be a silent bystander if you see a friend or even someone you don't know being bullied by a jerk at your school. Tell the jerk to leave the other person alone and show the person being bullied that you're there for support.You can report bullying even if you are not the victim. If you are worried about someone else who is being bullied, report the situation just as you would if you were the victim. You might really be helping someone who is afraid to confront the situation or doesn't know what to do.

Get support from trusted adults.,
Develop your own social circle.,
Don’t tolerate cyberbullying.,
Laugh it off.,
Try not to be naïve.",How to Deal With Annoying Populars1," If you feel victimized and need help, don't hesitate to talk to a trusted adult for support. Find a parent or parents, a guidance counselor or teacher, or anyone else who you trust. Ask them for advice and reassurance about your particular situation, or see if they can help mediate the situation., There is safety in numbers, and popular kids will be less likely to target you if you have a circle of your own. Schools usually offer lots of different kinds of clubs and extracurricular activities. Join a club dedicated to something you’re interested in, and make your own friends who have things in common with you.Don’t just ignore the problem and don’t retaliate: these usually make the issue worse.
Without seeking revenge, find a way to show that you are confident, have your own friends, and can’t be intimidated.

, Social media can be great, but don’t let it become a source for bullying. Popular kids often use the internet to maintain their popularity by bullying others. Social media, text messages, and other platforms can take bullying from school and affect you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Never respond to a mean text message or online comment, and don’t say anything in a text that you wouldn’t say to your parent or another figure of authority — remember that it could be shown to anyone.
Know your school’s policies on cyberbullying and what resources they have for help.
It can be very serious, even a crime, if someone sets up fake profile, spreads a vicious online rumor, or threatens violence. You aren’t alone in dealing with problems like these, so do not be afraid to report something to your parents, school, or, if appropriate, law enforcement., Have a sense of humor, especially if the popular kids aren’t necessarily tormenting you but are poking fun in a less severe way. You’ll face rejection and teasing no matter how old you are. To an extent, you have to develop a thick skin and learn to shake things off.For example, maybe you told the popular clique who your crush is thinking you could trust them, and then they told that person. Act unfazed and laugh it off. You could say to your crush, ""Well, that's embarrassing, but what can I do — it’s really easy to have a crush on you!""
If your crush doesn’t return your feelings, then at least you can start getting over your crush and focus on other things — maybe even someone who’s interested in you, too.
Don’t laugh it off if you really feel threatened, and don’t go it alone if you face constant torment. Remember how important it can be to find support from others, too.

, Don’t fall into traps or let yourself be an easy target. If they find you less likely to be intimidated, the ""popular kids"" will be less likely to make fun of you. You don’t want to be paranoid all the time, but if you suspect someone is stringing you along just to make you a punchline, don’t wear your heart on your sleeve.


Be prepared for handling two-faces and backstabbers: some people will be nice to your face and talk about you behind your back. Remember that it takes time to build a friendship. Don’t become best friends with someone overnight and let them in on any secrets they might turn into rumors.

Ignore them whenever possible.,
Define the hateful behavior.,
Decide if the behavior could be labeled as bullying.,

Make a list of all the reasons you are a great person.,
Remember that you’re not meant to be friends with everyone.",How to Cope With Classmates Hating You," Are you an active member of the class or more of a peripheral member of the group? You may feel like the class does not like you if you are more of a peripheral member of the group. This means you are perhaps quiet in class and almost overlooked. If this is the case they may not be ignoring you to be mean, it might just mean they honestly forget about you.Getting out of the peripheral can be as simple as making an effort to participate more in class and making an attempt to talk to others and make new friends.
One way to make sure you are noticed is to “get big” and commit to making yourself more of a known presence in the class. This means taking a stand in group activities instead of just blending in.;
, While you may really want them to include you in their activities, it goes both ways. Getting left out of events or not getting invited to social events does not always mean the group you weren’t included in hates you. Could you have missed an open invite that they assumed everyone understood?Keep in mind most of the other students in your class are just like you, trying to fit in and make friends. Take a close look at your own behavior to make sure you aren’t being left out simply because they don’t know you want to join in.

, If you don’t have much in common with these classmates, there may not be much of a need to even be friends in class. If your classmates seem like they would be the type of friends you want, ask yourself whether you need to make more of an effort to make friends.


Sometimes being a quiet person can send signals to those around you that you do not like them. Breaking the silence of not speaking up in class does not need to start out in a huge way. You can start out by just making an effort to make small contributions to the bigger conversation. Or, you may show interest by just laughing at the right time during an animated story being told by a classmate.Examples of small additions to the conversations might include:

“I heard that too, what do you think?”
“No Way!”
“You are not kidding! He does do that!”



, You don’t need to be friends with everyone. There are going to be some groups you just don’t have a lot in common with. You could be hoping for a relationship with classmates who have different interests or nothing in common with you.


If you find that even after trying to make yourself a part of the conversation, you do not have much to say about the subjects they talk about, you may just not share any common interests with the group. There may be little need to be friends with these people outside of class., Take a moment to consider why they are acting out and know that it may have little to do with you. The best bet in this case is to refuse to engage with these kinds of students. Refrain from giving them any sort of reaction.


When other students seem to treat everyone around them in a mean manner, it can be a sign these students have underlying issues they are trying to hide. They are probably not acting mean to just you, but instead trying to hide their need to fit in with a mean attitude that pushes everyone else away. They may feel like the safest approach at school is to scare everyone off so no one can hurt them.If the bullies are acting out for attention, there's a good chance that they will leave you alone if you don’t react.

, There are a variety of behaviors that can hurt your feelings, but each one requires a different course of action. Is there an actual action being made against you like being called names or is it more of the feeling of being left out of things?


Take a look at their actions to see if they are being done to make an effort to harm you or if you are just interpreting a lack of effort on their part to include you to be mean., In order for it to be considered bullying there must be an imbalance of power, intent to harm and repetition. Bullying is a serious offense, so be sure the behavior happening to you meets the criteria before you get your classmates in trouble.While at times any mean behavior at school may be labeled as being “bullying,” not all behaviors actually add up to this. For example, if a classmate who is in the same grade level, about the same physical size and has no real power over you is bothering you, this probably isn’t bullying since there is equal power. The intimidation factor isn’t present.
Beyond the power issue there also needs to be a valid intent to harm, so if this is a classmate who just plays jokes on you but doesn’t seem to want to harm you that isn’t bullying. A classmate pulling one practical joke also lacks the repeated pattern of bullying as well.

, Explain to this person how your classmates are treating you. Ask for their advice. Be careful to keep your conversation fact-based. Tell this adult what the classmates did, how often it happens and what the outcome was. Let the friend consider why this is happening and give you advice as to how to handle the situation.Speaking to someone who is close enough to the situation to even witness what goes on may help in the event that you are misinterpreting something.

, If you think this qualifies as being bullied or feel threatened at any time, speak up. Most schools have zero tolerance for this type of behavior and have resources to help end the problem.Even if the behavior isn’t bullying, a teacher can help. Your teachers can facilitate solutions like letting you work with groups of students you may have more in common with or assisting you in becoming a bigger part of the class.

, Is the problem with just one class? If you are having a problem with one of your classes but not others, it means that some people are able to value your presence and treat your politely. Focus on the classes you have friends in and know you are liked.


One approach to fixing a class you are not enjoying is trying to network with even one person from that class outside of the classroom. If you are a quiet student is there another quiet student you can befriend and connect with?

, Calming yourself before the class can help you focus on the positive and build up your confidence to face mean classmates. You can repeat virtually any quote or phrase of your choosing.An example of a mantra: “I can make it through this hour of English. I can focus on getting my work done, so I have no homework. I will ignore the students who do not seem to like me.”

, Even the worst class is doable if you know you can exchange funny stories at lunch with your best friend. You may not get to choose who is in your class, but you do have a choice whether you carry anything negative from class beyond the classroom. Focus on your friends, family and things you enjoy.You can even vent to your friends or family about your classmates. Having this outlet outside of class can make the time in class easier.

, Keep this in mind when you are faced with hateful people. Remember if a person doesn’t know you personally, don’t take his or her opinion of you personally.Taking a look at the way the classmates you are having a problem with interact with others may also tell you it’s nothing personal. Their baseline may just be negative, and this goes for everyone. Knowing that they are harsh to everyone makes it much less personal., It could take a great load of stress and tension from you when you accept the idea that you cannot possibly be friends with everyone at your school. Believing that you should be could be holding you back from focusing on the key people who are your friends. Be polite and friendly, but don’t go out of your way to try to make mean people like you.

Know your likes and dislikes and be proud of them.,
Deal with any jealousy or insecurities you might have.,
Identify what you find annoying.,
Talk to a counselor or therapist.",How to Deal With Annoying Populars2," Be proud of who you are, the music you like, and the choices you make. Get into after-school activities you love, wear clothes you love, and hang out with friends you love. Remember that you aren’t the problem, they are.If you have this kind of positive mindset, being bullied can actually be an opportunity to learn more about yourself. Don’t let annoying or mean popular kids control what you think about yourself.

, Remember that there will always be someone prettier, more handsome, stronger, taller, smarter, and so on. It’s easy to get caught up in the rat race of trying to be the best at something, but learning to accept who you are and be happy with yourself is one of the most important parts of growing up. Don’t try to be like anyone else: just be yourself and be proud of who you are!Ask yourself if you find these people annoying because you are feeling resentful, insecure, or jealous. Identifying these feelings means you can begin to deal with them.
Work on not comparing yourself to others and appreciating your unique qualities and talents.

, Jealousy and insecurity are possible reasons you may find the populars annoying, or it may have to do with how they treat you or other people. Dig deep and think about what is at the root of your annoyance and if there's a solution that will allow you to move on.

Ask yourself if your boundaries are being violated. Your boundaries define what you will and will not accept in your interactions with someone. You may feel annoyed with the populars because they are crossing over the line. Maybe they are teasing you about your older sibling and asking you personal questions. Make your boundaries clear by saying something like, ""I really don't want to talk about it. If you keep asking me questions I'm going to leave.""
You may not be aware of your boundaries until they have been crossed, or the annoying people may have no idea their teasing is taking things too far. Be clear about what you are not willing to tolerate from others, and remember it's okay to reset your boundaries if you need to.

, Sometimes popular cliques really wear you down and make you not like yourself, which can be a really dangerous situation. If you find you’re having trouble building your self-esteem up on your own, or with friends and family, it might be best to talk to a professional. You don’t have to tell anyone at school or be ashamed about getting help: it’s your business alone and none of theirs.Make an appointment with your school’s guidance counselor.
If you want to keep your business private and keep it completely outside of school, ask your parents for help setting up an appointment with a therapist or counselor elsewhere.

Don’t become an annoying popular yourself.,
Stand up for people who the populars target.,
Help redefine what it means to popular at your school.",How to Deal With Annoying Populars3," Nothing is permanent, and you might find yourself “unpopular” and a target for bullying one year, then find yourself on the other end of the spectrum later on. Kids in school often switch roles back and forth between bully and victim. Don’t keep the cycle going. Make sure you’re setting a good example and not being a bully, regardless of whether or not people think of you as popular. , If you see someone getting excluded or bullied, reach out and defend them. Sit next to people at lunch who have no one else to sit with, and befriend those who feel like no one wants to be their friend. It’s true that there’s safety in numbers, but even more importantly, you’ll make someone feel better about themselves. In turn, that’ll help your self-esteem, too.


Remember that the tables could always turn: you might see someone get targeted one day, and find yourself to be the target the next. Defend someone the way you’d want to be defended.

, Mean, annoying populars bully others because they think that’s what makes them popular. A lot of the time, they end up being right: studies show that the more popular you are, the more likely you are to bully.You can’t change your school’s social dynamics overnight, but you can become part of the solution by helping to change people’s perceptions.


Work on being a positive example for others, including the bullies. Be the change you want to see. Remember, kids are a lot more likely to be influenced by their peers than by authority figures.Understand that people often bully because they have insecurities, need a sense of control, or countless other complex reasons. It’s important not to judge any book by its cover!

Resist any urge to adopt negative self-talk as a defense mechanism.",How to Cope when Boys Tell You You're Fat1," You know your real value, and so do your close friends. Being confident in your own skin is much more important than what others think of your appearance.The composition of your body does not make you confident or unconfident.
Confidence is being proud of who you are and brave enough to show your true self to the world.;
, No matter what someone says or does, you are in full control of feeling one way or another about it. Choose to either ignore the comment, or choose to respond in a way that counteracts his negativity and inappropriate focus on weight.Don’t internalize someone else’s criticism of you. Many times kids who are told they are overweight and bullied become adults who tell themselves the same kinds of things in their heads. It’s not good for your long-term mental health to constantly be worried about your weight or what you are eating as a child/teen, so focus on action rather than feelings., The best way to keep other people’s body negativity from infecting your own thoughts is to make taking care of yourself mentally, emotionally and physically your first priority! There is no one right way to practice self-care, as it is very individual.Some possibilities are:


Set aside time every morning to visualize how you want your day to go, or every evening to reflect on your day. Focus on the things you have control over rather than what others might have pushed onto you.
After school, spend 20 minutes doing something that makes you happy. Get some nice colored pencils and a fancy coloring book, or write a letter to a friend or family member just to say hi.
Read some body positive blogs or articles on the internet. For excellent information on how expectations of women’s bodies in society are unrealistic, see http://www.jeankilbourne.com/videos/ and http://therepresentationproject.org/


, This never helps you feel better in the long run and takes your focus off of taking care of yourself first. Unless your profession depends on being a certain weight, like being an actress or model, it is not an issue about which you need to look to others for acceptance., Both boys and girls, of all ages and weights, regularly say negative things about their own physical beauty in either an attempt to get a compliment back or to humble themselves in front of peers. This kind of type hurts your self-esteem more than helping it, and it perpetuates societal standards that focus on appearance over personality. "

Turn it into a chance to thicken your skin.,
Create an opportunity to practice listening skills.,
Question binary thinking.,
Practice forgiveness.",How to Cope when Boys Tell You You're Fat2," Someone will always criticize you for something, whether your looks or performance, or even your personality.


Take this incident as a chance to practice learning to accept negative criticism without hurting your own self-esteem and to think before you react.
Or, let this incident teach you to let go of things that don’t matter. In other words, “don’t sweat the small stuff.” , If you can turn the comment into a conversation, it will be a great chance to practice active listening, which is a necessary skill for dealing with people in both social and professional/academic settings. , Even if negative, listening to others’ comments about you may open your mind to other possibilities or perspectives you hadn’t thought of before. Nothing is really ‘black-or-white,’ and confronting this type of thinking will make both of you better, more empathetic people. , In addition to learning more about yourself and about society, negative comments are an opportunity for you to practice forgiving others for hurting you. It’s a necessary skill to have throughout your life to remain happy with yourself. "

Determine whether or not you want a relationship with this person.,

Shift the focus of the conversation entirely.,
Use the opportunity to questions society’s beauty standards.,
Ask him what exactly “fat” means.,
Thank him for teaching you an important lesson about people.",How to Cope when Boys Tell You You're Fat3," If you are not dating him, he might not be worth your concern at all. If you are already dating him, assess his language to see if he is trying to express genuine concern for your well-being or if he is just making a hurtful comment about your physical appearance.Either way, your response is a chance to tell this person how you allow them to treat you in the future. If he is simply being nasty, kick him to the curb. Criticizing a loved one will never lead them to lose weight, and often causes bitterness and unintentional weight gain. If he can’t discuss it in a helpful or sympathetic way, he’s not worth worrying about.
If he is trying to express concern for your health, turn it into a two-way conversation, without blaming or hurting feelings. He may just want to keep you around this world as long as possible and serious health problems are associated with being overweight.
It is OK to decide to not spend time with negative people who focus on appearances!, The best way to close down negativity is to counter it with positivity. Say something about yourself, focusing on your good qualities, or say something nice about the boy. Either way, you are redirecting the tone of the conversation in a good way. Your most important qualities are those that affect what kind of person you are, rather than what others think about your appearance. Say something like, “That’s your opinion, but I think of myself as a straight-A student,” or “…as a loyal and committed friend.”
If saying something about him, be sure to focus on non-physical qualities so that he knows that defining someone by their appearance is unacceptable.

, If you can’t think of something nice to say in return, or feel too emotional to respond confidently in that way, simply change the conversation by starting a completely new one. Ask him about the test you just took in class, or if he is ready for tomorrow’s exam.
Mention the latest news item and ask how he feels about that situation. Nothing stops “haters” more than bringing up a topic that is clearly more important to talk about, like the latest earthquake or political conversation.
Ask, “How about that _______ game last night?” or “Have you played yet?”

, In the US and other Western cultures, everyone is expected to fit within generally agreed upon ideals of perfection, which are completely unrealizable in real life for almost everyone (including models).The media celebrates being extremely thin and treats overweight people like they are failures and don’t deserve love, from themselves or from others.


Think about what you can say to challenge society’s standards of beauty, particularly weight.
Do some research to prepare a response in advance if this is a comment you hear often (about you or other girls/women). Collect a couple statistics, or one great example of a photo-shopped ad of a famous model.

, It is not a medical term. Make him qualify his comment with a real opinion. Either he will rethink his statement and assumptions, or it might start a useful conversation leading to increased education.


Obesity is a medical term, defined as being 20% over ideal body weight based on your body type and height.“Fat” only means something because societal standards have defined it as a meaningful word. It is unlikely, though, that he can explain it with any substance.

, Whether you know this boy or not, one way to shut him down is to thank him for the lessons he has provided, whether about whom you will befriend in the future or about how to be a better person."

Your appearance and size is no one else’s business but your own, and it’s not your job to fit other people’s expectations of you, realistic or unrealistic. Focus on how you feel about yourself without considering the comments of others.


If you do not agree that you are overweight, brush off the comment as a meaningless jab by a bully.
Even if you would like to lose a few pounds, it is still inappropriate for anyone else to comment on your size. Ignore the comment, and focus instead on how to best take care of yourself and what makes you happy.
If you are eating more than you should, or making mainly unhealthy food choices, it may be a symptom of stress or anxiety.Find the reason for your eating habits and deal with that stress directly.

, You don’t ‘feel’ fat or ‘thin,’ you think it. Think about how you make judgments about your body. Are they based on physical health (meaning you are healthy and can do everything you want to do), society’s expectations of beauty, your family’s unique perspectives, what your friends talk about when you’re around, etc?
Often our self-esteem is based on family dynamics and therefore comes from older views about beauty and women’s roles. If this is true for you, educate your parents and relatives about how body image is treated in 2016., Trying to change your life to make others happy is not something you want to get into the habit of doing. The only person who will get hurt is you!


DON’T start following random diets, or the new crazy diet celebrities are using, to lose weight. In addition to possibly causing serious health problems in the future, constantly dieting causes permanent mental harm. , Eating healthily makes you feel better physically and mentally.

Consider the situation.,
Decide on an approach.,
Listen closely and think of a way to make the other person look foolish.,
Show disdain or amusement.,
Respond quickly.,
Remain professional.",How to Come Up with Good Comebacks1," The first step in determining how best to respond to any insult is think about the situation and the source of the insult.How best to respond will depend on what's going on.


If the person who is insulting you is a friend and is joking around, feel free to joke back! If he has actually hurt your feelings though, you may want to discuss that. If this person is really your friend, he will not want to hurt you.;
, If the person is a bully or someone else who wants to hurt your feelings, decide if you want to ignore her or respond. If you want to respond, you have a few options:


Make a funny comeback to make her feel foolish.
Make an earnest comeback aimed at stopping the behavior.
Try to have a conversation with her to try to get at the root of the problem.

, To make a good humorous comeback, you need to respond directly to what the other person said to you. A comeback that is off topic won't be effective or funny. People won't get it, and you'll be the one who ends up looking silly.It's easy to get caught up in thinking about what you are going to say next and not really pay attention to what the other person is saying, especially if what the bully is saying isn't very nice. Try to pay close attention to what he is saying about you. His insults should provide the basis for your comeback.
A good comeback is one that makes the other person look foolish for insulting you.Think of something that will turn the other person's words back on him.
For example, if someone calls you ugly, you could respond by saying: ""Too bad you can’t Photoshop your ugly personality.""If someone makes a joke at your expense, you could respond: ""Bet you were up all night thinking about that one.""
If someone insults your ability or skill at something, you could say: ""Well, I learned by watching you."", Before delivering your comeback, you need to show that the insult hasn't hurt you — on the contrary, you should make it apparent that you think what the bully has said to you is stupid. Your look has to match your words.Use your body language. Raise an eyebrow, laugh, roll your eyes. Anything to show how ridiculous you think the other person's words were.

, For a funny comeback to work, you have to get it out right away. If you are halfway down the hall before you think it up, it won't be effective.If you don't come up with a funny comeback right away, it's better to just save it for another time. If this is an ongoing problem, there's a good possibility you'll have another chance.

, If the bully you are responding to is someone you work with, stand up for yourself. Do not, however, cross the line into being unprofessional.


In a workplace situation, for example, a good comeback might be one one that points out how the bully's behavior is hurting productivity. Don't make one that that mocks her appearance or intelligence.You might say, ""If you put as much effort into your work as you put into making fun of me you might not be behind on your project.""

Have a conversation with your child.After seeing your child bullying someone or hearing a report that your child was bullying someone, talk to them immediately.,
Discover why your child is being a bully.There are many reasons why children bully others.,
Don’t assume your child is not bullying.Many people are surprised to learn their child engages in bullying.,
Recognize traits of a bully.Children who engage in bullying have at least one of several related traits.,
Rule out disabilities that may cause unusual social behavior.Sometimes, an inability to express oneself or identify emotional cues is mistaken for bullying.",How to Correct Your Child for Bullying1," Say exactly what you saw or what the authority figure reported to you. Tell your child that you love them, but you are concerned about their bullying.


Remain calm during this conversation. Even if you are angry, disappointed, or concerned, you should keep a steady voice. If you become upset, your child might become defensive, anxious, or defiant.
Be direct. Ask your child if the report about their bullying is true. If they deny it, ensure they have an acceptable explanation as to why their behavior was understood as bullying.
Listen to your child’s side of the story. Were they bullying, or were they standing up for themselves against a bully? If the latter, help them think about alternatives to physical force or aggression of their own. For instance, you could recommend that next time, they get a parent or teacher involved in the conflict.;
, Perhaps they were trying to impress their friends. Perhaps they wanted to attract attention from their peers or from adults (including you). Perhaps they have anger issues stemming from a lack of attention at home or some other cause, such as marital conflict.


Perhaps your child hasn’t learned appropriate conflict resolution tactics.
Bullies are often insecure, or were bullied by others.Reflect on the home situation for the child. Although it may be difficult to confront these issues, ask yourself if there are there any sources of conflict within your family.
Talk to your child's teachers, nurses, school administration, baby sitters, and other daily caretakers. They may have witnessed things that your child is hesitant to talk to you about.
If you have a hard time figuring out why your child is bullying another, consider seeking professional help. Child psychologists are trained to identify and prescribe remedies for various causes of bullying behavior. If your child is bullying another child, enroll them in therapy.
Remember, understanding why your child bullies others does not excuse their behavior – it only explains it.

, As a parent, you might not see bullying behavior at home, or your child might not engage in bullying when you’re around. Even if the child does bully others around you, you might be tempted to be generous and dismissive when you see it because you love your child. However, it is important to recognize when your child is being hurtful or domineering towards someone else, and take necessary corrective action.


Do not dismiss reports from teachers and other parents about your child’s behavior. Take them at their word and talk to your child about their actions.If someone tells you that they have seen your child bully others, ask them questions about the incident to learn as much as you can about it. Be sure to thank them for coming to you.

, These traits demonstrate a need for control and difficulty relating to others. Keep an eye out for behavior that denies personal responsibility and justifies aggression or emotional outbursts. Your child may also exhibit:


poor social skills
anxiety, depression, or frustration
a lack of accountability
a lack of empathy
a need for control
low self-esteem
jealousy

, It is important to recognize when your child has an emotional disability that might impact their social relations. If you have trouble doing so, or suspect an emotional or developmental disability, consult a child psychiatrist for a professional diagnosis.


For example, a child who struggles to read faces or process verbal and social cues might not realize when they accidentally upset another child.

Take a breath.,
Act confident.,
Show you aren't hurt.,
Consider shaming the other person.,
Ask questions to start a conversation.",How to Come Up with Good Comebacks2," Sometimes a more earnest response is a better one — an insulting comeback can end up provoking more of the same (or worse). You still, however, need to show the bully that you aren't hurt by his words, even if you are.


Take a deep breath. If you are angry, try to let the feeling go. Anger is what the bully wants to see, so don't give in and show it.Try to put on a ""poker face"" that doesn't reveal any feelings one way or the other. You can practice this in the mirror at home to make this easier.

, When you respond to the bully, show that you are confident. It's not just that you aren't angry or hurt — you feel fine about yourself and and confident in your response.Stand up straight, and look the bully in the eye. Speak in a calm, clear voice.
You can tell the person insulting you something like: ""Your words don't affect me,"" or, ""I don't let people like you get to me."", Respond verbally with a comment that shows that the insult hasn't hurt you, or that the bully's words are unimportant to you. Here are some good examples:I heard you, but I don't care.
You're wasting your breath.
Real mature.
Are you done?
Wow, you discovered I look different than you.

, You might consider a response that promotes feelings of shame for the bully. Ideally, you can make her feel bad for insulting you. Here are some examples:I feel sorry for you.
Build up your self-esteem some other way.
Your parents must be really proud of you.
It's sad that you feel a need to do this.

, Some people have found it effective to respond to insults with questions aimed at making the other person open up about the real problem. If you think the person insulting you might be open to a conversation about the real issues that are upsetting him, this might be worth a try.For example, if someone calls you stupid, you might respond by asking: ""What is it exactly that makes you feel I am not intelligent?"" Even if this doesn't start a heart-to-heart conversation about the bully's own feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, it might disarm him just by being unexpected.

Practice your comebacks.,
Learn a little about your bully.,
Don't become the bully.,
Be careful not to provoke violence.,
Get help.",How to Come Up with Good Comebacks3," Comebacks are all about timing and confidence. Most people think comebacks have to be spontaneous, but you can improve yours by practicing.Find a friend or a sympathetic adult and have her deliver the insults so you can practice your responses. If you don't feel comfortable with this, you can try it on your own in the mirror.
Notice which style of comeback feels most natural to you. If you struggle to come up with a funny one-liner in the moment, then using this tactic will not be very successful for you. Use a different response — like a poker face and saying ""Are you finished?"" if that comes more naturally. Use what works best for you until you can practice and use the other methods effectively.

, Bullies are usually very socially intelligent and great people-readers. They can easily see which comments get under people's skin. You can benefit from building up this same skill, but using it for defense instead of for aggression (like the bully). Watch the bully's reaction when you deliver your comeback and the reaction of others around him. Did he respond with surprise? Become angry, quiet, walk away? Then the comeback style used was successful.

Watch for patterns and make not of what worked and what didn't. Notice, for instance, if humor seems to egg him on. If this is the case, switch to indifference or seriousness.
Use the group dynamic to take control over the situation. Did the reactions of others watching tell you that you made an impact? Then what you said is working. Did they laugh at you and continue to support the bully? Then try a new tactic.

, When you are thinking about comebacks, try to come up with ideas that insult the bully's behavior, not characteristics she can't change. Your goal isn't to be as mean as the bully; your goal is to make the put-downs stop.Don't use stereotypes or attack a person based on her gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, or other characteristics such as these. This is just as bad as what the bully is doing to you, and possibly worse. You can also get in a lot of trouble for using these kinds of insults.

, Sometimes comebacks can lead to more insults. More concerning, however, is that some bullies might respond with violence, especially to insulting comebacks. Keep an eye out for signs that the person is becoming aggressive.


Think carefully about the comebacks you use, and if a violent reaction seems like a possibility, remove yourself from the situation.Do you know if this person has ever gotten in trouble for violence before? Have you heard about him hitting or fighting with others? Or is he a social bully who just uses words? If you know this person has gotten violent in the past, you will want to be very cautious.
Watch for physical cues of violence. The person may touch his head or face (rubbing his face or scalp or almost touching his face) and clench his fists, wring his hands, or pop his knuckles. The bully may remove an article of clothing, like a hat or a jacket, and may crouch down slightly. In addition, the person may turn his non-dominant side toward you; so, a left-handed person may turn his right side toward you.If you notice any of these behaviors, do not try to make a comeback and back away from the person.
Do not make comebacks to threats of violence. The bully may something like ""I'm going to Get away from the person making the threats and report threat immediately.

, If someone is bullying you regularly get help from a teacher, manager, or coworker. Bullies are less likely to pick on you if you aren't isolated.


If you can't solve the problem informally, get someone in a position of authority involved. You shouldn't have to deal with constant insults from a bully in any situation."

Ask, “How did it make you feel?” If your child can’t think of such an occasion, ask them to imagine how they would feel if someone said or did to them what they said or did to the child they were bullying.When your child puts themselves in the bullied child’s shoes, they will be able to empathize with them and understand why bullying is wrong.

, Young children (5-8 years old) tend to not understand that bullying is wrong, but that does not mean that they should get away with it. They cannot identify power imbalances and repeated behavior. They also do not usually know how to reflect on their own behavior, or consider other points of view. Therefore, it is important to teach your child what bullying is, no matter how young they are.Tell your child specifically what kind of behaviors are unkind to help them understand bullying. You might tell them that pushing, name-calling, and yelling at others are bullying behaviors.
To solve bullying in young children, it is important to use simple language and examples they can understand. For instance, you might explain that it is not nice to leave others out of their games, or that mean names are hurtful.
Keep an eye on your child and ensure they are being kind to their friends and playmates.

, To correct their behavior, you should not only tell them how bullying is hurtful, but teach them how to act properly. Behaviors you could suggest to your child include sharing, forgiving, being kind, staying calm (and not yelling), and accepting differences in others.


Tell your child that to make friends and live happily, it is important not to engage in bullying.Watch your child as they play with other children. If they act in an inappropriate way, give them a prompt to correct their behavior, such as ""can you share your toys?"" or ""remember, we don't call people names.""
It may take a while for your child to learn how to behave properly. Be consistent with your expectations, and remind them periodically.

, For instance, you might make a list of different behaviors with your child and help them categorize each into “bullying” and “kind” behaviors.


Divide a piece of paper into two columns. Label one column as “unkind” or “bullying” and label the other as “kind” or “nice.” Provide several words or phrases to your child and ask them to place each in the appropriate a column.
You could include words or phrases like yelling, showing respect, pushing, sharing, complimenting, being mean, and hugging.
Ensure the language you use is appropriate for your child’s age. Don’t use complex terms for a pre-teen (or younger) child. Speak to your child at a level they understand.

, Role-playing is a valuable method you can use to demonstrate to your child how bullying feels. Preface the exercise by explaining to your child that you want to show them what it is like to be bullied. Perhaps you can take a pencil or crayon they were using, or tell them you don’t want to play with them. Ask them how they feel. Then, allow them a turn to play-act bullying, and respond with expressions of sadness and emotional pain.


Always make it clear before and after the role-playing that you in fact love and care for your child.
End the session with a reminder that bullying does not feel good, and encourage your child to think about the role-playing session next time they interact with their peers.

, Many films, books, and plays teach forgiveness, kindness, empathy, and respect. They can also offer valuable lessons about the effect of bullying on others. Use relevant media to explore qualities that build friendships and the consequences of bullying.


You might use Hercules to demonstrate how bullying affects people. Refer to the scene where Hercules is bullied by his peers and feels bad about his differences.Think about what films or books your child loves and use appropriate examples to teach your child appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

, If you are a kind, generous, and loving person, your child will notice. Likewise, if you are domineering, verbally or physically abusive towards others, and stingy with your affection, your child will be more likely to adopt bullying tactics and behaviors. Be a positive example for your child and you can indirectly teach them not to be a bully.Make sure the whole family is included in modelling this behavior. Talk to the other parent as well any step-parents, grandparents, and extended family members who spend time around your child.
Act kindly around strangers in public as well, especially if the other person is getting on your nerves. Be calm and polite, and your child will learn how to properly interact with other people.
Avoid gossiping or insulting other people behind their back. This will teach your child that it is never acceptable to speak badly about others.

Make sure the book is oriented to the child's personality.,
Pick the right theme.,
Make sure it is age appropriate.,
Don't be too obvious.",How to Choose Children's Books About Bullying," If the book for a child that is being bullied, one might want a more educational book about what to do when being bullied. Stories in which the hero/heroine is being bullied and over comes it are also good choices. On the other hand, if the book is for a child who is being a bully a book that involves the main character being the bully and then realizing the consequences might be more appropriate.;
, Although most books can be unisex, some books are oriented more to one gender or the other. In addition, different books will be appealing to different children based on their personality and interests. A child who is not as interested in books or reading may be drawn to a book more if it has an interesting cover or illustrations.

, There are many different types of bullying books dealing with various types of bullying.

Be aware that self-preservation is a right for everyone.,
Love yourself.,

Validate yourself.",How to Bully Proof Yourself," While you have probably heard this a million times, it's important to really understand the worth of this skill. In a nutshell, it allows you to see that the bully is someone who lacks something, be it a sense of self worth, a secure home environment, a certainty of their abilities and so forth. When seen from this perspective, it becomes possible to realize that many a bully is operating from a place of insecurity and even fear, and they have latched onto pushing others around or hurting others as a way of feeling good about themselves. Certainly it is an odd way to cope but it's still something that you can understand as the motivation behind the behavior. By taking this step back and viewing the whole picture, you can begin to see the bullying behavior as less about you, and more about what the bully lacks, and therefore it will seem less intimidating.;
, Eye contact is a powerful way of reminding a bully that you're not going to be swayed by their tactics. You view yourself as an equal individual, not subservient to their bad attitude. Next time you pass such a person in the hallway, sit across from them at work or end up near them for whatever reason, make eye contact and make it clear that you don't have low self-esteem but feel equal.

, Consider what the bully is targeting and decide whether it is something in need of fixing or changing. Things such as how you present yourself, your demeanor and your approach to others can be changed if needed, as all these things involve skill learning. On the other hand, your height, eye color, hair texture, preferences, and the like, are what define you and are not weaknesses. If the bully targets those things, it may hurt but it is important to learn to not take such jabs personally but to see the bully's tactics for the weak and mean-spirited attacks that they are.


While you can make changes, don't take the bullying as a confirmation that you are any less of a person. Bullies can be highly perceptive about what we don't like about our own selves or are yet to fully work out about ourselves and they can work away at this uncertainty or confusion. It can be an opportunity for you to do some self reflection leading to self-driven choices to make changes that will enhance your strengths and help to bully proof you.

, Know yourself. What do you want and not want to be. Having an idea as to what you stand for will give you confidence. Sometimes we don't always know what we want out of life. Start with what you don't want to be.

, Sometimes people test you and your reaction to things. Identify when you should voice your concerns and when to just listen and walk away. There is a great strength in just letting what bothers you flow from you without it affecting your well being. This takes time and patience to acquire, so don't be hard on yourself if you don't get it right away.

, If someone is teasing you, agree with them. Letting the person get on your nerves will just satisfy them. Agreeing with them takes away the sting and spoils their expected reaction.

, Confidence is crucial to survival. Learn new skills, have hobbies and interests. If you are shy, you may want to volunteer in a setting that will help strengthen your social skills. Read, learn about the world, get in touch with what is happening out there. This is also a great way to start conversations, by having plenty to talk about when asked what you do.

, It is basically about keeping yourself from destruction or harm. It is your responsibility to make sure that no one hurts you (physically, emotional or spiritually). If you have the ability to determine that something is not good for you, then you should have the courage to deal with that situation.

, This involves acceptance of your nature, personality and preferences. If you don't love yourself, no one else will. Never lower your standards as how you should be treated. It all starts within ourselves. Carl Jung once stated ""If we look outward we dream, if we look inward we awaken"". Sometimes it is what we are doing to ourselves that makes us vulnerable to others.

, Don't let situations get out of control before you ask for help.

, You matter and it is important for you to believe this from within. Those who seek validation from others all of the time can be easy prey to the bully. On the other hand, those who feel self-validated (without being boastful or unduly stubborn about making fruitful changes) will weather the storms that bullies seek to set upon them. Thus, by knowing your self worth and accepting who you are, you can find a way to bully proof yourself and not take the taunts personally.

Is there a reason, such as previous conflict, why this person might want to try to intentionally hurt your feelings?For those parts of the insult you find to be true, acknowledge that it is ok to be imperfect. Know that all people have flaws, and it is acceptable to evaluate and work on them.
For those parts of the insult that you don’t find true, remind yourself that they are not factual and do not reflect you.

It is normal to have a negative reaction to an insult, and those around you will understand if you need a moment to collect yourself.Take a moment to practice deep breathing, or repeat a positive quote or mantra to yourself.
Allow yourself as much time as you need to healthfully work through tears or feelings of anger. Avoid exploding emotionally, and instead give yourself time enough to calm your immediate feelings.

, Laughter causes the release of endorphins, a group of hormones that can stimulate happy or euphoric sensations. Take a moment to laugh at yourself, and allow the endorphins to replace that sense of panic with better feelings.Remind yourself that no one is immune from insults or criticism. Even if you are not laughing at the insult, find some personal imperfection and allow yourself to laugh about it.
Try a “fake it ‘til you make it” approach. Even if it doesn’t seem funny, laugh at yourself in difficult moments. With time, it will get more sincere.

Think of ways to counter verbal attacks. For example, if the person who bullies you picks on you because you are quiet or shy, and says things like, “Why don’t you ever talk, stupid,” you can think of ways to positively respond. You could say, “Well, I don’t appreciate you calling me stupid, because I’m not. I don’t talk that much because that’s the way I am. I like how I am.” This way you are keeping the bully in check and showing you are confident about who you are.
You can also clearly respond with something simple, such as ""Stop,"" and calmly walk away.Be sure to use assertive body language, such as standing up tall and keep your arms loose and relaxed. Look the bully right in the eye as you communicate to show him that you are not afraid of his bullying.Try using humor or laughing off a bully's comment to show him that he has no control over your emotions and can't push your buttons.

One way to use assertiveness is to use “I-statements.” This is a way to talk about how you feel without being directly aggressive toward the person who bullies you. An example would be, “I feel angry when you tease me and say that I am strange.” The key is to focus on how you feel (angry, sad, disrespected), instead of on the person’s actions. This can help reduce the defensiveness of the person you are confronting.

, Do not get aggressive with people who bully others, this can fuel their fire.

Surround yourself with good people.",How to Be Confident when Someone Insults You2," You do not have to agree with what a person says, but learning to accept an insult takes more confidence than near any other response. It shows that if the insult comes from someone you care about, you are willing to consider their point. If it comes from someone you don’t care about, it shows that they don’t impact you.Practice accepting insults by going over past criticisms you have received. Say to yourself something like, “You’re not that great.” Then, practice accepting by saying, “You are right, I am not that great.”
Repeat this exercise until you feel the sting of the insult wear off. It may or may not go away completely, but taking away the initial shock will give you the presence of mind to be able to respond when someone does insult you.

, This is easier said than done, but one of the best ways to build confidence long-term when you are faced with insults is to remind yourself that an insult is only effective if you let it hurt you. If you choose to move past the insult quickly and focus self-improvement or already positive aspects about your personality, the insult loses its power.Practice filling in statements such as, “That doesn’t matter because I’m ______.” Give yourself a reason, based in your positive traits, to dismiss the insult.
For example, if someone insults you by saying, “That was a really bad presentation,” let yourself know, “That doesn’t matter, because I turned in a great report for this project.”
Understand that moving on may take time. View being able to quickly dismiss insults in favor of your own positive traits as a goal rather than an immediate solution.

, One way to not only build confidence but also minimize unnecessary criticism is to surround yourself with positive influences. Put time friendships, family relationships, and school or work connections that you find fulfilling and let go of those that you see as a hindrance.Positive relationships will help you build your confidence by celebrating you when you do well in life and pushing you to reach for positive things. Take inventory of who in your life does this for you.
Look at who is insulting you. If it is a family member or someone who calls themself your friend, consider loosening or leaving your relationship with that person. Let them know, “You constantly criticize me and I do not want that kind of negative force in my life.”

Go into self-protection mode.,
Remind yourself that you matter and that you are courageous.,
Use the fear and hurt to stand taller.,
Realize that bullying won't just go away without something in its way.,
Decide what you will do.,
Don't give up or give in.,
Be brave enough to ask for help.",How to Be Brave when Getting Bullied," Bullying includes any attempt to belittle you, to make you feel powerless in relation to the other person, to insult you and to cast aspersions on your reputation. It does not include attempts to provide constructive feedback, to critique your work or performance fairly or when a person is expressing their concerns or sense of being upset/hurt in relation to your behaviors.


The reason it is important to know the difference is that it is not appropriate to accuse someone of bullying when they're not, nor is it appropriate to walk away or ignore someone who is actively trying to help you by giving you feedback or trying to kindly or fairly correct errors that you've made.;
, Think about donning imaginary armor, or creating a pretend moat around you. Make yourself impenetrable from the bully by putting up this mental shield as quickly as you can. This shield is to prevent you from reacting to the bully and to help you remember that you are a worthy person who does not deserve the insults or mean comments. Let the words bounce off you.

, Being brave isn't about height, weight, wit or cleverness. Moreover, being brave isn't being unafraid or hurt. Indeed, you will likely feel fearful and/or hurt by what the bully is saying and/or doing. Being brave is about knowing that you are better than this, that it will pass and that despite the fear, you will carry on undeterred.


Being scared in the face of nasty comments and attitude is natural. Being scared also means that you're able to be brave.

, Often advice will tell you not to show fear or hurt to the bully. The real thing is to show that you can cope in spite of that fear, that you will keep thriving despite the hurt. Words do hurt. Yet, use that hurt and fear to spur you on to strive to be the better person and to know that you are the better person for not giving in to the attempts of the bully to minimize you. Remind yourself that you are as valuable as every other person. This will give strength to your bravery.


The brave person is free. Free of the expectations of others, free of the neediness of validation of self-worth from others. Remember this when you are faced with intimidating remarks and commentary.

, Bravery is the barrier you can put up to stop its continuation. Bravery is the signal to the bully that whatever they choose to hurl at you, you'll remain strong and courageous. Bravery shows the bully that you are choosing the story that is told about you, rather than giving in to the one they're trying to make up for you. Define yourself.

, Some good ways to react include ignoring what is being said, saying something neutral and kind in response, or walking away. Put your efforts into dealing with the bullying. Some good articles to help you with this include:


How to deal with being bullied
How to deal with verbal bullying

How to stop workplace bullying.

, Courage isn't always there when you need it, as it often needs to grow through what you've learned and experienced. Yet, that doesn't mean you can't develop it with practice, nor does it mean that a bad situation cannot be salvaged. Remember that, in spite of what has gone before, tomorrow is another day. When your courage failed to surface today when you felt you needed it, tell yourself this evening that you will kindle it and feed it with what you have learned. And that the next time, it will arise as you try again.


Give yourself second, third and more chances to develop your bravery in the face of bullies. You will meet people throughout your life who will try to bully you. With practice and experience, you will become expert at recognizing them quickly and disarming them with a look, a word or a clear indication that you don't stand for being bullied. Each experience is a learning chance to perfect your bravery and to resort to it whenever a new case arises. In this way, you cease to be a victim but have control of your own reactions and responsiveness to bullying situations, knowing full well that you are as valuable as the person attempting to drag you under and that you will survive such nefarious behaviors every time.

, While you can stand alone and deal alone with a good dose of bravery, often it's not enough on its own. Also accept then you need help and be brave enough to ask for it. There are plenty of good, kind and well-adjusted people in the world who are willing to help you out, with just a reach-out to them.

, A solid friends group can help you cope with bullies. If your friends are being targeted by the same people, they may have advice for you on how to cope. It can also be helpful to know you're not alone in a situation. If you're being targeted by a bully, talking over the issue with your friends can help remind you that you're not alone.

, If the situation gets out of hand, you need to alert school officials. Bullying that becomes violent, or bullying that affects your mental health, needs to be reported. Do not fear being labeled as a tattletale in these situations. Nothing is more important than your physical and emotional wellbeing.


Report the bullying to a teacher or school official you trust. Make sure you provide the information you've documented, including the nature of the bullying and when and where it occurred.
See if you can get anyone to step up with you. If you and a friend are both being bullied, you can help corroborate one another's stories.

Join a club, group or team.,
Find study partners.,
Maintain your friendships.",How to Be Brave in School1," Participating in social life outside of the classroom is a great way to make friends and gain new knowledge. It is also a great way to take control of your school experience and even foster some school spirit. Studies have shown that extracurricular activities have positive effects on students, including improved self-esteem, social skills and better grades., It has been shown that developing friendships at school can improve students’ emotional health and academic performance.Having friends to study with can keep you motivated, and it can make academic challenges a little less daunting. School work is something that all students have in common, making it the perfect thing to bond over.

, Friendships are only really meaningful if you value them. In today’s world of social media and virtual friends, it is especially important to show friends that you care in a real and personal way- by staying in contact, resolving conflict and treating them how you want to be treated.To demonstrate your commitment, reach out by:


sending encouraging texts or emails
celebrating their accomplishments with a gift or shout-out on social media

Identify the problem.,
Confide in someone.,
Be an ally to bullied peers.",How to Be Brave in School2," It is important to see bullying for what it is and remember that it is a result of the bully’s weaknesses, not yours. Acknowledging this fact is helpful in breaking past the shame and embarrassment that can come from being bullied and deciding to get out of that situation. It is also important to remember that bullying occurs in many forms:


Physical (violence and destruction of someone’s property)VerbalPsychological or social(social exclusion or humiliation, spreading rumors, etc.)Electronic (cyber bullying), Whether you go to a parent, teacher, guidance counsellor or principal, telling someone you trust that you’re being bullied is a big step in overcoming the isolation that can come with it. Approach the discussion by saying something straightforward, like, ""I am dealing with a bully and I would like someone to talk to.""


When confiding in someone, be honest and provide all of the information you can about the situation (e.g. who is doing the bullying, what they are doing, when and where it occurs, and how it is affecting you).
If you do not feel comfortable talking about the bullying in person, write a detailed letter instead., Bullying sometimes involves the presence of third party bystanders, whose inaction allows the bullying to continue.Intervening, offering support to the victim, or seeking help from a teacher or administrator can stop the situation in its tracks. If you feel guilty about getting someone in trouble, remember that bullying has negative effects on the bully too, and can foreshadow destructive behaviour down the line."

Focus on your success.,
Express yourself.,
Write a list of things you like about yourself.,
Make a kind gesture.",How to Be Brave in School3," School might get difficult, but it is ultimately an experience that is geared towards giving you the tools your need for a brighter future.Students generally work better if they have an understanding of the specific goals they are working towards, so make sure to keep your own in mind!To stay on track:


devote ample time to doing homework
create and follow a schedule for assignments and studying
find a distraction-free study area like a library
take detailed notes in class

, School provides many opportunities for students to show off their skills and to learn new ones. Projects, presentations and other creative outlets are a great way to shine and to foster comprehension, analysis and evaluation.To stand out as a student, remember the four A’s:Attitude- a positive outlook and willingness to learn
Academic skills- good study habits and learning skills
Awareness- the ability to connect learning material to real world happenings
Accomplishment- the ability to apply and communicate what you’ve learned

, Self-esteem is something that comes from within, but it is also something that you can work to build up. Making a list of things that you are good at is an excellent way to boost your self-confidence by reminding yourself about your strengths.Feeling strong and self-assured is a great way to face all of the challenges that school can throw your way.

, Doing a good deed is a great way to feel content with yourself, and it is a positive contribution to the world. Studies have shown that performing acts of kindness can boost an individual's long-term happiness.They can be as simple as:


offering your seat on the bus or subway to someone
carrying an elderly person's parcels
lending your notes to a classmate
helping a friend with homework

Take deep, relaxing breaths.,
Repeat a calming word or phrase to help you relax.,
Visualize something that calms you.,
Start counting.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Call a friend or family member.",How to Stay Calm when Infuriated1," Learn to breathe from your belly in order to take effective deep breaths. Shallow breathing does not reduce stress levels, and in fact can contribute to anxiety.Visualize air causing your diaphragm/belly to expand. Breathe the air through your nose down into your belly. Exhale through your nose, pulling your belly in toward your back.
Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique to calm down. Belly breathe in through your nose to the count of four. Hold your breath to the count of seven. Then exhale through your mouth, making a whooshing sound, to the count of eight.;
, You might want to decide on words that have a calming, relaxing effect on you ahead of time, so that the next time you’re angry, you can utilize them immediately. Think of a word, phrase, or quote that relaxes you. Practice saying the words out loud, before you get into an infuriating situation, so they become habitual and comfortable.You could repeat words that act as reminders to yourself, like “peace,” “stay calm,” or “breathe.” Make sure to say these words in a soft, comforting voice.
You could name what you are feeling or thinking, and then remind yourself to change your thoughts to a more productive pattern. For example, you could say, “Right now I am very angry. I can take some deep breaths and not let my anger control me. I can control my anger.”You could repeat a part of a prayer or a religious verse that you find comforting and soothing.
If you find that humor helps diffuse your anger, you could repeat something to yourself that usually makes you laugh or smile. Try keeping a funny image or video in your phone that you can access quickly when you are upset.

, When you are feeling angry, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and imagine something that makes you feel calm, peaceful, or happy. It is also a good idea to practice this even when you are not feeling angry. The more you practice this, the easier it will be to use your calming image when you need it. What you imagine is up to you -- different things may relax different people.You might imagine a peaceful scene that relaxes you, like a tropical beach or quiet woods.
You could imagine the smiling face of your spouse, or your grandchild sleeping in your arms.
You may even think of an object that relaxes you, like a tree, a flower, or your favorite quilt.

, If you are feeling furious and ready to explode, take a deep breath and start counting before you respond. You could count to 50 or 100 -- take whatever time you need in order to respond without losing your temper. Breathe deeply as you count to yourself.You could also keep an eye on your watch. Set a timer for two minutes (or whatever you need) to breathe deeply and calm down before reacting., Progressive muscle relaxation is a powerful calming technique where you contract and release the muscles in your body starting with your toes and moving to the top of your head.To do this exercise, lie down in a comfortable spot and close your eyes. You might even want to put on some headphones and listen to some soft, soothing music or nature sounds, such as ocean waves.
Begin by clenching the muscles in your feet and hold to the count of five. Then, release and relax for 30 seconds.
Next, move to your calves, clench the muscles by pointing your toes, and count to five. Then, release and relax for 30 seconds.
Continue to clench, release, and relax each muscle group in your body moving up towards your head.

, Talking with a supportive friend or family member can be a great way to calm yourself. Try calling up a friend or family member who you know will listen to you and be supportive as you attempt to calm down.


Try saying something like, “I am feeling really angry right now and I need to talk about it. Do you have some time to listen?”
Share with your friend or family member what is making you angry and then listen to their suggestions and supportive words.

Distract yourself.,
Find humor in the situation.,
Look at patterns.,
Pay attention to how you are feeling.,
Give people the benefit of the doubt.,
Avoid thinking in extremes.",How to Stay Calm when Infuriated2," If you are able to, take a short mental break and focus on something else to help you remain calm. You may need to check out mentally for a few minutes, call up a friend and talk for a while, or distract yourself with something in your environment.For example, if your boss says something infuriating in a department meeting, and you don’t want to confront them, you could start thinking about what you want to make for dinner that night. You could start preparing a mental grocery list.
As long as you’re not being rude (for example, if you’re in a one-on-one conversation) you could pull out your phone and play a game on it for a few minutes to remain calm. This might work if you are waiting for a delayed flight or in the waiting room to see your doctor.

, Step back from how you are feeling in the moment and focus on something about the situation that may make you laugh. Sometimes the things we get angry about can be pretty ridiculous!For example, if you are arguing with someone whose appearance always reminds you of a donkey, you could imagine yourself arguing with an actual donkey.
Sometimes you might find yourself arguing that, upon reflection, is really silly. It can be helpful to diffuse the situation by calling it to the other person’s attention as well. For example, “Why are we arguing about what the baby is wearing? She is going to spit up on it in an hour anyway!”

, Do you find yourself getting angry at the same things, or around the same time each day? Think about what you can do to alter your behavior the next time you bump into this scenario, or how you can avoid it entirely in the first place.For example, getting everyone out the door in the morning to work and school can be a huge hassle. You may always be running late, or your kids consistently oversleep, and you start your day off stressed out. You may often find yourself losing your temper.
Find ways you can avoid the triggering situations, or reduce the likelihood that the situations will make you angry. Using the example of the rushed morning, you could wake up earlier, put alarm clocks in your kids’ rooms, or shower the night before.
When you find yourself getting angry by the usual situation, you could think to yourself, “I am always getting mad at this time of day. I am always going to feel stressed out when this happens. It will be over in a few minutes, I don’t need to get angry.” You can also try using some relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation to prepare yourself.

, If you feel yourself getting irritable, fidgety, anxious, sweaty, or whatever physical symptoms you normally have when angry, try to find a way to take remove yourself from the situation before you get even angrier. Learn the physical cues you feel when you start getting upset.For example, you always feel your heart pounding and a tightness in your chest when you get angry. Pay attention to your body and know you need to take steps to stay calm if you begin to feel that way.
Try to excuse yourself for a few minutes to regroup. You could go to the bathroom or step outside for a second to collect yourself.
If you are not able to step away from the situation, but are feeling yourself angering, you could try a quick relaxation technique or taking some deep breaths.

, Most likely, you try your best most of the time, and do your best to generally treat other people with kindness and courtesy. Understand that most people are just like you, doing their best and trying not to step on anyone else’s toes. So when you find yourself getting angry, stop and think about how, most likely, this person is just trying to get through their day, the same as you are, and likely doesn’t mean to cause you trouble.For example, you could tell yourself, “Jamie is just a child, that’s why he keeps asking you the same question,” or “Mary likes to chat with everyone, that’s why she’s coming over again while you’re working.” You might also remind yourself of times when you have lost your temper to have some compassion for other people who are going through the same thing.
This is an especially good thing to keep in mind when you are dealing with low-level customer service representatives who have little power in their ability to change policies. If you are frustrated with the level of service you are receiving, you could say, “I understand that you probably do not have the power to change this policy. I am not angry at you, but at the situation. Can you please direct me to someone who can better help me manage this problem?”

, Correct your thought patterns and avoid using “always” or “never” when describing a person or situation to yourself. These words will make you feel more quick to anger because you will feel like your anger is justified.Telling someone “You always do this” or “You never do that” will also put them on the defensive and escalate an argument and anger.
Instead of saying (to yourself or to another person) “You never throw your dirty laundry in the hamper!” you could say, “I had to pick up Bill’s socks again. It makes me mad when he does this.”

Sit down.,
Try some gentle stretching.,
Go for a walk.,
Take a timeout.,
Go outside.,
Tense and relax your muscles.",How to Stay Calm when Infuriated3," If you’re standing up, try sitting down to dispel your anger. Sitting, lying down, or otherwise attempting to make yourself comfortable can help trigger your brain to help you relax. Your body associates relaxed postures with being relaxed.If you are standing during a confrontation with another person, you could say, “Let’s sit down and try to work this out.”
If you can’t sit down, try not to pace or tense your body. Soften your stance as much as possible. You can also try visualizing yourself relaxing on your bed or sitting in your favorite comfortable chair.

, Stretching can help relax your muscles and release tension. Even just a minute or two of gentle stretching could help you relax and re-center yourself.Focus on the areas where you normally hold tension, such as in your neck, jaw, or shoulders, and work on loosening up the muscles in these areas.


You could also try yoga to relax. If you are familiar with some poses, take a minute to do one that you find relaxing and centering. If you are unfamiliar with yoga, try taking a class to learn some great stretches!

, Spend a few minutes walking to calm down. Getting outside is ideal, but if you can’t, walk around your office, home, or school. Aerobic activity can help lower your stress levels in just a few minutes.Exercising daily can help your stress levels stay lower all day, even before you get angry. You could get into the habit of taking a walk every morning or evening.
If walking isn’t your favorite activity, you could try some other aerobic exercise to receive the same stress-reduction benefits, such as biking, running, or swimming.

, If you find yourself unable to remain calm in the situation, excuse yourself from the person or environment before you lose your temper. Figure out where you could go for a few minutes to collect yourself, or schedule another time to deal with the situation if possible.Just make sure to come back to the discussion. Don’t use the break as an excuse to abandon the conversation altogether.


You could say, “I need to excuse myself for a few minutes. I’m finding this upsetting and need to collect my thoughts.”
You could say, “This conversation is upsetting, and I want to talk to you with a clear head, without anger. Can we reschedule this meeting for tomorrow? I need some time to think.”
Excuse yourself and head to the bathroom, your car, or somewhere you can be alone for a few minutes. If the person who is making you mad follows you, you could say, “Please leave me alone for a few minutes. I’m afraid I am going to lose my temper.”
Find a quiet place to meditate. Meditation has been found to lower stress and anxiety levels, as well decrease irritability.Apologize upon your return. You could say, “Thank you for your patience. I’m sorry to make you wait. I needed to calm down.”

, Exposure to a park or other green space for just a few minutes a day can be calming and restorative. If you are feeling yourself getting angry, find a way to take your timeout outside. Better yet, use that time to get in a short walk.Your break doesn’t have to be long. Studies found that just five minutes outside had positive effects on a person’s mood.

, Use progressive muscle relaxation if you feel tension in your body. Try tensing muscles and relaxing them, beginning from your lower body and working all the way up to your head.Sometimes we are given the advice to pound a pillow or take our anger out on another object. This only increases your hostility. If you feel anger or tension in your body, try progressive muscle relaxation to help dispel it."

Assess the situation to determine if someone is being bullied.,
Size up any danger an intervention could pose.,
Approach the victim, not the bully to diffuse the situation.,
Bring the victim to a safe area where you can meet with responsible adults.,
Talk to other kids about how they should not put up with bullies.",How to Be an Upstander (a Bystander Who Stops Bullying)," Sometimes, it’s not as apparent that someone is being bullied or harassed so take a few seconds to size up what’s going down.


Evaluate the person who you believe is being bullied. Obviously, if he/she is crying or looking visibly upset in reaction to what another person is saying or doing, you can conclude that bullying is occurring. However, if the person seems to have shut down or is not reacting, you may need to observe what the alleged bully is doing or saying to that person.
Identify who you believe is the bully. Physical violence certainly constitutes bullying; so does stalking, verbal, and even written assault as well. Pay close attention to what the possible bully is saying or doing to determine if he/she is bullying another person. In addition to pushing, hitting, or using a weapon against another, demands the other person do something, stealing, spreading rumors to the other person’s detriment and ongoing harassment fall under the bullying umbrella.
Observe how others are reacting. Are other people simply walking by as one kid hits or insults another kid or are administrators or other kids intervening? If an adult or school official is actively addressing the situation, make a mental note about what happened (in the event you need to intervene in the future), but allow the adult to handle the situation.;
, You certainly do not want one person to systematically harass another; however, you need to make sure that your and others' safety is not at risk.


Does the bully or the victim have a weapon? Often, if the weapon is concealed, you may not readily know. However, look for protrusions around the sock area, in pockets, around the waistband, or inside a coat.
If you believe either party has a weapon, either immediately get adult assistance, or call the Emergency Services. There is no reason for anyone to become wounded as a result of the incident, plus you may not be physically or mentally prepared to handle a knife or gun being pulled.
Is the bullying incident primarily physical or mental? Is the bully verbally “picking on” another person, or is he/she using physical intimidation or violence? The method in which the bullying is being delivered should be taken into consideration before you intervene.

, You don’t want the situation to continue to escalate, so instead of getting into the bully’s face, make it about the victim instead.


Even if you do not know the victim, make up some sort of story that you need his/her help. Pretend you know the person, walk directly up to him or her during the incident, and let the victim know that his/her assistance is needed immediately.
Insist the victim leave with you and have him/her accompany you to a safe area. Be confident and forceful with your approach, making it appear that this person must leave as soon as possible with you no matter what.
Find an area away from the group (especially the bully) to talk to the victim. Ask him/her if he/she is okay and inquire about what was happening. If possible, try to get the entire story that may include past incidents.
If the victim has been injured, ask him/her about the pain, where he/she hurts, and what happened. Contact an adult immediately or call the Emergency Services if extreme.

, Help the victim find his/her way to help immediately by either heading to the principal’s office, or, if necessary, a police station.


Make sure the victim is going to get help and/or receive medical attention. As a responsible person, it’s your duty to ensure that once you’ve gotten the victim away from the bully, he/she receives the necessary help.
Ask the victim if he/she wants to contact his/her parents. In some cases, the victim may not want to talk to parents about what happened. While it is important for parents to get involved your role is to mediate and assist. If the victim says ""no,"" remind the victim that his/her parents will be instrumental in getting the bully to stop what he/she is doing. However, allow the victim to make his/her own decision.
Remain with the victim in case adults want to ask you questions about what happened. Witnessing the incident makes you an important part toward solving and preventing bullying in the future. Be accessible to adults and answer any questions truthfully, providing as much detail as possible.

, It takes more than one person to stop bullying so be an advocate and an example for others.


After a specific incident, talk to your friends or other bystanders about what they were thinking and what they wanted to do about what they witnessed.
Ask an adult if the school could host a workshop or plan an assembly addressing bullying and what kids, especially bystanders, should do if they witness it.
Remind kids that by not doing anything or even joining in with the bully makes them just as culpable.

Plan your mall visit ahead.,
Look for places that can provide some respite in your visit.,
Look for ways to reduce the stress of a mall visit while you are there.,
Try to visit when you feel at your best and on a full stomach, rather than when you feel tired and hungry.,
Shop mindfully.",How to Stay Peaceful when Mall Shopping," If you can access a map online, you will be able to find the shops that interest you, the bathroom facilities, eating areas and suitable parking. This should help to relieve some of the stress of the visit; planning ahead is a good for dispelling some of the anxiety that you might be feeling. Also, if you don't enjoy parking in mall car parks, have a friend or family member drop you off and collect you so that you can avoid this additional anxiety, or visit when there won't be so many cars parked.;
, Some examples of ways to find ""peace"" in the mall include:


Finding a good cafe to stop and have a cup of tea or coffee in
Visiting the bathroom for a break from the noise, to have a freshen up
Find a garden store with plants. Plants break up noise and garden stores are often less brightly lit and more open to outdoor light
Visit the foyer of a cinema. If the shopping center has a cinema, these often have very large and darkened foyer areas where you can sit on soft seats and chill out for a bit. Have a drink while you're resting!
Have a rest near large potted plants. These will give you a little privacy and cut off the glare of the lights and throngs of passers-by.
Post offices, bookstores and bookstore cafes are often wonderfully quiet compared to other places in a mall.
Have a massage! Some malls offer these services; have one to unwind!

, Perhaps you can block out some of the noise with an MP3 player; or wear sunglasses if the lights are too bright. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing so that you don't have to worry about slipping, tripping or just feeling too ""constricted"". Have your packages stored somewhere so that you don't have to carry too much around with you. It pays to consider all of the ways that you can reduce the impact of the noise, crowds and bright lights on your frazzled nerves.

, If you feel tired and hungry before you have even started, then you will have a very hard time of it and will be driven by the need to eat and rest rather than feeling energetic.

, Don't wander aimlessly and without purpose. Instead, visit with a list and a time deadline so that you can get in and get out doing just what is required and no more. It can also help if you have phoned places in advance (or looked online) to check that stock is available.

Speak to your doctor.,
Outline your symptoms.,
Learn about the potential risks.,
Apply a topical anesthetic.,
Inject steroids and/or anesthetic into the nerve.,
Experience numbness and pain relief.,
Keep a ""pain log."",
Return for additional injections.,
Explore other treatment options.",How to Get an Occipital Nerve Block," If you suffer from head pain, head aches, or tender scalp consult your doctor to decide whether or not an occipital nerve block is right for you. There are several reasons why your doctor may not recommend a nerve block (or not right away).An occipital nerve block, may not be right for you if:

You are allergic to any of the injected medications
You currently take blood thinning medication
You have an active infection
You have diabetes (depending on a number of factors)
You have heart disease (depending on a number of factors);
, The occipital nerve governs specific areas of the head and scalp. As such, an occipital nerve block may be able to relieve very specific types of a head pain. When you speak to your doctor, you will need to explain all of your symptoms, in as much detail as possible. This will help your doctor decide if an occipital nerve block might help.Occipital nerve blocks are generally used to treat:

Migraines
Cluster headaches
Spondylosis
Tender scalp (with may be a sign of an irritated nerve)
Pain on one side of the head or the back of the head (usually zapping, shooting, or burning pain).

, An occipital nerve block is a simple, minimally invasive procedure that is considered safe. However, like all medical procedures, it does carry some risks.Though rare, these include:

Infection
Bleeding
Damage to the nerve
Swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site
Raised blood sugar levels (from steroid injections)

, When you go in to have your occipital nerve block, a topical anesthetic will be applied to the base of neck, where your doctor will insert the needle. This may in the form of a cream, gel, or spray. You will then wait several minutes for the topical anesthetic to take effect., You will then lay down on your stomach. Your doctor will carefully insert a very small needle into the base of the occipital nerve, which is at the back of the head just above the neck. Through this needle, your doctor will inject steroid medication and/or anesthetic that will block the signals coming from your occipital nerve.Your doctor may opt to inject only anesthetic to numb the nerve, or a mix of steroids and anesthetic to reduce inflammation while numbing.
There may be some discomfort as the needle goes in, but it will be minimized with the topical and local anesthetic used as well as the very small needle., For most people, the effects of the injection should occur very quickly, often within moments. For others, noticeable pain relief may require up to one week to take effect.If you do not experience relief within 1-2 weeks, it is possible that your occipital nerve is not the source of your pain.
Your doctor may opt to do a second injection and/or explore alternative treatment options

, The length of time that occipital nerve block pain relief lasts can vary greatly from person to person. The way the nerve block effects you can give your doctor clues about the best long-term treatment plan for you. As such, it is a good idea to maintain a ""pain log,"" where you briefly jot down your level of pain (as well as any other symptoms) each day. Try using a number system (such as 1-10) to describe your level of pain., If your pain is severe, your initial treatment plan may include doing a secondary injection 1-2 weeks after your initial occipital nerve block. Furthermore, if the injections seem to be working, you will likely need to return for another injection when the pain relief begins to wear off. You and your doctor will work out a treatment plan for if/when you will return for follow-up injections.For some people, a single injection quells the pain. However, most people will return for follow-up injections at some point.
The amount of time the pain relief can last will vary widely from person to person.
It is rare to do more than three occipital nerve blocks over the course of six months (as this increases the risk of side-effects and complications).
If you need more than three injections within the span of six months, your doctor may suggest alternative treatment options.

, If the injections do not provide sufficient or long-enough lasting pain relief, your doctor may wish to explore alternative treatment options.Some of these include:

Cutting a nerve
Relieving pressure on a nerve
Administering small doses of a poison or radiofrequency energy, to slowly kill nerve cells
Inserting an occipital nerve stimulator

Know the costs of the procedure.,
Discuss the procedure with a dermatologist or practitioner.,
Visit a certified specialist or facility.,
Prepare to provide before and after photographs.",How to Get Collagen Induction Therapy1," Microneedling is not a cheap procedure and is not covered under insurance. You will need to undergo multiple sessions, along with buying products to help post-treatment.


Some places charge per facial zone. For example, you may be charged $100 per facial zone. Other places may charge based on the area, for example $90 for one scar, or $150 for eyes.
A few places provide deals where you get a free zone if you purchase multiple zones.Some places will give discounts if you do combined packages, such as face and neck, or face, neck, and hands.
Other places charge $100-$300 per treatment, depending on the area.Neck CIT can from $150 to $250.
Before you get the treatment, schedule a consultation to discuss what areas you would like and the overall price for the entire procedure, including follow up visits and any post-care products.;
, Before you undergo CIT, you should discuss it with your dermatologist or other medical professional. Determine why you want this procedure and if the procedure will yield the results you want.Discussing the treatment with a practitioner can help determine you are suitable for treatment.
This discussion also allows you to ask any questions to make sure you are knowledgeable about the procedure., CIT is available through spas or at-home treatments, but these can cause scarring and damage. You should always get CIT at places with medical professionals since the procedure breaks your skin.The inexpensive rollers or needle devices used at spas or sold for at-home treatment can have needles with poor quality. They are also shorter than ones used by professionals, so they can be less effective.
CIT should be done so that the needles are inserted into your skin at a 90 degree angle. This reduces the risk of scarring and trauma. Inexpensive devices are not generally angled properly or can get bent, which may cause scarring.

, Many places will take a before photo prior to your first treatment. Then, after a month or more, they will take an after photograph.These photographs are used to show a comparison of your skin pre and post treatment.

Cleanse and numb the face.,
Undergo the treatment.,
Expect redness for about a day.,
Follow post-treatment care.,
Return for follow-up treatments.,
Consider at-home CIT for minor cosmetic use.",How to Get Collagen Induction Therapy2," The first thing that will be done when you get CIT is to have your face cleansed and sterilized. After your face is cleaned, the practitioner will apply a topical numbing cream onto the affected area. This will be left on for 20 to 30 minutes.Since the procedure requires the use of needles, a numbing agent is used to ease pain or discomfort. However, you still may feel some discomfort or minimal pain.

, Your treatment will either be done via a needle roller or a needle pen. The practitioner will move the roller or pen over your skin, puncturing the skin in evenly space wounds.This procedure takes anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and a half, depending on the extent of the area being treated.
Most people find the treatment uncomfortable, but not extremely painful.

, After the treatment, your skin will be red or pink for 12 to 24 hours.Most people can return to work the day afterwards.If you have sensitive skin, your skin may be redder longer. If extremely long needles were used, it might take longer for the redness to subside, too.Some people might experience slight swelling or bruising.
Your skin might be warm, itchy, or tight after the procedure. Others might peel. This is normal.

, You should follow all post-treatment care your practitioner provides. This helps keep your skin from scarring or becoming damaged.Stay out of the sun for two days after the treatment. Wear hats, scarves, or other garments to cover your skin if you have to go outside for 24 hours after the procedure. Stay out of tanning beds after the procedure.
Only use lukewarm water to clean your face for two days after the treatment. Gently pat the area dry. Don’t rub the area.
Don’t touch the area with dirty hands. This helps reduce risk of infection.

Ask for advice.,
Look for silver linings.",How to Stay Calm When Things are Chaotic," The best on-the-spot solution for combating stress and tension is deep breathing. This technique stimulates the body’s natural relaxation response, slowing down the breaths to allow more oxygen in which minimizes anxious feelings.Find a comfortable place to sit with your back straight or supported by a chair. Place on hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Take a deep cleansing breath in through your nose for 4 counts. Notice the hand on your abdomen expanding outward. The other hand should move only a little.
Hold the breath for 1 or 2 counts then exhale slowly from your mouth for 4 counts. As you release the air, the hand on your stomach should gradually deflate. Continue the exercise for approximately 5 minutes.;
, There are many types of meditation. One useful form, called mindfulness meditation, involves focusing on the present moment. You focus your attention on your breath, a repeated mantra or phrase, an object in the room, or on the flame of a candle. Increasing one’s mindfulness is associated with decreased rates of anxiety, stress, and depression, so this form of meditation can be incredibly practical for staying calm during chaos.Find a quiet, distraction-free environment where you can sit comfortable without being disturbed. Sit up straight, either on a cushion or in a chair.
Find a point of focus (e.g. your breath, the wall ahead of you, etc.). Observe your point of focus without judgment. When you find your mind straying from this focus, gently guide your attention back without criticizing yourself.

, You can practice visualization on your own or through an abundance of free guide imagery videos available on YouTube. Visualization allows you to enter a state of relaxation by imagining yourself in another environment, a peaceful place.Sit comfortably. Choose a setting that is relaxing to you – a beach, a rainforest, or a special place you knew as a child. Engage all of your senses.

, There is something especially therapeutic about pulling out a notebook and pen to unload your thoughts and worries. When you find yourself getting caught up in unfortunate or distressing circumstances, it can be helpful to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper.


There is scientific evidence that journaling helps you to understand yourself and your thoughts and feelings, solve problems, minimize stress, and come up with solutions to disagreements., In truth, it’s hard to know when you are letting your current situation or surroundings aggravate you unless you are self-aware. Self-awareness is the practice of becoming conscious of your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and actions.Becoming more self-aware can clue you in on your unique personality traits, how you learn and adapt, your values, and your abilities.

, Step one in the process of becoming self-aware is to listen to your self-talk. What kind of things do you say to yourself? Do you say nice things about yourself or others?Set aside a few minutes each day to sit in silence and pay attention to your thoughts. Write these thoughts down to see if they are positive or negative.

, Grow into a careful observer of your thoughts and feelings by tuning in to the sensations you experience. You can know when you are overwhelmed, frustrated, or ashamed by the way these emotions impact your senses.For example, going red and warm in the cheeks, or blushing, could be a sign of embarrassment. Feeling tightness in your chest or being short of breath can point to anxiety or distress. Balling up your fists or clenching your teeth could symbolize anger.

, You will face many problems in your life - some small, some big. It is in your ability to adapt and grow from stressful situations that you become resilient. There are 10 ways to foster resilience:Refrain from labeling stressful events as insurmountable. It is not the event, but your interpretation and reaction that determines how you move forward. Choose to believe that things can and will get better.
Trust yourself. When you view yourself positively and believe you are capable of handling life's problems, you develop greater resilience to those problems.
Connect. Stressful events seem less daunting when you have a positive support group on which you can lean on or accept help.
Be good to yourself. Exercise. Eat well. Attend to your emotional needs. Practice regular self-care.
Be a solver. Rather than denying problems or running from them, take action on the things you can control as soon as possible.
Avoid exaggeration. Stop letting your mind blow things out of proportion. Ask yourself, ""how much will this matter in 1 year or 5 years?""
Embrace change. Change is an inescapable aspect of life. Know that life is a constant ebb and flow - bad won't last forever, neither will good.

Be optimistic. Have faith that things can improve in your life.
Discover yourself. In the midst of chaos, look for ways you can learn from the situation.
Set realistic goals. Aim to do something daily (or weekly) that pushes you closer to reaching your goals. Doing this builds motivation and self-confidence to accomplish bigger goals in the future.

, Simply throwing back your head for a mighty guffaw has the power to lift your mood and shift your perspective. Other benefits of laughter include its ability to help you fight disease, minimize pain, lower anxiety, and build connections with others.The next time the chaos of life is getting you down, find something that makes you laugh.


Some ideas are hanging out with your silly best friend who is always a ball of giggles, playing with a small child, or watching funny videos and movies.

, Want to know if you are overreacting about a situation? Ask a trusted friend. Sometimes, it takes talking about a situation aloud for us to recognize that things aren't as bad as they seem.Pull aside a close friend and tell this person what's been going on in your life. See what her reaction is to the situation. She may be able to offer helpful advice for changing what you can, or looking on the bright side.
You can even ask a friend to hold you accountable. When you find yourself overreacting or getting too stressed about life, tell your friend to call you out and remind you to relax.

, Choosing to search for the positive in stressful or upsetting situations is a life-giving trait. When you consciously strive to find the silver linings in ""bad"" situations, you can reduce depression, improve your relationships, and enhance stress-coping.Try this exercise to help you find the silver linings in negative events:


Get out a sheet of paper and a writing instrument. Create a list of 5 things for which you are appreciative (e.g. ""a job"", ""my health"", etc.) This portion of the exercise helps you enter a more positive line of thinking.
Now, think of a situation that did not go so well lately. Maybe the event caused you anger, frustration, or disappointment. Briefly describe the situation on paper. Then, list 3 things that allow you to look on the bright side of the event.
For example, maybe you made a bad grade on your English essay. The bad grade gave you the opportunity to: 1) get to know your English teacher better; 2) utilize the campus writing center for tutoring; and 3) improve your English grades in the future.

Do not draw attention to yourself (e.g.,
Do not fight back!,
Don't talk to them.,
Don't react to the bully's rude remarks.,

Do not give them the attention they clearly want.,
Kill them with kindness.,
Don't be scared of the bully.",How to Avoid Bullies," try to act ""cool"", or do outrageous things), this makes it more satisfying for the bully to bring you down.;
, This is inevitably the worse thing you can do when dealing with bullies. This will create more repercussions, which is the last thing you want.

, Leave them alone. Talking to them will give them a chance to be mean or disrespectful to you.

, If he or she calls you names or bags you out, don't ignore him or her, just smile and walk off. You need to make sure that you do not express any distress or the bully will thrive off this.

, Try to make small talk with them when they are alone. Listen to them and be genuinely interested in what they are saying. After all, the more people you have on your side the better.

, Bullies want attention, as well as them being jealous, mad, disliked, and possibly insecure. Know that many, many people in this world think that the only reason why bullies act ""that way"" is because they are insecure about themselves. This could be true, and it could not be true. Either way, keep in mind that they want attention. Don't tell the bully that they are insecure, follow these steps above and don't give them the attention they want.

, This means to say something nice ""back to them"" when they insult you. For example, if they make fun of your hair, which is probably the least they will do, tell them that you like their hair as well. Whatever you do, be sure to stand up for yourself and others, but don't be mean. You will get in trouble and keep in mind that it can easily backfire, no matter how much they do it and remain untouched.

, One of the reasons you may actually desire to avoid them is, yes, because of the bullying, but also because you may be scared of the bully. Realize that they are human, and there is not one reason to be scared of them, even if they are violent. If you are still scared, do not show them that.

, You aren't protected by the same constitutional rights that normally apply when you are at home.


Some schools call the police for even the most minor fights or other public displays of anger like punching lockers or throwing things.
In some states, the same laws apply on or off school grounds, if there is proof that the fight began at school. You will be in trouble with the school, and the police as well.

, When weapons are involved, violence escalates immediately and can quickly get of control.

Be confident.,
Stay within eyesight of an adult.,
Hang out in groups.,

Have a failsafe response ready.,
Take control of the conversation.,
Talk to someone.,
Report them.",How to Avoid Getting Into Trouble in a School Fight3," To stay out of trouble, plan in advance how you will handle a confrontation if it happens.

Know how to get to cover.,
Learn basic self defense moves.,
Avoid being overconfident.",How to Avoid Getting Into Trouble in a School Fight4," Cover can be anything that offers you momentary safety. Be aware of your surroundings, and don't allow yourself to be boxed into a corner.Cover can be distance – if you can remove yourself from the situation, your attacker can't get to you. Plan your escape route in advance.
Cover can also be a physical barrier, like getting to a bathroom or supply closet and locking your attacker out.

, The best way to avoid getting into trouble is to remove yourself from a fight before it happens. But if you are attacked by a violent person and can't get away, you will need to defend yourself as best you can. You can't really learn these moves without practicing them, so sign up for self defense classes before trying them in person.Make a fist and swing upward, hitting your opponent's nose squarely with the heel of your hand. The upward movement carries a lot of force, and is easier to pull off than a boxing-style punch.
Kick your attacker's knee by using your foot in a horizontal stomping motion. Be sure to take aim first, and strike suddenly before they expect it.
Use the instep of your foot or your knee with as much force as possible to connect with your opponent's groin with an swift, upward motion.
Alternate your strikes between face and body – when your opponent goes to protect one vulnerable area, they will leave another area open to attack., Even if you have been taking self defense classes and doing well, never assume you will win the fight. There are too many things that can go wrong, and you can never predict the outcome. If you let the situation get out of control, you are far more likely to get caught and get into trouble.


If you underestimate your opponent he or she may catch you off-guard, and hurt you.
You are far more likely to get caught if you are reckless – you won't pay enough attention to your surroundings and witnesses.

Don’t take negative comments personally.,
Stop blaming yourself when someone is making negative comments.,
Avoid getting back at others by making mean comments about them.,
Avoid responding with physical violence.,
Don’t be afraid to speak up and talk about what is making you feel bad.,
Stand up for yourself through assertive communication.",How to Avoid Caring About What People Say2," Remember, you are not the negative comments someone makes about you and you don’t need that person’s validation. That person has their own reasons for being mean and those reasons have nothing to do with you.Try telling yourself something like, ""Her comment is only one of many. I can't make everyone happy, but I can make myself happy.""

, It is not your fault that some people have a tendency to be negative. Let them be unhappy if they wish. Just realize that you are not to blame for their negative attitude.


To avoid blaming yourself for the comments someone makes about you, try saying something to yourself like, ""I wonder if she has had a hard day? It seems she is taking it out on me. I hope she feels better tomorrow."" Or, ""I know her comment has more to do with her than with me. I'll focus on what is more important, which is what I think - not her.""

, When someone says something mean about you, it can be tempting to say something equally mean in return. Doing so makes you just as bad as that person, though. Practice being the type of person you want to be and don’t stoop to the level of those who are negative. , When someone is constantly pushing your buttons by making rude and hateful comments to you, there might be times when you feel like turning around and punching them. You know that fighting is never the solution, though. Using physical violence to deal with someone who acts like a bully will probably lead to more violence. Choose to walk away.

, No matter how much you work on developing positive habits and limiting negative reactions to mean people, there might still be times when their words get to you. When you feel that way, find someone to talk to about it.Friends or family members can remind you of everything they like about you and help you brush off those negative comments.
If you are still in school, speaking to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor can help you deal with the negative comments and realize that none of those things are true.

, When someone says something mean about you, it’s normal to want to either say something mean in return or to hide from that person. However, both options lead to a negative outcome. By saying something mean back, you are acting just like the other person. By hiding, you are avoiding the situation and will likely continue to feel bad about it.


You can be assertive and stand up for yourself in a positive and respectful manner.
When someone says something mean to you, try saying something like, “I don’t appreciate the mean things you said about me. They aren’t true and I won’t listen if you say things like that.”
It’s okay to let some time pass before speaking up so that you no longer feel so emotional about the situation.For example, if someone at school or work says something rude to you, give yourself a day or two to get past the hurt feelings before letting them know how that made you feel.

This type of worry is often very difficult to control, and can interfere with relationships, work, and other parts of life.;
, A person with anxiety is often depressed and moody due to the effects of constant fear and worry. They may lose interest in things that used to give them pleasure and have trouble with alcohol or drug abuse as a way to forget about their anxiety.

, A person with severe anxiety may begin to have suicidal thoughts or engage in self-harm due to depressive symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness and guilt.

, A person with anxiety often avoids objects, places, or situations which make them feel helpless such as heights, social places, work etc. as a method of coping with their anxiety. However, this avoidance often makes them even more anxious in the long run.

, Due to exaggerated feelings of tension and worry, a person with anxiety may decide to self-medicate, or use chemical substances such as alcohol or cigarettes to suppress the symptoms of anxiety such as nervousness.

, When a person feels overwhelmed by their anxiety, they may start to hyperventilate (breathe deeply and rapidly), and feel as if they can't get enough air in their lungs. Other physical symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, sweating, shortness of breath.

, A person with anxiety is often highly sensitive and will often get angry or upset at the slightest provocation.

, There are certain risk factors which make a person much more prone to developing anxiety. These include:



Trauma: Children and adults who have been victims of abuse or have witnessed a traumatic event are at a high risk of developing anxiety at some point in their lives.

Illness: People with a health condition or terminal illnesses such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, cancer, and others can often develop significant worry and anxiety about treatment, and what their future holds.

Stress build-up: A series of stressful life situations may finally trigger excessive anxiety. For instance, the death of a family member followed by frozen bank accounts.

Mental disorders: A person diagnosed with a mental health disorder such as depression will often experience anxiety symptoms. Unrealistic worry or fear also accompanies other mental health disorders such as OCD, phobias, and others.

, This class of drugs includes fluoxetine, paroxetine and others. They work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin by specific brain nerve cells. As a result, more serotonin (also known as the happy hormone) will be released, thus easing symptoms of anxiety.


The initial dose of Fluoxetine is 20 mg every morning, followed by a maintenance dose of 20-60 mg. 20 mg of paroxetine is taken orally every morning, with a maintenance dose of 40 mg for up to 4 weeks.
Common side effects of SSRIs include sleeplessness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction, but the side effects are fewer compared to tricyclic antidepressants.

, SNRIs are a class of drugs with a dual mechanism, as they include both duloxetine and venlafaxine. They inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and neropinephrine in the brain cells, increasing the levels of these hormones and enhancing a person's mood.


60 mg of duloxetine is administered orally once a day and 75 mg of venlafaxine is taken orally every day, with a maintenance dosage of a 75 mg increment every 4 days; the maximum dose is 225mg per day.
Side effects of SNRIs include insomnia, stomach upsets, headaches, and a minor rise in blood pressure, among others.

, This class of drugs include diazepam, alprazolam, and others. They are used for short-term anxiety management. They promote relaxation as well as reduce muscular tension.


Also known as Valium, diazepam is taken in 2 to 10 mg does, 2 to 4 times daily, depending on the severity of symptoms. Alprazolam is taken in 0.25 mg doses 2 to 3 times daily, with a maintenance dose of between 1 to 10 mg.
The main problems with Benzodiazepines are tolerance and dependence, as long-term use requires increased doses to achieve the same relief.

, This a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy where a person with anxiety is exposed gradually to situations and objects that trigger their fear, and they learn to become less sensitive to these triggers with time.


To deal with symptoms such as constant worry, tension, and hyperventilation, the person with anxiety is taught relaxation skills such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation.
Later in treatment, the person is later exposed to their trigger situations and encouraged to practice the relaxations skills they learned.

, This type of therapy allows a person with anxiety to accept their condition without judgment, and encourages them to commit to a behavioral change.


In a one-on-one session, the client is often taught skills for accepting stressful experiences, and learns to place them in a different context. This helps them to see the situation with more clarity, and puts their anxiety into perspective.
This process involves accepting negative experiences and facing up to uncomfortable thoughts. The client is then encouraged to develop a healthier, more positive attitude to their problems.

, This is a short-term supportive psychotherapy aimed at addressing interpersonal issues. It often involves 12 to 16 sessions, one hour every week.


The initial session often begins with gathering information about the person's depressive nature and personal experiences. This is followed by unlearning the depressive thoughts and managing personal experiences that cause anxiety.
Behavioral homework, such as personal observation of the anxiety symptoms, is usually assigned.

, Friends and family members are imperative in the life of a person with anxiety, especially during recovery, as they can offer understanding, support, and help.


Unfortunately, people with anxiety often do not feel like socializing, and they spend a lot of time alone, which can make recovery harder.
It's recommended that they participate in social activities and accept social invitations. Being connected with other people increases feelings of confidence and well-being.

, Exercising is a valuable tool in managing anxiety symptoms. It naturally alters the levels of brain chemicals such as serotonin, and endorphins that lift a person's mood.


Being physically active enhances mood, increases energy levels, improves sleep and appetite, distracts and blocks negative thoughts and worry, increases socializing opportunities, and enhances well-being.

, Healthy eating habits can help to curtail anxiety symptoms. A healthy diet is fundamental for improving mental and physical health. A nourishing diet also enhances a person's sense of well-being.


Plenty of fruits, whole grains and vegetables will boost the production of serotonin, inducing a calming effect and improving brain function.

, The most helpful kind of support often comes from people who have experienced similar problems. Support groups provide opportunities for people with anxiety to connect, share experiences, and develop ways of dealing with their difficulties.

Determine if the work is right for you.,
Research organizations online.,
Look for employment.,
Apply for a volunteer position.",How to Work on a Suicide Hotline1," Working on a suicide hotline can be a high-pressure and emotional experience. You may be dealing with multiple stressful situations per shift that require immediate assessment. You may also need to be comfortable with not having any follow-up to your work. That said, there are many benefits to working on a suicide hotline, too, including:Helping people in times of extreme crisis
Developing crisis counseling and listening skills
Making a difference in your community
Providing individuals with community resources for continuing care in their time of need;
, Determine what agencies are near you, and/or which particular hotline would be the best fit for your values, schedule, and experience. Some national hotlines partner with local organizations to take their calls. You may need to apply directly with the local agency for a position. There are different types of organizations and ways to connect with those in need:


National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a national hotline that works with local crisis centers: http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/.
The Trevor Project provides crisis intervention for LGBTQ youth: http://www.thetrevorproject.org/pages/volunteer.
IMAlive is an online, chat-based suicide prevention agency: https://www.imalive.org/index.php.
The Veterans Crisis Line allows Veterans to connect with someone via live chat, text, or phone call: https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/.

, Look for job opportunities through the organizations you are interested in, or look on a job board that caters to your area or skill set. Submit your application per the agency’s requirements, and go on an interview if requested.


The qualifications to work as a crisis hotline employee will vary depending on the state and organization you work for, as well as, the level of crisis intervention you are providing.
Many organizations will put their new employees through certified training as there are key things or phrases one needs to listen for, or ask questions about to ensure the caller is connected to the most appropriate level of care.
If you want to be employed by a crisis hotline, you will likely need, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree in psychology or human services. A master’s degree in a counseling or social work program could further help you take on direct counseling or supervisory roles.
Keep in mind that for certain roles within the organization, you may require licensure by your state’s human services regulatory agency. These requirements vary by degree, license, and state., If you have a long-term goal of being employed by a suicide hotline, you can gain experience and skills by working as a volunteer for a suicide or crisis hotline. Having volunteer experience will look great on future employment applications.


Check out your local shelters. Domestic violence shelters in particular are always willing to accept volunteers. These places are generally short-staffed and have very little to no funding to pay for another employee. The more free help they can find, the better. In addition, you will get experience providing crisis intervention face-to-face with clients to really hone on your skills.
It is always good to start off volunteering for an organization of preference and connect with others with experience. Through this connection, you get a feel of this line of work and decide if it works for you. Also, connecting with an experienced crisis hotline worker, and/or crisis counselor will help you identify what level or type of crisis work you wish to do. There are many different levels, each offering their own set of responsibilities, pay, and different levels of required education and experience.
Remember, you can still help at a suicide hotline even if you are not taking calls! Help is always needed for fundraising, events, marketing, and administrative support."
"
Be open and honest about the “suicide question.” Asking someone if they have a plan to kill themselves does not mean that you are planting a seed in their mind to do it.,
Establish trust and rapport.,
Paraphrase.,
Empathize.,
Use “say more” expressions.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Provide necessary resources.",How to Work on a Suicide Hotline2," Do not be afraid to ask “Do you feel suicidal?”; or, “Do you feel like you want to kill yourself?”If the caller responds that they do feel suicidal, continue to ask direct questions to assess the following:


Lethality — Dangerousness of the plan, and is there potential for rescue if needed
Intent — The level of desire and intent to act on ones suicidal thoughts
Caller history — Is there a history of suicidal ideation? Were there actual attempts in the past and thought-out plans, or were these passive suicidal thoughts? Are there self-harming behaviors, and if so what are they? (i.e. cutting, burning, pulling out hair, hitting head on door/wall, etc.).
Substance abuse/use history — Do they currently drink alcohol or use drugs? Do they have a personal history or family history of substance abuse?
Symptoms — Feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness?
Mental health History — Does the person have a history of mental health concerns, current psychosis, delusions, or hallucinations?
Medical concerns — Are there any immediate medical concerns that require treatment?
Coping skills — Does the person know of any healthy ways they can cope with their feelings?
Support system — Who or where are their primary formal and informal support systems?
Protective factors — There are some factors that can reduce the likelihood that the person will attempt suicide. Do they have supportive family and friends? Access to medical and mental health care?
Other concerns and factors that might cause this crisis— This might include lack of housing, no financial income, loss of loved one, or loss of belongings or employment. Are there other family/friend relationship problems?
If a person has a plan, a timeline, and a means to kill themselves, they should be considered high-risk and not left alone. Keep the person talking to you, and take their statements seriously.

, Focus on acknowledging and validating what the person is feeling. The more comfortable a person feels with you, the more they will be willing to disclose and allow you to help. Connect with them in a kind, nonjudgmental way.Keep your opinions to yourself. You may not agree with certain aspects of this person’s lifestyle. If you find yourself feeling judgmental, try putting yourself in their situation. Imagine what you would want to hear from someone if you were in crisis.
You could say something like, “I know you took a lot of drugs tonight, but right now, my priority is keeping you safe tonight. Do you have somewhere you can go right now?”

, Paraphrasing means to restate what someone says, usually using different or fewer words. The goal is to understand what the person means. It is beneficial to the listener to see if they were correct in their interpretation of the speaker’s words, and it is beneficial to the speaker to know if they are being understood.For example, the statement “I feel like I can’t get out of bed in the morning. I feel like I can’t stop crying most days,” might be effectively paraphrased as “It sounds like you are feeling very depressed.”
Even an incorrect paraphrase can help you achieve better understanding. It shows that you are putting effort into listening to the speaker, and it gives the speaker an easy opportunity to correct the listener.
For example, say the listener paraphrases the sentence, “I don’t think I can take it anymore” as, “You sound really tired.” The speaker could correct them and say, “No, I feel miserable and hopeless.” This helps the speaker clarify their feelings, and helps the listener stay on the right track.

, Having empathy means to be able to understand and identify another person’s emotions, as well as the ability to imagine what the other person may be thinking, feeling, or experiencing. When you empathize with another, you are “putting yourself in their shoes.”Expressing empathy for the other person allows that person to evaluate, clarify, and/or identify their own feelings. The person expressing the empathy may allow the other person to hear their emotion expressed in a different way, bringing further clarity to their emotions.For example, say a caller in crisis is expressing suicidal thoughts because they feel all alone in the world. In the last year, they have had several people close to them die. You could say, “That sounds devastating. You must be grieving these losses so badly right now.” The caller may not have put together that their feelings of loneliness are connected to their grief.

, These are ways to keep the person talking about a particular topic and explore deeper feelings. You can also deploy one of these sentences if you are feeling stuck in a conversation with someone, and you want to keep them talking, but aren’t sure where to go with them yet.These include questions like, “Could you tell me more about what happened?” or statements like, “I’d love to hear more about that.”
For example, if someone says, “I just don’t want to live anymore,” you could say, “Could you help me better understand what is making you feel that way?”

, Keep the person talking by limiting your use of “yes” and “no” questions, and instead, asking questions that require the person to explain, describe, and express their emotions.Give them space to answer the questions. Be comfortable with silence. They may be formulating their response.You could ask something like, “How did you feel when your son said that to you?” or, “When you said, ‘I don’t think he ever wants to see my face again,’ what do you mean by that?”

, This may include giving the person a referral for ongoing clinical care, support groups, education and information, resources for financial support or finding housing, etc. If the person needs immediate or emergency care, know the protocol to connect them."
"
Follow your agency’s protocol.,
Follow your QPR training.,
Get training on different populations.,
Ask for help.,
Prepare for deep emotional impact.",How to Work on a Suicide Hotline3," You will receive a thorough training before becoming a suicide hotline worker. Your training should indicate steps you take in every call, resources available, how to troubleshoot situations, and who to ask if you need help. Make sure you understand all of these steps before you begin taking calls. If you do not understand something, ask.


You will receive hands-on training, including participating in role-playing exercises, answering mock phone calls, and watching other workers take calls, before you answer calls on your own.Make sure you follow your agency’s rules on confidentiality, for both you and the client. Some agencies have you use an alias to protect your identity. While it may feel frustrating to not be able to follow-up with the person who called you, understand that it helps you focus on staying in the moment to prevent a crisis, and not dwelling on things you may not be able to change., QPR (Question, Persuade, and Refer) is a suicide-prevention technique that anyone can learn and use, whether you work in a crisis management capacity or are just a concerned citizen. Those trained in QPR learn suicide warning signs and become “gatekeepers,” or people in a position to recognize a crisis and suicide warning signs.Question the person about suicide directly. Talk to them about any suicidal ideation, plans, timelines, or means. Assess their immediate risk.
Persuade the person to get help. Be a supportive listener and empathize with their concerns. Then you could say, for example, “I want to make sure that you have a way to stay safe right now. Who can you call right now who can come over and stay with you?”
Refer for help. Assess their support network and other protective factors (relationships and behaviors that reduce likelihood of suicide). Utilize some of these support systems already in place to get them help. Your hotline may have additional resources to which you can connect your caller., Understand that different cultures and groups of people may have different needs and concerns. If you are working in an area that has a large population of a group of people with whom you are not familiar, you may want to have some additional training on common problems and how to work with that particular community.


For example, you may want to take additional training courses on how to help suicidal youth, LGBTQ+ individuals, the elderly, or veterans.Check with your organization to see if they offer in-house trainings on different populations, or if they recommend outside organizations that can help you.

, If you are on a call trying to manage a difficult situation, or if you feel like you are unable to be an effective helper for this caller, follow your organization’s protocol to get assistance. Remember that different people are more susceptible to different emotional triggers than others.


Keep your ego in check. Remember, it’s not about you, it’s about helping the caller survive. Do whatever you can to keep the caller safe, even if that means asking for help.

, Know that in your role as a hotline counselor, you will likely be exposed to many difficult situations. Understand you may even hear a person attempt and/or complete suicide over the phone. Your training will help you develop effective strategies to handle your own emotions while working on the hotline.Connect with other volunteers and supervisors on your hotline to prepare for difficult calls, and to for suggestions on how to take care of yourself after particularly traumatic calls.

"
"
Talk to other staff members or volunteers.,
Take a break if needed.,
Practice self-care.",How to Work on a Suicide Hotline4," Reach out to other hotline workers who are coping with the same feelings as stresses as you are to talk about your highs, lows, and problems. You may also end up making some new friends.


Following a difficult call, connect with a supervisor or other designated person to help you debrief and address any emotional impact. Reaching out for your own help will help keep you strong and focused to continue to help others., If you are feeling drained, emotionally depleted, or overwhelmed with other stressors in your life, talk to a supervisor at your agency. Let them know you need a break. Because of the stressful nature of suicide hotline work, there should be plans in place to help you manage your stress effectively and avoid burnout.


Learn to recognize your own signs of burnout. These may include symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, detachment, or depression.You could say, “I have been dealing with so much stress in my life over the past couple of weeks. I don’t think I can do a good job answering calls right now. Can I take a few days off, or work on something that doesn’t require client interaction?”

, Because you will be giving so much of yourself in order to help callers in places of crisis, be sure that you have effective ways of taking care of yourself. Self-care is an intentional action that meets your physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual need. Self-care looks different for different people. Some ways you might consider meeting your self-are needs include:Physical needs: Go for a walk, get a massage, or make a special meal for yourself.
Mental needs: Take up a new hobby you’ve always wanted to learn, create an art project, or listen to a podcast about something that interests you.
Emotional needs: Listen to music that relaxes or inspires you, make a donation to charity, or attend a support group meeting.
Social needs: Call your loved ones, go out to dinner with friends, or smile at strangers and strike up conversations.
Spiritual needs: Attend a religious service if you are religious, meditate, pray, or connect with nature."
"
Refocus on your “why.” When you become disconnected from your personal mission or purpose, experiencing anxiety can immobilize you.,
Set a goal.,
Take the first step.,
Seek advice from others.,
Challenge yourself regularly to build resilience.",How to Turn Anxiety Into Action1," On the flip side, when your purpose is clearly defined, it’s easier to move forward into the action phase.


If you have become detached from your purpose, sit down and reevaluate the principles, people, and causes that drive your life. Make a point to fill your day with activities that bring meaning to your existence. If they don’t, toss them or delegate them.
For instance, public speaking might fill you with anxiety, but you are more likely to push past this fear when you are speaking about a cause close to your heart. Add meaningful challenges to your day to take action against anxiety.If public speaking still fills you with anxiety, take on smaller challenges first and build your way up to speaking in public.
Do not start with your biggest fear or worry. Instead, start with smaller concerns to help yourself build confidence.;
, Goal-setting is another way to use your anxiety as fuel. Take notice of your anxious thoughts and worries. What are you most concerned about? What are your biggest fears? Instead of shaking in your boots, get to work developing a plan that allows you to overcome these fears.Let’s say you are worried about failing your algebra class. You can take action against this anxiety by creating an action plan to minimize the likelihood of it coming true. You might have steps like “Find a math tutor,” “Ask the instructor for extra credit,” or “Spend two hours studying each day.”

, After you have determined what your goals are, you must immediately move forward into fear. Oftentimes, anxiety-sufferers spend too much time planning without ever bringing those plans into fruition. To prevent yourself from getting stuck in analysis paralysis—that is, worrying about which next step is the right one—just take a step forward. Identify one small action you can take to move you closer to reaching your goal and do it.For example, in the previous example, you might need to “Find a tutor” to improve your math grades. Don’t spend too much time analyzing how to obtain a tutor. Consider the simplest route forward and take it. Send an email to the tutoring lab at your school. Ask a clever classmate. Or, catch your instructor’s eye after class to see if they have a recommendation.

, Anxiety often debilitates us because we keep quiet about it. We keep our worries and fears close to the vest out of concern that others will think less of us, or take advantage of our shortcomings.


It requires vulnerability, but you may find that talking about the source of your anxiety with a trusted friend or acquaintance may help you view it more objectively. As a result, you might receive advice or encouragement that propels you from paralysis into action.Reach out to someone you trust and speak candidly. You might say, “Hey, Tom, I know this might come as a surprise, but I have a fear of heights. Our flight next week is really freaking me out.”
Don't stop yourself from confiding in other people by overthinking it and assuming your friend will judge you. Choose someone you trust, and try talking to them.

, Think of your resilience to anxiety as a muscle. The more you use the muscle, the stronger it becomes. Rather than avoiding those situations that provoke anxiety, gradually expose yourself to them more often. When you do this, you will find that, over time, they lose their power.Don’t let fear and avoidance make you complacent. Make an effort to build resilience by challenging yourself to face your anxiety regularly. For instance, if you loathe public speaking, you might benefit from signing up for a local Toastmasters club. Doing so will allow you to practice speaking in front of a group more often, which will reduce your anxiety.
Don't necessarily start with your greatest fear. Getting over smaller anxieties first can build your confidence.

"
Step back and look at the situation.,
Consider the best and worse cases.,
Tell if you've had enough.,
Attempt to deal with the problem.,
Ask for help from other sources.,
Know when to leave the situation.,
Say goodbye and and don't feel guilty.",How to Tell when You Are Fighting for a Lost Cause," Before you go jumping into a decision that one way of looking at things is the only way, take a step back and breathe. Have you looked at all of the possible outcomes? Take a pen to paper and decide whether your problem is minor or major. If it is an immediate large problem you are dealing with then weigh the possible outcomes of all your possible moves. However, if you have time, no matter the size of the problem, slow down and really think about your options. Don't act in a matter of hours or days. If this problem is as serious as you're thinking it is, it should be dealt with, but at the right time and properly.;
, Think about the best possible resolution of the situation. If everything went right, what would that look like, and what would the result be? Then consider the worst possible resolution. What would happen if everything went wrong? Consider the likelihood and desirability of each of these cases.


If there is no case with a desirable result - if the best case scenario is not a very good result - then chances are, you're fighting for a lost cause.

, While thinking about the problem and looking for advice constantly can help in some situations, it might just wear you down. Sometimes, the situation has been really nagging at you, it's under your skin and it won't just go away. Are you having trouble sleeping because of it? Do you find yourself often dwelling on it when you should be working or paying attention to something else? Does the problem affect you on your 'you-time', the time when you clock-out of work or school and go home to be with your family or friends? If you answered yes to any of these questions, it might be time to stop fighting and let it go.

, If it's a problem that can be controlled or fixed by a person, such as a boss or friend, have you talked to them? Tell them your side of the story, tell them how it makes you feel, and directly make it known that you are unhappy with the situation. If you have talked to the head of the problem, and knowingly they have done nothing to help your situation, then it's not going to change. You are fighting a losing battle. Change does happen slowly though, so be aware that while it is possible, it does take time.

, If you've gotten nowhere trying to work with those involved to solve the problem, turn to someone outside it. Approach a family member or friend, tell them what's going on, and then ask them to all help you. Consult a therapist or other professional for expert help in coming to terms with the situation, or ask people experienced in conflict resolution for advice.

, If it's not going to get better, or if solving the problem will bring up other issues, it might be better just to let it go. If you feel that all your efforts to resolve the conflict or fix things are failing to achieve any results, or if you've tried everything you can think of, to no avail, consider stepping back and walking away from the situation. It's better to leave the problem and move on than to continually dump your time and energy into a virtual black hole in an effort to resolve it.

, No matter how hard it was for you to say goodbye in a bad situation, remember that you did it to better yourself. You did this because you are an equal person to everyone else and you deserve to be happy too. It doesn't matter who they are, if they are not willing to accept that, then they were not worth your sorrow.

Keep a journal.",How to Treat Acute Stress Disorder," In order for a condition to be characterized as ASD, the patient must have experienced a significant emotional stressor less than a month prior to showing symptoms. The trauma usually involves a death, fear of death, or physical and emotion harm.By knowing if you or someone around you has experienced this sort of trauma, you can more effectively asses if ASD is the cause of these symptoms. The most common causes for this trauma are:Interpersonal traumatic events, like assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting.
Being the victim of a crime, like robbery.
Motor vehicle accidents.
Mild traumatic brain injuries.
Industrial accidents.
Natural disasters.;
, There are a number of symptoms that can denote ASD. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which is the universal manual of mental illnesses, if a patient exhibits the following symptoms after a significant trauma, it is possible that he or she is suffering from ASD. The symptoms must last more than 2 days and less than 4 weeks to be considered ASD., Dissociation is when someone seems as if they've withdrawn from the real world. This is a common coping mechanism for people who have experienced significant trauma. There are numerous ways a person can dissociate. Three or more of the following symptoms indicate ASD.A sense of numbing, detachment, or absence of emotional responsiveness.
Reduced awareness of surroundings.
Derealization, or feeling that the external world isn't real.
Depersonalization. This is when someone feels as if their feelings or experiences aren't their own. Victims of trauma may convince themselves that the event was experienced by someone else, not them.
Dissociative amnesia. The person may block out or forget the entire trauma or aspects of the event.

, Someone suffering from ASD will re-experience the traumatic event in a number of ways. If you or someone you know is reliving a trauma in one or more of the following ways, it is an indicator that ASD is present.Recurrent images or thoughts of the event.
Dreams, nightmares, or night terrors of the event.
Flashback episodes detailing the experience. This can be quick flashes or very detailed events where the person actually feels like he or she is reliving the trauma.

, The patient will experience distress on exposure to reminders of the traumatic event. He or she will often avoid situations or places that bring back memories of the event. If you notice someone deliberately avoiding certain situations or places related to a trauma, it is another indicator of ASD.The victim will usually experience symptoms of increased anxiety, over-arousal, or hyper-vigilance when approaching the reminder.

, A further criteria for ASD is that the symptoms experienced significantly interfere with the sufferer's life. Evaluate yours or another person's day to day life and see if these symptoms are causing significant problems.Look at how your work is affected. Are you able to concentrate on tasks and get work done, or is it impossible for you to concentrate? Do you experience reminders of the trauma while working and are unable to continue?
Look at your social life. Does the thought of going out cause anxiety? Have you stopped socializing altogether? Have you tried to avoid things that remind you of your trauma, and therefore cut out certain social situations?

, If you or someone you know fits the preceding criteria for ASD, then professional help is needed. Fortunately ASD is treatable, but you have to act as soon as possible. A medical professional can evaluate the condition and begin the appropriate treatment.Where you should start depends on the situation. If you or someone near you is having a severe crisis, feeling suicidal or homicidal, or becoming violent, you should call 911 right away. After the crisis passes, you can seek further psychological help.
If you've been having suicidal thoughts, you can call the suicide helpline at 1-800-273-8255.
If you or the person you're concerned with is not currently experiencing a crisis, you can make an appointment with a therapist or similar mental health professional.

, Currently, CBT is considered the most effective treatment for ASD. It has also been found that treating with CBT early enough helps prevent ASD from developing into PTSD, a similar condition with more long-term effects.CBT for ASD focuses on changing the way you perceive risk associated with the trauma you experienced, and the focus is to process the trauma in order to desensitize you to the triggers you have developed around your trauma.
Your therapist will educate you on the physical, emotional, and psychological responses to trauma so that you are better able to recognize your triggers and responses. Your therapist will also explain how and why the process is important to desensitize you to the experience.
Your therapist will also provide relaxation training to use during anxiety responses outside the office, as well as to use in session while verbally processing the trauma or imagining the trauma and describing it out loud.
Your therapist will also use CBT to help you reframe your experience and help you to overcome survivor's guilt if necessary. For example, in the case of ASD, the patient may have experienced a car accident that caused a death. He may now be terrified of getting into a car because he feels he will die. The therapist will work out how the patient can think about this in a different way. If the patient is 25 years old, the therapist may say that the patient has been getting into cars for 25 years and didn't die, so statistics are in his favor.

, Psychological debriefing involves a mental health intervention very quickly after a trauma, ideally before symptoms have developed into ASD. The patient will undergo an intense therapy session to talk out the whole trauma with a professional.The drawback of this treatment is that it must be done very soon after the event to be effective.


The effects of psychological debriefing are considered inconsistent. Some studies find that psychological debriefing has no long-term benefit for victims of trauma.This should not discourage you from seeking psychological help, it just means that your counselor will probably use different treatments if debriefing proves ineffective.

, In addition to one-on-one therapy sessions, group treatments can also help individuals suffering from ASD. These sessions are usually overseen by a mental health professional who will guide the conversation and make sure all group members have a positive experience. A support group can help prevent feelings of loneliness and isolation, because you'll be around people who have had similar experiences.Like psychological debriefing, there is doubt that group therapy is effective when treating ASD, though participants might enjoy the level of camaraderie that develops in group sessions.

, Often, ASD leads sufferers to fear particular places or situations that remind them of the trauma. This can be a significant hardship on the person's life, because he or she may stop socializing or going to work to avoid reminders of the trauma. If untreated, these fears can develop into PTSD.With exposure therapy, the patient is gradually exposed the the stimulant that causes anxiety. The hope is that this exposure will gradually desensitize the patient to the stimulus and he or she can face it without fear in everyday life.
The treatment often starts with visualization exercises. The therapist will have the patient visualize the stresser in as much detail as possible. Gradually these sessions will progress until the therapist accompanies the patient in facing the stresser in a real-life scenario.
For example, a patient may have witnessed a shooting at a library, and is now afraid to enter a library again. The therapist would begin by having the patient visualize being in a library and describe how he or she feels. The therapist may then decorate the office like a library, to make the patient feel like he or she is in one, but still knows it is a controlled environment. Finally, the two of them would go to a library together.

, Like all prescription drugs, medication for ASD has a risk of dependence. Because of this, it is common to find these drugs sold illegally on the street.Never take any medication that your doctor hasn't prescribed. In the wrong doses, this medication can worsen your symptoms and even cause death.

, SSRIs are considered the first-line medication for treating ASD.They work by altering the levels of serotonin in your brain, which helps improve mood and lessen feelings of anxiety.This class of drugs remains the most popular treatment for a number of mental health disorders.


Common types of SSRIs include sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro).

, amitriptyline and imipramine have been shown to be effective treatment for ASD. Tricyclic antidepressant work by increasing the amount of norepinephrine and serotonin available to the brain.

, Benzodiazepine is often prescribed to reduce anxiety, so it can be beneficial for people suffering from ASD. It also works as a sleep aid, which helps alleviate the insomnia that often goes along with ASD.Common types of benzodiazepine include clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).

, Relaxation practices have proved to be very effective in improving overall mental health. They reduce the symptoms of stress, and can help prevent relapses of ASD. They can also help treat the secondary effects of mental illness like insomnia, fatigue, and hypertension.


When you seek psychological help for ASD, your therapist will probably teach you several relaxation exercises. It is usually a part of cognitive behavioral therapy., A common and powerful tool for reducing stress is deep breathing. By using the right techniques, you can effectively lower your stress level and help avoid future problems.Take breaths from your abdomen, not your chest. This will pull more oxygen into your body and help you relax. When breathing, place your hand on your stomach to make sure your abdomen rises and falls when you breathe. If it doesn't, you aren't breathing deeply enough.
Sit up with your back straight. Alternatively, you could lie on the floor too.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Take in as much air as you can, and then exhale until your lungs are completely empty.

, Like deep breathing, meditation helps release stress from the body and lets the you achieve a state of relaxation. Regular meditation can help improve your mental and physical health by reducing your levels of stress and anxiety.In this process, the person shifts to a quiet place, concentrates on a single sound, and allows his or her mind to turn away from all concerns and thoughts of daily life.
Select a quiet place, sit comfortably, clear all thoughts out of your mind and concentrate on the image of a candle, or a word like “relax”. Do this for 15 to 30 minutes daily.

, People with good support networks are less susceptible to episodes and relapses of mental illness. In addition to family and friends, you can reach out to support groups for help and camaraderie.Share your issues with those close to you. Don't bottle up your feelings. Telling your family and friends what you're feeling is very important for building a support network. They can't help you if they don't know what's going on.
You can also reach out and find a support group in your area that specializes in your specific illness. Doing a quick internet search will probably help you find a group close to you.

, Keeping a journal has been shown to help reduce stress and anxiety. It is a liberating experience to get all of your feelings out, and most treatment programs for mental illness involve writing in a journal. Commit to writing for a few minutes every day to benefit your mental health.When you write, really try to reflect on what's troubling you. First write what triggered your stress, then how you responded to it. What were your feeling sor thoughts when you started to feel stressed?Analyze your interpretation of the event. Identify if you are entering a negative though pattern. Then try to re-balance your interpretation in a way that is more positive and avoids catastrophic thinking.

Create a personal anxiety mantra.,
Visualize a positive outcome.,
Burn off nervous energy with physical activity.,
Release anxiety through creative pursuits.,
Refrain from unhealthy coping.",How to Turn Anxiety Into Action2," In some situations, overcoming anxiety means faking it until you make it. You can steel yourself to enter anxiety-provoking situations by repeating positive affirmations that empower or calm you. You might try:”When this is over, I’ll be glad I did it”
”It’s hard now, but it will become easier with time.”
”I will not let anxiety stop me from reaching my goals.”
”Feelings come and go. This anxiety won’t last forever.”

, One of the most common fears is of the unknown. When uncertainty exists you might be tempted to not make any decision because you fear making the wrong one. Turning anxiety into action is much more feasible when you practice visualizing a favorable result.


Let’s say you are hoping to ask the girl next door out on a date. You might beat the anxiety and give yourself courage by envisioning the result you want. Do this several times each day leading up to the big event.
Close your eyes and imagine greeting her. She smiles when she sees you approach. You have a witty comment that gives you a surge of confidence. Then, you say, “I would really like it if you go to a movie with me on Friday. Will you?” She says, “yes.”

, Anxiety can feel like a live wire in your body. You can’t sit still or focus. Exercise is a great activity to make use of this surplus energy. As an elixir of life, exercise offers a host of benefits like fighting off illness and helping you manage weight. One of the benefits most helpful to you, however, is its ability to neutralize anxiety and improve your mood. Thanks to feel-good chemicals called endorphins, you will feel more relaxed after a good sweat session.


Transform your anxiety into action by going for a run, lifting weights, having a dance party with your best friend, or going for a swim in the neighborhood pool., Employ your creativity to bring order to the chaos happening in your head. Making art can allow you to ease stress, express yourself and take your mind off anxiety. Any art form will do. Try your hand at several different types to see which one works best for you.


Consider painting, writing, singing, knitting, baking, or even decorating. You may find that this activity becomes a regular hobby for you to find joy and fend off stress.Get started in whichever way is most comfortable for you. If you want, you can join a class, but if that does not work for you, you can just install an art app on your phone or buy some starter kits from a craft store.

, It can be tempting to numb or mask anxiety by engaging in unhealthy habits. This only makes you susceptible to developing an entirely new problem. Rather than numbing your anxiety with alcohol, drugs, excessive shopping, or gambling, turn to these other positive coping mechanisms instead.

"
Redefine anxiety by calling it excitement.,
Perform reality testing.,
Look for evidence that supports your perceptions.,
Ask yourself what’s the worst that can happen.",How to Turn Anxiety Into Action3," Just knowing that you are experiencing anxiety can sometimes be more debilitating than the thing you fear. Because both anxiety and excitement stimulate the same areas in the body—rapid heartbeat and production of stress hormones—you can trick yourself into thinking what you’re feeling is actually a positive emotion instead of a negative one.Research shows that anxiety places you in a “threat mindset” while excitement places you in an “opportunity mindset.” Re-label your anxiety and you can benefit from the experience of enthusiasm rather than nerves.The next time you enter an anxiety-provoking situation, don’t say “I’m nervous” or “I’m anxious.” Say, “I’m excited” and see what a difference it makes.

, You don’t have to become a slave to your anxious thoughts, giving them permission to get you all worked up. Put them to the test instead. Reality testing involves assessing a situation for errors in thinking.


For example, you think, “My parents won’t let me go to the party. All my friends will think I’m lame. They’ll stop talking to me.”
To assess the reality of this situation, you want to ask what evidence is there that says this is true? Did your friends actually call you lame? Are they avoiding you?, When you find yourself becoming anxious, check your thought patterns to determine how realistic they are. What evidence is there that your thoughts are false?


Using the previous example, ask additional questions. Did your friends make alternate plans to hang out with you instead of going to the party? Are they still talking to you?
If your friends don’t avoid you, odds are, they aren’t thinking anything negative. Your mind is just exaggerating the situation. A better way of thinking is “Not going to one party won’t ruin my friendships. There will be other opportunities to hang out.”, When you worry and fret about every possible outcome, you remain stagnant. You can take action against anxiety by actively considering every angle of a problem. Ask yourself logical questions that help you switch the focus to productive problem-solving.


For example, you fear that one bad performance review will lead to you getting fired. Ask yourself: “How do I know that I will get fired?” “Is this worrying productive or just wasting my time?” “How can I cope with getting fired if it does happen?”
Now, you might reframe your statement to “The worst that can happen is I will get fired, but that is unlikely. If I am fired, I will contact my network for any open positions. I can also update my resume.” This is a much more active, realistic approach to worrying.Put your worries into perspective to make them seem smaller. For example,one ""C"" or ""D"" on a quiz does not mean that you will fail the entire course.

Postpone your worries.,
Make a worry list.,
Approach work tasks with a positive attitude.,
Determine if the worry can be solved.,
Stop spending time with those that make you worry.,
Make your workspace yours.,
Be grateful for your job.",How to Work Through Work Related Anxiety1," This may sound easier said than done, but when you are at work, try to put off your worry. You should be focusing on your work while you are there, not worrying about things.


This helps break the habit of worrying at work by saving it for a later time instead of trying to ignore it. If you ignore it, your worries may build up. However, if you simply save it for later, your mind should be able to focus on your job.
If you find yourself returning to the worry, tell yourself that you will come back to it later and that you need to focus on the tasks at hand.Worrying can decrease your productivity and cause problems with your overall workflow.;
, One way to help you stop focusing on your worries at work is to write them down.Whenever a worry pops into your head, write it down on your worry list. Once it is written down, put it out of your mind to worry about later.


This list can be very cathartic and help you move past the worry by seeing it written out.You can write the list out by hand, create a document on your computer, or write them in a note on your phone or tablet. Just choose whatever way is most effective for you.

, When you are worried about a presentation or other situation at work, approach it with a positive attitude. Often, when you are worried about situations, you end up approaching them with negative, worried thoughts. Combat this with positive ones instead.For example, the morning of your big presentation, tell yourself “You have worked hard on this. You are prepared. You are going to do extremely well.” This will help you feel better and more confident about the situation instead of worry about it.

, Many people worry about things that can be solved if you apply a little problem solving. Think about your worry in a larger context of your job and your place of employment. Ask yourself questions such as:


Is this a problem I am currently dealing with, or is it just a ‘what if’ problem?
If it is a ‘what if’ problem, is it likely to happen?
Can I do something to solve this problem?
If not, do I know someone who can?
Is it my place to worry about it?, In some situations, there may be a coworker that that causes you to worry more. If you notice that there is a certain person at work that makes you more anxious or worry more frequently, try to spend as little time with them as possible. This way, this coworker will not be able to make you worry.


If you are unable to get away from this person, try having an honest discussion with your coworker about your worries. Keep the language about you and don’t blame your coworker for the worries.
For example, if your office-mate constantly reminds you of your worries, tell your coworker “I am trying to be more positive in my life and worry less, so I am trying not to talk about these things that worry me.” This way, you focus the change on you and don’t call your coworker out specifically for causing you to worry., You can try to combat workplace worries by making your work atmosphere more comfortable for you. This will make you feel at home while at the office and help you focus less on your worries. The happier you are by the things around you, the less likely you will be to focus on the worries.


Bring pictures of friends or family, your favorite cup, or a favorite action figure or knick knack. You can also post inspirational quotes or jokes to help you feel better throughout the day., Although there are always things to worry about at work, you should be thankful for the job you have. There are always worse situations you could be in or you could not have a job at all.


Take time to remind yourself of this whenever your worries take over."

Sleep and rise at consistent times.,
Maintain a balanced diet.,
Schedule in relaxation and fun.,
Do something daily to move you closer towards your goals.",How to Thrive in the Midst of Chaos1," Structure is an important ingredient for maintaining balance in life, particularly in chaotic times. While you may not be able to control various circumstances, you can control your bed time. Aim to wake up and go to sleep at the same times each day.A regular sleep schedule helps your body fight stress and anxiety. Getting to bed at a decent hour and waking up early ensures that you feel well-rested and capable to face whatever the day throws your way.
Strive to get 7 to 9 hours for maximum benefits. Shut off those electronics an hour before bed to help you unwind. Making your bedroom comfortable by lowering the temperature and the lights will also help you get good quality sleep.;
, Your diet is yet another tool you can use to give you fuel to take on life’s unexpected trials. Eating well gives you energy, a great mood, and improved cognitive skills to handle stressful situations. Make sure you eat nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day.


Give yourself the best chance of selecting healthy foods by preparing ahead. Use your Sunday or another convenient day to prep home-cooked meals for the week ahead. Include fruits and vegetables rich in stress-relieving antioxidants and high-fiber carbs like sweet potatoes. Avoid processed foods loaded with salt and sugar. Stay away from caffeine, too., When things are chaotic you can re-center yourself and reduce stress by setting aside to do things that are enjoyable. Whether it’s 10 minutes in the morning when you first wake up, or an hour at night before bed, take some time for you.Activities for relaxation may include gentle exercise like yoga, meditation, or simply going for a walk in the woods.Activities for fun might consist of having a movie marathon with your best pal, engaging in a hobby like painting or bowling, or reading the latest science fiction thriller.

, Chaos can make you lose site of the big picture and feel like your entire life is spiraling out of control. Take back the reigns by committing to goal achievement in spite of any uncertainty present in your life. Plus, adding a goal-oriented activity into your daily routine can help you feel more positive about your future.


Look at your major life goals and pick one small task you can do daily to help you reach them. For example, if you have been hoping to lose 50 pounds, don’t focus on the end result. Instead pay attention to what you can do each day to get there. For instance, you can eat a healthy breakfast or exercise for 30 minutes each day.
Set small goals for yourself as well. For example, instead of focusing on running one mile without stopping, you might focus on running for one minute without stopping. Then, increase the goals by 30 second increments each time you achieve one.

Wherever you are, as long as you're not at your house or something, you can probably locate a stranger.,
Walk carefully up to the stranger, or near them.,
Think about what you want to say to said stranger.,
After you go back to your house, you can tell someone you talk to about this accomplishment.",How to Talk to a Stranger if You Have Selective Mutism," Remember to be safe, and maybe a bit far away from them and call out. If you're at the mall however, and there are many people around, try to find maybe a woman with a stroller, as they're already a tad pre-occupied with their children, and are usually very safe especially in the mall environment  (to avoid being impolite, don't talk to someone that's on the phone or doing something else.);
, Easy so far, right? You can tap them lightly on the shoulder if you're afraid they won't hear you. Just don't sneak up on them and give them a heart attack!

, It helps if you think of something beforehand, so you don't stand there wondering what to say. After selecting this, say or call it to the stranger. Don't say anything rude or inconsiderate. You can compliment them, which is always an easy and safe road to take. Ex: I like your shoes. Or simply say, hi. Maybe mention the weather, or make small talk if your SM is not severe. You can also ask them a question, but this also takes more effort, as you have to wait for an answer and maybe say something else if they ask you something in return, so start out with statements instead, and work your way up. Then, you run away as fast you can if you want! Don't worry about making a fool of yourself, like a lot of people with SM do, because guess what, it's very unlikely that you'll see this stranger again, unless you live in a small town.

, It always helps to get feedback on your experience. If no one that you talk to is around, (or your SM is so severe that you don't talk to anyone in your household) keep in mind that other sufferers of the silence of SM are going through the same thing that you are. Congrats, and I'm sure you'll beat this pesky disorder soon enough!

Forgive others for your own good.,
Stop allowing yourself to be the victim.,
Repeat positive affirmations to yourself.,
Express your feelings.,
Revisit the past for positive reasons.,
Get the support you need.,
Focus on something positive.,
Reframe painful experiences as learning opportunities.,
Be mindful of intruding thoughts.,
Be open to others.",How to Let Go of Past Hurts," When you forgive someone who has hurt you, you are giving yourself a wonderful gift. You may experience health benefits, including lower blood pressure and better heart health, as well as psychological benefits, including less stress and fewer symptoms of depression. You will also be increasing your chances of having more successful relationships in the future.Forgiving someone who has wronged you is a sign of strength, not weakness. It does not mean that you condone the hurtful actions, but rather that you will not allow those actions to burden you any longer.
Forgiving a person does not necessarily mean reconciling with him. Depending on the situation, this may not be possible or it may not be a good idea. Forgiving simply means that you are letting go of any resentment you feel and any desire for revenge.
Try to be compassionate and empathetic to the person who has hurt you, as hard as it may be. It is important to understand that people often hurt others because they are hurting themselves.
You may have to forgive yourself as well if you bear some responsibility for your past hurts. It is important to recognize this responsibility, but don't hold on to it. Forgive yourself with compassion and understanding.;
, Although another person may be responsible for hurting you in the past, he is not responsible for your decision to continue dwelling on the past. The first step towards healing is to take back control of your life and realize that you have the power to make your future better than your past.When you continue to blame the person who has hurt you for everything negative that happens in your life, you are allowing him to control you. The next time you have a thought like this, consciously remind yourself that you are in control. Then try thinking of something positive you can do to help yourself feel better.
It can be very empowering to take control of your own recovery. In order to stop letting others control your actions and your emotions, make your own plan for how you will let go of your past hurts. You can take advice from others, but keep reminding yourself that you are the boss of your own life., If your past hurts have left you with damaged self-esteem, try taking a moment to think about some of your most positive qualities. Then remind yourself every single day that you are a wonderful, worthy person.Try different ways of affirming your self-love. Sing it, write it, or say it aloud or to yourself. Create a piece of artwork that incorporates the affirming words and keep it where you will see it often.

, Allowing yourself to express the pain and hurt you feel can be freeing. Try writing about what happened in a journal or write a letter to the person who hurt you (but don't send it). Getting it all out at once will help you to process your feelings and understand why you are still hurting., Revisiting the past is usually a negative thing, but if you choose to do it for the right reasons, it can help you move on from your past hurts. If you are holding on to guilt or other negative feelings about yourself, try thinking through the events of your past and reviewing them to figure out why you feel that way. Then consider all the reasons why your negative feelings are not grounded in truth.This exercise is best used for revisiting traumatic events for which you are unnecessarily blaming yourself. If, for example, you feel responsible for your parents' divorce or you feel that you are to blame for your partner's infidelity, revisit the event to help yourself understand the source of your negative feelings. If you take the time to analyze the situation, you will realize that the negative feelings you are harboring about yourself are not based in truth.
Be careful about placing too much blame on others. The point of this exercise is not to begin holding a grudge against someone else, but rather to recognize why you feel badly about yourself and to stop yourself from feeling that way.

, Depending on what kind of hurt you are trying to let go of, you might need different kinds of support. Don't keep your feelings to yourself if you feel trapped by them. Talking to someone can help you sort through your feelings, and sometimes it just feels good to let it out.Talk to friends or family members about your feelings, but make sure they don't have anything to do with the issues you are dealing with. They will be in a much better position to support you if they are completely impartial.
Look for a support group that addresses your issues (for example, a bereavement or childhood trauma group).

Find an individual or group therapist with expertise in past hurts or trauma recovery. Your therapist may be able to help you understand why you feel the way you do and learn how to overcome your negative feelings.

, If you allow negative thoughts and memories to consume you, it can feel like there is no room in your life for anything positive or happy. Instead of allowing this to happen to you, take the opposite approach: fill your life with so many positive things that there is no room for negativity.Choose to occupy yourself with something goal-oriented, like school or your career, or things that make you feel good about yourself, like volunteer work or quality time with your friends.

, Reframing negative thoughts can be very helpful in allowing you to move forward. Everyone experiences painful things at times, but finding opportunities for personal growth can help you move past the hurt.For example, perhaps you are hurt that your partner broke up with you. Rather than dwelling on the pain of this experience, try reframing it: ""I am hurt because I lost my partner, but I learned a lot from that relationship that I can take with me into the next one.""
Or, as another example, perhaps someone was unkind to you. You can reframe this as ""That person was hurtful, but I am strong and resilient and her behavior won't keep me down.""

, When you begin to think about what happened, gently move these thoughts away and remind yourself about what it is that you are currently focusing on in your life. It's okay the acknowledge the memory, but quickly replacing it with a reminder of something positive in your life will help keep you from dwelling on it.When you become preoccupied with thoughts about the past, try repeating the following phrase: ""Bad things have happened to me in the past, but it is now the present and I don't have time to worry about the past because I am focusing on _______.""
Alternatively, you can take a moment to list all of the positive things in your life. If you fill your mind with happy thoughts, there will be no room for the negative ones.

, If you've been hurt by someone in the past, it can be easy to assume that others will hurt you in the future as well. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking can cause you to enter into new relationships with anger. If you want to develop healthy relationships in the future you will need to do your best to leave your anger behind and to avoid assuming the worst of others based on what has happened to you in the past."

Connect with other empty-nesters.,
Say “yes” to more social invites.,
Start dating again.,
Lean on family for support.,
Consult with a therapist.",How to Deal with Empty Nest Syndrome As a Single Parent1," Spending time with other parents who have just emptied their nest can be comforting for you during this time, especially if the others are single parents as well. If you know other parents from your child’s high school or in the local community, reach out to them for connection.


You might say, “It’s amazing how much free time I have now that the kids are all gone. You want to grab a coffee together on Friday?” Offer a specific date so that the person understands you’re serious. Even if that day is no good, you’ll have a better chance of setting up something solid in the future.
You might also search for parenting groups or Meetups in your area for parents with adult children. In these groups, you can bond with others who are going through similar experiences.;
, When you’re juggling parenting responsibilities, a career and other life obligations it’s easy to say no to invites because you’re too swamped with other things. Now, you probably have more leisure time that needs filling, so train yourself to say “yes” when invited out to lunch or social gatherings — even if you don't feel like it!Between raising your kids, working, and other daily obligations, it's possible that some of your friendships have fizzled out over the years. That's okay, and it doesn't mean that you or the other party don't care about each other or no longer enjoy each other's company. Make the effort to re-energize relationships with people with whom you may have lost touch.

, Dating may have seemed impossible when you were still raising kids, but as an empty-nester, it may be a breath of fresh air to have a companion. Start slowly by connecting with the acquaintances of friends and family. Don't overthink the process — just have fun.Chat with a few friends or family members whose judgment you trust. You might say something like, “The kids are all out of the house and I think it's time I start back dating. Do you know anyone I'd like?”
If you're involved with a church or other religious institution, they may have groups for single or divorced people to get to know each other.
If you’re hesitant about jumping back into the dating game, give online dating a shot. Be sure to follow safe and appropriate online etiquette. Avoid giving your last name, place of residence, work, or any other personal details until you feel comfortable with potential dates. Always schedule your first dates in public places, and let a friend know where you are.

Set aside a time to worry.,
Embrace your worries.,
Stay focused on the present.,
Accept uncertainty at work.,
Take a moment to breath.,
Fake it until you feel better.",How to Work Through Work Related Anxiety2," Each day, set aside a specific time after work to come back to your work related concerns. Keeping this time in mind will help you push aside your worries during your work day. During this time, bring up your worry list and give your worries the proper attention.


This time period should only be around 20 to 30 minutes.
If you don’t want to do this every day, schedule your worry time every other day. If your schedule varies, you can make the specific time vary every day. Just make sure it isn’t over 20 to 30 minutes.
Make sure it isn’t too close to bedtime. You don’t want to fill your mind with worries right before you try to sleep. It may keep you awake or make it hard to fall asleep., This may seem hard to do at first, but one way to work through your worries is to accept them. When you are thinking about your worries, don’t feel guilty or bad for experiencing worry. Your feelings are valid and you have a right to them.


Once you accept your worries and the emotions attached to them, you will be able to start working through them., If you are constantly worrying about things that may happen at work, you aren’t being active in the present. Instead of focusing on your worries, keep yourself focused on what is going on around you. As soon as you start to worry, focus on how your body feels, the noises around you, and the rhythm of your breathing.


This is a mindfulness technique that will help you stay in the present., Many of the things you stress about at work may be due to uncertainty. It is often hard to deal with the unknown or things that aren’t set in stone, but these are exactly the kinds of things that you should not worry about.


If there are things that you cannot control in your work position, there is no reason to worry about them. There is nothing you can do about it in the first place.
If you find this hard, keep telling yourself that it is impossible to be certain about everything in life and that you can handle anything that comes at you., If you find yourself feeling anxious, take a moment to simply breathe. Close your eyes, letting what’s going on around you melt away. Take a few deep breaths, focusing on your inhales and exhales. After a few breaths, open your eyes and continue with the day.


This will calm you down so you can keep on working.You can even imagine you are breathing out the worries as you exhale. Imagine them floating into the air away from you.

, Although this may seem like you are repressing your worries, it is actually an effective strategy to help you deal with your worries. If you feel yourself getting anxious, pretend that you feel fine. Go about your daily work and interactions as if there is nothing going on. The longer you pretend you are okay, the better you will feel.


Try to vent your worries a little at home, but keep a positive attitude at work. Eventually, your mind will start to adapt to the way you act."

Make work tasks into games.,
Do fun things after work.,
Exercise before or after work.,
Create a bingo game out of your worries.,
Write stories from your worries.",How to Work Through Work Related Anxiety3," If you are worrying or stressing about things at work, take your mind off of it by making your work tasks into games. This will make your day to day tasks more pleasant and will help keep your mind off your worries.For example, if you have a ton of budget reports to get through, give yourself a treat of some sort for every three you complete. You can also give yourself points for how quickly but efficiently you do your job.

, Many people think going home and relaxing is the best way to fight dealing with work related worry. However, this can lead to more worry while you are at home. Instead, spend time doing fun things with friends or family.


This will help replace your work related worries with happy memories., A great way to release your worries, reduce anxiety, and improve your mood is to exercise. Exercise releases endorphins into your body, which act a natural mood lifters. You can try to get in some exercise before work to help you start your day off right or go after work to relieve stress from your day.


This can be a walk, a run, yoga, a dance class, or any other physical activity that you prefer.
You can also go for a quick workout during lunch if you are having a hard day.
This has the added benefit of helping to improve your health., Another way to relieve your worries is to make them into a game. Make bingo cards with all of your worries and stresses on them. This will help you detach from your worries a little and help you focus on something else.


For example, have a block for a reward to a less hard working coworker, criticism from your boss, or a rude customer. Whenever your worries and stresses come up, cover up that space. When you completed a whole line, give yourself an award., If you have a particularly worry heavy day, don’t just go home and dwell on it. Instead, write a story about the worrisome situation. This way, you can work out your inner anxieties about the situation and express your creativity at the same time.


Try making the story much more over the top and extreme than it actually was. This way, the next time a similar situation comes up, you can think about the more awful or extreme version to help get you through the moment. Plus, you now know that your situation could be a lot worse."

If you feel like you are reacting differently than other people, know that that is completely fine. Allow yourself to feel your own unique emotions and acknowledge your unique experience. There is no typical loss, which means there is not typical response to loss.Sudden losses, such as those due to trauma, accidents, or crime, may cause a stronger sense of loss (at least immediately) than more predictable losses, such as those due to terminal illness.;
, Death is a loss we must all deal with at some point in our lives. However, it is not the only type of loss. You can mourn the ending of a relationship or the loss of a beloved pet. It could be the realization that a cherished dream will never come to fruition. Everyone is entitled to their own grief, regardless of the cause. Do not be afraid to mourn. Acknowledge your emotions as a natural response.There are many losses you may experience in life. No loss is “greater” or “less” than any other. You simply feel how you feel about loss, and that is okay.
Other losses that may cause feelings of grief include leaving home, losing your health, losing a friendship, changing a job, moving away, graduating from school, or losing financial security. If you experience grief in response to an event like one of these, acknowledge that your response is natural., Mourning is a very individual experience--this article just offers a guide of sorts to help you through what you may experience.Avoid expecting yourself to “progress” through particular stages. This can actually keep you from mourning the way you need to for yourself.Elisabeth Kübler-Ross famously defined “five stages” of emotional reaction to death and dying in 1969. These stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. However, these were used to describe a person’s feelings regarding his or her own death and are not a theoretical framework for all grief or loss. References to these stages as universal stages of mourning or grief are inaccurate., Grief is the immediate, natural response to a loss of some sort. Grief includes your emotions and thoughts after you experience a loss. You cannot control your experience of grief.Mourning is a longer process that includes actively expressing your grief and adapting to the world after your experience of loss. It is an action that helps you process your grief.Many cultures and religions offer guidelines for how to mourn. Mourning is a process you can control to work through your grief.
Grief may feel like a rollercoaster. One morning, you may wake up and feel at peace with what has happened. Do not get down on yourself if the next day, you wake up feeling sad again--grief comes and goes.There is no true time frame when it comes to mourning. Your grief may stay with you for weeks or months. The full mourning process may take years, even a lifetime.

, Dr. J. William Worden suggests that we need to accomplish four “tasks” of mourning. These are different from conceiving of mourning as “stages,” since these tasks often must be completed simultaneously and can take years. These tasks are:Accepting the reality of loss. You must learn to accept loss as a reality both intellectually and emotionally. This can take time.
Processing grief. Grief in response to a loss is a natural emotional reaction. It does lessen over time, but the time it takes varies depending on your own needs.
Adjusting to the world after loss. There are a variety of adjustments that you may need to make after a loss, including external (such as living without what you lost), internal (questioning your new role in the world), and spiritual (finding new meaning after your loss).
Finding a way to connect with your loss while continuing your life. Accepting loss does not mean you must never think about the person or other situation that you have lost. Instead, it means finding ways to honor the connection you had while embarking on life after the loss.

, There are some common symptoms that people experience when they feel grief, but nobody experiences grief exactly the same way. Acknowledge your own feelings of grief while understanding that others may have different feelings or expressions.Expressions of grief vary widely not only between individuals but also between cultures and spiritual traditions.

, Some common physical symptoms you may experience during feelings of grief include:Changes in sleep patterns
Changes in appetite (loss of appetite or increase of appetite)
Crying
Headaches or body aches
Weakness or fatigue
Feelings of physical heaviness
Pain
Stress-related symptoms such as nausea, rapid heart rate, or insomnia
Weight loss or weight gain

, Grief is emotionally complex and deeply personal. You may experience many of these symptoms or only a few. At times, you may feel overwhelmed by emotions and other times you may feel numb. These are all natural reactions to grief. Some common emotional symptoms include:Shock or disbelief
Sadness, emptiness, or yearning
Loneliness or feeling isolated
Guilt or regret
Anger
Fear or worry
Panic attacks
Frustration
Anxiety
Depression
Questioning your spiritual or religious beliefs
You may also experience positive emotions, such as relief or peace, particularly if you have experienced a prolonged loss such as the death of a person with a terminal illness. These feelings can trigger feelings of guilt or disloyalty, as you may feel ashamed that you are experiencing positive emotions. Acknowledge that these feelings are also a natural part of the grief experience., Children, especially those who are younger, may express grief in recognizable ways but also in ways that are less familiar to adults. Be on the lookout for possible signs of grief in children, who cannot always adequately communicate their feelings through words. These signs include:Emotional shock. The child may appear much less expressive of his or her feelings than usual. S/he may refuse to talk about the loss.
Regressive or immature behaviors. The child may appear to “regress” to an earlier stage of behavior, such as needing to be rocked, experiencing separation anxiety, fearing going to school, sucking the thumb, wetting the bed, needing to sleep with a parent, or having difficulty completing tasks or activities that s/he usually does not have trouble with.
Explosive behavior and misbehaving. The child may “act out” or explode with sudden bursts of emotion. These emotions commonly include feelings of anger, frustration, confusion, or helplessness. Misbehaving in ways that are not common for the child may be a way for him or her to try to assert some control over the situation.
Repeating questions. The child may ask the same question repeatedly, even if given the same answer. This may signal that the child is having difficulty understanding or accepting the reality of the situation.
Defensive behavior. This is common in early school-aged children to adolescents. Defensive behavior attempts to “distract” the child from his or her feelings. S/he may get more engrossed in schoolwork, socializing, games, or other activities. S/he may also deny feeling loss to parents or authority figures but feel comfortable talking about feelings with peers.Physical symptoms. Grief and anxiety often manifest themselves in physical symptoms, particularly in very young children. Symptoms such as headaches and stomachaches are common.The child may also have trouble sleeping and may experience loss of appetite., Sometimes, you may experience so much grief for so long that it significantly impairs your ability to function in daily life. While all grief is complex, “complicated grief” refers to a process of mourning that does not lessen feelings of grief over time, and may even cause worsening emotional trauma. If you notice these signs in yourself or others, especially if you have been experiencing grief for some time, consider seeing a mental health professional who can help you process your grief. Signs include:Focus on little or nothing other than your loss
Extreme focus on or avoidance of reminders of your loss
Prolonged denial of the loss
Feeling that life is meaningless or purposeless
Inability to trust others
Inability to think about positive experiences or feelings
Extreme irritability or agitation

, In order to begin the healing process, you will first have to acknowledge the emotions you are feeling. Bottling your emotions up can make you even more unhappy, though on the outside you may appear to be fine. Instead of pretending like you are all right, allow yourself to feel every emotion that comes along with a great loss--sadness, anger, guilt, fear. Eventually you will be able to find new meaning in what has happened.Make sure that you give yourself time each day to just be by yourself. While you may feel like you need to act a certain way in public, you need to allow yourself time each day to let out your emotions. Whether than means taking some time to just sit and cry, or reflecting upon what you have lost, do so in a private space where you can really let yourself feel.

, How you do this is really up to you, but it is important to put your emotions into something concrete that you can see and feel. Doing this may help you make sense of what you are going through, and can help you to put your emotions towards doing something productive.This could be creating a scrapbook or photo album of your loved one’s life, writing in a journal each day, creating artwork like a painting or sculpture that expresses what you are feeling, or taking up something, like volunteering at an organization, that was important to your loved one.
Personal rituals may also help you process your grief. While we are accustomed to public rituals, such as funerals or sitting shiva, significant evidence suggests that personal, private rituals are equally important for expressing and processing grief. You may find that experiencing a reminder of your loved one, such as a favorite song or activity, causes feelings of sadness but also of connection to the loss.Physical activities, such writing down your feelings and then tearing up or burning the paper, may also be helpful. Do things that you find allow you to express your grief in a helpful way.

, No one can know exactly how you feel or what you are experiencing because each person mourns in his or her own way. If someone tells you that you “should” be feeling one way or another, don’t let this dictate how you grieve. Know that that person is only trying to help, and then continue to feel exactly how you feel.One good example of this is crying. Many people believe that crying is the best way to express grief but that eventually you should just stop crying. Crying if you feel the need or desire to cry will help you relieve tension and may help you feel better physically.It is important to remember, however, that some people don’t express their grief with tears, and that is perfectly fine. It is also important to remember that there is a not a timeframe for crying. You may cry over your loss years from when the loss actually happened, and that is okay too.Trying to make yourself feel a certain way because you feel you “should” experience that feeling is also unhelpful. Allow yourself to feel whatever it is you feel, even if your emotions are not what you expected or have been told is “acceptable.”, While we often think of mourning as a purely emotional thing, grief can cause physical changes as well. Lack of appetite, inability to sleep, and a lowered immune system are all physical reactions to grief. In order to combat these side effects, it is important to remember to eat healthy (even if you’re not hungry), exercise, and get enough sleep. When we take care of our bodies, we help lift our emotional and mental state.Eat a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Getting enough B12, vitamin D, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids may help relieve feelings of anxiety or sadness.Avoid highly processed foods and foods with a lot of fat or sugar. These may worsen feelings of depression.Avoid consuming too much caffeine, as it can increase your feelings of anxiety or depression.Get at least 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise per day. Numerous studies show that exercise can help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression.Try to keep a healthy sleep routine by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Visualization techniques and pre-sleep meditation may help with insomnia., Turning to substances, including food, to help one cope with grief is a fairly common behavior, but it’s crucial that you avoid it.


Turning to alcohol is response to grief is slightly more common among men than women.Alcohol is a depressant that can cause symptoms of depression and anxiety. It also interferes with REM sleep and can affect your judgment and your mood.The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that most women drink no more than 1 drink per day, and that most men drink no more than 2 drinks per day.If you believe you have a problem with alcohol, you can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration hotline at 1-800-662-HELP.Support programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous may also help you.
You may be prescribed medication to help you deal with symptoms of grief, such as depression. Use these as prescribed by your doctor. Avoid illegal drugs and substances, as they often make depression and anxiety worse and can seriously affect your judgment and mood.Experiences of grief and trauma may trigger eating disorders in some people. If you feel unable to control your eating behaviors, or the desire to control them too strictly, seek help from a mental health professional., A good way to lift your spirits is to do things that you love and keep busy. When you put your energy towards working on a project that you are passionate about, making art, or hiking in the woods, you are helping your brain secrete serotonin, the chemical that makes you feel happier. Doing something you love is also a good way to get your mind off of your loss, and puts your energy towards something other than grieving.If you feel comfortable doing this and think that it will help rather than hurt you, you might consider picking up a passion that your loved one was involved in. This might make you feel closer to your loved one. However, if doing the activity only inspires great sadness, you may want to try something else.

, In particular, holidays, birthdays, and other major milestones can trigger feelings of great sadness. Locations and other things, like a certain object or a type of flower, can also trigger grief. This is completely normal. It is important to come up with strategies, such as changing your schedule or having excuses to leave a certain place. For example:If you have recently lost a child and seeing children at the grocery store with their parents triggers your grief, plan on going to the grocery store at a different time of day when it is less likely to see children.
If you are planning on spending a holiday with your family, and you have recently lost a loved one, ask your family to help you come up with a way to honor that loved one during the holiday.
Focus on the good things about your relationship with your loved one. It’s important to acknowledge the feelings of grief that may occur after a triggering experience. Try to acknowledge that you feel grief because you had a deep connection to your loved one, and then think about something that makes you feel joy about that connection.
For example, you might feel sadness when you smell peach pie because your late grandmother and you always made peach pie together when you visited her. Acknowledge your grief about your grandmother, and then consider a way to honor your connection to her, such as making a pie on your own or looking through a favorite cookbook., This might mean soaking in a bubble bath at least once a week, or going to your favorite gym to get a workout in, even if you feel like you don’t have the time to do so. It is important to create time to let yourself do things that help you to relax.Yoga and meditation are both excellent ways to pamper the mind, body, and soul all at once. Let yourself simply be in the moment and let go of the negative energy you hold in your heart.

, It is important to have people to lean on during your time of mourning. While you may want to be self-sufficient, now is the time to let others care for you. A lot of the time, your loved ones will want to help but won’t know how, so tell them what you need--whether that is a shoulder to cry on, a friend to go to a movie with, or help with arranging a memorial service for your loved one.Let your loved ones, co-workers, and friends know what has happened if you feel comfortable doing so. Alerting them to your situation will help them to understand why they might find you crying in the middle of the day (which is a perfectly fine thing to do!).
Talking with friends and family members may also help you understand how your cultural background informs how you experience grief., Sometimes sharing your loss with those who have experienced a similar loss can be very therapeutic. Mourning can feel very lonely, even when you have friends and family by your side, so surrounding yourself with people who understand your loss can make it feel a lot less lonely.You can look up grief support groups in your community by searching online or looking at listings posted on community boards in your town.
If you are religious, you may also want to consider finding out if your place of worship offers support groups.

, If you feel like the grief you are experiencing is too much for you to handle alone, you should consider seeing a counselor or therapist that practices grief counseling. An experienced counselor will be able to help you work through the emotions you are feeling.A common myth about seeking counseling is that if you are getting support from family and friends that you don’t “need” counseling. However, a trained mental health professional can offer support that your loved ones cannot. A counselor or therapist can help you identify unhelpful ways of thinking or behaving. S/he can help you learn healthy coping techniques and ways to process your feelings. Seeing a counselor or therapist does not mean you are not well-supported elsewhere in your life. It means that you are seeking as many sources of support as you need, which is healthy and courageous., This could mean turning to your faith for support, or spending more time in nature or surrounded by things you love. If you follow a certain religion, take comfort in the mourning rituals that your faith defines. Meditating or praying can also bring you a sense of peace. If you are not religious but find peace walking through the woods or sitting on the beach, do these things. Perhaps the bonds of family are what you have faith in. Draw strength from the beautiful things that you believe in or love., Some people find that becoming involved in their community after experiencing a loss helps them feel more connected to others.You may find that engaging in a community service project that was meaningful to your loved one is a good way to honor him or her (or it, in the case of a pet).Or, you could memorialize your loved one by giving to a personally meaningful charity in his or her name.


Helping others can also help you feel better physically.Research has linked exercises of compassion and generosity, such as giving to charity or volunteering, to an increase in oxytocin, a hormone that promotes feelings of connection and wellbeing., Some people may expect that after a certain period of time you should stop remembering your loss, but this isn’t true. You may (and probably will) continue to remember your loved one long after the initial experience of loss.Allow yourself to remember your loved one.Try to focus on positive memories and things you loved about your relationship. You will likely still feel sadness, but you will also be able to feel joy and pleasure in remembering what made the person so special to you.Do not feel like you have to avoid remembrances or tokens of your loved one. It can be healthy and helpful to keep a beloved memento or photograph around. Do what feels best for you.

, “Getting over” grief is common goal, but mourning is more complicated than that. Loss changes you, and it’s important to acknowledge that. You do not “get over” grief, but you can learn to continue your life in a way that honors your loss and your own future., When you first learn of your loss, you may go into shock--your mind and body shut down in an attempt to keep you from becoming completely overwhelmed. You may find yourself disbelieving in the face of a death. This is normal.

, Denial is how our bodies and minds often react to the shock of a loss. Denial is what allows us to not become overwhelmed by all of the emotions and physical reactions caused by a great loss. You may not believe that your beloved is really gone. Slowly, however, you will find yourself beginning to acknowledge the reality of what has happened.If you are telling yourself, “this can’t be happening to me”, you are experiencing denial. Slowly, you will be able to come to terms with the fact that it did happen, and that you have the strength to get through it.

, You may find that you feel angry at your god, the doctors, even yourself because you believe you did not do enough to prevent your loss. Anger is an emotion that we can easily recognize and that is easier to control than other emotions. Anger can be directed at a certain person, event, or thing. What is important to recognize is that your anger is coming out of your pain and redirecting that pain into something that we can more easily understand.You may also feel guilt, particularly when you recognize that you are angry at someone that could not stop the event that has led to your loss. In turn, you may feel more angry that you feel guilty. Just know that these feelings will subside as you work through your mourning.

, Many people experience a time when they begin to think of all the what-ifs that could have been, and what they would do to change what has happened. You might find yourself thinking something like “I will never be annoyed with husband again if he would just come back to me.” You might find yourself dwelling on ‘if-onlys’. If this happens, talk to someone, distract yourself, or simply remind yourself that you did all that you could., Part of the mourning process is being very, very sad. You may find that you cry all the time, or that you often find yourself reflecting upon what has happened. You may feel empty or depressed. As with every emotion, this great sadness will also subside, though it is perfectly normal to fondly reminisce on your loved one and feel deeply sad, even years later.There is a difference between mourning and complicated grief or clinical depression. Even when you are mourning, you will still find things that make you smile or lift your spirits, even if it is just for a moment. You will continue to live your life, despite the grief you feel. If you are clinically depressed, or are experiencing complicated grief, you will not be able to find even the smallest amount of joy in anything, even after a good deal of time has passed. You may find it hard to accept that your loss has occurred. You will find it hard to do anything, even normal daily activities, and may feel hopeless. If you feel that the latter description fits what you feel, talk to a mental health professional., Acceptance does not mean that you feel ‘happy’ or ‘okay’ with what has happened--it simply means that you have come to terms with it. You will carry on with, and even enjoy, your life, all the while knowing that you are moving on without the person or thing you have lost. You will begin to plan things, look to the future, and find a sense of peace.You may feel a sense of guilt for moving on with your life, but know that your loved one would want you to be happy and to truly enjoy the life that you have.

This is because crying is a physical outlet that allows you to move through emotion. It can also relax you. Research suggests that a stress hormone is released through tears.After you have finished crying, lie back on your bed and think through what has happened.


If reflection makes you upset, let yourself cry again. No one can see you, so don’t be embarrassed. Just let yourself emotionally release.;
, Go to a quiet place where you can sit with your thoughts. Describe your feelings, what's been happening, and how upset you are in as much detail as you can. Be sure to include how you feel physically. These can help you understand the underlying feelings of sadness. You might want to try writing a letter to your pain if you're having trouble simply writing your feelings.If you've let your feelings out and are still sad, there is a good reason. You could still need to process a situational or internal conflict. Journaling can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings., Current research suggests that dancing can improve mental health symptoms such as sadness, fatigue, anxiety, and their physical symptoms. Dance can be formal at a studio or just moving to music in your house.Research also shows that listening to sad music might help when you feel sad.Sad music provides a connection to the feelings which gives you an outlet for processing them.


If you are not ready to deal with your feelings, music can provide a distraction till you're ready to confront your sadness.

, Doing something artistic is a way to be creative and express your sadness with color, form, shape, and sometimes texture. Art lets you release your sadness without words. Try:Guided imagery: Start by visualizing your feelings. Close your eyes and imagine what they look like, the colors, shapes, etc. Open your eyes and draw the image on paper. It doesn’t matter what it looks like. Just release the feeling however it comes out on paper.
Mandala: This is an intricate circle that you can color or paint to find emotional release. Look for a mandala online that you can print off. Some people prefer this kind of structured art project that addresses the subconscious.

, Negatives thoughts are often unrealistic thoughts about a situation, yourself, or future events. These can overwhelm your positive thoughts and change your view of yourself. If you don't catch these negative thoughts, you won't be able to use healthy coping skills.Having a negative view of yourself can lead to depression.For example, you might be sad because you were just broken up with. After a break up, most people have some negative thoughts like, ""I wasn't a good partner,"" or ""I'll always be alone.""
If you start believing these negative thoughts, your actions will start supporting them. For example, you may stop going on dates because you think you'll always be alone., Think of the concerns you have underneath the negative thoughts. For example, if you think you'll always be alone, your underlying concerns might be related to lack of self-confidence when meeting new people. While becoming aware of your feelings may not be comfortable, it is important to understand what's creating your negative thoughts.You might try making a thought record by writing down an event that you wish happened differently or that you could have handled better. Track any feelings of sadness or events surrounding the feeling.For example, your initial negative thought might be, ""I'm a loser since I can't get a date."" The underlying cause of this thought might be that you're feeling sad about the breakup and you feel alone since you had plans to go on a date.

, Simply ask yourself if the thought is the truth. This will lead you to realize that most thoughts are not true, but are just reactions.You might also ask yourself the following questions to challenge and let go of negative thoughts:


Why do you think the thought is true? What facts support it? ""I don't even know how to ask someone out on a date. I'm out of practice.""
What are your reactions to the negative thoughts (actions, feelings, and other emotions)? ""I'm scared to ask someone to go on a date with me.""
How would not having that thought change your actions or behaviors? ""I shouldn't be so scared. I should could try asking someone out when I'm ready.""

, You're allowed to be sad so don't try to bottle up your feelings. Accepting your emotions is the first step in letting your sadness out. You're sad for a reason and it's important to acknowledge that sadness and pain. This way, you can begin the journey of letting it go.If you're struggling to respect your feelings, try writing down or saying aloud:


“ I am sad when………………………. And that is okay.”
“ I am allowed to be sad about…….”

, Often family and friends try to comfort you and mean well by saying that the sadness will pass or there's some good in the situation. Even when they have the best intention, this can put minimize your legitimate feeling of sadness.Tell them that you know they mean well, but that you feel sad and need time to be sad.


For example, if you were just broken up with and your friend tells you that now you have lots of free time, you can tell your friend that you need time to process your emotions.

, Remind yourself of your accomplishments and things you like about yourself. Or, verbally remind yourself about positive statements that mean something to you, such as quotes.You can write this down as a list and keep it nearby for whenever you're feeling sad. Research shows that you can foster and protect positive thoughts by carrying a physical reminder of them.To keep positive statements or affirmations nearby, try writing them on index cards that you keep in your wallet, store them on your phone, or make them your computer's screen saver.

, Surround yourself with friends or family who can relate to your feelings. Explain how you're feeling and see if it helps. Chances are, they'll try to lift your spirits. It's also okay to tell them that you're sad and need time to be sad.Try talking with someone you trust who is wise or older. This person might have more life experiences to draw upon, which can help you work through your sadness.

, It's easy to focus on the negative and overlook positive emotions, like happy, relaxed, excited, joyous, or encouraged. Take a moment to write down happy or relaxing memories. This reminder can make you feel positive again.You can also distract yourself from negative emotions by doing something fun or positive. You could:Color your hair
Make a cup of tea
Count up to 500 or 1000
Work on a puzzle or mind game
Go ""people watching""
Play a musical instrument
Watch TV or a movie
Paint your nails
Organize something like books, your closet, etc.
Make origami to occupy your hands
Be active. Play a sport, take a walk, or work out

Recognize the physical signs of emotional trauma.,
Figure out the impact.,
Engage with anxiety.,
Focus on the future.",How to Let Go of Painful Memories1," Sometimes particularly impactful experiences can leave noticeable physical traces indicative of emotional trauma. If you have certain symptoms, it could be the case that the painful memories you have are associated with some emotional trauma that is affecting your physical health. No two people will ever express their reaction to trauma in the same way, so it’s important to consider your own situation individually, perhaps in dialogue with a mental health professional.


Common physical symptoms of emotional trauma are trouble sleeping due to insomnia or nightmares, a racing or unsteady heartbeat, physical aches and pains all over your body, being easily startled, tiredness, trouble concentrating, agitation, being on edge, and tense muscles.These symptoms can be signs of anxiety related to painful memories in the past. Engaging with and learning how to manage any anxiety that arises for you can help in easing the effects of painful memories in your everyday life.;
, The first thing you have to figure out is precisely how painful memories might be impacting your current life. Because particularly impactful experiences in the past can affect you in the most subtle of neurological and psychological levels, you are not always aware of how they might be influencing your behavior in the present.While all of your current behaviors and ideas are influenced to some extent by past behaviors, those that have left painful memories often affect you more than others.For example, you could experience a large degree of anxiety around lakes because of a near death experience in water, or you could perhaps unconsciously avoid certain activities or locations that remind you of a deceased loved one. Whatever the case, learning exactly how such painful memories might be affecting your life in the present in order to come to terms with them and incorporating their effects into your everyday life.
To figure out how they are impacting you, take an inventory of how you react to certain things. Think back to any noticeable changes you think you may noticed in yourself between the traumatic event and how you act now. If you aren't sure you can see any changes yourself, ask those around you have different you act or if they have seen any changes in your behavior that may point to the areas of your life the memories have impacted.

, Whenever you start to feel anxiety in situations that remind of painful memories, engage with the anxiety. Identify the memories as such and experiment with what’s happening as opposed to simply removing yourself from the situation entirely. Psychologists have several different techniques for working through issues like this, but two similar and effective methods are mindsight and mindfulness.In either case, the goal here is to learn to pay attention to when anxiety arises. When it does, focus on aspects of the situation you can control, such as your breath, in order to slow the situation down enough to where you now longer feel overwhelmed.


Since breathing is one of the things you will typically always have some degree of control over, and it is connected to so many different physiological processes in your body, learning to regulate it can be a great tool for reducing anxiety when it arises. It can also be helpful to become more aware of your surroundings in general.Do this first by yourself at home. Start by breathing in slowly, holding it in, and then releasing just as slow. Try to notice any sensations that arise when this occurs so you will be able to make such connections between your anxiety and your breath during other situations outside of your home.

, Living in the past and in your painful memories is not healthy. You will never go forward or enjoy new things if your mind is always stuck in the past. This kind of rumination has been linked with depression, post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and many other issues. In order to stop ruminating, take part in activities that help your focus on the present or future. Make plans for the weekend with friends, think about a vacation you want to save up for, or think about career or life goals that you have yet to achieve. Anything positive will help you keep your focus from spiraling down into your painful memories.


If you are still worried about changes you could have made in the past associated with the memory, think about the ways you can avoid such events in the future. If it was not under your control, think about how far you've come since the event and focus on the positive aspects of your current or future endeavors."

Take breaks.,
Break large tasks down into manageable chunks.,
Lean on your support network.,
Focus on the here and now with mindfulness.",How to Thrive in the Midst of Chaos2," Chaos can make you believe that if you only work harder, you can bring everything back into harmony. However, becoming a workaholic will only add to the stress you’re feeling. Take a step back from work or obligations to get some perspective. Doing so can relieve stress and give you the mental boost you need to problem-solve your way out of chaos.Make sure to set aside plenty of time for self-care as well. For example, you might set aside 30 minute every night to take a bubble bath, meditate, or do an evening yoga routine. You can also do little things to treat yourself, such as getting yourself a special coffee drink, going for a walk in nature, or getting a massage.

, A key to thriving in chaos is in the small actions you take throughout your day. Large projects or goals can seem impossible and intimidating if you view them from start to finish. However, tearing them down into smaller, controllable parts enables you to feel more capable of completing them.For instance, if you are trying to plan a fundraiser, separate the event into various sections. These may include volunteers, marketing, t-shirts, and sponsors. You might delegate each section to a different team to help you coordinate each part.

, A great way to find the peace of mind to excel during in the face of chaos is by turning to your support system. Thinking you can manage on your own will lead to you feeling isolated and overwhelmed. Instead ask for help or support if you need it.Go to a friend and say, “I am working on this school project. Do you think you could give me a hand?” Or, merely ask for support: “There’s a lot happening at home with my parents separating. Is it okay if I hang at your house for a while to get some distance from everything?”

, Use your thoughts to transform chaos into calm. Mindfulness is an excellent practice to start when life seems unpredictable. It can help you stop fretting about past mistakes and quell worries about the future by focusing your attention on the present moment. Mindfulness seems like a challenging practice at first glance, but, in reality, it can be implemented right away and used at any time.


Get the most benefits by practicing mindfulness every day. To start, set aside a few moments to sit without distractions. Take some deep, cleansing breaths. Observe the present moment. What sounds do you hear? Smells? Sights? Keep your focus on the moment as it is. When competing thoughts come into your mind just let them roll away without judgment. Continue breathing and observing the present moment.You can incorporate mindfulness into a range of daily activities such as eating, driving, walking, or showering.

"
Let go of perfectionism.,
Develop a gratitude practice.,
Turn to your spirituality.,
See a counselor.",How to Thrive in the Midst of Chaos3," One character trait that can prevent you from thriving in the midst of chaos is believing that you need to do things perfectly. Trying to reach perfection in your job, your appearance, your relationship, or any other aspect of life wastes time that could be dedicated to accomplishing other goals. It also leads to procrastination; because if you’re worried you’ll never be good enough, you’re unlikely to get started.


Aim to be more flexible in your standards, and you’ll find that you have more time for what’s important in your life. Ask yourself “What level of imperfection am I willing to tolerate?” when doing a task. Then, try to come up with some realistic standards that allow you to still get the job done., Expressing gratefulness for the positives in your life is a significant habit to adopt all the time. Yet, it can be especially practical during times of chaos. Practicing gratitude can help you shift your focus to the good things happening in your life, and help you obtain greater acceptance for those that are negative or unpredictable.


Strive to write down or create a log in your phone three things that you are grateful for each night before you go to sleep. These can vary widely, from shelter to live in to a person like your best friend. Do this practice daily to start recognizing how fortunate you are., If you have faith in a higher power, deepening your spiritual connection can be beneficial during chaotic periods in your life. How you enhance your spiritual side will depend on your unique beliefs.


For some, spiritual practices may relate to organized religion with rituals such as attending worship services or praying. For others, spirituality involves connecting with their inner selves through yoga, chanting or meditation. Still, for others, they can connect with their spirituality by spending time in nature. Do what works for you., If, despite your best efforts, chaos in your life causes chronic stress, anxiety or depression, you should see a professional. Talking to a therapist, particularly one who has training in cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help you identify characteristics that are preventing you from thriving and build coping skills to more effectively manage chaos in life."

Learn a new skill.,
Take a trip.,
Pick up a hobby.,
Join a club or organization.,
Further your education.,
Make self-care a part of your routine.",How to Deal with Empty Nest Syndrome As a Single Parent2," While you were raising your children, your interests probably took a backseat in your life. Now that your kids are all out of the house, think about some goals you’d like to reach or new skills you’d like to develop. Learning something new can be a great way to distract yourself from loneliness, meet new friends, and fill your schedule.


Learn a foreign language in preparation of an upcoming trip. Or, simply sign up for a woodworking, flower-arranging or cooking class to build an entirely new skillset., Visiting someplace new can help ease your transition from full-time parent to empty-nester. Getting outside your home and into a new environment is not only exciting and fun, it can also help foster your independence, reminding you that you are your own person and that you can have fun on your own.

, Being a single empty-nester offers you the opportunity to selfishly pursue your own interests again. What kinds of things did you enjoy doing when you were younger? Sit down and make a list of passions you let go because of parenting responsibilities. Pick three that you’d like to pick back up.


These can include anything from playing an instrument, cycling, painting, writing, crafting, welding, or bowling.If you don't know where to start, see if your friends have any interesting hobbies and ask if you can tag along or they can give you a lesson.

, A terrific method for making new friends and pursuing a passion is by getting involved with a local club or organization. These groups might be purely for hobbyists like cake decorating, or they may involve more civil pursuits like politics, volunteerism or activism. Contact the group and find out how you can join., Did you always dream of finishing your college degree but never had the extra time? Now you do. Reach out to a local college or contact someone from an online institution to find out what you need to get enrolled. You may even be able to find grants or special scholarships for older adults returning to the classroom.Not interested in a traditional education? Do some on-the-job training to enhance your knowledge of your given career path. Ask your supervisor what sort of training courses you can enroll in to help you become better at your job.

, It seems indulgent, but it’s also important to use this time to pour into your physical, mental and spiritual health. You probably neglected yourself while caring for your children. Use your free time to rebuild a self-care habit.


Support your physical health by eating nutritious, balanced meals several times a day. Drink plenty of water. Exercise regularly (consider working with a personal trainer to help you transition back into exercise if necessary). Get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.
Boost your mental health by managing stress with relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
Nurture your spiritual health through mindfulness, prayer, spending time in nature, attending spiritual or religious services or listening to music."

Let your child set the pace.,
Work out a flexible way to keep in touch.,
Look forward to new chapters.",How to Deal with Empty Nest Syndrome As a Single Parent3," Some parents use their newfound free time to encroach on their adult children’s lives. You drop by unexpectedly, you call at all hours of the day and night, and you constantly remind them to eat or sleep. Your children have achieved some measure of autonomy after moving from underneath your roof. Give them the satisfaction of finding their own way.


It can help to have a conversation with your children or simply wait and let them set the pace. You might say, “I just want you to know that I am here for you anytime you need me,” then let them call if necessary.

, Your adult children may not have the courage to tell you that you are calling or dropping by too often. Of course, they love you and want to hear from you, but they also want to enjoy the new experiences that come with independent living. Have a candid discussion with each child to settle on the right amount and method of contact for them.


For example, some college students may be terribly homesick and appreciate daily phone calls. On the other hand, some young adults may prefer occasional phone calls in addition to texts, emails, and cards via snail mail.
Ask your child what they prefer. You might say, “I want to respect your independence and give you space, but I also want to be a part of your life. How can we keep in touch?”, While becoming an empty-nester can be distressing at first, look on the bright side. In addition to having more time for yourself, you also have the opportunity to build sophisticated grown-up relationships with your children. Just because they have moved out doesn’t mean they won’t need you for advice, financial assistance, or emotional support.

Take some time to visualize what you'd like your relationship with your child to look like. It may be helpful to journal or write about how you'd like this new stage of your life to go.
As your child matures you will help them through difficult breakups, terrible losses, and even guide them as they get married and start families of their own. Even though they may not need you in the same way they once did, they will always need you."
"
Begin a journal.,
Cultivate joyful habits.,
Mix up your routine.",How to Let Go of Painful Memories2," Writing things down is one of the most effective ways to help with past painful events. Try journaling about your past and present in order to learn more about how you are impacted by painful memories. Putting such experiences in narrative form can give you some degree of control over how you see these experiences as being important to your life.It can also allow you to tap into to emotions related to such memories that might be difficult to access otherwise.Sit down one day and simply write about any experiences that come to mind, in as much detail as possible. This can help you incorporate the effects of painful memories for two reasons. First, it can allow you to see connections between situations in your life and your emotions. Second, writing can act as a sort of cathartic experience whereby you can feel a sense of creative freedom that might help you avoid feeling pulled down by prior life events.
If you struggle with this, start small by simply writing about what happened to you throughout the day. If you feel any urge to connect what happened to anything that happened to you in your past, allow those connections to be made without forcing your writing to go in one particular direction as opposed to another.

, In order to help you get over painful memories, try to make new, better memories and form new habits. Painful memories can consume you if you spend too much time alone and ignore your own intrinsic desire for relationships with other people. Surround yourself with people and activities that bring you joy. Humans are innately social creatures, and so any sense of pleasure or joy will very likely involve interpersonal relationships with other people, especially those involving touch or other forms of intimacy.This doesn’t mean you should just hang out with anyone. It will likely take some degree of effort on your part to figure out what really brings you joy. But once you find an activity or group of people that do so, try to restructure your daily life in order to maximize the time you spend in such situations.

, Getting stuck in a normal routine can give you too much time to think about the past. Try to experiment with your environment and social groups in order to mix up your routine every other day or so. This is especially true if you sense a lack of pleasure in your daily life. If you notice yourself becoming noticeably preoccupied with painful memories from the past, it might be necessary to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and put yourself in environments you’ve never been in before.If you persistently feel isolated from others and unable to meet people who support you, it might be necessary to experiment by interacting with entirely new people in situations you wouldn’t typically be. This can lead you to meet the right type of people who might be able to support you in the ways that you need. This will also hopefully help you become less preoccupied with the past by giving you more interesting activities and people to focus on in the present.
Try taking a class on mixed martial arts or yoga. You could even simply go on a walk in the park. The key here is simply to put yourself in situations in which you would not typically find yourself, or around people you would not typically hang out with. Painful memories can become part of a psychological feedback loop that become part of your everyday routine and habits otherwise.

Ask for outside input.,
Join a support group.,
Visit a mental health professional.,
Try cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Ask about eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).",How to Let Go of Painful Memories3," If you feel like you need an outside perspective or you find it hard to get out of your own head, ask others if they’ve noticed anything different about you since the experience that left you with the painful memory. This will require some courage on your part, as they might tell you something you don’t want to hear. However, other people, especially those closest to you, are often able to pick on things about you that you fail notice.


Ask someone you trust, such as your best friend, your sibling, your parent, or trusted colleague, while approaching them without any preconceived notions.

, If you cannot find supportive people on your own or you want to talk to someone that isn't a loved one or in your group of friends, try joining a support group that focuses on the type of problems you are suffering from. There are countless out there that focus on a wide range of issues, such as substance use problems, domestic violence, grieving the death of a loved one, or anxiety and depression.


There are online databases that help you look for the right group for you. You can also ask your doctor or a mental health professional for suggestions if you can’t find any on your own. , If you cannot deal with your painful memories on your own, find a mental health professional that specialized in trauma to help you with you issues. You should also seek professional help when the painful memories become unbearable on your own. Mental health professionals, such as counselors or therapists, are trained in suggesting various coping skills or implementing therapeutic techniques that are intended to help people become more productive or constructive with in their daily lives, despite painful experiences they might have had in the past. There is nothing wrong with asking for help. Don't feel like a failure or be embarrassed to ask for help.


If painful memories are keeping you from functioning on a day to day basis in the way that you want, and if the pain associated with them doesn’t seem to subside with time, visiting a mental health professional could be helpful. He or she can lend an ear to your story and suggest some tricks for dealing with such issues. In order to help you engage with painful memories that might have resulted in some sort of traumatic affection to your day-to-day life, a mental health professional might implement the following a myriad of techniques., CBT is a popular method for the treatment of past trauma. CBT is a typically short term, problem focused approach to anxiety and depression, where the therapist helps you with your beliefs and thought processes. They help you align them more functionally with your desires. It is more active than other forms of therapy, in that it takes effort from you to help you change your behaviors and thoughts. Your therapist will help you work through issues, give you exercises and treatments to do at home, and help you change your overall behavior.Look for a mental health professional that specializes in this method if you think it might be effective for your particular situation.

, Your mental health professional may also try eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR takes advantage of your body’s natural reactions to past experiences by using eye movements to unlock memories and allow you to engage with them more easily. This method uses repetitive eye movements along with CBT to help trigger traumatic memories so you can deal with them instead of repressing them. This method treats mental health in the same way as physical health. If you have a traumatic memory festering in your mind, it will never have time to heal, despite your brain's natural healing ability.


By uncovering your past trauma and dealing with it using EMDR, you can move past your painful memories and go toward mental health."

Be pleasant towards others.,
Focus on your breath in moments of sadness.",How to Hide Sadness1," If you want to look positive, work on smiling. While you shouldn't smile too much, as this can come off as fake, offering a smile to friends and co-workers can make you look happy despite negative circumstances.Smiling may also lift your mood. If your smile more, this may actually encourage happy feelings in your brain.It can be hard to make yourself smile if you don't feel like it. Try doing something like thinking of something funny. You can even reread a funny text or look up something funny on your phone if you're really struggling to smile.;
, You want to be aware of the messages your body language sends to others. If you appear physically withdrawn, others may think you're sad. In order to hide sadness, work on maintaining relaxed, pleasant body language.Keep your arms opened and your palms relaxed.
Avoid crossing your legs. Try to keep them parallel, or even stretched apart slightly.
Try to maintain eye contact when talking to someone.

, Watch your language. Your sadness may show up in subtle ways, so try to be pleasant in conversation. Try to use happier vocabulary in casual interactions and day-to-day conversation.Try to use positive words. If someone, for examples, asks you how you're doing, say something like, ""Great"" instead of more neutral terms like ""Fine"" or ""Okay.""
Be sure to watch the tone of your voice as well. With the wrong tone, even happy words can sound like they carry sad meanings. Vary your pitch slightly, as a monotone voice can indicate sadness.

, Many times, people who are sad withdraw from others or even take things out on them. If you want to hide the fact you're sad, refrain from doing this. Work on being pleasant around others. This can help you seem happier.Smile at others, listen to what they have to say, and offer positive affirmations instead of criticisms. For example, ""That's a really interesting story. Thanks for sharing.""
In addition to not criticizing others, do not criticize yourself. If you're sad, you may be tempted to tear yourself down. However, this will only show your sadness. Try not to let a negative inner monologue slip into conversation.

, You can't prevent yourself from feeling sadness. In fact, it can be detrimental to avoid negative feelings. However, you can calm yourself down and taper your reactions by focusing on your breath. When you're in a situation where you begin to feel emotional, slow down and pay attention to your breathing. While this won't make negative feelings go away, it can prevent you from showing your emotions externally.If you feel sadness building, close your eyes for a moment. Tune in to your breathing.
Focus on the natural rhythm of your breath. If you feel like you're breathing too fast, try to slow your breathing slightly.

Make a worry list.As each anxious thought appears, record it on a piece of paper.,
Create a worry period.,
Stay busy.",How to Stop Worrying About Bad Things That Could Happen to You or Your Family1," Say to yourself, ""I don't have time to think about this right now. I'll write it down and I can think about it later."" There will be a time and a place to worry about yourself and your loved ones later. You don’t need to worry about forgetting because each thought is recorded on your list.;
, Choose a set time and place for worrying about the bad things that could happen. Give yourself permission to worry freely during this time each day. This is your worry period. What you think about is entirely up to you. You don’t need to edit or limit yourself. Whether your thoughts are productive or unproductive doesn’t really matter.If an anxious thought about yourself or your family comes up during the day, try to set it aside. Tell yourself that you will be able to think it through later, during your worry time.This will get easier with practice.
It should be roughly the same time each day (e.g. from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m.).
It should also be early enough that it won’t make you anxious right before bedtime.
It is important that when your worry period is up, you actually stop worrying. Get up and go do something else to help take your mind off the fears you were just mulling over.

, When you find yourself beginning to worry about what could happen, look at your to-do list. If you don’t have a list, begin one. List your goals and the steps to meet them.Begin with simple tasks, like cooking dinner or doing the laundry.

Strive to keep up with daily activities.,
Take steps to stay energetic.,
Identify and avoid any triggers for sad feelings.,
Make excuses when necessary.",How to Hide Sadness2," Oftentimes, people who are very sad withdraw from daily activities. Sad people may not keep up with work, school, or a social life.If you don't want people to know you're sad, strive to go through the motions as much as possible.


If you're sad, don't push yourself too hard. You don't have to expect you'll do a stellar job at work or school if you're going through something. However, make an effort to show up and do your best.
Avoid shunning social situations. In addition to helping you hide your sadness, getting out with friends could potentially boost your mood. Try to force yourself to attend social engagements.

, A lack of overall energy is a common symptoms of sadness.If you're feeling sad, you may notice a dip in energy. To hide your sadness, take steps to increase your overall energy.Do some light exercise. Something as quick as a 10 minute walk can boost your energy.
Stretch. Stretching your body when you're feeling low energy can cause your energy to boost slightly.
Find something to make you laugh. You can, for example, find a funny YouTube video online to laugh at. This can boost your mood and increase energy.

, Reflecting on when and why you feel sad can help you combat feelings of sadness. Certain situations or moments may cause you to feel sad, or make existing sadness worse. If you can figure out your triggers, you can avoid them. This will prevent you from experiencing as intense sadness, making sadness easier to hide.Think about when you feel the most sad during the day. Does seeing a certain person make you sad? Does going to a certain place make you sad? Are there certain noises, songs, or other external stimuli that provoke feelings of sadness?
If so, try to avoid your triggers as much as possible. While it won't eliminate sadness altogether, it can help you avoid situations that intensify your sadness.

, It's impossible not to be affected by sadness indefinitely. There will be times when you miss a social event or seem off during work.

If you're feeling suicidal or thinking of harming yourself, do not hide it. Seek help right away.If you're feeling suicidal, you can call 1-800-273-TALK in the United States to get help. If you're outside the U.S, you can visit Suicide.org to find a similar service in your country. If you're thinking of hurting yourself, or if you have, call 9-1-1 or emergency services in your area.

Improve your distress tolerance.,
Work on accepting uncertainty.,
Practice habituation.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Cry it out.,
Call a friend.",How to Stop Worrying About Bad Things That Could Happen to You or Your Family2," Distress tolerance refers to how well you can handle uncomfortable, negative, or distressing emotions.Think about how you react when you imagine something bad happening to your family — do you panic and frantically try to stop your feelings of fear and anxiety? Do you run from the feelings or bury them? Do you do something destructive? Increasing your tolerance for these uncomfortable feelings can give you room to deal with them in a healthy way.In fact, the act of worrying can be a way of avoiding distressing emotions. If you're in your head, worrying about something bad that may happen to your family, you are actually distracting yourself from your emotions.Your worry may be a way you distract yourself from anxiety over things you can't control.Learn to self-soothe in the face of distress. When you begin to worry about your family, figure out what you can do to make the emotion more tolerable. This doesn't mean you run from the feeling, but you make it less intense so you can deal with it.
Try some of the following: Exercise, dance, clean the house, listen to soothing music, look at artwork or something beautiful, play with your pet, do a puzzle or play a game, watch your favorite tv show, volunteer, take a shower or a bubble bath, pray, read a book, laugh, sing, go somewhere beautiful and calming.Start noticing the things you do that make you feel better, and the things that make you feel worse (such as binge eating, isolating yourself in your room, etc.).

, Oftentimes people think worrying is productive — if you are hyper-vigilant about everything that might happen to your family, then you might be able to protect them from anything that might harm them. Unfortunately, this doesn't work — this doesn't make life more predictable. Instead, you just waste time and energy, as you can never know with 100% certainty what will happen in life.Realize that worrying about worst-case scenarios (""What if my dad gets cancer and dies?"" ""What if my plane crashes?"") doesn't have the power to stop these things from happening.Ask yourself: Is it possible to be certain about everything in life? Does worrying constantly about something bad happening have any advantages? Does it keep me from enjoying the present moment? Can I accept that there is a small chance something bad will happen, but the actual likelihood of it happening is very low?, This means you become habituated, or grow used to, your worries. For 30 minutes you visualize what you're afraid of — your family dying in a car crash, for instance — and accept the feelings that arise instead of trying to avoid them or run away.The goal of this is to allow your anxiety to calm down and to come to a place of acceptance. It will also help you begin to distinguish between solvable problems and those over which you have no control.Ask yourself these questions, suggested by HelpGuide.org:Is the problem something I'm currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen?
Is my concern realistic?
Can I do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of my control?


If you recognize that, no, there's nothing you can do to eliminate the chances of your family getting injured or killed in a car accident (or other worry), you can work on accepting uncertainty about the situation. Remembering: worrying is not an action. Worrying about a car accident won't somehow prevent a car accident.
If you feel the problem is solvable, try to define the problem, brainstorm potential solutions, and make an action plan to start actively doing something, instead of simply worrying., Taking the steps to speak to a health care professional doesn’t need to be a last resort. Sometimes just speaking your worries about yourself or your family out loud to someone who has no connection to the problem can really help. Look for providers in your area that offer sliding scale rates, and make yourself an appointment., There is nothing like a good cry to wash away your negative emotions. Research shows that after you finish crying, your heart rate slows, your breathing slows, and you enter a state of relaxation. This relaxed state tends to last longer than the time you spent crying. So if you feel so worried about your family that you could just cry, go ahead.


Cry alone or with a friend.
Make sure you're in an appropriate place (embarrassment won't help)., Friends can be an excellent source of support. They can give you their perspectives and help you to sort out yours. They can help you see if your fears about yourself or your family are rational or not. Simply by speaking your fear out loud to a real person, you may find the anxiety start to dissipate.It may help to set a ""connection goal,"" such as calling one friend per week.
If you can't bring yourself to actually call, write an email instead.

Reduce stress.,
Meditate.,
Eat chocolate.,
Get enough sleep.,
Practice gratitude.",How to Stop Worrying About Bad Things That Could Happen to You or Your Family3," While you can never eliminate stress from your life completely, you can take steps to reduce the stressors in your life.


Learn to say ""no."" Don't say ""yes"" to that dinner with your friend when you know you'll be working late to meet a deadline or agree to take on another project when you're already swamped. Learn to distinguish between the things you ""must"" do and the things you feel you ""should"" do.Change your situation. Are you a ball of stress by the time you arrive at work because traffic has you so frustrated? Find an alternate route, take the train, or see if you can start your day early to avoid the gridlock. Identify small changes you can make in your environment and everyday life to eliminate unnecessary stress.Spend less time with people who stress you out.Maybe you can't eliminate these people from your life — it could be your mom or your boss or co-worker who stresses you out the most — but try to limit your contact with these people as much as possible. Tell your mom you'll call her once a week, but you're too busy to talk every day. Avoid a stressful coworker as much as possible. Find reasons to excuse yourself from his presence.

, Mediation does not mean to sit with an empty mind. Instead, meditation is about witnessing your thoughts as they come and go, but not judging them. Doing this for a few minutes each day can significantly reduce your anxiety about things that could happen to you.Try sitting in a comfortable spot and taking deep breaths.
As you do this, imagine each of your thoughts is a bubble that floats out of you toward the ceiling and pops.
Listening to a guided mediation can also help.

, Giving yourself a yummy treat is a wonderful distraction from your worries. In addition, chocolate has been shown to reduce cortisol (the stress hormone that causes anxiety symptoms).The compounds found in dark chocolate can actually improve your mood., If you chronically worry about your family, this may be easier said than done. However, if you regularly let yourself stay up late, you may be feeding your own anxiety. Research has shown that people who go to bed earlier are less likely to be burdened by anxious thoughts. Try tucking in a bit earlier.Adults should get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. Teenagers need between eight and 10 hours, and school-age children should get nine to 11 hours., If you are worried about bad things happening to yourself or your family, it means that you love yourself and you love your family! In other words, you have a lot to be grateful for!Anytime you feel worry coming on, stop and count five of your blessings.
Some example may include: your family, your health, nice weather, some time to yourself, or a satisfying meal.

Be ready for negative comments.,
Learn to stop caring about what other people think.,
Decide how you want to sing and where your singing strengths lie.,
Realize that others have put up with rejection too and often years of it.,
Keep your head up.,
Hang out with the crowds who care for the music you like.,
Be yourself, anywhere and everywhere.",How to Take Rejection in Singing," If you allow a single comment to derail your dreams, then you may not have what it takes to cope in what is essentially a tough industry. Criticism is part of the job description and improvement is the name of the game. Learn to discern between jealous and unfriendly criticism and criticism that is targeted at helping you to improve and become an even better singer.;
, While it is important to gauge what others think of you and to tweak things that you know you need to improve, it's quite another thing to let people's jibes and undermining get to you. People think bad things because most of the time they wish they had the very talent you have and it just helps them to cope better. Or, maybe the school of hard knocks has hardened them so much that they can't stop being mean as a way of coping. That isn't an excuse but it does provide you with an explanation that reveals that their unkindness isn't about you, it's about them. Hence, don't take it to heart and don't assess yourself by their judgmental standards.

, Don't allow yourself to be buffeted about by other people telling you which box you need to sit in. Once again, learn from the comments about what doesn't work for your voice and either improve that aspect or steer clear of what doesn't work to focus on what does work.

, This means you must be ready for a lot of rejection, a lot of the time, but know that it's all part of the process and eventually you will break through if you stick at and keep improving. For example, it took years of rejection before Linkin Park became well known and respected for their music but eventually they got a contract because they stuck at it and believed in what they were doing. When you get to the point of wanting to quit, read up on other artists and what it took to get them to where they are now (or where they got if they're already long gone).

, Focus on where you're headed, not what has already passed. A bad performance is a chance to learn, to improve and to stop repeating what doesn't work. It is not a reasons to give up unless you really cannot sing (and by now, you would already know this if you've listened to people who know, such as your singing teacher).

, Don't hang out where people aren't going to like your music. Avoid places where people are likely to throw things at you or shout demeaning things. They are just not worth it and won't improve your confidence any. That's abuse, not constructive criticism. Instead, perform at venues, parties, shows, events, etc., where you know that people are going to love what you're doing. You might even get fans and requests for autographs!

, If you let people push you around, nothing will work, so stick to doing your own thing. Recording companies aren't actually looking for the next clone, they can create their own for that. When they see an independent performer who sings well, they want a unique package and if you've stuck to what you're best at, that's precisely what they'll see. Or, skip them altogether and do your own thing using online promotion instead.

Look ahead, rather than down, when on the escalator.,
Hold the railing or someone’s hand.,
Take the escalator when it is empty.",How to Overcome a Fear of Escalators1," Avoid making eye contact with the moving stairs and keep your gaze straight ahead as you ride the escalator. This will help you stay still on the escalator so you can get to your destination.This will also reduce any dizziness you might feel when riding the escalator.;
, Use the side railings to steady yourself on the escalator and to prevent getting dizzy.You can also travel with someone that will hold your arm as you ride the escalator. This can help with your sense of balance and perception of depth while on the escalator.
Some people who suffer from a fear of escalators find wearing practical, sturdy shoes while on an escalator can give them a sense of security and comfort., Some people with a phobia of escalators dislike feeling trapped or boxed in, surrounded by others on the escalator during a busy time of day, or rush hour. Rather than try to ride a crowded escalator, wait until the crowd thins out. This may help you feel less crowded and trapped while riding the escalator."

Learn from past experience but don't let it stranglehold you.,
Learn to overcome avoidance.,
Try new things one at a time.,
Don't put yourself down.,
Don't project into the future.,
Be open to suggestions, requests, ideas.,
Follow things up.,
Once a year, do something that scares/thrills/really excites you.",How to Stop Limiting Your Opportunities in Life," Applying past experience can cause us to err in our present judgment, however, when we don't adjust the context of what is happening now. Take the good lessons about practicing caution and weigh up that need for being cautious with the need to keep trying new things.;
, When you avoid situations and events, you avoid the risks inherent in undertaking an activity or meeting new people. You also avoid the potential for discovery and great opportunities. Avoidance is a safety mechanism built up from past experiences, current fears, and presumed rather than actual outcomes. It takes a lot of work to overcome avoidance as a habit but the first step is to recognize that you do this, and to start working on not relying on avoidance as a habit.

, Don't overwhelm yourself by taking on too many new experiences at once. Test things out slowly and reward yourself for each small step that you take. When you remove the pressure, you will find it easier to gradually take up new opportunities.

, When you insist that other people can do something better than you, or that you're just not able to do something because you're too young, too old, too fat, too thin, too pretty, too ugly, too smart, too dumb, etc., you automatically limit your belief that you can do something. Once that happens, you work really hard at confirming your negative impression and in turn, put yourself and your abilities down. The better course of action is to believe that you're capable and to at least ""give it a go.""

, The worst that can happen is that something won't work, and that you'll fail in that endeavor. That is called learning and experience. We derive more information from our failures than we give them credit for. Keep trying; if you realize that the new opportunity really isn't for you, at least you gave it a go. But don't give up before you've even started by imagining the future holds failure.

, Rather than rejecting these immediately, tell people you'll think these things through. Let them permeate your mind and rest in there for a while; find the ways that you can see yourself involved in the new opportunities that will make the most of your interests and abilities. Go back to the person and explain how you'd like to be involved; that way, they know you're keen and where you will fit best. If they don't like your idea of involvement, at least you tried and made yourself clear.

, Never sit around thinking that someone will notice your talents, beauty, cleverness, abilities, etc. The reality is that you need to get out there and promote yourself so that you're on people's radar. When you get a lead, be sure to follow it up and remind people about your potential.

, Keep a date with yourself to come out of that shell and push yourself beyond your safety limits. Go on, you can do it!

Take responsibility for failure.,
Think back on changes you brought about.,
Try not thinking about it.,
Counteract your hindsight biases.",How to Stop Being Fatalistic1," Fatalism approaches situations by assuming they were inevitable, and nothing could have been done to change them. This belief often happens when you don't feel like you have any power in a situation.Studies show that re-framing failures as being due to a lack of effort (changeable) versus a lack of ability (unchangeable) lead to better performance in the future.This is likely because viewing a mistake as the result of actions that you and others took, as opposed to fate, allows you to feel more empowered about learning from the situation.


To own up to your failure, think back on different ways that your lack of effort may have contributed to your failing to achieve something. Then think about how you might change in the future; if you found yourself forgetting to work on a task, for example, you might try putting it into your calendar to help remind you.;
, Help ditch old ways of thinking by reflecting on your life and on parts of it that you did not like but that you worked to change. Engaging in this exercise will remind you that if you worked to change things before, you can do so again.


As an example of a change you might have caused, maybe you were dissatisfied with your monthly income and you worked hard to find a job with a higher salary.

, Although easier said than done, try not to think about whether things are determined or not, and just try your best; see where you land, you may be pleasantly surprised at what hard and smart work can lead to!There are several steps you can test out to get your fatalistic views off your mind:


Think about an interesting distractor thought instead. It is tough to entertain multiple thoughts at once; use this to your advantage. For example, if you're procrastinating on your math work because you think everything is predetermined so what's the point in trying, try thinking instead about the rewards you might obtain from finishing your math degree.Try exposure. Give yourself 20 minutes a day to think about determinism and your fatalistic views. Although this may be painful at the time, by letting your thoughts air, you may find yourself not thinking about them for the rest of the day.Try postponing the thought. If fatalistic thoughts come to mind, try telling yourself that you will get back to those thoughts next week, but for now you won't think about them., Sometimes, things can seem determined because of a hindsight bias: the idea that outcomes seem obvious after they have occurred. In other words, the hindsight bias occurs when people feel that they ""knew it all along"" despite the fact that they didn't. You can reduce the hindsight bias by identifying and dealing with its causes:


Need for closure. This refers to the idea that one motivation some people have is to view the world as a predictable place. After something happens, holding the belief that it all makes sense and was predictable lets the issue be put to rest. Try to reduce your need for closure by accepting that many things are just unknown and that so far, things have still gone mostly OK.Processing fluency. When it is easy to come to a conclusion about something, it can seem as if the outcome was inevitable. For example, you might view a driver who cuts you off on the road as being a jerk. This may lead to the belief that his behavior was inevitable because that's just who he is as a person.
You can combat processing fluency by imagining all the different ways that might have caused him to change lanes abruptly. Maybe the driver was in an emergency situation; maybe his wife was pregnant and he was rushing her to the hospital. Maybe he cut you off accidentally and didn't see you at all. Or, what if he spilled coffee on his pants and swerved into the other lane? All of these possibilities make the outcome seem less inevitable. "

Try hypnosis.,
Consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Look into exposure-based treatment.,
Try Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).",How to Overcome a Fear of Escalators2," Hypnotherapists believe that your subconscious mind sometimes reacts inappropriately to specific situations, for example, riding an escalator. Hypnotherapist try to change the responses in your subconscious mind to find new ways for you to react to certain situations and to release you from your fears and phobias.Hypnosis for escalaphobia can be done in one initial session with the use of exposure through imagined flooding, in which the therapist guides you through an imaginary experience on an escalator while you are deeply relaxed. There is usually a follow up session to see if your fear is still in remission.
Ask your doctor for a referral to a certified hypnotherapist and look them up online before you make an appointment. You can also ask friends and family if they have been to good hypnotherapist for any of their fears or phobias., This psychotherapy focuses on adjusting inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view fears or phobias with a clear mind and respond to them in an effective way.You will work with a psychotherapist in a limited number of sessions to treat your escalaphobia and come up with solutions to help you overcome your fear.


To try CBT, get a referral for a psychotherapist from your doctor, your health insurance plan, or a friend or family member who has experienced a good CBT session. If you have health insurance, find out what your plan offers for coverage of psychotherapy. Before you agree to a session with a therapist, check the fees and payment options for the sessions.You should also confirm the psychotherapist’s qualifications before you go to the session. Look up her education, certification, and licensing. Most trained psychotherapists have a master’s or a doctoral degree, with training in psychological counseling.

, This type of therapy places you in a situation where you confront your phobia in a controlled manner. Your therapist will also prevent you from avoiding your fear and may use other interoceptive cues, such as internal physical sensations. Most exposure-based treatments are therapist assisted to help you tolerate the fear and anxiety you associate with a certain experience or object.For example, your therapist may expose you to escalators in increments. Once you become comfortable standing over an escalator, for example, your therapist may then have you put one foot on the escalator and then slowly get comfortable to put both feet on the escalator. Placing yourself next to an escalator and then on an escalator, with your therapist present, will help you learn that any feared consequences of escalators you might imagine will not occur.

, This therapy was originally used to treat PTSD, and has been adapted to treat specific phobias. During EMDR, you will be exposed to brief images of the feared object or situation and be directed by a therapist to practice eye movements, listen to tapping, or rhythmic tones. The purpose is to decondition you of your phobia through rapid eye movement and processing of images of the feared situation or object.Some experts argue that EMDR is more useful for the treatment of fears that developed out of a traumatic experience or for more irrational or impractical fears. Many people with phobias will try hypnosis or exposure based therapy before they try EMDR.

Get your ears and eyes checked.,
Ask for an official diagnosis.,
Get a referral for a therapist.",How to Overcome a Fear of Escalators3," Sometimes, people who have difficulty staying balanced on escalators, or experience vertigo as they go down the escalator can have ear or eye issues. Get your eyes checked for any visual issues that may be causing imbalance or unsteadiness, and ask your doctor to check your ears for any issues that may be causing vertigo., Your doctor can diagnose your phobia based on your symptoms, as well as your medical, psychiatric, and social history. Be prepared to answer questions in a clinical interview about your fear of escalators and the severity of your fear.The clinical definition of a phobia is a fear of an object or experience that is consistent for six months or more. You may experience panic attacks when exposed to the object or the experience, as well extreme distress or anxiety. You will likely recognize that your fear is irrational or unreasonable and be bothered that you cannot move past your phobia. Finally, your fear may so strong you will adjust your daily routine, your social life, or your work life to avoid confronting your phobia.Once your doctor gives you an official diagnosis of escalaphobia, you can use this to get coverage for therapies and treatment for your issue.

, Your doctor can refer you to a certified psychologist, a cognitive behavior specialist, or even a hypnotherapist. Discuss these options, as well as the pros and cons of each option, before you agree to treatment.

Consider the complexity of the world.,
Learn about the complexity of the brain.,
Engage in thought experiments.,
Re-assess your goals.",How to Stop Being Fatalistic2," Even if it is true that the world always obeys physical laws and that determinism is true, it is still the case that a) we do not know how events will unfold until they do because b) the world is incredibly complex and difficult to predict.


This means that you won't know what the outcome will be until you have tried your best. Remember this next time you are thinking of giving up because you think the outcome is already determined.
To think about how complex the world is, try to imagine all the people in it (about 7 billion). Then imagine all the different ways that their lives might intersect over one year. Our lives are connected directly, such as when you bump into someone at an airport, and indirectly, such as when you eat a piece of fruit that was harvested by someone halfway across the world. Then remember that people make up just one small aspect of the world: there are also some number of millions of different kinds of species of animals, and there's complicated weather systems, and other physical laws of nature, for example. The number of ways that all these things can interact with each other is staggeringly complex!
For example, think about the butterfly effect, the idea that slight changes in initial conditions can change the ultimate outcome of the weather, or the idea that it is so difficult to roll dice to the same number each time because tiny differences in how the dice are thrown affect the ultimate outcome.Now spend a few minutes thinking about other ways that the world is really complex and how small changes to the initial conditions of something can have interesting consequences for the final outcome.

, If you adopt a fatalistic attitude because you view your behaviors as controlled by neurons firing in your brain, consider that the brain and its trillions of connections is probably the most complex system, and therefore one of the least predictable, in the universe.


In most cases, it is very difficult to accurately predict how people will behave in the future, because there are often many underlying variables that influence any individual's behavior that may not affect another's behavior.This means that even if behavior is ultimately determined by the physical laws that govern the brain, the actual output of the brain (behavior) is influenced by so many things it may as well not be determined. There is often no way to know what an outcome will be without trying your best to get the outcome that you want.
To learn more about how complex the brain is and what this means for predicting future behavior, try reading some articles pulled from an internet search using the keywords, complexity + human brain.

, If you have a fatalistic attitude, try the following thought experiment. Imagine that the outcome of your goal, say, finishing your math degree, will ultimately be positive, but that you have to first get over an initial hump of negativity and passiveness.


This means that your current fatalistic view is actually just part of the determined path where, through hard work and persistent effort on your part, you ultimately succeed in your goal, finishing your math degree. Sound far-fetched? Well how do you know until you try!?
Or, try the following thought experiment. Think about how complex and uncertain the world can be. This will help you to realize that even if things are determined, outcomes are often unknown due to all the possibilities; from this perspective, even if determinism is true in theory, in practice it is not because the world is so unpredictable due to all the ways that things can unfold. Imagine all the ways that 16 billiard balls could be arranged. Seems simple enough, and yet, there are actually 3,360 ways to arrange them (16 x 15 x 14).The world, human behavior, and so on, is so much more complicated than arranging billiard balls! Try to imagine all the ways that all the forces of the world might interact.

, Being fatalistic is associated with having goals that are very difficult to achieve. It may be the case that, when something seems impossible to achieve, we default to believing in fate: what will be will be. This may be a kind of rationalization that allows us to wash our hands of incompatible feelings whereby we want to achieve a goal but know that we actually cannot To change your goals, make them more concrete and actionable. Vague goals feel impossible to achieve because they are not clearly defined, so it is unclear how they could actually be achieved.
To make goals more actionable, break them into smaller more digestible chunks. For example, if you want to learn the coding language Python but this feels like an insurmountable task, break it down further:
Start by researching books that can teach you Python.
Once you select a book, set a goal to read one chapter per week. Write this down and cross it off every time you succeed at it. This may help you to build your confidence while getting rid of your fatalistic attitude.

Learn how self-efficacy is tied to fatalism.,
Start small.,
Watch someone else.,
Avoid generalizations.,
Ask for support.",How to Stop Being Fatalistic3," When people have low-self efficacy, they don't believe that their efforts have any power to change their behavior or a situation. They may feel powerless or hopeless. This can lead to a fatalistic outlook that interprets situations as ""just the way things are,"" rather than as experiences to be examined and learned from.For example, a student with low self-efficacy may feel like he is simply ""bad at math."" No matter how hard he studies, he never seems to improve. He may stop hoping to do better because he believes his skills are innately limited. This is a fatalistic approach.
On the other hand, a student with high self-efficacy may feel like she is ""bad at math,"" but view the situation as one that she can change with effort. She may set higher goals for herself and seek help in order to accomplish them. This feeling that the student has some power over the outcome helps her perform., To help you build feelings of self-efficacy -- or like you're able to change your behavior to influence an outcome -- it's helpful to experience success at things you try.Try taking up a new hobby, such as cooking, learning a new language, or music. Make it something you connect with. As you succeed in this pursuit, you'll develop feelings of mastery, which will help you realize that you have the power to succeed in things you try.


When you experience challenges or setbacks, which you likely will, think about them in terms of temporary roadblocks that you can overcome, rather than an innate limitation of your knowledge. Few people start off being able to make a perfect souffle, but many people have learned.
Take time to acknowledge your progress and successes along the way. Perhaps you knew exactly two words in Spanish when you started, and now you know 12. That's a success!

, ""Modeling"" is another helpful way to build feelings of self-empowerment.Watching a friend who is working on the same goal as you may help you feel more confident that your own actions can influence the result.


You may also find it helpful to ""role-play"" through a particular situation with a friend. For example, perhaps you feel like you're never recognized for your effort at work. A fatalist thought would be ""I'll never get any recognition."" A thought of self-efficacy could be ""I can talk to my boss about my work."" Role-play that conversation with a friend and ask how she would approach it. This may help build your confidence. Cooperation with others can often increase people's feelings of self-efficacy, too.Avoid using super achievers or perfectionists as models. These are unrealistic and unhelpful ways of approaching goals.

, When you make generalizations about yourself or others, such as ""I'm such a loser"" or ""Life really sucks,"" you're encouraging fatalism, or the belief that things just are the way they are and there's nothing you can do about them. You see a single event as representative of the way things will always be.For example, if you failed an exam, your thought might be ""I'm such a loser, I'll never pass any of these tests."" Challenge this thought by reminding yourself that you can change your behavior to affect future outcomes. Consider what you can do in the future. For example, you might ask to retake the test, see a tutor, or make up your grade with extra credit.Remind yourself that one event or trait does not define you. You are not a ""failure"" if you fail an exam. You're a person who failed an exam. You are not a ""loser"" if you lose a sports game. You're a person who lost a sports game. Keeping things in perspective can help you stop thinking fatalistically.

, Support from family and loved ones is crucial to developing feelings of self-empowerment.You can also ask for feedback on your strengths and areas for future development. Your friends and family may see strengths in you that you didn't even know were there. They may also be able to help you make a plan to learn and grow in a particular area for the future.

Sweating is an evolutionary trait designed to keep you cool as you fight or flee a danger. If you begin to feel sweaty, fear may be taking over.
Increased heartrate is your body preparing to take action.
Shortness of breath occurs when the muscles and nerves in your chest contract.
Dry throat occurs as your body diverts fluids to other areas of the body.;
, Fear exists inside the mind, once you have a handle on what’s happening to you and why, you can focus on overcoming it.


Fear is an adapted response humans developed to protect us from real or perceived danger.A fear of spiders may be inherited through your DNA as a leftover from early man.Appreciating that your fear is simply a leftover from another time may help you overcome it.
Fear is just a chemical reaction in your brain, but so is courage. Your reaction to the daddy longlegs is not based in reality, and you can overcome it., Often fear requires a level of discomfort with a situation. In order to overcome your fear of daddy longlegs, change how you frame the situation in your mind.


Try to imagine the daddy longlegs in a different way than that which frightens you.Look at it the same way you might look at a different bug or insect that you aren’t afraid of. Treat the daddy longlegs like you might treat a lady bug or butterfly.
Step back and look at the big picture.The daddy longlegs you’re afraid of is much smaller than you, and doesn’t pose any real danger to you.

, Don’t just focus on what won’t happen in terms of your fear, think about what will happen as you gain control.


Use positive coping statements to yourself like, “I’ve been this close to a daddy long legs before and nothing bad happened.”Imagine yourself free from your fear of daddy longlegs and how good that will feel. Imagine how empowered you will feel once your fear is behind you and let that motivate you to continue., Lots of people are afraid of spiders and daddy longlegs, but if it begins to affect how you live your life, you may need to seek medical attention.

Daddy longlegs are not venomous. They don’t even have fangs!Daddy longlegs aren’t actually spiders or bugs. They are arachnids but only have one pair of eyes and can’t produce silk to make spider webs. In fact, daddy longlegs eat mostly decomposing plants.Do more of your own research so you can better understand daddy long legs. Familiarizing yourself with them can help ease your fears.

, One effective way to reduce your fear reaction to certain things is to expose yourself to it slowly and in controlled way until you begin to feel more comfortable. This process is called, “systemic desensitization”or “exposure therapy.”Take it slow. If you become too uncomfortable, take a break and allow your fear reaction to subside.
The point of exposure therapy is to ease your fear response and train yourself to replace it with relaxation exercises. Focus on keeping control of your feelings and look for the symptoms of a fear reaction in yourself., This will aid your efforts toward exposing yourself to daddy longlegs without getting too upset and help you maintain control when you feel a fear reaction taking hold.


Keep reasonably good posture with your head in a resting position.
Focus on your breathing; keep your breaths steady and intentional.
Allow your chest and abdomen to fully expand with each breath., This will give you a frame to base your following steps on.This list is called a “fear hierarchy.”


Begin the list with things that only cause a slightly anxious feeling and list things in a manner that creates a progressive increase in your discomfort and fear.Start with something like, “seeing a daddy longlegs a few feet away” or “having a daddy longlegs in my room.”
Imagine yourself in the least frightening scenario. Picture it often and with a positive mindset until imagining it does not illicit a fear reaction.

, As you progress with the imaginary exercises, approach a daddy longlegs when you come across one, placing yourself in your first step (i.e. “seeing a daddy longlegs a few feet away.” Gauge your response and control your breathing. Continue to work on it this way until no longer experience a fear reaction when near a daddy long legs.As each situation becomes more manageable, move toward the next step on your list.
Approach each step by first imagining the scenario and managing your fear of it, then apply that practice to real life., If you begin to feel overwhelmed by your concerns, challenge those fear based thoughts with the knowledge you have.


Avoid “fortune telling,” or convincing yourself something bad will happen.Don’t over-generalize the situation. You may have had a negative experience in the past that helped solidify your fear of daddy longlegs. Don’t allow yourself to believe that will happen every time.Don’t exaggerate the situation. Encourage yourself to recognize the situation for what it is. Avoid exaggerations in your mind about the danger of the situation or what has happened.

, A common response to something scary is rapid breathing, but that can make it very difficult to regain control of your body.


Focus on taking slower, intentional breaths.
Slowed, deep breathing encourages a better oxygen exchange within your body. By improving the oxygen to carbon dioxide ratio within your body, you can lower your heart rate.Breath in through your nose, allowing your chest to fully expand, then exhale in a controlled manner through your mouth. After a few minutes, you should begin to feel more in control of your reaction. , You know daddy longlegs are not dangerous and that they can’t possibly harm you. Consider what you know and try to reason with yourself.


Stay calm and recognize what is happening to you. Have you noticed the common symptoms of a fear reaction in yourself? Identify them and recognize them for what they are: simply a chemical reaction.
Remember that you’re in charge. Your reaction is there to serve as a tool, not make decisions for you.

, Joking about the situation you’re afraid of is an extremely effective form of “cognitive reappraisal” that will help you cope with fear.Let yourself make light of the situation to subdue your fear reaction. Negative jokes are effective, but finding a way to make positive light of the situation works best.
Even making just one quip or joke about the situation or about your fear can have a marked effect on your ability to cope with the situation."

If you are a wheelchair user, or if you have a pushchair, heavy luggage, or a shopping trolley, do not use an escalator.,
DO NOT RUN!!!,
Always face the direction of travel.,
Do not walk up an escalator that is going down, and do not walk down an escalator that is going up.,
Always use the handrail.,
In an emergency, press the emergency stop button to stop the escalator.

",How to Use an Escalator Safely," Use a lift instead.;
, It is extremely dangerous to run on an escalator, even if you are likely to be late for something. Simply walk up or down (depending on the direction of the escalator) until you get to the top/bottom, or stand on one step until you reach the top.

, Failure to do so can increase your risk of falling.

, Doing so greatly increases the likelihood of falling down the escalator.

Understand the risks.,
Consider the person.,
Look at how the person is chewing and handling food in their mouth.,
Look for any signs or symptoms that things are ""going down the wrong way"".,
Look for symptoms that things are getting stuck in the esophagus, the tube that goes from your throat down to your stomach.,
Get help if needed.,
If directed by an SLP, try some exercises.,
Get more tests if needed.",How to Identify a Swallowing Difficulty," Why does dysphagia matter? Aspiration (ass-per-A-shun) is when some of the food or liquid goes past the vocal folds in the direction of your lungs. You might have experienced this as ""something going down the wrong pipe"", and it probably made you cough a lot. It happens to all of us once in a while (maybe someone said something funny while you were in the middle of taking a drink), but for someone with dysphagia, it could be happening with every meal or even with every bite or sip. If it's happening very often, the person can even stop feeling it and stop reacting in any way. They might have no idea that something is going down the wrong way. This is called ""silent aspiration"". Aspiration can lead to pneumonia, which is very serious and sometimes fatal.;
, Dysphagia is very common among the elderly, people who have had strokes, and people with dementia, Parkinson's Disease, MS, and other neurological conditions. However it can also affect anyone of any age, for many different reasons. (Dysphagia also affects infants, especially premature babies; however, this article will only discuss adults.)

, If any of these are true, the person might have ""oral dysphagia"", or dysphagia affecting the mouth.


Is the person taking a long time to chew?
Is the person chewing ineffectively or swallowing food that's only partially chewed up?
Is there food being held (""pocketed"") in the person's cheek on one or both sides?
Is the person impulsively putting too much food in their mouth?
Is there residual food stuck to the person's tongue, teeth, or in the back of their throat after they swallowed? Remember that the person may or may not be able to feel it. Try to have the person open their mouth after they swallowed and take a peek inside.
Is the person losing any food or liquid out the front of their mouth, because their lips aren't closed all the way?

, If any of these are true, the person might have ""pharyngeal dysphagia"", or dysphagia affecting the throat.


Is the person coughing while they are eating or drinking? (This might happen before or after they swallow.)
Is the person clearing their throat while they are eating or drinking? (This can also happen before or after they swallow.)
Does the person have a ""wet"" or ""gurgly"" sounding voice during meals, or after they swallow something?

, If any of these are true, the person might have ""esophageal dysphagia"".


Does the person complain of something getting ""stuck"", especially in the upper chest area?
Does the person regurgitate food during or after meals?
Does the person have a history of stomach problems, heartburn, or reflux?

, If any of the above are true, talk to a doctor about getting a swallowing evaluation from a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP). This is the professional who evaluates and treats swallowing disorders. Most SLPs work with children in schools, but many others specialize in treating adults with swallowing disorders. If you think that you or a loved one has difficulty swallowing, talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to an SLP who specializes in swallowing.


The SLP might recommend a modified diet, which could include changing the texture of either the solid foods, the liquids, or both.
Changes to the solid textures usually means avoiding certain hard or crunchy items (like nuts and popcorn), and might mean making all of the food softer. There are various levels of softness, ranging from just cutting the food up into bite-sized chunks, to foods that are completely pureed in the blender. The SLP will describe which texture is recommended for you and give you examples.
If you are having difficulty with liquids, the SLP might recommend thickening your liquids. There are several textures of liquids: Thin (normal water and most normal liquids), Nectar thick liquids, Honey thick liquids, and Pudding thick liquids. You can buy commercial thickeners at most drugstores that can be added to liquids to make them thicker. The SLP will let you know if you need thickened liquids and which texture is right for you.

, An SLP might also recommend exercises in order to make your swallow stronger. There are different exercises for different types of dysphagia, and you should only do the ones that are recommended to you by an SLP for your particular issue. 

, An SLP might also recommend further testing to find out the exact nature of your problem.


There are two different kinds of tests: A Modified Barium Swallow (MBS), which is a moving X-ray that can see exactly how the food goes down your throat, and a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), which is a little camera that goes through your nose and points down into your throat as you swallow different foods.

Look for shortness of breath.An enlarged heart cannot contract as well as a normal-sized heart.,
Watch out for swelling.Swelling of body parts due to fluid buildup (edema) is a common symptom associated with an enlarged heart.,
Look for arrhythmia.Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat.,
Pay attention to chest pain and coughing.Chest pain is often a secondary symptom caused by arrhythmia; however, coughing and chest pain deserve special attention because if present, you could be close to a heart attack.If you’re experiencing serious chest pain and coughing, contact a doctor immediately.,
Monitor feelings of fatigue.An enlarged heart makes it difficult to circulate blood properly throughout your body.",How to Identify Enlarged Heart Symptoms1," Because your heard does not pump as well, excess fluid backs up into your lungs, leading to shortness of breath.This symptom might be most noticeable when lying down or when engaging in physical activity.
You may find it hard to exercise or wake up in the middle of the night feeling short of breath.;
, It occurs for the same reason you develop shortness of breath: your poor circulation means that fluid cannot drain properly from your lungs, abdomen, and legs.Swelling in the legs is the most common form of edema associated with an enlarged heart.
You may incorrectly interpret the swelling as weight gain. If you experience a steady and inexplicable increase in your weight along with other symptoms of an enlarged heart, consult a doctor., If you can feel your heartbeat speeding up or slowing down inexplicably, you may have arrhythmia. This condition can be harmless, but it could also be cause for concern. Signs of arrhythmia include:Fainting or near fainting
Sweating
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Palpitations — A palpitation can be an increased or decreased heart rate, irregular rhythm, or a skipped or missed beat

,


If you’re coughing up a lot of frothy, watery sputum (saliva and mucus), you may be on your way to heart failure, a common consequence of an enlarged heart. You may also notice trace amounts of blood in your sputum., Without an adequate amount of blood circulating, you may start to feel fatigued and dizzy. A decreased blood supply to your brain, especially, can lead to feelings of fatigue or lethargy.


Keep in mind that fatigue can be a symptom of many conditions and does not particularly mean that you have an enlarged heart.

Have an echocardiogram (echo) done.,
Ask your doctor to take an X-ray.If you and your doctor suspect you have an enlarged heart, your doctor will probably make you get an X-ray.,
Do a stress test.A stress test can determine if you have an enlarged heart due to blockage in your heart arteries.,
Get blood tests.An enlarged heart may disrupt the production and levels of certain substances in your blood.,
Talk to your doctor about a cardiac catheterization and biopsy.Catheterization involves inserting a tube (catheter) into your groin and threading it through your body into your heart.A small sample of heart tissue can be removed and examined later.",How to Identify Enlarged Heart Symptoms2," This is considered the best way to diagnose an enlarged heart.An echo is a painless procedure in which the doctor uses ultrasound technology to examine the movement of blood through your heart on a monitor.The anatomical structure and functional activities of the four chambers of your heart can be assessed with this test. The valves of your heart can also be observed
If your doctor finds that the walls of your heart’s left ventricle are larger than 1.5 centimeters (about half an inch), your heart is considered enlarged.This test records the electrical activities of your heart and can detect irregularities in your heart’s rhythm.It can also aid in analyzing how a particular chamber of the heart has been enlarged. The heart’s activities are recorded on a graph.






An EKG provides information about heart rate, rhythm, and any conduction defects in the heart.

, X-ray images can help your doctor see the size and condition of your heart.


An X-ray can also help to determine if you have any irregular enlargement of parts of your heart, or if the shape of your heart has changed.

, Also known as an exercise stress test or exercise tolerance test, you will walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike for a given amount of time while doctors monitor your heart rate and blood pressure. If you have an enlarged heart, your heart will have a hard time coping with the physical activity, and the results will help you discover that you have an enlarged heart.

, By measuring the amount of these substances in your blood, a doctor can determine if you have an enlarged heart or a related condition.

, This technique is not usually necessary, since other techniques of diagnosis are less invasive and easier to perform.


During the procedure, the doctor might be able to capture images of the heart to visualize what your heart looks like.

Exercise.Exercise is recommended for most people with heart failure.,
Maintain normal blood pressure.High blood pressure causes the heart to work harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body.,
Manage medical conditions.There are many medical disorders that can lead to cardiomegaly.,
Hemochromatosis occurs when your body cannot metabolize iron properly.,
Adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle.Get eight hours of sleep each night.,
Talk to your doctor if you have had a heart attack.If you have had a heart attack in the past, you are more likely to develop an enlarged heart than people who have not experienced a heart attack.,
Steer clear of drugs and alcohol.Drugs and alcohol are connected to 30% of all cases of enlarged hearts.",How to Identify Enlarged Heart Symptoms3," The level of exercise you should aim for varies with your age, weight, gender, and physical ability. Talk to your doctor about how much you can and should work out.


Some people with heart valve problems should not exercise. Talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen if you already have cardiomegaly or other heart problems.
If you are just getting back into exercising, start with a daily walk. You can start with as little as 10 minutes, then work your way up to 30 minutes.

, This can lead to an enlarged heart, by causing enlargement and thickening of the heart muscle.


Ask your doctor for medications to lower your blood pressure.
Avoid salt and foods high in sodium to reduce your blood pressure.
Don’t use diet pills to lose weight. They raise blood pressure., If you have diabetes, amyloidosis, or valvular heart disease, you have a higher risk of cardiomegaly than the general population. Let your doctor know if you have a family history of heart problems. You can also talk to your doctor about getting a blood test done to diagnose potential heart problems.


Pay attention to thyroid disorders. Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart.
If you have valvular heart disease, you might need medications or surgery. Talk to your doctor about how to treat your valvular heart disease.Anemia can cause a heart to become enlarged. Anemia occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (a protein found in red blood cells) to carry oxygen to your tissues. Your heart must then pump harder to deliver enough oxygen to the rest of your body. This can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat.

, A buildup of iron can be toxic to your organs and weaken your heart muscle, leading to an enlarged left ventricle.


Manage medical conditions in concert with your doctor in order to prevent an enlarged heart.

, Take time out of your day to relax and enjoy yourself by walking around your neighborhood, watching TV, or reading a book. Engage in moderate physical activity for about 30 minutes each day. Limit the amount of salt, caffeine, and fat in your diet. Eat a diet of mostly whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with moderate amounts of protein.


Talk to your doctor about exercising. Some individuals with cardiomegaly cannot exercise because it might exacerbate their condition.
Use your alarm clock or watch to determine when you should go to bed and wake up each day. Having a regular sleep schedule helps the body adjust to sleeping the right amount.

, Cardiac muscles cannot regenerate, which means that a part of your heart will be weaker than your normal heart tissue.


When your heart has both healthy and weak tissue, the healthy tissue may become enlarged as it is forced to do more work.

, Alcohol and drugs break down heart muscle cells. Heavy drinking, especially, can lead to poor nutrition, which limits the heart’s ability to repair itself. As a result, your heart muscles may become structurally weak, producing enlargement. Therefore, avoid drinking alcohol and using drugs.


If you are addicted to drugs or alcohol, speak to a substance abuse counselor. Talk to a therapist to confront the underlying reasons why you drink and abuse drugs.
Get support from groups like Alcoholics Anonymous.

Do not smoke. Risk of heart attack greatly increases in smokers. People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day have more than twice the risk of heart attack than non-smokers. Use nicotine gum and patches to control cravings, and gradually reduce the amount you smoke each week until you’ve kicked the habit.

Stay calm.,
Listen closely to the feedback.,
Own up to the review.",How to Handle a Negative Review1," A negative review can be tough to swallow and you may start to feel angry or defensive. You may also react emotionally if you were not expecting the review to be so poor. Resist the urge to get upset, yell, or shout. Instead, try to stay calm and collected.If you are getting a negative performance review, you may react by simply nodding your head while the reviewer discusses your performance review. Try to maintain a neutral facial tone and maintain eye contact with the reviewer.
You should also try to display open body language, where you keep your body relaxed and your hands at your sides or in your lap. Try not to fold your arms over your chest or fidget with your clothing, as these are signs of closed body language.
If you are reading a negative review of your business online or getting an in person complaint from a customer, you should try to relax your body and take a deep breath before responding.
During the review, acknowledge any negative physical reactions that you are having, such as an increased heart rate, sweating, or a turning sensation in your stomach. These reactions are normal. Remind yourself that only you can feel these and the person who is reviewing you is unlikely to notice them. Acknowledge these physical sensations silently to yourself and then continue to focus on the conversation.;
, Though it may be difficult to listen to the review, try to pay attention to what the reviewer or the customer has to say. Focus on their words and try to pay attention to any information they are giving you during the review. This will allow you identify and address your performance issues later.You may take out a paper and pen to write down notes on what the reviewer or customer is saying to you. You may also ask for a copy of your performance review and write notes in the margins.
Try not to interrupt the reviewer or customer when they are speaking. The more information you absorb, the better you can address them and improve your performance. If you get distracted or get defensive during the review, you may miss an opportunity to understand the review and identify your performance issues.

, Be professional and accept the feedback in the review. Refusing to own up to the review will only show the reviewer or the customer that you are not willing to work on your issues or try to improve.If you are getting a negative performance review, you may be required to sign the review to acknowledge you have read it and understood it. Sign or initial the review willingly to show the reviewer that you are able to own up to the review and acknowledge your performance issues.
You can also own up to the review by saying, “Thank you for taking the time to share this information with me. I take this review seriously and would like to work on improving my performance.”

Notice sudden and severe pain.,
Keep an eye out for inflammation or bruising.,
Notice any deformity of the affected leg.,
Realize if you cannot put weight on the injured leg.,
Look for severe bleeding.,
Consider the presence of muscle spasms or numbness.",How to Identify a Broken Femur1," When you break your femur, the pain will be sharp, pulsating and excruciating. When the femur is broken, the pain receptors send pain signals to the brain and pain is perceived. This is not the type of pain you might not notice, it is extreme and intense.


Especially consider pain that intensifies upon weight bearing activity and exercise and subsides with proper rest.;
, If inflammation or bruising is present at the site of pain, this indicates the possibility of a broken bone.


Inflammation results from the body’s immune system releasing inflammatory chemicals in order to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process. Bruises appear when the blood vessels break because of the force or blow to the skin. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in a red, black or purple skin mark.

, The length could be shorter compared to the other leg, or feature abnormal twisting. The reason why the length of the leg is shorter than the other after the injury is that the injured femur might be out of its bone socket, also called the acetabulum.

, Failure to put any weight on the injured leg can indicate a break. If putting weight on the injured leg leads to sharp, pulsating and excruciating pain, the leg is probably broken.

, This can occur if the broken femur punctured through the skin, also called as an open fracture. During an open fracture, blood vessels are exposed out of the skin. Blood will drain from these areas in large amounts, becoming obvious very quickly.

, When the muscle fibers in the femoral area stretch or tear due to a break, these muscle fibers contract and tighten. This contraction results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. Reduced blood flow can lead to spasms and a funny feeling or numbness in the affected area.

Ask clarifying questions.,
Reflect on the feedback.,
Create a performance plan.,
Request feedback on a regular basis.,
Consider if the position is not the right fit for you.",How to Handle a Negative Review2," You should focus on identifying your performance issues so you can then address them successfully. Start by asking the reviewer or your boss questions to clarify any notes in your performance review. In your questions, request concrete examples of what you can do better in the future so you can take real action.For example, you may notice the reviewer notes you do not take enough risks in your current role. You may then ask, “Can you provide an example of a time when I should have taken a risk? What could I have done differently to take more initiative?”
Another example may be a comment in your review of not hitting the performance targets for your department. You may then ask, “What level of performance would you consider a success? How can I achieve this performance for my department?”

, You should then take some time to reflect on the feedback given to you in the performance review. Thank the reviewer for feedback and then go home and think on what they had to say. Read over the review in detail and allow yourself to digest the feedback.You may ask yourself, “How can I address this feedback in my day to day actions?” or “What can I do differently moving forward?” Asking yourself clarifying questions can make it easier for you to understand and accept the feedback.
You may want to reach out to your colleagues and your friends for advice. Discussing the negative review with others can help you put the feedback into perspective and better understand where you went wrong. Try to talk to friends who are in a professional career that is similar to yours or to a peer who has experience with negative performance reviews in the past.
If you are dealing with a negative performance review, be careful not to vent about the review to people you work with, especially if you are not close with them or you do not have a trusting relationship. You do not want word to get back to your boss that you are complaining about your bad performance review.

, Depending on your company’s policy, you may be placed on probation and required to commit to a performance improvement plan. You can also address your performance issues by creating a performance plan on your own. You may discuss the performance plan with your manager or your boss and give yourself a set time period to achieve certain performance goals.You may allot thirty to sixty days to achieve your performance goals and change up your working style. Your manager may help you develop these goals and outline how you can achieve them in an active, realistic way.
For example, you may set performance goals around taking more risks in your current position. You may outline ways to do this, such as following up with potential clients, setting up networking meetings with current clients and pushing a specific product to increase your sales.

, You should remain open to feedback from your manager or boss on a regular basis, as this will show that you are actively trying to improve your performance. Have weekly check-ins with your manager to follow up on your performance goals and get feedback on how you are doing so far. Be willing to get constructive criticism from your boss and implement any changes they suggest so your performance can improve.You may also set a date for your second performance review or a follow up review with your manager. This could thirty to sixty days from the date of the first review. Work to achieve your performance goals before the follow up review date so your second performance reviews goes well.

, If you have tried your hardest to improve your performance, but you feel you are still falling short, you may want to step back and consider if the position is the right fit for you. Perhaps the position is not suited to your skillset and you may want to consider a different position at the company. Or perhaps you need to consider a new position in a different department or even a different field. Forcing yourself to try to succeed at a position that is not suited to you may not lead to success.You may want to have a follow up meeting with your manager or your boss to discuss your career options. Be honest about being unsure about your current position and propose switching to a different department or area. If your manager is not interested in doing this, you may want to consider applying for positions that suit you better at a different company.

Take the review as a learning opportunity.,
Identify possible issues you can address now.,
Respond to the review with appreciation.,
Offer the customer an incentive.",How to Handle a Negative Review3," As a business owner, you should try to see every review from your customers as a way to learn and expand your business. Studies have shown that for every disgruntled customer there are 26 customers who remain silent but may have the same or similar issues with your business.Responding to a negative review with thoughtfulness and care will allow you to keep your customers happy and ensure they remain loyal to you.You should start by reading the review over or listening to an in store review carefully. Then, consider how you can learn from the review. You may ask yourself, “How can I use this customer review in a constructive way?” or “What type of feedback is being given in this review and how can I act on it?”
Sometimes customers simply have a bad day and use an online review as a place to vent. If you cannot identify any constructive feedback or learning moments in the review, you may not be able to solve the customer’s issue as a business owner.
Remind yourself that this is a review of your business and not a review of you. Although your business if important to you, it is important to remind yourself that a negative review is not a criticism of who you are.

, You should then consider any issues in the review that you can address right away. You may be able to come up with a solution to the negative review by taking a few steps to improve the customer experience. Or, you may offer a solution to the customer to help address their issue.For example, you may get a negative review of your product from a customer that notes the product did not work as advertised. You may then consider how the product is being advertised and think about whether it being advertised correctly. You may decide to adjust the wording or language in your marketing so it feels more accurate and does not make any false promises.
Keep in mind there may be issues in the review that you cannot solve right away. For example, a customer may complain about the taste of your product. You may consider adjusting the taste of your product slightly, but you may not be willing to do an overhaul of your entire product because one customer did not enjoy the taste.

, You may ask clarifying questions if the customer is in front of you, such as “How do you feel we can improve next time?” or “How could we do better in the future?” If you are responding to an online review, you should do so concisely and with appreciation. You want to come off as sincere and thankful that the customer has provided you with feedback in your response.For example, you may respond to a customer who received poor service by saying, “Thank you for your review of our business. We apologize for the poor service you received from our customer service team. We take customer reviews very seriously and will be speaking to our customer service team about your review.”
Avoid responding with anger, frustration, or a passive-aggressive tone. The customer will likely pick up on this and may not appreciate this type of response from you. This may also lead to another negative review from your customer, which will just make the issue worse.

, If you feel your business really failed the customer, you should also try to offer the customer an incentive to try your business or product again. This may be a complimentary product on their next visit or a discount on a service that you offer. Try to make it up to the customer in a concrete way, as this will show them that you take customer reviews seriously.You may decide to offer only a few customers an incentive, especially if their negative review is especially critical of your business and points out some clear issues that you need to fix or adjust. You cannot please every customer, no matter the incentive, so you may decide to pick and choose which customers you respond to directly.

Focus on constructive feedback in the review.,
Consider not responding to the review at all.,
Lean on peers and mentors for emotional support.",How to Handle a Negative Review4," You should start by reading the review carefully for constructive feedback, which is feedback that feels thoughtful, detailed, and useful to you as the creator. Go through the review and note any points that feel they may help you improve your work in the future. Ignore any points that simply state “I did not like this” or “This was bad” without providing concrete examples from your work to support these claims.You should also consider any comments in the review that may feel irrelevant. Perhaps the reviewer misses the point or does not seem to understand what you were trying to do in your artwork. Because their comments seem clueless, you may be able to simply say, “Whatever” and brush them off.

, Though it may feel tempting to respond in anger or with a witty retort to the review, not responding may be the best option. Responding to the review with a calm, patient reply may feel good in the moment, but it does not mean the reviewer has to reply or even acknowledge your reply. Not responding to the review can help you move on and focus on other reviews that may be more useful to you and your work.Try to accept the review as one person’s opinion and then move on. You can’t please everybody, especially when you are creating art, which is subjective at best.
You should also keep in mind that any publicity is good publicity, especially in the art world or the publishing world. Though the review may have been bad, it still helps you raise your profile as an artist.

, You should reach out to those closest to you and get emotional support, especially if the review hurt you on a personal level. Though you may try not to take the review personally, this is easier said than done. Lean on your peers and your mentors for support and advice. They will likely remind you that the review is just one of many and that you need to be confident enough in your work to handle reviews from others, positive and negative."

Recognize the common causes of a broken femur.,
Understand that athletes are at an elevated risk of breaking the femur.,
Be aware that women are more prone to breaking bones.,
Know that preexisting medical conditions can heighten your risk of breaking your femur.,
Know that people of advanced age are at risk of femur breaks.,
Consider lifestyle factors that can affect your risk of breaking bones.,
Be aware that tumors or cysts can weaken bones.,
Know about the dangers of deconditioning.",How to Identify a Broken Femur2," There are some common causes of broken femurs that can be easily identified. Because the femur is such a strong bone, it usually requires significant impact or trauma to break it. Some of the most common ways to break your femur are:


Falls. Falling is the most common cause of a fracture, especially when you land badly. Toddlers who play outdoors, often slip and accidentally fall because of scattered toys.
Significant or massive trauma. This kind of trauma would be impossible to miss, and could include being hit in the leg with a hammer or a vehicular accident.
Sports injuries. Injuries, especially in contact sports such as hockey, can commonly cause broken femurs. This is especially the case in sports where a bat or hockey stick is used and accidentally hits the thigh.

, Individuals who participate in sports or are serious athletes are at high risk for a broken femur. Athletes who do certain activities like running, ballet dancing, basketball and other close contact sports like football and hockey are also prone to having broken femurs due to the high impact blows that the thigh bone receives.

, Women, especially those with an irregular menstrual cycle, are at an increased risk of breaking bones. During menstruation, a sufficient amount of iron is lost. Iron is needed in the proper development of bones.


Iron deficiency can predispose women to breaking bones.
Additionally, hormonal imbalances in women lead to bone weakening especially if estrogen (female sex hormone that regulates bone growth) is low.

, People with preexisting medical conditions, especially osteoporosis, are prone to breaking bones because they have weak and brittle bones.


Osteoporosis is a condition related to aging which causes the bones to become fragile and brittle because of hormonal and lack of absorption of calcium and vitamin D.

, People aged above 65 are at an increased risk of breaking their femur. This is because during aging, our bones weaken as the body absorbs less calcium, a mineral necessary for strong bones.


The body’s ability to metabolize important nutrients diminishes as a normal part of aging.

, People who drink more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week or smoke are at a higher risk of breaking bones. This is because substances in alcohol and cigarettes tend to reduce bone density.


Additionally, people with eating disorders have reduced amounts of calcium and vitamin D, nutrients that are necessary for strengthening the bones.

, As tumors or cysts grow, they can press against the surrounding tissues of the bone resulting in bone destruction and weakening. This can put you at increased risk of breaking your femur.


If you suspect that you may have some kind of tumor, get it checked out by the doctor immediately.

, Deconditioning causes decreased muscle mass and muscle weakness, especially due to lack of exercise. Physical activity causes formation of new bone tissue. If you stay inactive, then your bones will become brittle and fragile.

Know when to see your doctor.,
Discuss your medical history.,
Get a physical examination.,
Get imaging tests.",How to Identify a Broken Femur3," Although treatment is usually effective, it is important that you check with your doctor or a specialist (podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon) right away if you experience signs that your recovery is regressing. If pain, discomfort and swelling do not subside, it is best to head to the emergency department of the nearest hospital or treatment facility.


Some indications that you need to return to your doctor are: shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, frequent and painful urination, redness or increased pain around the incision site, the presence of excessive drainage, swelling, increased temperature (more than 37 degrees Celsius), incessant pain not controlled or managed by analgesics.

, The doctor will interview you and ask you some questions are necessary to gather information. This information will aid the doctor in accurately diagnosing a broken femur.

, A thorough physical examination is done where the doctor will inspect, palpate and percuss the affected area. Symptoms such as tenderness, pain, and swelling are determined in this manner.

, Imaging will help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. The extent and severity of a broken bone can be shown using different forms of imaging. Generally, x-ray is sufficient to determine whether or not you have a broken femur. If the x-ray is unsuccessful, further imaging will be ordered. Some possible types of imaging are seen below:


X-ray. The use of radio waves to determine the site and extent of a break in bone.
Computed tomography scan. A modernized method of evaluating the internal structures of the body. CT scans take computerized images and convert them into visual diagrams to provide a clearer picture of what is happening within the affected site and its surrounding joints, ligaments or bones.
Bone scan. Can identify a broken bone. This scan uses a radioactive tracer injected through an intravenous line to demonstrate areas where bone cells have increased activity and blood supply, suggesting bone repair. A bright white spot is shown on the scan image.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A procedure used to establish the degree of injury acquired by the patient through a scan. It uses radio and magnetic field waves to form a more detailed and clear picture of the scanned body structure.

Be aware of how the illness progresses.,
Understand how your child would contract the illness.,
Be aware that the incubation period usually does not cause any symptoms to occur.,
Look for symptoms roughly 11 days after your child was exposed to an infected person.,
Check for mild or low-grade fever.,
Watch out for mild conjunctivitis.,
See if your child has developed Photophobia (Light Sensitivity).,
Monitor your child’s runny nose.,
Look to see if your child’s eyes are red.,
Listen for a dry cough.,
Watch for signs that your child has lost her appetite.,
Check for signs of body malaise or weakness.,
Look for Koplik’s spots.,
Look for a rash behind your child’s ears and along her back and cheeks.,
Do not touch your child’s rash unless you are vaccinated against the illness.,
Apply calamine lotion to the rash.",How to Identify Measles in a Child," The measles infection develops in stages and comes with several signs and symptoms as it evolves. The illness is contagious prior to the onset of the prodromal phase, or the time in which signs and symptoms starts to occur. It takes five days before rashes become visible. It continues to become contagious until four days following the onset of the rashes.The early symptoms of measles typically emerge 10 days after your child becomes infected and resolve around the 7th to 10th day afterwards.;
, The incubation period of the measles virus is 10 to 14 days following exposure. If a person has measles, your child must be at least 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) near the infected person to be at risk of inhaling the measles virus. Your child can inhale it in the form of respiratory droplets that comes from certain activities of an infected individual such as breathing, coughing, talking or sneezing. , During this period, it is impossible for parents to identify measles in their child because it is usually not accompanied by any signs and symptoms., The Prodromal Phase (non-specific signs and symptoms) begins 11 days following exposure to the measles virus and lasts 4 to 5 days., Low-grade fevers range from about 100 degree Fahrenheit to 101 degree Fahrenheit (37 to 38 degrees Celsius).When your child’s body detects the virus, it will try to burn it out by increasing the temperature of the body. Use a thermometer to measure your child’s temperature.


For infants, you can detect fever through the following non-verbal cues:

Irritability
Fussy or hard to soothe
May not suck on the breasts or bottle
Cries constantly
Exhibits episodes of shivering or chilling


For verbal children they may complain of:

Feeling hotter or colder than normal
Headache
Pain in different parts of the body
A bitter taste which leads to loss of appetite


Verbal children can also display non-verbal cues of fever such as:

Irritability
Episodes of shivering or chilling
Lethargy



, Conjunctivitis is the swelling of the eyelids and eyeballs that occurs when rashes develop on a child’s face. Look to see if your child’s eyes look puffier than usual.Verbal children may complain of a burning pain in their eyes. They may rub their eyes because conjunctivitis is itchy and leads to tear formation.

, Photophobia is characterized by the occurrence of pain whenever the eyes are exposed to bright lights. This happens when the eyes are swollen; bright lights can further aggravate the situation.You may notice that your child immediately closes his or her eyes when exposed to bright lights.

, A runny nose occurs to prevent infectious agents from entering the lungs by blocking them in the nose and trapping them in mucus secretions, which is the fluid that comes out of the nose. In cases of infections such as measles, mucus secretions are generally green or yellow and usually thick., Your child’s eyes might become red as the virus colonizes in his or her respiratory tract. The redness is a sign that the virus is affecting your child’s inner nose and the passage between the eyes and the nose., This will most commonly occur if the infection is in the respiratory tract. Coughing is your child’s body’s way of expelling infectious agents.


A cough caused by measles is generally deep-sounding, hoarse, and barking. Your child may cough for long intervals at a time., When a child gets sick, his or her eating patterns often get disrupted. In particular, fevers can affect the taste buds; if your child’s sense of taste becomes impaired, he or she will be less likely to eat.

, Momentary muscle fatigue or weakness can be caused by infection. Muscles swell when infections are present as the body releases inflammatory chemicals to react with the infection. Your child may verbalized body weakness or an aching pain. Your child can tell you which part of their body is painful and can point it out.They may tell you that they just want to lie in bed and sleep because they feel weak.

, This symptom generally occurs at the end of the prodromal phase. Koplik’s spots refer to white spots that have bluish or white centers enclosed by a red ring. They generally appear along your child’s gums and on the inside of the cheeks. These are a hallmark of measles.These spots may bleed intermittently.

, Five days after Koplik’s spots become visible, they will shed off. At the same time, a rash will begin to form behind your child’s ears, neck, and cheeks. Within the next three days, the rash will spread over the face, arms, trunk, thighs, lower legs, and feet.At the same time, your child’s temperature will spike up to 40°C to 41°C (104°F to 105.8°F). Measles rash may last 5 to 6 days and may slowly fade away in the same manner it appeared. The rash leaves a brownish tint and flakes in the skin that vanish within 7 to 10 days., Measles rash can be spread very easily, which is why it is important to keep your child home from school. If you do not have the measles vaccine, do not touch your child while the rash is still present.


Vaccinated parents, and those who have had measles before are considered immune to the disease.

, Calamine lotion can be applied to the rash to soothe itchiness, but make sure not to directly touch the rashes. Use sterile gloves or a cotton bud to apply the calamine lotion to the rashes.After application, calamine lotion evaporates and produces a cooling effect that helps alleviate the itchiness. Apply calamine lotion as often as necessary.

Encourage laughter.",How to Help Your Loved One Get Well," Frequently care givers overlook their own health and well-being while taking care of others. This is a very difficult and stressful time for everyone involved. If you’re not well rested, not getting your sleep, it is virtually impossible for you to be able to provide the assistance and support your loved one needs. Sometimes this requires difficult choices, but the bottom line remains. You must take care of you first!;
, While many people focus on wanting to get over their illness, it is crucial to encourage your loved one to focus on what’s working. During a hospital stay, many patients tend to focus on not wanting to be sick, rather than getting well. While the difference between the two may seem subtle but it is very important. A focus on health, essentially stimulates the body to improve and to heal. An intention to get well, in very important and measurable ways helps the body.

, Use them as a catalyst, as a challenge to overcome whatever disease you are facing. Despite the odds, others have lived, your special one can, too! Unfortunately, doctors are trained not to give “false hope,” and often give patients dire predictions that appear to be credible predictions based on statistics involving other patients. Of course such bleak predictions will have a very negative impact on recovery and health.


Many patients have proven over the years that we all possess the ability to survive, thrive and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Regardless of the diagnosis and prognosis you are facing, please know all is not lost. Men and women like you have faced the challenges of living with and overcoming serious and potentially fatal diseases. These experiences led me to believe that you, too, can get well, too!
Usually predictions are based on statistics that reflect the experience of other people. The will to live, the desire to get well, has a tremendous impact on our bodies and can mean the difference, literally between recovery and illness, health and disease and life and death. They can’t accurately predict how long you will live. Remember: All statistics are about other people’s experiences! And may not necessarily predict yours unless you allow them to by putting faith in them.


, How do you feel about this experience called “disease”? Does it create fear, anxiety, denial, and constant thoughts? That’s normal. All of these emotions are a part of the disease process. You can work your way through all of them, with awareness and patience.

, Sometimes you’re frightened, anxious, distressed. Also, lonely, pain, fatigues. That’s very normal. Acknowledge them.

, With the patient’s permission, ask the treating physician pertinent questions. Ask about options, second and even third opinions, if the patient isn’t comfortable with the doctor’s recommendations. Write the patient’s questions down, and act as an advocate. The internet has great health information resources. Use them!

, First and foremost, one of the healthiest things you can do for your loved one during their hospitalization and recuperation is to turn off the news (any type, unless you just watch the weather)! Encourage them not to watch violent, depressing television programs. If possible, bring photos, blankets, small tokens from home that will help the patient to feel more comfortable. Also, encourage him/her to watch inspiring comedy and educational programs. Use the resources that are available to you via the Internet, books, CDs, DVDs, and other formats.

, It doesn’t matter who that is. A health professional, family member, spouse, friend or someone else can be a great well-being coach, a valuable asset.

, Medical research demonstrates optimists are healthier and recover faster than pessimists. Every crisis can be viewed as an opportunity. Your encouraging words can have a tremendous impact. Help your loved one to see that their cup isn’t necessarily half empty, it’s half full. A pessimistic view can be transformed into one that is more optimistic.

, This is a very important thing to do. Most illnesses are stress related. When your body is relaxed it has the opportunity to regenerate and heal.

, Laughter is one of the easiest and fastest ways to promote health. During the last 20 years researchers across the globe have identified the positive impact it has on our bodies, especially its ability to reverse the impact of stress on our bodies, a key ingredient to the development of most chronic diseases.

Avoid negative thoughts and actions.,
Accept your circumstances and who you are.,
Believe that you can change your mental habits.,
Forgive and forget.,
See a psychotherapist.,
Reduce stress.,
Distract yourself from negative thinking.,
Help others.,
Smile.,
Express your anger in appropriate ways.,
Socialize with people who have good mental hygiene.,
Try new things.",How to Overcome Bad Mental Hygiene," When you find yourself thinking and even planning to say things that you will regret later, you can tell yourself mentally to be quiet. If what you were thinking of saying would be unhelpful or unwise to do, take a moment to consider what you actually wish to express. If you are over thinking or having negative thoughts, think of something peaceful or happy instead.


Try replacing your negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, if you failed an exam, rather than saying ""I can't pass this class, why bother?"" you might say ""I did poorly on that exam, if I study harder I can do better next time."";
, Acceptance is proactive, not giving up: Tell yourself that you want to improve various aspects of your life. However, it is also important to accept yourself as you are, while you improve. To practice self-acceptance as follows:


Write down a list of your strengths. You can also ask your friends and family to write down what they find as your strengths., If you don't believe that you can actually change your present and future outcomes, you probably won't try. But, if you believe: ""Yes, I can make a difference and can change."", you'll see opportunities for change with hope and faith toward beginning and following-through. This is called a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"".Certainty that you can change your mental life is based on many different understandings and techniques found below that can be applied toward progress.

, Don't bring up wrongs, unless they are unavoidable. Studies show that the act of forgiving others is good for one's mental health and well-being. So, next time someone wrongs you, do your best to accept the situation and forgive that person. Even if you must fake a smile, smile. ""Hold your tongue"", if you must.


To forgive someone you might say ""What you did really hurt me but I know that we all make mistakes sometimes and you seem genuinely remorseful. It may take some time for us to be completely back to normal but I do forgive you.""

Empathize with the other person. Really try to put yourself in the other's shoes; this can help you realize that to make errors is human. Just as you make mistakes from time to time, so will other reasonable people., Qualified mental health professionals such as psychologists, counselors, or licensed social workers, are trained in techniques for improving their clients' mental hygiene. These techniques may involve removing negative patterns of thinking and/or creating positive patterns of thinking.It is a misconception that one needs to have a major mental illness to benefit from seeing a psychotherapist. If you would like to improve your mental hygiene, give psychotherapy a try!

, Stress can be a large contributor to negative feelings and thoughts. You can reduce your stress levels by identifying factors that cause stress and working to reduce them, by practicing yoga, and/or by exercising, among other ways.Social support can help mitigate the impact of stress, so be sure to spend quality time with family and friends., When you find yourself having negative thoughts, try distracting yourself from them. This will change your mind and reduce your bad mental hygiene. To distract yourself you might:Rub your fingers together and focus on the sensations that this causes. Pay close attention to the texture of your fingers and the temperature that you feel by rubbing them together.
Take deep breaths in and out. Specifically, breathe in over the course of five seconds and hold your breath

, One way to get rid of bad mental hygiene is to replace it with better mental habits. Studies show that spending time or money on others can increase your happiness and well-being. These are two critical factors that are the direct opposite of bad mental hygiene.So, to get rid of bad mental hygiene, it can help you to help others.
There are a number of ways that you might help others, including, for example, assisting strangers who seem in need of aid, donating your time at a homeless shelter, or giving a homeless person a hot meal or a few dollars.

, One interesting way you might be able to help overcome your bad mental hygiene is by forcing yourself to smile a few times a day, even if you don't feel like it. Studies have shown that forming the facial muscles into a smile increases positive mood.One way to get yourself to smile when you don't feel like it, is to hold a pencil between your teeth so that the erased bit is at one corner of your mouth and the writing bit is at the other corner of your mouth.

, It is important to let your negative feelings out, otherwise they may well up and promote bad mental hygiene. To let your anger out in acceptable ways you might:


Write a mean note about someone you are mad at but don't show it to anyone, then rip it up or burn it. The point is to allow you to vent your frustrations without hurting anyone.
Go to the gym and do a challenging workout to get your anger out that way.
Go for a long jog to blow off some steam.
Try imagining the situation as humorous. Think about what is funny about the situation you are in. As many great comedians over the years have shown, most topics can be funny if looked at from a certain angle. Looking at things that make you angry from a comedic perspective can help you to reduce your feelings of anger. , We learn a lot from those around us.Take advantage of this and spend time with people whose mental hygiene you admire. Look toward people who are positive, who are non-judgmental, and who are excited about life.


That said, recognize that the range of emotions, from low to high, are all a part of life. No one is going to be happy all the time. Sometimes sad or angering events will occur. A sign of good mental hygiene is how that person responds to their emotions.

, Once a week or so, go seek out a new experience. Doing so can keep boredom at bay, which can help fend off bad mental hygiene.Specifically, you might:


Try a new coffee shop rather than going to your usual spot.
Get into a conversation with a stranger.
Try a new activity.
Try a new musical instrument.
Try whatever else excites you.

Start by laughing at something from the past.,
Recognize your own limitations.,
Try to laugh at your present mistake.,
Forgive yourself and let go of expectations.,
Try to be more lighthearted about life.,
Find more positivity in your own life.,
Laugh at yourself to avoid being laughed at.,
Use humor to defuse tense situations.,
Find ways of using humor to cope with stress.",How to Learn to Laugh at Your Mistakes," If the embarrassment and frustration of a recent mistake are too fresh on your mind, you might find it easier to laugh about a mistake you made in the past. Having some time that's passed between that event and your present state of mind could ease some of the tension you feel about making mistakes.Think about a time in the past when you said or did something embarrassing.
Step outside yourself for a moment and imagine how silly it might have looked or sounded to an outside observer.
If you've ever laughed at someone else for making a similar mistake, you should be able to see the humor in your own mistake.;
, Many people strive for absolute perfection in all aspects of life. However, perfection is impossible. Expecting yourself to be perfect will only set you up for disappointment and frustrations. That doesn't mean you're not skilled or capable; it just means that you're human.Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. Everyone does from time to time.
Accept that you're just as prone to mistakes as everyone else. It's what makes you human, and there's nothing wrong with that., This may not come easy at first, but with practice you'll be able to see your situation as less serious than it really is. Once you're able to stop expecting perfection, you should be able to step outside your own fears and anxieties to see the humor in your mistake.


Consider the alternative to laughter. What good will getting angry or upset really do?
If you're able to correct your mistake, then try to do so. If not, try to realize that it's just a silly mistake and that your best option is to laugh it off.

, If you find yourself in a stressful or upsetting situation, you may be wondering how you can work it out to achieve perfect results. However, it may be worth stepping back and asking yourself how often in life you've actually been able to get perfect results out of any situation. If you're honest with yourself, you should quickly realize that your expectations are often higher than what is really possible in a given situation.You've probably committed many mistakes throughout the course of your life. The reason you made it through okay was because you adjusted your expectations and accepted the outcome eventually.
Did dwelling on your mistakes help the situation at all, or cause you more stress/frustration?
Eventually you stopped stressing about a mistake you made. All that happened was that you learned to forgive yourself and stop dwelling on what you ""should"" have said or done.
Why prolong the forgiveness process? Instead of torturing yourself for days, weeks, or months, just let go of what ""should"" have happened and forgive yourself for making a simple mistake.

, Life can be very serious at times, and that seriousness may even be devastating. There is and will always be suffering in life, both for you and for others. While suffering is unpleasant, it's important to remember that there are many good times, too, which typically outweigh the bad times.If you let every instance of suffering or sadness in the world get to you, you would be an emotional mess all the time. Instead of taking on suffering, try to actively embrace the good things in life.
Think about all the things you have to be grateful for in your own life. Try to also consider how many happy, fun memories you have, and focus on those good thoughts instead of the self-doubting or self-punishing thoughts.

, It can be easy to take life too seriously if you don't see the positive in a given situation. Doing so may not always be easy, which is why it's important to try to cultivate positivity in other areas of your life. Over time, you'll learn to appreciate the little things in life that make you happy, which may help you stop dwelling on the bad things that upset you.Practice gratitude by showing sincere appreciation whenever someone helps you out, even in small ways.
Focus on things that amuse you. Listen to stand-up comedy, read new and funny jokes, watch funny movies/TV shows, and do fun things that make you happy.

, Many people feel embarrassed when they make a mistake or do something foolish in front of others. That embarrassment can be painful, but it won't undo the fact that other people witnessed the mistake. In situations like this, laughing at your own mistakes can actually take away the power of others to laugh at you.If you make a mistake and immediately joke about it, it won't sting when other people laugh. They'll be laughing at your joke instead of at your mistake.
Laughing at yourself shifts the dynamic of any situation. When you decide to laugh/joke about your mistake, you hold all the situational power.
Try saying something like, ""Wow, I haven't even had anything to drink!"" if you trip or lose your balance. If you're stumbling over your words during a presentation, laugh it off by saying, ""Guess I could have used that second cup of coffee this morning.""
Your joke doesn't have to be all that clever, as long as you deliver it quickly and with a tone of self-deprecation.

, Humor has the potential to resolve minor conflicts between two people. Finding ways to laugh during a tense moment can help put everyone involved a little more at ease, and once that happens the anger and tension between two people tends to fade quickly.If two people are in a conflict, do not make a joke about one of them. Similarly, if you're in a conflict with someone else, don't make a joke about that person.
Try making fun of yourself, no matter how you're related to the present conflict. This can help put everyone at ease and take focus away from the mounting tension.
If two colleagues are arguing at work about whose project turned out better, for example, you might defuse the situation by making fun of your own abilities.
Say something like, ""Well both of your projects are way better than mine would be. You'd think I was born with two left hands on this assignment.""

, Studies suggest that using humor during a stressful situation can help reframe your mindset regarding that situation. When you're able to laugh, your mind stops seeing the stressor as a threat and starts seeing it as more of a challenge to be overcome.Instead of letting yourself feel overwhelmed by everything going on in your life, try seeing the situation as something that can be made fun of.
Try imagining your stressful situation as the plot to a comedy show that you're writing. You've been given the basic materials of the situation, and now it's your job to find something funny in all of it.
As you begin to see the humor in your situation, you should be able to break out of the mindset that your situation is dangerous or damaging. Instead, you'll realize that you can manage this stress and get through the situation, even if it takes some work.

Take a test to identify bias.,
Recognize situations that make you uncomfortable.,
Understand positive bias.,
Ask for objective opinions.",How to Overcome Biases1," You can find tests online that will help you pinpoint areas in which you have formed biased opinions. Taking such a test can be a great way to learn about your implicit biases. This is the first step to overcoming them., Being uncomfortable in a situation can point to a bias of some kind. Make note of any situations or people that make you feel uneasy. If there are any common threads, this points toward a biased opinion about that particular situation.For example, if being in a restaurant and overhearing a conversation in a language that is not English is unnerving to you, you may be biased against other cultures or immigrants in general.

, Most people think of biases as negative qualities that are assigned to a group of people or situations. This is not always true. A positive bias is a positive trait that is assumed to be present. Positive biases can make people feel that they are only valued for one thing. It can also damage the self esteem of someone who you assume has this positive trait, but actually doesn’t.For example, assuming that all Asians can do math would be a positive bias.

, Your friends, family, or spouse might spot biases that you don’t. If they try to point out that you are being closed minded or stubborn about something, listen. You can also be proactive and ask for their opinions.


For example, you might say something like “I am trying to become more open minded. Are there any particular issues that I seem to be biased on?”

Write an entry in a gratitude journal.",How to Overcome Bad Moods1," Sometimes a bad mood is like the weather: it just happens. Other times, a bad mood has a specific cause. Perhaps you are stressed out at work, or perhaps you had a fight with a close friend. Take a few minutes to breathe and think about why it is that you are feeling down: that is the first step to finding a solution to your bad mood., One of the most common reasons for a bad mood is feeling lonely and rejected. Rather than stewing when you feel lonesome, consider reaching out to your friends or family members.Write them a letter, give them a call, or schedule a coffee date. This will help you realize that you are not alone.


If you do not have friends or family nearby, consider joining a meetup group to . You can also volunteer or attend classes to meet like-minded people in your neighborhood.

, Sometimes a bad mood can be caused by receiving a compliment when you do not feel worthy of admiration. To make sure that you admire yourself as much as the rest of the world does, undertake self-affirmation exercises.Write down in a journal your talents, skills, abilities, and positive traits. This will help you see yourself in the positive light that others see you.

, It isn't always possible to just ""snap out"" of a bad mood. When you get into a funk and nothing seems to be working, forgive yourself for feeling bad. Understand that everyone experiences these moods sometimes: it is not a reflection of your worth as a person., Studies show that listening to music can help improve moods.When you feel a bad mood coming on, put on your favorite album or find a new artist. Sing and dance along to make yourself feel more positive about the world.


If you feel stressed out, consider listening to classical music, Celtic music, or Indian raga music. Listening to these types of music for 30 minutes a day can help lower blood pressure and help you feel healthy and relaxed., One common reason for a bad mood is having too much on your plate, leading to stress and a general feeling of being overwhelmed.To get yourself out of a funk, find the easiest and quickest task on your list and get it done. Even if it is something simple like folding your laundry, you will feeling better for crossing something off your to-do list.

, Emotions can be contagious, much like physical illnesses.Spending time with someone who is stressed out or in a bad mood can make you feel the same way. Try to find a few friends who are always in a good mood and spend time with them. You might find that their optimism is contagious too.

, If you cannot shake your bad mood, find something to do that requires mental energy and concentration. Do a puzzle, watch your favorite funny movie, or do some baking. Occupying your mind with a task for a few minutes--especially a pleasant one--might help you forget your bad mood., A hobby can serve as an effective distraction. It can also help you see just how talented and productive you can be. When you are feeling down, working on something at which you excel can be immensely valuable. Whether it is playing an instrument, making art, playing a sport, or doing stand-up comedy, engaging in your favorite activity is an excellent mood elevator.

, There might be an advantage to being in a bad mood: it can help you think more carefully about the world and your place in it.If you cannot shake your bad mood, consider it an opportunity to learn about yourself and about those around you. You might learn something valuable if you pay attention.

, Social media can sometimes make us feel stressed out and disconnected instead of in touch with the world.If you are feeling low, turn off your social media notifications and shut down your laptop. Try to find another way to connect with your friends and family, or try getting out of the house for a few minutes.

, There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to lifting moods. Think about what it is that you love doing, and use that to guide how you will approach getting out of your funk. If you are an introvert, consider doing a quiet activity on your own. If you are an extrovert, consider getting in touch with friends. Do what you love most to help you shake your bad mood., ""Mental nagging"" is when your brain has trouble letting go of all the things you need to do, the mistakes you may have made, or upcoming stressful events you must prepare for. Mental nagging can lead to bad moods. In order to reduce mental nagging, write down your thoughts in a journal. This can help your brain stop worrying about things it cannot control and allow you to focus on the positive things in your life., In order to remember how joyful your life is, maintain a gratitude journal, in which you note everything you are thankful for. Be thankful for small things (such as when someone gives up her seat on the bus for you) or for large things (such as how your parents made you feel cared for when you were younger). Writing down your feelings of gratitude can help you feel empowered, happy with yourself, and happy with the world around you."

Observe positive role models.,
Engage with different people or ideas.,
Find common interests with others.,
Consider different perspectives.,
Go against your instincts, when necessary.",How to Overcome Biases2," Surround yourself with friends who either have very few biased opinions, or consciously work to overcome them. This will help you remain aware of your own biases. It will also give you encouragement to continue to overcoming them. , Whether you are introduced to another culture or simply new sets of ideas, you will be forced to look at things differently. This will expand your knowledge and challenge your opinions of the world around you. Even if your biases are not eliminated, they will certainly be weakened by your experiences.For example, spending time living around people of another culture can encourage you to make friends with some of them. Through these friends, you will learn more about the culture. Your biased opinions will begin to fall away to make room for the new, accurate information you are learning.

, Having common ground and common interest with another person will help to disarm biased opinions about them. Try being on a team or participating in a group with people that you have biased opinions about. If you do this often enough, you can overcome at least some of your biases., When you are looking at evidence that relates to one of your biased opinions, it is natural to see the evidence in whatever way confirms your opinion. For this reason, evidence alone is not enough. You should actively ask yourself, “What if the opposite of what I think is true?” This question will force you to look at an alternative to your biased opinion, and this technique has been shown to reduce biases.For example, if you hold the opinion that humans do not contribute to climate change, then you would start analyzing a different perspective by asking “What would it look like if humans did contribute to climate change?”

, If your biased instincts are telling you to act a certain way, don’t listen. Instead, make an effort to do what you know to be right. This can be difficult at first, but as you get used to pushing your boundaries, you’ll be able to overcome most biases.For example, if you know that you have a cultural or racial prejudice, choose not to use racial slurs when referring to members of that race/culture. Instead, make a point to talk about them in a respectful way.

Commit to overcoming your biases.,
Hold anti-biased thoughts longer than biased ones.,
Make a point to notice small contradictions to your biases.,
Seek professional help when needed.",How to Overcome Biases3," Biased opinions are often formed in the early years of life, and they are difficult to overcome. If you want to beat your biases, you will have to commit to it as a long term goal. Make a list of any biases you identify, and create steps to work against them.For example, if you find that you are biased against a particular culture, try going to a restaurant that serves food from that culture.
Ask yourself why you feel this bias. If you can identify the roots and triggers of your biases, you will understand them and be better equipped to overcome them.

, Your brain is programmed to weigh negative thoughts and emotions more than positive ones. This was a survival mechanism for early humans, though it doesn’t serve us today. So regardless of what kind of bias or negative thoughts you are having, make a point to counter them by holding positive, anti-biased thoughts for a longer period of time.For example, from a survival standpoint, it was more beneficial for our ancestors' brains to remember something dangerous (e.g. a tiger) than something that creates pleasant feelings (e.g. a pretty flower).

, When you assume that something fits in every situation or applies to every member of a group of people, you are inevitably going to see things that contradict that. Instead of ignoring or rationalizing such things, make a note of them. These contradictions help to break down your biased opinions so that your mind can move past them.For example, if you notice a homeless person doing work for food, make a note of the incident. This can help break down any biased thoughts about homeless people being lazy.

, If you know that you have strong biases but can’t move past them, you may need professional help. A good counselor can help you find the root of your biased opinions and give you guidance to move beyond them. They can also help you learn coping mechanisms in the meantime.

Spend 20 minutes in the woods.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Get a good night's rest.,
Exercise vigorously.,
Switch your commute.,
Stay active.",How to Overcome Bad Moods2," Studies show that spending time outdoors, surrounded by nature can be beneficial to your mood. Find a local park, forest, or green space where you can spend at least 20 minutes. Take a walk, read a book on a park bench, or simply sit and enjoy the birds and flowers. You will feel more relaxed and satisfied after your encounter with nature.

, It is easy to get into a bad mood when you are low energy and hungry. If you start to feel down, eat a nutritious snack that will elevate your mood and give you energy. Almonds, yogurt, fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains are good choices to keep you happy and energized.Resist the urge to eat so-called ""comfort foods.""Many of these comfort foods might taste great, but they only provide short bursts of energy and satiation. This means that you are more likely to experience an energy crash later, which might bring your bad mood right back., Staying up late and getting a poor night's rest can increase the likelihood of bad moods. In general people are happier when they go to bed early and maximize the amount of time they are awake when the sun is out.To make sure of that, you should:


Make sure your bedroom stays cool and dark at night
Use a white noise machine to cover up ambient sounds
Avoid naps during the day
Stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and large meals in the afternoon and evening hours
Give yourself time to wind down and relax before bed
Avoid electronic screens right before bedtime

, Raise your heart rate with vigorous aerobic exercise for 20-30 minutes at least three times a week. For example, you can jog, swim, bike, or participate in an aerobics class. You should also make some time to exercise when you begin to feel a bad mood come on. Exercise releases endorphins and serves as an effective distraction from distressing things.This will help elevate your mood in the moment, and regular exercise can reduce the frequency of bad moods.


Be sure to consult with a physician before beginning an exercise regime to make sure you are staying safe and healthy.

, Car commuting daily leads to bad moods and feelings of anger. If you live close to your office, consider walking or biking to work instead. You will feel more energized, healthier, and have fewer bad moods.

, People are more likely to experience a bad mood when their minds are allowed to wander. Resist the urge to laze about every day: keep your mind and your body occupied. Concentrating on any task will help stave off bad moods."

Talk to your physician about sustained bad moods.,
Consider seeing a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist about sustained bad moods.,
Consider hormonal birth control.,
Talk to your doctor about Seasonal Affective Disorder.",How to Overcome Bad Moods3," It is normal and healthy to experience bad moods every now and again. But if your bad mood lasts for more than two weeks or if it is seriously infringing on your ability to function, you should talk to your doctor about it.There is a possibility that you have a physical disorder, such as an abnormal thyroid, which will require medical treatment., Some people experience clinical depression, which is more serious than a typical bad mood. Depression can cause physical as well as mental distress and hurt someone's ability to work, sleep, or function normally. If you cannot shake your feelings of distress, or if you are considering hurting yourself or someone else, you should seek mental health care as soon as possible.Remember that depression is an illness that requires treatment, just like a physical disorder. It is perfectly normal to need the help of antidepressant medication or talk therapy to recover., Some women experience difficult, serious bad moods during the days leading up to their periods. This is known as Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS. If you feel like your PMS is hurting your ability to function in a healthy and happy way, talk with your doctor about whether you might benefit from hormonal birth control. Many women report an improvement in PMS symptoms and in their moods while on hormonal birth control.Note that hormonal birth control can have side effects that are potentially serious. Talk carefully with your doctor about your options.

, If your bad moods take place during the dark winter months, coupled with increased irritability and anxiety and lower energy, it is possible that you are experiencing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is caused by the lack of sunlight and can be effectively treated with light therapy, talk therapy, and antidepressants. Be sure to talk about these options with your doctor."

Give your child her prescribed medication on time.,
Use a cold compress to relieve your child’s pain in the first 48 hours after surgery.,
Use a heated compress 48 hours after the surgery.,
Call your doctor if the pain medication does not seem to be working.,
Give your child antibiotics if your doctor prescribes them.",How to Help Your Child Recover from Tonsillectomy1," It is very important to be sure that your child receives any prescription or over the counter pain medications according to the doctor’s orders. Even if your child does not indicate that she are in pain, the parent needs to be sure that they get their medication on time. The reason for this is the fact that the pain medication is supposed to keep the child comfortable so it needs to be taken before they are feeling pain.


Since the medication takes some time to get into the child’s system, if the parent waits to administer the medication until after the child is feeling some pain, it could become unbearable by the time the medication becomes active.
To be sure that the medication is available when the child needs it, the parent should pick up any prescriptions on the way home or have someone else do it right away. Over the counter medications should also be on hand when the child is brought home so that they do not have to wait to receive a dose.;
, While the medication your doctor prescribes should help to manage most of your child’s pain, laying a cold compress on the area where your child feels the most pain may help to make your child that much more comfortable. The cold temperature slows the blood flow to the area, which can decrease the pain and swelling.To apply a cold compress:


Wrap an ice pack, cold compress, or bag of frozen vegetables in a washcloth or hand towel. You should not lay the cold item directly against your child’s skin, as it could actually burn the skin.
Keep the compress on the area for 20 minutes. Let the skin warm back up for 10 minutes, and then re-apply the compress for another 20 minutes if your child is still feeling pain in the area.
After 48 hours, switch to a warm compress, as described in the next step.

, After 48 hours, you can begin to use a heated compress to make your child more comfortable. At this stage, the painful areas needs oxygen and nutrients in order to heal. Heat can open up the blood vessels in the area, making it easier for oxygen and nutrients to get to the healing area.You can administer heat in a couple of ways.


Let your child soak in a warm bath for 20 to 30 minutes.
Use a warm compress or gel pack that you warm up in the microwave. However, make sure that you wrap the compress in a washcloth so that the heat is not applied directly to your child’s skin.

, If your child complains about unbearable pain for an extended period of time, you should call your doctor. It may be possible to have the dosage adjusted, or to get a stronger medication.

, To ward off infections, your child will most likely be prescribed antibiotics. Make sure that your child takes her medication every day; one missed day of antibiotics could mean that she could become prone to infection.

Identify what you're feeling.,
Pinpoint which situations cause you to get emotional.,
Become aware of your thoughts about the situation.Once you target which person/people or topic is the stimulus, write down your feelings about this person or topic.,
Verify if your thoughts are realistic.,
Develop an adaptive substitute behavior.",How to Not Let Your Emotions Get the Best of You1," Your emotional experience is broken down into three elements: body language and behaviors, visceral reactions, and thoughts. Sometimes, you may clearly feel one emotion, while, at other times, you may experience a spectrum of emotions. Consider some common emotions with their three associated elements to determine how you're feeling right now.Anger may be characterized by clenched fists, flaring nostrils, pounding heartbeat, sweating, and jumping to conclusions with thoughts.

Confusion may include scratching one's head or cheek, blinking rapidly, rising body heat, and racing thoughts.

Disappointment may be exhibited by a heavy sigh, lowering one's head, sudden onset of nausea, a heart that seems to be shrinking, and thoughts of dread or hopelessness.

Fear may be associated with pressing one's elbows into the sides, shaking, hypersensitivity to touch and sound, and mentally having the desire to run or hide.

Jealousy may be characterized criticizing the rival, sneering, burning sensation in the chest, and rash decision-making.

Sadness may include wincing, a trembling chin, soreness in the the throat, the world seeming to slow down, and wanting to be alone.;
, If you are experiencing strong emotions, you need to figure out the stimulus that caused these feelings. This is especially true if you find yourself getting upset often. Think back over the last few hours or days. Consider the people you have talked to and the topics of the conversations you have had.It could be that a certain person caused you to feel strongly, or a specific topic set you off. Possible people/topics that may evoke strong emotions include family, friends, relationships, work, money, criticisms, and broken promises.

, Write out these emotions as ""I am angry because..."" or ""I am disappointed because..."" This exercise can give you some insight into what's driving your emotions. You may not have even been aware of these factors before now.

, Once you have written what's driving your feelings down on paper, you can check these statements for accuracy. For example, if you wrote ""I am disappointed because Dan did not get what me a birthday gift."", you need to consider the variables that surrounded Dan's behavior and your own. Did you explicitly tell Dan that you didn't want a gift this year? Do you generally feel dissatisfied by the previous gifts Dan has brought you? Is Dan going through financial difficulties and couldn't purchase a gift? If you can find at least one shred of evidence that shows Dan's behavior was warranted, then you have proven that your response (i.e. disappointment) was illogical.


If you cannot find a single shred of evidence that can challenge your strong emotion, then you need to look at the situation from a different perspective. Strong emotions are virtually always tied to some irrational belief that we hold deep inside., After you have closely examined your thought patterns and behaviors in your interactions with others, try to devise a plan to demonstrate healthier responses in the future.


Consider the previous scenario about the birthday gift. Once you realized that Dan did not get you anything for your birthday what did you do? You may have acted passive-aggressively by not expressing your feelings, but performing subtle actions such as withdrawing from him, not being affectionate, or ruining any other plans he had for your day.
Think about how you could have responded to minimize your upsetting feelings - and possibly his as well. You could have openly stated that you expected a gift from him and that you were disappointed. This may seem blunt but you are less likely to feel disappointed once you have an understanding of Dan's true motives. What's more, he won't have to tiptoe on eggshells around you wondering why you're behaving a certain way. Your feelings will be clear to him and eliminate any confusion.

Consider a family-wide silence to help keep your child from talking.,
Give your child a bell to ring if she needs something.,
Have your child write down requests if she is old enough.",How to Help Your Child Recover from Tonsillectomy2," In order for your child’s throat to heal, it is usually recommended that she refrain from speaking for a number of days. This can be quite difficult for a child. Sometimes this is easier if the entire household refrains from speaking for the same period of time, at least when in front of your recovering child.

, Because your child needs to rest her throat, you can consider giving your child another way to get your attention. This could be through the use of a:


Bell.
Bicycle horn.
Xylophone.
Whatever item you choose, make sure that it is not very disruptive, as it will no doubt be ringing throughout the house.

, If your child is old enough to be able to write, then consider giving her a pad of paper and a pencil. That way she can write down whatever she may need. If available, you could also give your child an electronic tablet to write down her needs.


If your child can’t write, you can purchase picture cards that she could use to indicate common needs like needing food, water, or a hug.
You could also come up with hand signals to indicate certain needs, like having your child rub her tummy if she is hungry.

Put your toddler in a playpen if she refuses to stay in bed.,
Instruct older children to stay in her bed.,
Purchase activities that your child can do in her bed to keep her from getting stir crazy.,
Limit the number of people who visit your child.,
Alert your child’s teacher(s) to her surgery.",How to Help Your Child Recover from Tonsillectomy3," Once home, your child will need to rest so that she can make a speedy recovery. If your child is a toddler, there is a good chance that she will want to get out of bed and play. If you can’t keep her in bed, set up a playpen so that she remains in a confined space and can’t exert herself too much.


Place some of her toys in the playpen with your child.

, If your child is a little older, it will be easier to explain to your child why she needs to stay in bed. Tell her that while she sits in bed, her body will start to fix itself. When she lies down, make sure that her head is propped up with two or three pillows so that it is higher than her legs; this will help to keep her neck from swelling. You will most likely have to keep your child in bed for about a week.If your child’s neck does begin to swell, put a cold compress on it to bring down the swelling.

, Recuperation time can seem boring to some children, especially those that are usually quite active in their play. Combat this boredom by buying activities that your child can do while she lies in bed. Some activities include:


Reading a new book. You can also read to your child.
Playing on a tablet or handheld device.
Drawing or coloring (you will have to put a hard surface down on your child’s lap so that she can draw).
Watching a movie or favorite TV show.

, When your child is at home recovering, try to limit the number of people who come over to say hi. Your child’s immune system will be a little weak because of the trauma she has just experienced. If a lot of different people come over to say hi, your child’s chances of becoming exposed to a bacteria or virus is more likely.


In addition, having visitors can make your child so excited that she talks or moves around, which could reopen wounds in her throat.

, While your child’s teachers most likely already know that your child is missing school because of surgery, it is important to remind them of this fact when your child goes back to school. For the first couple of days back, your child’s teachers may want to keep an eye on her and make sure that she adjusts to being back at school and does not exert herself too much.

Give your child plenty of liquids.,
Stick to the list of foods your child’s doctor gives you.,
Give your child soft foods about a week after her surgery.,
Be aware that your child’s diet can gradually return to normal over the two week recovery period.,
Keep your child’s medication in mind.",How to Help Your Child Recover from Tonsillectomy4," In order to help your child’s throat heal, it needs to be kept moist. At first, your child may not want to eat or drink anything because it is uncomfortable to do so, but it is important that she at least takes some water.


If she will not drink water, you could ask your child to suck on some ice. Give her small pieces of ice so that she does not have to open her mouth too wide to suck on them.

, Your child’s doctor will most likely give you a list of foods and drinks that you should give your child while she recovers. In particular, you can give your child cold foods, like ice cream, sorbet, or Italian ice. These cold treats actually help to numb your child’s throat, and will most likely make your child a much happier camper.Other foods include clear liquids and brother.
Fruit juice.
Jello and pudding.
Most children tend to avoid acidic or salty foods, like tomato bisque, after surgery because they irritate the throat, but if your child seems to be ok with these items, they are safe to feed her.

, You can begin giving your child soft foods when she feels she is ready. Give her a small amount and see if it causes her any pain; if it does, stick to the foods mentioned in the previous step for a couple more days. Soft foods include:


Regular soups like chicken noodle (however, you can also puree these soups to make them creamy). Serve soups lukewarm, or even room temperature, to make sure that they do not irritate your child’s throat.
Applesauce.
Pudding.

, Your child will most likely take two weeks to return to a normal diet. During this time, and for a couple days after the two weeks are up, avoid giving her any crunchy or rough food, as these types of foods could cause pain.

, It is a good idea to plan meals so that they are served 30 to 60 minutes after your child takes a dose of medication. This will give the medication time to get into your child’s system, so that she feels less pain when she swallows her food.

Know when it's not a good time to have a serious discussion.,
Recognize your interpretations to situations.,
Think about your beliefs about certain emotions.,
Reflect on others' behaviors towards you.",How to Not Let Your Emotions Get the Best of You2," There are a few circumstances when it's best to postpone a discussion until later to avoid our emotions getting out of control. If you are about to talk to someone when tempers are already flaring or extreme emotions are already involved, consider the acronym H.A.L.T. It represents hunger, anger, loneliness, and tiredness.These are times when we are already vulnerable and running low on resources. Remember, in the future, to take a brief pause and care for yourself before trying to resolve any issues.
Eat something regularly, engage in a relaxing activity, reach out to others for social connection or get some much-needed rest. Then, reevaluate the situation when you have more resources at hand.

, Individual interpretations to life situations often stimulate emotions that get out of control. For example, an employer does an end-of-the-year evaluation of all employees. One employee may review his evaluation and say ""Whew! It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. At least, I didn't get fired!"". Another may say ""What is this? I'll never be able to go up for promotion with less than 100%!"" Our interpretations to events trigger our emotions. The first employee probably feels relief, while the second is agitated. Our negative interpretations frequently form as a result of cognitive distortions like:Over-generalization- believing that one event has a major impact on all areas of your life when it doesn't
Dichotomous thinking- also known as ""all or none thinking"", this distortion involves interpreting all events as either black or white without recognizing potential grey areas
Emotional reasoning- basing your interpretations of facts on your current feelings (i.e. you feel ugly, so you must be ugly)
Filtering- focusing narrowly on the negative events in your life while minimizing the positive ones

, Our emotional responses are largely influenced by our cultural backgrounds and families. People learn how to regulate their emotions based on the modeling and imitating the emotions of others in their early environments.For instance, if a little boy was taught not to cry as a young child, he may take heed to such instructions into adulthood. He may have difficulty expressing his feelings to others or channel one emotions into another more socially acceptable one.


Consider what you were taught about exploring and expressing your feelings as a child. These early beliefs are probably playing a major role in how you express your emotions today.
Anger is often referred to as an umbrella emotion because it often covers up other emotions. People from different cultural backgrounds may find it more acceptable to display anger than insecurity or sadness. With this in mind, you should always look deeper beneath the apparent emotion to see if there are deeper feelings you cannot clearly identify.

, If you are having trouble understanding your role in developing strong emotions, pay attention to other's emotional reactions to you. All participants in a discussion play a role in developing strong emotions, although, as we learned above, your emotional response depends on how you interpret a situation.


Sometimes, we are not as aware of our own body language or nonverbal expression as we are of others' body language. Contemplate what behaviors the other person is exhibiting. If the other person is acting defensive (i.e. crossing arms or stomping away), ask yourself what you are projecting that could contribute to such a reaction.

Try deep breathing.,
Engage in mindfulness about your emotions.Practicing mindfulness meditation can be helpful in overcoming strong emotions such as sadness, fear, anger, and even jealousy.,
Exercise.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation.",How to Not Let Your Emotions Get the Best of You3," Deep breathing is the perfect tool to use right in the midst of extreme emotions. As soon as you notice the physical cues (i.e. racing heart, clenched fists, pit in the stomach, etc.) of a strong emotion approaching, you can step aside and practice a few seconds or minutes of deep breathing. This can reorient you and cause you to respond more mindfully within the situation. This can also serve as a relaxation technique to keep you from acting out in a way you would regret.


Start by breathing as you normally would, but pay close attention to each breath. Then, take deeper breaths in through your nose, expanding your stomach as if you are filling a balloon. Place your hands on your belly to notice these movements. Exhale slowly, deflating the balloon that is your stomach. Repeat this technique until intense emotional states subside.

, General mindfulness meditation involves grabbing a cozy seat in an area with minimal distractions. Cross your legs and close your eyes, if that feels comfortable to you. Breathe in and out deeply, noticing your stomach contract and relax with each breath.


After you have done the above for several complete breaths, bring to mind the emotion you are feeling. Perhaps you can recall in your head the situation that evoked this emotion. Continue to take deep, slow breaths. Recognize how your body feels in response to this emotion. Is your chest tight? Stomach cramped? Head aching?
Once you have become aware of the physical sensations you feel with this emotions, just sit with the emotion for awhile. Accept it as a temporary, changing part of you. Continue to breathe as you focus on this feeling of acceptance. If you ever get caught up in the emotion or worry that it is taking over, return to focusing on your breath and your presence in the room.
People often resist strong feelings because they fear the response. By participating in mindfulness about your emotions, you are able to recognize that these emotions alone cannot hurt you. They will eventually fade. You can manage them.

, It may be especially hard to motivate yourself to engage in physical activity when you're experiencing strong emotions, but the benefits are worthwhile. Just as regular exercise provides amazing benefits to your physical health, it can also benefit you mentally. Exercise reduces the levels of the body's stress hormones, and increases the production of endorphins, which elevate your mood and act as natural painkillers.Find an activity that can help you burn off the residual effects of your intense feelings. If you feel angry, you might try running or boxing to relieve this emotion. If you are feeling sad, a light walk or yoga may help.

, If a strong emotional state causes you to feel tense in your body, take a few minutes to try this relaxation technique. Progress muscle relaxation involves gradually contracting and releasing different muscle groups in your body. It functions as a way to relieve stress and make you more aware of tension in your body.


Have a seat with your thighs parallel to the ground and your arms parallel to your upper body. Relax your posture. Close your eyes or try not to focus on any stimuli in the room around you. Take several deep, cleansing breaths. Starting with your feet, move up through your body. Select a muscle group and clench all the muscles (toes, for example). Hold them contracted for a breath, noticing the tension. Then, release them and notice how the tension melts away. Continue doing this with each muscle group.

Move to a warmer place or a sheltered area.,
Elevate the injured area.,
Take off any tight fitting clothes or jewellery.,
Pour water with a temperature of 104–108 °F (40–42 °C) into a water bottle or a hot compress pad.,
Pour warm water into a basin.,
Avoid massaging or rubbing the area.,
Never use dry heat to heal frostbite.,
Avoid touching any blisters on a frostbite injury.,
Wrap the blistered area with gauze or a clean cloth.,
If possible, have a medical professional drain any blisters.,
Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief.,
Consult with your doctor if your blisters do not heal or the skin does not return to normal after three months.,
Ask your doctor about other treatment to help your skin heal.,
Notice if you feel pain, numbness, or needles and pins on the surface of the exposed skin.,
Check for any darkened, red, or gray areas on the exposed skin.The texture of the skin in the affected area may also feel hard and you may develop blisters.,
Be aware of the three levels of frostbite.",How to Heal Skin Damage from Frostbite," Going to a warm place will dilate your blood vessels and increase blood flow to your extremities. This will also prevent any further injury to your skin.


You can also warm up the affected area by wrapping it in a blanket or thick cloth.;
, Say, for example, you have frostbite on your feet. Sit down in a chair and get another chair or any object that is 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) tall and put your feet on it. This will promote blood circulation., Removing these items will help with blood circulation to the frostbitten area and prevent further cell damage. Do not wear any tight or constricting items while you are recovering from your frostbite injury., Wrap the bottle with a towel and apply it to the affected area.Do this for 30 minutes and repeat twice a day.
Always check that the water used during re-heating is warm and not too hot, as it could burn your skin.
If you only have access to heating pads, make sure the heating pads are wrapped in clothing or a towel before applying it to the frostbitten skin to prevent burns.

, If you don’t have a water bottle or hot compress pad, you can pour warm water (104-108 degrees Fahrenheit) into a basin and immerse the injured area in the water for 30-45 minutes.It’s normal to feel severe pain as the tissue begins to warm up, so do not be alarmed about this. You should slowly regain sensation and feeling in the affected area.

, Massaging or rubbing the affected area will create friction that will lead to skin breakthrough. When skin breakthrough occurs, you could develop an infection.

, Do not use dry heat sources like lamps, campfire or a hair dryer to re warm the affected area. Dry heat will burn, rather than heal, your frostbitten skin.As well, you should never apply direct heat to the injury. If you are sitting near a fireplace, do not go too close to it or put the frostbitten area in the fire. Direct heat can cause more damage to the skin.

, It’s important to keep the skin intact when blisters occur, as your skin will serve as protection against an infection.


Blisters usually happen during frostbite and will appear as sacks with a clear or milky fluid.

, For example, if your frostbite injury is on your fingers or toes, wrap each finger or toe individually in gauze.


Use at least two layers of gauze or clothing on the frostbitten area.
Keep your fingers and toes separated by putting 3-4 cotton balls between each finger or toe. This will prevent friction between the digits and any skin breakthrough or infection.

, Draining blisters can help the frostbitten area to heal as it will dry a lot faster. You can drain blisters at home, but ideally, it should be done in a sterile area to reduce the risk of infection.Medical professionals will also have access to medication to deal with any pain that may be experienced when draining the blisters. At a hospital, draining blisters is usually an outpatient procedure which requires only a topical anesthesia.

, Acetaminophen can be taken to decrease swelling and pain in the frostbitten area. It reduces the prostaglandins in the brain that are responsible for inflammation and swelling. It also relieves pain by increasing a person's threshold to pain and reduces fever by acting on the heat-regulating center of the brain.Acetaminophen can be taken as solution/suspension, liquid, tablets, caplets or gelcaps.
The dose for adults is 325 to 650 mg every 4 hours or 500 mg every 8 hours.

, Usually, the affected area will start to turn pinkish and become softer as it starts to heal. Early stages of frostbite may take a few days to a week while more serious cases of frostbites may take up to three months to heal., If you do not see improvements after three months, you may need further treatment such as debridement or skin grafting.


Skin debridement is when the pus or fluid inside the blister is removed to encourage the area to heal.
Skin grafting is when you remove the damaged skin and replace it with a new one from another part of the body.

, When the body is exposed to extreme cold, the body reacts. The blood vessels constrict in our extremities, causing sensations on the skin, and diverts the blood and oxygen to our major organs. If the constriction of blood happens in the body for a long period of time, there is a decrease in blood supply and oxygen, which causes damage to skin tissue., If the affected area turns black, this is a sign of severe frostbite.

, Depending on the duration of exposure and how cold the skin becomes, frostbite can affect the superficial part of the skin, as well as the underlying tissues.The first level of frostbite only affects the epidermis or outermost layer of the skin.
The second level of frostbite affects all the layers of the skin and the fatty tissues.
The third level affects all the layers of the skin, the fatty tissues, and underlying tissues like your muscles.

Maybe you are dealing with a stressful event in your life, relationship, or work, or maybe you just feel drained from the daily grind. Sometimes it can be very helpful to take a timeout. Take a few moments to yourself to honor your feelings and let go of sad, painful, frustrating, or negative emotions.


Some situations —if the negative emotional energy is due to an argument, for instance—make it harder to get up and walk away without being rude. In these situations, always be polite and suggest a time to begin talking again.;
, Look around. See what kind of people influence your thoughts. Whom do you hang out more often? Choose the right friends and accept the right thoughts from them.

, You can practice belly breathing anywhere. Breathe deeply into your belly and notice how your body responds. Notice places in your body that are tense and feel them relax.Try closing your eyes and breathing in slowly through your nose. Continue filling your lungs, fully expanding your chest and lower belly. Finally, breathe out slowly and naturally—your mouth or nose is fine.Let go of all your worries with that long exhalation.
You can also throw in a small affirmation, such as, “Let go.” On your inhales, say to yourself “let,” and on your exhales, say or think to yourself “go.” Try not to think about or analyze the negative energy you are feeling—simply let it go.
Dragon breathing is another type of deep breathing that you may find helpful. Use the same deep breathing technique but picture your negative energy as a cloud of grey smoke that you exhale with every breath. You can also picture yourself inhaling a calming color energy, like a blue mist, with each inhale.

, You can walk anywhere—around your home, your workplace, or just a quick jaunt around the block. Moving your body can help trigger positive emotional feelings and help elevate your mood in general. Think about your feet consciously hitting the ground as you walk and imagine the negative energy flowing through your feet right into the ground.You can also integrate your belly breathing and visualization work into your walk to enhance releasing negativity.

, Laughing is one of the easiest steps you can take to help combat your body’s stress response.Laughter additionally aids in muscle relaxation, and it can help promote mood improvements for those feeling anxious or depressed.Take a few minutes to tell your favorite joke, remember the best prank you’ve ever pulled on a friend, or simply pull up your favorite YouTube video that always makes you laugh.

, Take a hot shower or bath.Light candles in your environment and focus on creating a calm space for yourself. Listen to relaxing music, meditate, or use visualization techniques to completely relax your body.


If you are able, book a massage for yourself.Even if you can’t go immediately get the massage, it will still give you something relaxing to look forward to later, which can help with your negative energy.

, Sometimes it can help to just get the negativity off your chest.Ask a friend if he or she has time to talk and listen. Be respectful and mindful of your friendships, but also remember that helping you deal with negative energy and feelings in your life is part of what friends are for.


Ensure you vent as a release rather than as a way to keep yourself riled up about an issue. Venting in an overly angry or spiteful way can actually reinforce negative feelings rather than help dissipate them. Also remember not to see venting as a problem-solving technique, but simply a way to release steam before taking a calmer, more proactive approach to the source of your negativity., Put on some music that makes you feel like moving and dance. Try to stay out of your head. Instead, let the beat of the music and the movement of your body shake out tension, negativity, and stress. If dancing in private makes you feel more comfortable, find places you can dance without feeling self conscious. Dancing can help your body literally shake off negativity.

, You can do simple stretches at your comfort and ability level. Start with a few belly breaths. Raise your hands above your heads and just stretch from head to toe. You can do this stretch sitting, standing, or even laying down. Imagine the negative energy flowing out through your feet with each breath. Stretching practices such as yoga have been shown to help with releasing negative energy related to stress, anxiety, depression, and more.When attempting stretching or yoga, always listen to your body and never push yourself into doing something that hurts or feels too tight. Go with the flow, feel your body, and allow yourself to release.
For more information on getting started with yoga, check out How to Do Yoga for Absolute Beginners.

, Explore activities that help to give you a break from focusing on the negative energy that is weighing you down. Make a conscious choice to honor that you are feeling weighed down by negative energy, and then acknowledge that you will care for your emotional well being by being kind, positive, and caring toward yourself.


Go see a movie that you have been wanting to see, make plans to see a show you’ve been wanting to see, eat at your favorite restaurant, buy yourself a gift, or make plans with a friend who makes you laugh and lifts your spirits.

, If you are an animal person, using the warmth and innocence of animals or pets may help relieve feelings of negativity overload. Puppies and kittens certainly have a way of lifting moods and allowing room for positive emotions.If you don’t have a pet, maybe you have a friend who has a pet you are fond of, or you could visit the local humane society or animal rescue.
If you don’t really like animals that much in real life, you could watch cute internet videos about baby animals.

, If you have a favorite hobby that’s available to you in the moment, turn to it. Take some time for yourself and indulge in your hobby, even if just for five minutes.

Are you feeling useless because of a certain situation you have no control over? Do you feel useless because you don't feel like you're contributing to society in all the ways that you could? Identifying the cause of the feeling is the first step towards changing your life.


One way to explore your feelings is to write in a journal. Think about these questions as you write, and try to figure out what's bothering you.
Alternatively, try talking over your problems with a trusted friend. Sometimes saying what you're feeling out loud can help you figure out what's wrong.;
, Figure out what you're good at by exploring different hobbies and reading books. Seek out what makes you happy and what you can contribute with those skills so that you're offering something to the world.One way to explore interests is to take community college classes. These classes are relatively cheap, so you can spend a semester deciding if you really are passionate about an interest. Many community colleges offer night and weekend classes if you work full time.
Alternatively, try classes at your local museums if you're interested in art or history.
Another way to explore interests is to pick up a book from the local library. The books are free, and you can take your time learning about your interest.
If you want to meet other people with the same interest, look on social media websites like Meetup and Facebook to find people in you area with the same interest.

, Buy someone a cup of coffee. Bring your loved one her slippers without being asked. Offer a parking place to someone who looks stressed. The little things you do to help people everyday can help you feel needed., Volunteering is not only a solid way to make you feel useful, but you'll also be helping people out along the way. Choose something you love for your volunteerism. If you love books, offer time at the library. If you like working with kids, offer to read to kids at your local YMCA after school., Focus on what's positive in your life. By focusing on what's good about your life, you may be able to overcome feeling useless or worthless. It keys you in to the positive side of things, so you have a happier outlook.One way to focus on what's going well in your life is to keep a gratitude journal. Write down five things everyday that you are grateful for in your life. Some people use social media like Facebook to the same effect--that is, they post five things they are grateful for everyday as a status update. Using social media can help you motivated with this project, as you'll likely receive positive feedback from friends.

, Sometimes feeling useless can stem from low self-esteem. You may feel like you don't have anything to offer the world. However, take some time each day to acknowledge to yourself what you're doing right. You do make a difference to other people, and you should look for that in yourself every day.One way to build yourself up is to use your mirror to your advantage. Every morning, look yourself in the eye, and say something positive about yourself out loud.

, In the same vein as talking to yourself positively, accept positivity from other people, especially when it is about something you do or who you are as a person. You may feel like you don't deserve the compliment, but people are usually sincere when they take the time to compliment you. Think about the contributions you're making that inspired those compliments.

, If you are passionate about preserving our natural resources, go out and do something about it. Organize protests. Write letters. Talk to people. Fighting for what you believe in can help you to feel less useless because you are doing something to help your friends and country.

, Steer clear of potential distractions like the computer, the TV, the phone, the cat, or the fridge. If you procrastinate, you won't accomplish anything. However, if you finish tasks you start, you're sure to feel more useful. Start with something small, like cooking dinner for your spouse, and work up to larger tasks, like cleaning out the garage.

, Improve your self-confidence and value your time and your skills more. You're not going to get a sense of purpose if you're not caring for yourself enough. Don't sell yourself short, and take time out to rest and relax when you need to do so.


One way to value yourself is to say ""no"" to requests that you don't have the time or energy to do. If you divide yourself too thinly, you won't be able to contribute as fully to each task.

, Be active in the way you listen. That is, pay attention to what the other person is saying rather than preparing what you are going to say in your head. Be interested in what the other person has to say and respond in a way that shows you heard., Acknowledge what the people in your life do for you. That acknowledgement shows them that you notice what they do for you and that you appreciate their effort.

, Your presence is one of the best gifts you can provide for the people you love. It tells them you care about them., Instead of laughing at your boyfriend for crying, let him know you appreciate his emotional honesty. Instead of making fun of your friend for dancing silly in the kitchen, join in the fun., Some relationships will never work well no matter what you do. If another person is being emotionally abusive or just doesn't want to make time for you, it may be time to edge away from that person. You may feel useless in a situation like this one because you may feel like you've failed. However, it could be that you are just not compatible with the other person, not that you have failed to contribute to the relationship. Maybe the other person has issues he or she needs to deal with before she is in any kind of relationship, so you shouldn't place the blame on yourself.

, You may not be able to solve the situation--your mother is still going to be sick no matter what you do. However, you can be there for her. You can show up when you're needed. You can offer support and encouragement. It may not be dealing with the problem as you'd liked to do, but you will be doing something, which can help alleviate your feelings of uselessness., You can pray, meditate, or just take a few deep breaths, but whatever way, take a moment to calm yourself down. Accept that you do not have control over the situation.

, Your mother may be sick, but you can take the time you are spending with her to develop a better relationship with her than you've had in the past., Even if it doesn't change anything, it will help others realize that they aren't the only ones who are dealing with these feelings, which is a way you can provide support. It also opens up the discussion, so others have a chance to take about their feelings, as well., Long-term stressful situations can lead to depression, and feeling useless could be a symptom of depression, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms.


Symptoms of depression include having trouble focusing, feeling pessimistic, not being interested in things you usually enjoy, feeling guilty, being extra tired, being consistently sad, and even experiencing physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches.Feeling sad on occasion doesn't mean your depressed. Depression is a sustained period of not caring and feeling sad. When symptoms start to overrun your life, you may be depressed.

, If you are depressed, you may need medication, or you might need to seek out counseling to help you work through some issues, which may help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. Remember, being depressed is not a sign of weakness. It can be caused by a traumatic event in your life, but it could also be a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected. Also, certain medications, your genes, and other problems like illnesses can also lead to depression."

Incorporate a sense of spirituality.",How to Release Negative Emotional Energy2," Make it private so you feel free to write honestly. Every night, make entries about people, places, world events, life events, or anything else that triggered negative energy over the course of your day. Write freely and honestly about why you felt negative., Monitor your journal for emerging patterns to your negativity. This will begin to give you a roadmap of what you are sensitive to, what is causing your distress, and if there are things that are outside of your control over or if you find yourself writing about things that you have the capacity to change.For example, maybe you find yourself writing about how much you hate your job. Use your journal to guide your thoughts about what kinds of changes you could make in your life to reduce the daily negative energy you feel at your job.

, Toxic interpersonal relationships can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions. Discuss with your friends or family, anyone close to you. Question everything you feel about the person you are with. Is he/she the right match for you? Is the relationship causing this pain and anxiety? Try resolving the issue by having a healthy conversation with your partner. Try letting go if it's not something you are not looking for. Also, examine how you interact with the people in your life. Determine if your personal or social life is a source of negative energy. Don’t make the examination about placing blame but simply explore what your relationships bring to your emotional energy. If you identify relationships that seem to bring mostly negativity, ask how you can make changes to those relationships.


Some of the most common signs of a toxic interpersonal relationship include viewing the person primarily with contempt and through a critical lens, taking unnecessary steps to avoid the person, and feeling as though even good times with the person end up hopelessly swallowed by the other negative interactions., Are you taking on negative energy that isn’t yours? Examine the ways that you allow yourself to soak up negative energy, take responsibility for things that aren’t your fault, blame yourself for things you had no control over, engage in negative self-talk, or if you view yourself in a negative light in general.Consider using your journal to create a concrete way to become aware of yourself and your own negative thinking. What are you holding on to? What can’t you forgive? What grudges do you keep alive? What are you angry about? What do you need to focus on letting go?

, Daily meditation may make it easier on a regular basis to release negative energy, as well as creating more self-awareness and creating resilience to negative energy in general.Sitting for ten minutes a day counts as a meditation practice.


Even if you don’t focus on your breathing the whole time, don’t get discouraged. Try to remember that just sitting is the practice. Imagine your thoughts are like cars on a highway, and as you breathe, you are just observing your thoughts race by.

, Start making lists every day of things you did that you were proud of. Use that list as motivation for the next day. You can also explore things you could have done or said differently that would have resulted in less negative energy. Explore your own actions and reactions and begin to feel confident in your ability to make decisions that will allow you to release negative energy.For example, say you experienced road rage that day and felt a lot of negative energy while driving. Did you allow yourself to stay angry or did you practice some belly breathing and help yourself let go?

, Remember that feeling negative emotions is often healthy and natural. Accepting that life is difficult, that things will be challenging, and that problems will arise is a huge step toward building a resilient attitude.It's natural to feel negative feelings from time to time. Instead, maintain perspective on the fact that how you deal with the associated emotions is what matters.Keep in mind that whatever the situation, you are equipped to handle what life throws at you.


For example, if you lost your job, you could reframe your negativity and anger into an underlying awareness that life is about doing, you will find another opportunity, and you will make things work. You never know what life has in store, and sometimes the most difficult things we experience turn out to be for the best.

, Spirituality can help you make sense of tragedy, feel comforted, and help you gain illumination and meaning on your journey.Spirituality can mean whatever it needs to mean to you. Developing a sense of connection to the world in a healthy way that gives you a sense of life outside yourself is really the biggest goal. Explore what resonates with you and what doesn’t. When exploring spiritual avenues, always listen to what feels right for you.


If faith isn’t something you are interested in, Buddhism offers a deeply spiritual way to connect with the world without any belief systems whatsoever.
Some situations —if the negative emotional energy is due to an argument, for instance—It is impossible or hard to get up and walk away. In these situations, be polite, take a long pause, think your words over, and then respond. Mind your tone as well.

You can even massage between your two eyebrows using your index and middle finger when you feel your brows furrowing., You may be frowning and furrowing your brows because you are having issues with your sight. This may be forcing you to squint or frown. If you have been having headaches lately, your vision is blurry, or your sight has changed, consider seeing an eye doctor. They will be able to prescribe glasses, contacts or perhaps even Lasik surgery if necessary., If possible, keep a mirror on your desk at work to monitor your expression and correct it if you see yourself frowning. If you are currently in school and there is a mirror in your classroom, try to situate yourself in sight of it.When you are at home, sit near a mirror as well.
Don’t stare at yourself constantly. Look occasionally to ensure that you are not frowning.
Practice facial expressions in the mirror. Practice smiling and then resting your face. Repeat the process for a few minutes.

, Your family and friends can be particularly helpful in assisting you on your quest to stop frowning. Communicate to them this wish and ask them to tell you when you are frowning. Frowning may have become so natural to you that you do not even realize that you are doing it. Since you can’t see your face unless you are in front of a mirror, as your friends to let you know when your face develops a scowl.You might say to them “Hey, I have noticed that people tell me I frown a lot, but I don’t even notice I’m doing it. Can you tell me when you see me frowning so I can learn to stop doing it?”

, When you are at home, and even while you are sleeping, you can train yourself to stop frowning. Take a piece of clear plastic tape and place it between your eyebrows. This will create a barrier on your skin to prevent you from frowning using your eyebrows. You might be frowning during your sleep as well, so this will begin correcting the issue even when you are not awake.Try not to put the tape on any of your eyebrow hairs so that you don’t cause irritation when you take the tape off.

, Though practicing facial expressions will assist you in your efforts to frown less, sometimes it is necessary to fake it until you make it. Actively encourage and remind yourself to smile throughout your day.Smile when you see someone walking past you.
Smile when someone makes eye contact with you.

, On particularly sunny days, you may be forced to squint to protect your eyes from the harmful rays of the sun, which can cause you to frown. However, consider wearing sunglasses to prevent yourself from furrowing your brow.

, Perhaps a frown is not your natural expression but is instead a symptom of the stress that exists in your life. Throughout your day when you or someone else catches you frowning, assess the stressors that exist in your environment.For instance, perhaps you tend to frown when you see a certain person or are given an assignment in a certain class.
Journal out these stressors to keep track of them and their frequency.

, After determining these stressors, identify which you can get rid of and which you can work to dissipate the effects of. Your frowning can be significantly reduced and perhaps even eradicated completely if you work to get rid of these issues.


For instance, perhaps your significant other texts you throughout your day about all of the issues they are having at work, causing you stress. Perhaps you can ask them to tell you once you are off work or perhaps during your lunch break so that you don’t get distracted.

, During the day, when you catch yourself frowning, take a break from your frustration and write down a list of things you are excited about. You can include items that are simple, like having a nice meal after work, or larger things like going on vacation in a week.This mini journaling exercise will grant you respite from whatever tension exists and allow you to focus on something that is more positive.

, Perhaps one of the best ways to stop frowning so much is to start laughing more! Watch more comedies and throughout your day, you will remember the funny parts and smile more. This is a great way to inject more humour into your life.Google jokes or download a joke app to your phone.
Download or screenshot funny pictures or memes and revisit them throughout your day.
Spend more time with your funny friends.

, If you don’t feel that you have many things to look forward to, or even if you do, begin to make some fun plans for yourself or with friends. Consider things like taking a vacation, going to the beach for the day, or going to see a movie that you’ve been wanting to check out.Ask your friends if they have any suggestions.

, Sometimes, you might be frowning because you have been working too long or too hard on a difficult project. Remember that you cannot work at your optimal level unless you are taking proper care of yourself, which includes giving yourself space from your work at times. If you find yourself frowning often while completing a task, take a five minute break to listen to a song or to take a walk outside.


You can also get a snack to revive your spirits.

, You might find that your frowning is eliciting comments from others. People might say things to you like “Wow, you always look so angry.” These comments, especially if they happen often, can be quite annoying and rude. However, you should be prepared to respond to them respectfully yet directly.You might say something like “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I am perfectly fine. Thank you for asking.”

, Another way to improve your mood and stop your frowning is by giving back to others. Whether it’s a small act like picking up a coffee for a friend or coworker or something larger like volunteering for a day at a soup kitchen, take some time to show kindness to someone. Giving back is bound to put a smile on your face."

Accept setbacks gracefully.,
Avoid pointing the finger.,
Treat your body well.,
Treat your mind well.,
Ask for feedback.,
Observe or learn from others.,
Change your definition of failure.,
Focus on change rather than results.,
Take calculated risks.",How to Regain Your Confidence After Setbacks," It's easy to be a bad sport when you have suffered a minor loss in some area of life. Instead of getting down on yourself, aim to maintain your composure. This is especially important if the setback you are experiencing involves others, such as a romantic partner, boss, or casual acquaintance. If you handle such relationships poorly, your confidence will only be lessened. However, if you handle such relationships gracefully and with finesse, you can demonstrate to yourself that you are capable and strong-willed.Let's say you were passed over for a promotion and a coworker was chosen for the position. Rather than being a sore loser, approach the person who received the promotion and congratulate him or her. Doing so allows you to portray yourself as respectable and dignified. It is also good practice for winning — because ruminating about a loss is just as unfavorable as bragging about a success.
Even if you don't approach the ""winner"" (or, if such a scenario does not fit your circumstances), try your best not to spend too much time outwardly or inwardly dwelling on the setback. Accept your disappointment and regroup.;
, Blame is another sign of poor coping and inability to accept responsibility. If things didn't go your way, it's hardly appropriate to lay fault on others. Blaming someone else - even if this person(s) is partly responsible — only hurts you.For one thing, assigning blame diminishes your own role in the situation. It enables you to point the finger at someone else without taking responsibility for your own mistakes or misjudgments. Secondly, blame provides you with ammunition to be disrespectful or mean towards another.
Don't allow blame game to taint your heart. Acknowledge that all humans make mistakes (even you) and strive to learn from yours.
When you accept responsibility, you can move quickly past feelings of resentment and on to finding a solution or a plan B.

, When humans feel down about themselves or specific life situations, they tend to neglect health and wellness, and confidence (and mood) takes a further hit. Prevent further setbacks by being gentle and kind to your body. Despite your current situation, make a commitment to eat balanced meals rich in vitamins and nutrients, exercise regularly, and sleep seven to nine hours each night., Eating right, staying active, and sleeping will help to lift your mood and your self-confidence. Practicing additional relaxing strategies such as progressive muscle relaxation or meditation may help to clear your head up for strategizing on how to bounce back after this setback. Do whatever helps to ease your mind and bring you back to a place of calm and peace. Go running. Play with your dog. Read that novel that's been lying on your desk for weeks.


To practice progressive muscle relaxation, sit comfortably in a chair with your thighs parallel to the floor and your hands at your side. Take several deep, cleansing breaths, pulling air in through your nose and out through your mouth. Start with the muscles in your face. Contract these muscles and hold for five seconds. Notice how it feels when the muscles are contracted. Now, release the muscles and notice how that feels. Continue taking deep breaths and move through each muscle group in your body.
There are various forms of meditation, but compassion meditation may be most helpful in this situation.Find a comfortable position and take a few deep breath, closing your eyes. Try to focus on your breathing, and then begin to notice if you're carrying tension anywhere in your body, or if you're holding onto stress or worry. Offer yourself kind and compassionate words, such as ""May I be kind to myself,"" and ""May I accept myself as I am."" If your mind begins to wander or you feel overwhelmed, focus again on your breathing., Right now you feel upset, disappointed, or uninspired. This may feel like a bad time to reach out for help, especially when your confidence is already low. In truth, asking for assistance after running into a stumbling block is the most opportune time. Approach your boss, a more experienced coworker, a mentor, or a spiritual advisor. You can get feedback from anyone, but it will be most helpful to speak with someone who intimately understands your situation.Introduce (or explain) your circumstances and ask this person to be candid with you. Your question might sound like, ""Why do you think this happened?"" or ""What do you think I need to do to prevent this from happening again?""
Do not allow your current state of vulnerability to limit you from getting practical advice. Listen to the person's response and ask qualifying questions to better understand. Refrain from judging or defending (remember, you came to this person for help). Take notes so that you can later reflect on these responses and decide how to proceed.

, Watching, or reading about, how others perform in similar situations can be a learning and growing experience for you. Closely observe others who have either overcome the same obstacle or have completely bypassed it. Pay attention to how they carry themselves, interact with others, and manage through such a setback. It can also be helpful to read autobiographies or self-help book that relate to what you are going through.Hearing or reading about others' experiences can help you rebuild your confidence by recognizing that everyone encounters setbacks. This stumbling block was not exclusive to you — everyone has to get back up and dust themselves off at some point.

, One quote wisely proclaims that ""Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat..."" Do you agree? Or, have you been lumping failure in the same category as the plague? Work to redefine what it means to fail, and you will instantly feel a boost in your self-confidence. Try these strategies to help you:Practice positive thinking. Rather than seeing a setback as a failure, strive to view it as a stepping stone to success. When you find yourself entertaining negative thoughts, challenge them. For example, you think ""My business will never be successful."" Look for ways that you have found success — no matter how small — and attack this thought. A more positive thought would sound like, ""I have built a small client list, and I have great products. I have everything in order. I just need to keep at it.""
Remove the negative contractions from your vocabulary. Challenge yourself to change the way you speak. Toss out words like ""can't,"" ""won't,"" or ""shouldn't."" Doing this alone will force you to speak more positively.
Remind yourself of your strengths and think back to a time when your strengths led you to success. Remember that you hold the tools already, and you just need to try again.

, People often set themselves up for disappointment because they narrow their focus to the outcome only. Decide for a day or a week that the outcome doesn't matter. Just tell yourself that the only thing that matters is what you do today or this week. Remember, it's the journey, not the destination.A good example of shifting your focus can be found in a weight loss program. If you only pay attention to the numbers on the scale, you may be pleased some days and disappointed on others. On the other hand, when you take note of other variables of change, like the way your jeans fit or how much energy you have, you can see how you have made progress.

, After a setback it can be nerve-wracking to jump back in the saddle. You must. Take baby steps to gradually rebuild your confidence. Taking smaller, more calculated risks can help you to regain a sense of self-efficacy without risking everything.Analyze all the variables of a given situation and weigh the pros and cons. Consider what you can afford to lose. If the pros outweigh the cons, and you have much to gain, go for it. Getting back out there — in a smart and calculated way — can work wonders for your confidence level.

Spend time with people who love you.,
Make a new friend or enter a romantic relationship.,
Adopt an animal companion.,
Be kind to others.",How to Stop Feeling Empty1," This may be your family or it may be a group of trusted friends. Spending time with people who really know you and love you for who you are is a remedy for emptiness. Focus on building and strengthening your relationships with these people. You can find meaning in the simple act of spending time with a loved one who takes pleasure in your company. Spending time with friends and family can also help reduce stress and give you a deeper sense of belonging.Reduce the time that you spend with people who are harmful to you, even if they don’t mean to be. If you must spend time around someone who is hurting your self-esteem or making you feel powerless, make sure your meetings always have a time cap.;
, The pleasure of meeting someone you connect with and letting the relationship grow in unexpected ways is a terrific antidote to feelings of emptiness. A new friend or love interest can help you have rich new experiences and show you that you're an interesting, lovable person. Suddenly the world can seem like it has a lot more to offer than you previously thought. Making friends can also help you to have a deeper sense of purpose and belonging.Sometimes it's difficult to make new friends and meet people, especially in later years when you're no longer in school. Joining clubs, taking classes, or spending time in a favorite hangout are good ways to meet people.
Practice being more generous with your time and saying ""yes"" when you're invited to do something. If you feel you never have enough time to give new relationships, they won't grow.

, Research has shown that having a pet can make life feel fuller and more meaningful.People who own pets are also less likely to suffer from depression and may experience health benefits from owning a pet as well.Having a companion animal that depends on you for care can also help make your life seem more meaningful. Consider adopting a cat or dog from a local shelter to reduce your feelings of emptiness.

, Performing random acts of kindness can help you feel more fulfilled by refocusing your attention on other people. Look for small ways that you can demonstrate kindness to others. The kind acts that you perform will make other people feel good, which may help you to feel more fulfilled.


For example, you could offer a compliment to a stranger such as, “I love your dress! It is so beautiful.” Look for ways to show kindness in whatever situation you are in. Even something as simple as smiling and nodding at people throughout the day might help to brighten someone’s day and help you to feel more fulfilled."

, When you're scared and not thinking properly, you tend to start hyperventilating, which increases your fears. Take deep full breaths and relax your body. Start with your shoulders and, as you breathe, work your way down to your feet relaxing each muscle.Not only will your breathing calm you and make sure you are getting enough oxygen, focusing on your breathing and relaxing your body makes it so you can't focus on what is scaring you.
Being scared means that our hypothalamus (which governs flight or fight) activates our sympathetic nervous system and we tense up. It also has the adrenal-cortical system dump a bunch of hormones into our system, so even if we're scared about going to a party and meeting a bunch of new people, our hypothalamus interprets this as a fight or flight situation.
So breathe and you'll calm the hypothalamus.

, In the moment, while you're busy being scared, get out a pen and a piece of paper and write down everything you're scared of. This exercise helps you draw your fears out into consciousness. You acknowledge them and it makes it easier to let them go.Many of the seemingly scary things go back to a primal fear like being scared of death (the potentially cancerous mole), being scared that no one will like you (going to the party and meeting new people).
Acknowledging them won't make them magically vanish, but it will help you to better articulate your fears

, If you're having a scary moment, call someone up and talk to them. Make sure it is a trusted friend or family member. You can even call a hotline for people with anxiety.


Talking to someone can help simply through making a connection, but your friend can also help put your fears to rest.

, Fear is a learned behavior. No body starts off like being scared of things. We are conditioned through experience and governed by the amygdala in the brain. Anxiety (which is tied to and triggers fear responses) causes the nervous system to flare up, which triggers the fear response.Certain pathways in the brain are created by events that trigger fear in us. Following those pathways means that we get stuck in certain patterns of thinking and behavior.
What this means, of course, is that fear can be unlearned. You have to recondition your brain to either avoid being triggered by certain things, or to react differently to the things that scare you.

, Being scared is about what pathways are being used and created in the brain. To stop being scared you have to basically rewire your brain. It's not as hard as it sounds thanks to neuroplasticity.Neuroplasticity is involved in processing memories and how we learn. By practicing ""desensitization"" a person can change the pathways in their brain that react fearfully to the things that scare them. ""Desensitization"" is basically just being exposed to the thing that scares a person in gradual and controlled environments.
Chart your emotional reaction to physical stimuli and surroundings that cause you to be scared. For instance, if spiders scare you, the physical stimulus is the appearance of the spider. From there the emotional reaction is fear, being scared and this can get heightened all the way to panic levels, depending on your response. Charting this will help you cultivate a detached reaction instead of an emotional reaction to the appearance of a spider.

, A detached reaction means that you react to the things that scare you from a place of observation rather than emotional reaction. This is something you have to practice and it helps to have mapped out your thought patterns so you understand how scary things make you emotionally react.


Recognize that you're being confronted with something you find scary and that you can either have an emotional reaction (which will in turn trigger more and more fear and anxiety) or you can have a detached reaction.
Coach yourself with mantras. Pick a couple mantras and write them down so that you have them with you at all times. Repeat them to yourself when you start having an emotional reaction, so you can short-circuit the reaction. For instance, ""this isn't as bad as I am making it,"" or ""I can't control the outcome, so I'm going to let go and trust that it will be okay.""
Do something physically comforting. If you can, drink a cup of tea and focus your whole being on that cup of tea--its warmth, the steam rising from the cup, the smell. Focusing on the physically comforting thing is a form of mindfulness and means that you are living in the moment, which is a place antithetical to fear.

, Avoiding the things that scare you increase the fear of the scary thing itself and also stops your body from getting accustomed to the thing that scares you, so that the fear can lessen.Start small when you're working up to dealing with the things that scare you. For instance, if you're afraid of spiders, start by dealing with small ones in your home and work your way up to bigger spiders.
If you're afraid of heights, try taking walks in high places that are equipped with safety measures instead of trying right away to make yourself go parachuting.
Remember: the more you avoid something, the more it will scare you and the more the fear itself will paralyze you. We can't avoid being scared, as humans it's part of our physiological make-up, but we can work on how we react to things that cared us. Nothing is as scary as what we imagine it to be.

, Sometimes you can't stop being scared by yourself. This usually is a form of panic disorder, anxiety disorder, PTSD, OCD behaviors. Seeking professional help is a good way to work towards dealing with your anxiety and fears.


Medication can also help, but make sure that you're taking medication as part of an entire program to help overcome your fears. You will need to have counseling as part of that, to retrain your brain.

Talk to a trusted friend about how you're feeling.,
Start a journal to track your thoughts and feelings.,
Look for symptoms of depression.,
Consider whether you have experienced a loss.,
Determine whether addiction may be a concern.,
Examine your behavior to see whether you may have borderline personality disorder (BPD).,
Meditate to explore your feelings of emptiness.,
Seek help from a licensed mental health professional.",How to Stop Feeling Empty2," Keeping your feelings bottled up can be damaging over time. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can make them go away or decrease. Talk to someone who cares and understands you, or at least, whom you trust; it can make a big difference.

, Journaling can help you to understand your feelings of emptiness better and it is also a great way to relieve stress.To get started with journaling, choose a comfortable place and plan to devote about 20 minutes per day to writing. You can start by writing about how you are feeling or what you are thinking, or you can use a prompt. Some prompts you might use include:When did you first notice your emptiness? How long has it been there? How old is your emptiness?
What emotions do you experience when you are feeling empty?
Are you prone to feeling empty during certain times or in certain places? What do you notice about your environment when you are feeling most empty?
What kind of thoughts do you have when you are feeling empty?

, Depression manifests differently in different people, but low mood and feelings of emptiness or worthlessness are very common symptoms.Depression can come in waves, where you feel okay for a while and then very low for weeks or even months, or it can be more of a steady feeling. Depression is also very common; about 6.7% of US adults experience major depressive disorder. Women are 70% more likely to have depression than men.If you think you may be experiencing depression, you are not alone. Seek treatment from your physician or a mental health professional if you experience any of the following symptoms of depression:Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or “emptiness”
Feeling hopeless or pessimistic
Feeling guilty, worthless, or helpless
Unusual irritability or restlessness
Changes in your mood or behavior
Loss of interest in things you used to enjoy
Fatigue
Changes to sleep habits
Changes to your weight
Thoughts of harm to yourself or others
Aches and pains that do not appear to get better with treatment

, Bereavement is another common cause for feeling empty. While the deep feeling of grief is most common after the death of a loved one, it can be a response to any loss, including the loss of a pet, loss of your job, experiencing your children moving out, loss of your health, or any other significant life change.Feelings of loss and grief can produce a variety of other emotions, including sadness and emptiness, and they can also affect other areas of your life, such as appetite, concentration, and habits.If you have experienced a loss or change that may be causing feelings of grief and emptiness, consider sharing your feelings with someone you trust, such as a friend or loved one.You may also benefit from seeing a counselor who is trained in handling bereavement.While many people believe there are “five stages” of grief, this is actually a misconception. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s “five stages” -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance -- refer to her work on death and dying in 1969. However, Kübler-Ross used these stages to describe a person’s feelings regarding his or her own death; they are not a scientific framework for all grief.You may experience all, some, or none of these stages, and that is okay -- your grief is uniquely your own, and each person mourns differently., Use of certain substances is another common cause of emptiness. Substances such as alcohol, illegal drugs, and misused prescription drugs can cause physical dependence on them. This can have a serious effect on your mood, thoughts, and behavior.Often, people fall into using these substances because they feel like there is a “hole” in their lives that the substance can fill.If you think you may have a trouble with substance use, you are not alone: in 2012, about 7.2% of the US population was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).Many others suffer from Substance Use Disorder, which involves other substances, such as marijuana, stimulants like cocaine or meth, hallucinogens like LSD, and opoids like heroin..If you are worried that you may have a problem, ask yourself the following questions. In the last year, have you:


been in a situation where you ended up using more of the substance than you intended to?
tried unsuccessfully to cut down on using the substance?
spent a lot of time using or trying to obtain the substance?
experienced cravings to use the substance?
had to use much more of the substance to get the same effect as when you first started using it?
experienced withdrawal symptoms such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, clammy skin, irritability, depression, anxiety, nausea, or sweating?
experienced the substance interfering in your daily life or responsibilities?
continued to use the substance even if it was causing trouble for family or friends?
stopped participating in things you used to enjoy in order to use the substance?
used the substance in dangerous situations, such as driving or operating machinery?
Addiction has a strong hereditary component. For example, relatives of people who have alcohol abuse problems are more likely to experience addiction issues themselves, independent of whether they even knew each other.If you are struggling with a dependence on drugs and/or alcohol, talk to your therapist about this problem. You may need to be treated for addiction in order to stop feeling empty., People who suffer from BPD often report feelings of emptiness. People with a personality disorder experience persistent patterns of unstable feelings and behavior that cause distress or social impairment. People with BPD have trouble regulating their thoughts and feelings. They are prone to reckless behavior and have poor impulse control. Their relationships with others tend to be unstable.About 1.6% of US adults have a diagnosis of BPD in any given year.BPD can be treated effectively with professional guidance.If you experience any or several of the following signs of BPD, consult with a mental health professional:


You make extreme efforts to avoid abandonment, which may be real or imagined. You often believe that you will be abandoned or separated from a loved one. You react negatively, such as becoming extremely angry or fearful, even when the separation is temporary (such as your spouse going to work). You are very afraid of being alone.
You alternate between idealizing and demonizing people you have been in relationships with. People with BPD often begin relationships by putting the other person on a pedestal, seeing them as perfect or ideal. After some time, you begin to think the other person does not care enough about you or contribute enough the relationship. Your relationships are commonly unstable.
You have an unstable sense of your own identity. People with BPD struggle with maintaining a stable sense of themselves, their identity, and their self-image.
You are very reckless or impulsive. This is especially true of self-harming. You may do reckless things such as drunk driving, gambling, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior.
You frequently consider self-harming and make suicidal threats. You may harm yourself through things such as cutting, scratching, or burning. Or you may threaten to hurt yourself to gain attention from others.
You often experience extreme mood swings. These moods shift frequently and are often very intense, such as moving from joy to despair.
You experience chronic feelings of emptiness. You may often feel empty or bored, or like you need something to do.
You have trouble controlling your anger. Many things are likely to provoke your anger, and you respond with outbursts that may include bitterness, sarcasm, or verbal outbursts. You are particularly likely to be angry if you believe someone is uncaring toward you.
You sometimes feel paranoid about others, or don’t feel as though your environment is “real.”

, Meditation can also help you to get in touch with your feelings of emptiness and begin to understand them better. Research has shown that 30 minutes of meditation per day can help change behavior and brain function.To get started with meditation, sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Use the following questions to help you develop your understanding about your emptiness through your meditation.


Notice how you are feeling in the moment. Do you feel any sense of emptiness or lack, such as a lack of worthiness, clarity, understanding, or a lack of peace or love? Accept that you have emptiness in the moment.
Notice how you experience emptiness. Where do you feel the emptiness in your body? How much space does it take up?
Consider your emptiness. Does it bring up memories from the past? What emotions are present as you notice your emptiness?

, Talking to a therapist about how you have been feeling can help you to understand and work through your feelings of emptiness. Your feelings of emptiness may indicate that you are depressed or that you might have another underlying condition. Particularly if you show signs of depression, substance use problems, or BPD, you should seek help from a mental health professional.


Treatment for depression is often two-pronged, using psychotherapy and, if necessary, prescription medication such as SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro) or SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are both effective at treating depression. CBT teaches you how to identify and reduce unhelpful patterns of negative thinking and learn ways to think productively and helpfully. IPT focuses on helping you work through relationships that may be causing you problems.Several types of psychotherapy are helpful to work through grief, although complicated grief treatment (CGT) appears to work best for people who have struggled with grief for a long time.Treatment for alcohol and substance use disorders often focuses on individual and group counseling but may also include medication if necessary. CBT is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder.Treatment for BPD is psychotherapy using Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). DBT focuses on learning to identify and regulate your emotions, tolerate stress, apply mindfulness, and interact with others in a healthy, productive way.You will learn ways to cope with your emotions, as well as social skills to help you interact with others.

Practice mindfulness.,
Do something new.,
Pursue goals and interests that matter to you.,
Look for meaning in the everyday.,
Take good care of yourself.",How to Stop Feeling Empty3," Mindfulness involves being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and experiences in the present moment without judgment.Research has shown significant benefits to mindfulness, including the reduction of stress and anxiety problems.Mindfulness can even rewire your brain’s responses to stressors and help you feel more connected to others.Learning to be more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and learning to acknowledge them without judging them or yourself, can help you feel more peaceful, empathetic, and satisfied. You can practice mindfulness at home, through meditation, or by taking a course. Here is an exercise to get you started:Look at, name and touch 5 different objects, noticing each object’s color, texture, temperature, and weight.
Look at, taste and smell foods during dinner or pleasant floral scents during a walk, noticing their colours, texture, taste and aroma.
Close your eyes and listen for different sounds. Notice their tempo, strength, and volume.
Mindfulness meditation has also been shown to be very helpful. The Mindful Awareness Research Center at UCLA has several online guided meditations in MP3 form., If you're feeling empty every day, you're probably stuck in some type of rut. What routines and patterns might be getting you down? Find a way to inject some new energy into your life. Changing your routine or even finding 30 minutes per day to try something new can help fill the emptiness.For example, if getting up and going to school or work every day is what's getting you down, figure out a way to make the situation more interesting. Start a new extracurricular activity to help yourself get excited to go to school, or volunteer to work on a new project at work.
Try doing something slightly outside your comfort zone. Making improvements in a new area will give you something interesting to think about and help you build up your confidence.
Even small changes can end up making a big difference. Try out a dish from a cuisine that's new to you, bike to work instead of driving, or start doing yoga in the morning before school.
Changing your personal environment can also help. Replace drab curtains in your bedroom with something brighter, paint the walls a new color, get rid of clutter, and introduce some interesting artwork.

, In order to feel fulfilled, you should work towards goals and interests that matter to you. Don’t let others control the goals or interests that you choose to pursue. If you are not pursuing goals and interests that matter to you, you may need to readjust your pursuits to make sure you're on a track that you feel good about.If you're in school, consider whether you are studying what you want to study, or what your parents want you to study.
Other outside pressures can also have a negative effect on the decisions we make. Decide if you are doing what you really want to do, or if you are doing something that will look impressive to others.
If you determine that there are forces or people preventing your life from being self-directed, take steps to change your situation. Once you have more control over things, you might see the feeling of emptiness subside.

, When life feels like drudgery, it can help to take time to find beauty and meaning in small, everyday things. What makes you feel alive and joyful? When you find something that seems to give you a boost, make it a consistent part of your life. Here are a few ideas for making the mundane feel more meaningful:


Practice gratitude. Taking a few moments each day to think about what you are grateful for and why can help make your life feel more meaningful.You can speak or even write down your gratitude to reinforce it. For example, you might say or write, “I am so thankful the sun is out today; it’s beautiful!” or “I am so thankful for my caring family; they make me feel so special.”
Don't deny yourself your favorite foods. If you love chocolate, have some! You don't have to go overboard, but give yourself permission to enjoy a little every day.
Go outside and breathe fresh air. Research has shown that spending time outside makes people feel more alive and energetic.Spend some time outside every single day, rain or shine. Focus on breathing in fresh air and noticing the natural world in a deeper way.
Take time to make your world richer and more pleasant. Turn seemingly trivial tasks into positive rituals. Sit down and read the newspaper while you're drinking your morning coffee or tea instead of dashing out the door. Take a long, hot bath on the weekend instead of a shower.
Keep your home environment pleasant. Fold your laundry neatly before putting it away. Wash the dinner dishes before you go to bed. Make your bed in the morning. Air your home out by opening the windows and letting some light and wind inside. Don't neglect to do spring cleaning. Maybe you feel you don't have time for all this, or that it doesn't matter, but when your home feels fresh and clean, the mundane parts of life are easier to bear.

, Exercise, healthy food, rest, and relaxation are all important components of a meaningful life. By taking good care of yourself, you are sending your mind signals that you deserve to be taken care of and that your life has value. Make sure that you are devoting enough time to meeting your basic needs for exercise, food, sleep, and relaxation.Aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day.
Eat a balanced diet of healthy whole foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
Get 8 hours of sleep per night.
Set aside at least 15 minutes per day to practice yoga, do deep breathing exercises, or meditate.

Recognize that everyone has challenges to overcome.,
Practice gratitude.,
Compliment people.,
Draw inspiration from envy.,
Adopt a non-judgmental attitude toward yourself.,
Avoid comparing yourself to celebrities.,
Find other ways to live a meaningful life.,
Discover your type of envy.,
Dig into your envy.,
Work on the issue.,
Think about how destructive envy can be.,
Remember a time when you were envied.",How to Stop Envying Famous People," Although celebrities may seem to have lots of great things going for them, it is likely that there are some serious struggles that you do not hear about in magazines or TV interviews. Try to look at the big picture and acknowledge that you are only getting part of the story about a celebrity’s life from media depictions. Looking at the big picture may help to tame some of your envy.As a celebrity, one might have the privilege of money, awesome clothes, and attention, but celebrities also have to worry about things that you don’t. For example, celebrities have to worry about protecting their assets, being stalked by paparazzi, and keeping up appearances.
Celebrities also probably deal with some of the same things that you do, such as depression, loneliness, and insecurity. Try to remind yourself that no matter how wealthy or famous someone is, he or she is still human and still has human problems.;
, Instead of constantly comparing yourself to a celebrity you idolize, try to cultivate gratitude for what you have in your life. Making a gratitude list every day or once a week is a good practice. You can start small, such as by listing basic necessities that you are grateful for, and then add more specific things to the list as time goes by. Some things that might show up on the list include:Your loved ones and friends.
A roof over your head.
Food to eat.
A beautiful sunset.
Some spare time to enjoy a hobby.

, Complimenting others can also help to reduce your feelings of envy.If you envy celebrities who receive a lot of positive attention from the people around them, try spreading positivity to the people around you. Small compliments to your friends and family can mean a world of difference, both to them and to yourself. They will appreciate your positivity and you can pat yourself on the back for taking small steps to make the world around you a better place.


For example, you can pay a compliment to your mom on her excellent cooking, tell your best friend that her hair looks beautiful, or congratulate a classmate or coworker on an awesome presentation.
Since many celebrities are on social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, you might even consider paying a compliment to a celebrity who you envy. For example, if you are feeling a little envious because of the beautiful dress a celebrity wore on the red carpet, try complimenting her on how beautiful she looked. As you do so, remind yourself that this celebrity is a person with emotions just like yours and she will probably really appreciate your compliment.

, The celebrities you envy probably have a lot of strengths. You can focus on these aspects of their personality and life to inspire your own. For example, if there's a singer whose fashion you admire, use that as motivation to find your own sense of style. Or, if you are feeling envious because an actress transformed her body for a role in an action film, then start your own action star fitness program.Just keep it reasonable. There's nothing wrong with looking up to people. We all need role models. Looking up to people is an old practice that comes from looking up to people in your tribe with good survival skills, like talented hunters.A little bit can be healthy and inspiring, just avoid letting yourself go overboard. Admiration for celebrities, rather than envy, can be healthy to have.

, Often, envy shows up because we feel like we aren't good enough. Somebody else is better than us or has something we want. Learning to accept yourself and stop judging yourself for who you are will have a big impact on the envy that you feel toward celebrities. Non-judgment is different from self-esteem. Non-judgment is about accepting yourself for who you are.You didn't always have control over your past, but you can accept how it's shaped you and take responsibility for your life now.
If this is really difficult for you, consider going to a therapist, who can help you with learning to accept and love yourself.

, We live in a culture that encourages us to look up to celebrities and compare ourselves with them, but this is not healthy.Many magazines depict celebrities in such a way that achieving the same physical appearance would be almost impossible and possibly even dangerous to attempt.


For example, models for fashion magazines are often underweight, which is unhealthy. However, these models are depicted as glamorous and beautiful.
It is also important to remember that most images in magazines are altered to make the models and celebrities look thinner and more beautiful.Using computer programs, someone can transform an average photo of a celebrity into one with flawless skin, a perfect hourglass figure, and striking blue eyes.

, We may love celebrities so much because of the legacies they build. Good actors and musicians will be remembered for their talents and works long after they die. It makes sense to envy what these people have done, but you should focus on yourself and try to find your own path to happiness and creativity.If you have a passion such as playing guitar or designing clothes, focus on developing your skills rather than comparing yourself to others.

, Celebrity worship is a common experience for a lot of people. What do you envy about the celebrity? Once you know what it is that you envy, you will be better equipped to address it.Think about these examples:


Body image. Do they have a ""perfect"" body that you wish you had?
Lifestyle. Do you envy their extravagant lifestyle?
Money. Do you envy the amount of money they have?
Fame. Do you wish you were as famous as they are?

, Envy can actually show you a lot about yourself. It's a window into what you want in life and maybe even what you're afraid of. Reflecting on your envy can give you insight and self-knowledge.Ask yourself what the envy is trying to tell you, if it could tell you something. Is the envy related to something in yourself that you want to develop?Of course, you may want to have a therapist or a good friend on hand to help you work through these things, rather than tackling them on your own.

, Choosing a goal related to your envy can be a healthy way to deal with it and improve something about yourself in the process. Try to dig into the root of the problem and work towards a goal.For example, if it's a particular kind of celebrity body you envy, look into improving your body image through therapy or a support group for people with body image issues. If it's money, ask yourself how much money would make you happy and why.

, Is comparing yourself to celebrities harming your life? Is it making you feel inadequate or miserable? Try making a list of ways that your life would be better without all this toxic envying.Would you feel better about yourself if you stopped feeling so much envy?
Would you have more time for friends and fun activities without envy running your life?

, It can be helpful to consider the other side of the coin. Being envied is not always a fun position, because it can generate a lot of negativity towards you. The person who envies you may either idealize or demonize things about you, failing to see you for who you actually are.Remembering how it feels to be envied can help you further realize the destructive nature of what you're doing.

Identify your values.,
Determine which qualities match up with your values.,
Think about activities that would allow you to embrace your values.",How to Stop Feeling Empty4," Reminding yourself of what you value in life and what you value about yourself can help you feel fulfilled rather than empty. Our values, or core beliefs about life, are usually based on our experiences throughout our lives, but we may not always take time to consciously examine them. In order to seek out your values, you will need to spend some time in reflection. Identify your values by writing your answers to the following questions:


Identify the two people you most admire. Which of their qualities make you admire them and why?
If your house was on fire, and you could only save 3 things, which would you choose and why?
What topics or events get you fired up? What about these topics are important to you? Why?
Identify a moment when you felt fulfilled and content. What about that moment made you feel fulfilled? Why?

, After you have finished answering these questions, try to figure out what qualities correspond with your values. In other words, read your answers and decide what qualities best match up with your values.


For example, if you chose to bring a favorite book, a family heirloom, and gift from your best friend, you might say that this means you value intelligence, loyalty, and friendship. Therefore, a few of your qualities might be that you are intelligent, loyal, and a good friend.

, Once you have determined what you value most and what your qualities are, you can begin to determine what activities would make you feel fulfilled. Make a list of these activities and choose at least one of them to add into your life.


For example, if you have “Community” as a value, you could volunteer for your neighborhood watch, serve as a tutor at your school, or work at a soup kitchen. If you have “Faith” as a value, you could look for ways to incorporate your faith into more areas of your life, such as going on a mission trip or visiting your church, temple, mosque, or other place of worship more regularly.
By living a “value-congruent” life (meaning the choices you make and your life path align with your values), you are more likely to feel fulfilled and happy."

Overcome pessimism.One of the reasons you may be paranoid is that you tend to assume the worst in any situation instead of being realistic about possible outcomes.,
Stop obsessing over every little thing.,
Confide in a close friend.,
Stay busy.Another way to avoid being paranoid is to not give yourself a lot of time to wallow or sit around thinking about what everyone else is thinking about you.,
Put yourself in someone else's shoes.,
See if your paranoia is rooted in anxiety.,
Seek professional help if it's necessary.,
Stop caring what other people think.If you want to be able to socialize without constantly worrying about how others perceive you, then you have to slowly learn to stop caring about what people think.,
Put yourself out there.,
Take note of all the kindness around you.,
Learn to accept criticism.,
Accept that there are mean people in the world.,
Confront your partner if you think he or she is cheating on you.,
Question whether your friends are really talking about you.,
Combat paranoia on the job.A common paranoid worry that people tend to have at work is that they're always on the brink of being fired or that their boss hates him or her.,
Remember that not everyone is looking at you when you step out.",How to Stop Being Paranoid," You may think everyone is talking about you, that everyone hates your new haircut, or that your new boss is out to get you. However, it's highly possible that none of this is true. The next time you have a very pessimistic thought, stop and do the following:


Ask yourself how likely it is that the pessimistic thought you're having will come true.
When you're expecting the worst, consider all of the possible outcomes of a situation, not just the most negative ones. Then, you'll see that there are many possibilities in virtually every situation.
Try to combat each pessimistic thought you have with two realistic thoughts. For example, if you're worried that everyone is laughing about your shoes, consider that 1) it's unlikely that a pair of shoes will keep everyone laughing throughout the day, and 2) it's more likely that a new, hilarious cat meme is making its way around the office messaging system.;
, Part of being paranoid means not just considering that everyone is against you or out to get you, but it also means thinking about this constantly. The more you think about the same negative thing, the more you indulge in your paranoid thoughts, and the more you become convinced that they are likely to be accurate. Though it's impossible to stop obsessing completely, there are a few tricks that can help you minimize your obsessive thoughts:


Give yourself a designated ""worry time."" Spend this time sitting down with your paranoid thoughts, evaluating them, and trying to minimize them. If a worry comes up during a different part of the day, just try to mentally move it to your ""worry time.""Keep a journal that tracks your paranoid thoughts. Reread it weekly. This can help you not only unload some of your paranoid feelings in a more healthy fashion, but it can also help you see that some of your paranoid fears were completely unfounded when you read back over what you've written. You may see that you worried about X happening on a certain date. Once the date passes, and X didn't happen, you may be able to accept that many of your paranoid beliefs are unwarranted., Having someone you can talk to about your paranoid feelings can help you get your worries out in the open and get a different perspective. Even the act of vocalizing some of your fears can help you see how they may be illogical. If you tell your friend that you think your group of friends really hates you, your friend will be able to provide rational and concrete examples that prove you wrong.
Just make sure you pick one of your more rational and even-keeled friends. You don't want someone who might encourage your paranoid behavior and make you feel worse.

, Though staying busy can't help you escape your problems, it can help you focus your energies on more productive outlets, such as pursuing your interests or attaining your personal goals.


If you spend even a few hours a week pursuing something that you really love, whether it's yoga or coin collecting, you're guaranteed to be less absorbed in your paranoid thoughts.

, This exercise really helps. If you put yourself in the shoes of the people you're so worried about, it'll help you see that many of your fears are unfounded. For a simple example, let's say you head to a party and tell yourself, ""Everyone will probably notice that I'm wearing the same outfit that I wore to that party three weeks ago."" Ask yourself if you remember what anyone else was wearing at that other party; the chances that you remember what anyone was wearing are very slim.


Ask yourself what the chances are that all of the people you're worried about are thinking about you as much as you're worried about them thinking about you. Do you spend hours thinking about how much you don't like those other people? Probably not.

, If you have anxiety, then you may be plagued by worry and a constant fear that something may go wrong. Anxiety may even trigger your paranoid thoughts, though these two conditions are different. Anxiety may cause you to worry that you're suffering from a fatal illness; on the contrary, paranoia may lead you to believe that your doctor purposefully made you sick.If anxiety is in fact the main cause of your problems, then you may want to seek medical help or take actions to stop anxiety., There's a difference between occasionally worrying that all of your friends are talking about you and letting this thought completely consume you. There's also a difference between knowing that your thoughts are irrational on some level and suffering from serious delusions that everyone is really out to hurt you. If you feel like your paranoid feelings are taking over your life and preventing you from enjoying your everyday interactions or socializing, then talk to a psychologist or other mental health professional to get help for your condition., Of course, this is easier said than done, but once you start believing in yourself and get comfortable around others, you'll see that every little thing you do, say, or wear doesn't really matter to anyone around you.


Work on being less self-conscious. Self-conscious people worry about the subjective experiences of others, which is something no one really has control over.Recognize that no matter what someone thinks of you, they have the power to think it. Sometimes, other people make comments about us that reflect what we think of ourselves. Even in these situations, it doesn't make the opinion a fact. Aim to shrug off these comments and stop questioning yourself every time someone states a subjective opinion of you.
Work on accepting yourself unconditionally.No matter if you did just trip over a rug or if your hair is sticking up, you're still human. All human beings are flawed creatures. Embrace your natural quirks and quit thinking everyone else is perfect except for you. Need a reality check? Visit YouTube and watch a few klutzy videos to remind yourself that all humans make mistakes - and sometimes these mistakes are laughable.

, Many paranoid people are so afraid that no one likes them or wants to hang out with them that they're more likely to spend time alone or at home instead of in a social setting. If you never put yourself out there, then you'll only expect the worst because you won't ever experience the positive aspects of social interaction. Make a goal of getting out of the house and hanging out with people fairly often, or at least once or twice a week.The more time you spend socializing, the more comfortable you'll be with the people around you and the less likely you'll be to imagine that they all hate you.

, After hanging out with a group of friends or even just talking to a neighbor on your street or chatting with the check-out girl at your local grocery store, you should come away with at least a few positive impressions of your fellow citizens of the world. At the end of every day or week, write down all of the good things that happened when you interacted with other people, all of the positive ways they made you feel, and all of the reasons why these interactions benefited your life.When you're feeling paranoid, review this list. Reminding yourself of all the concrete reasons why you should have more faith in others' intentions can help you ease your paranoid thoughts.

, You may think that a person hates you when he's just giving you constructive criticism and telling you how to improve. If your teacher gives you a poor grade on an essay, read the feedback and try to see if she has a valid point instead of assuming that you got the bad grade because your teacher just doesn't like you.


If you've been given some hurtful criticism, remember that it is entirely up to you how to receive it. You can cry or dwell on it for weeks, or you can think of it as an opportunity to refine yourself. Write down the critical comment and ponder its validity. If there is even the slightest chance that the critical remark is warranted, then you need to think hard about whether this is an aspect of yourself you want to change, or whether you are willing to stay the same.

, Unfortunately, not everyone you meet or interact with is going to like you or be nice to you. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't put yourself out there! In fact, being aware of the fact that there are mean, careless, or bitter people out in the world will make you appreciate all of the good people in your life even more. If someone is just outright rude to you for no reason, then you need to learn to accept that this is a result of that person's insecurities and personal issues, and not because of something you did.


Remind yourself that it takes all kinds of people to make the world. Not everyone is going to be your best friend, but that also doesn't mean everyone wants to be your worst enemy.

, If you're worried that your current partner is cheating on you - especially if you've had this concern about every person you've dated - then, chances are, your worries are rooted in paranoia. Ask yourself if you have any concrete evidence that this may be happening or if all of your concerns are in your head.Be open and talk to your partner about it. Tell him or her that you know your feelings are irrational and that you want help dealing with them.
Don't accuse your partner of cheating or check in every two seconds when you're not together to make sure he or she is not cheating. This will only make your partner feel like there's a lack of trust in the relationship.
Maintain your own identity. If you get too obsessed with the person you're dating or start depending on him or her too much, then you'll be even more likely to be paranoid because you'll feel completely dependent on that person's loyalty. Maintain other relationships outside of a romantic one.

, Ask yourself what you and your group of friends talk about when one of you isn't around - do you spend all of your time gossiping and talking about how much you hate that person? Unless you're in a really gossipy or mean group of friends, then most likely not. Ask yourself how likely it is that people talk about you the second you leave.


Do your friends invite you to hang out? Send you text messages? Compliment you? Ask you for advice? If so, then why would you think that they completely hate you?

, If this is you, then ask yourself about what evidence you actually have that you're going to lose your job. Do you get to work on time? Put in your hours? Show improvement? If so, then why would you get fired? If you've had no warning signs and people around you aren't getting fired left and right, then it's very likely that your worries are all in your head.


Help yourself feel better by making a list of all the great contributions you've made in the workplace.
Make a list of all of the compliments or positive feedback that your boss has given you. Now, write down anything negative you were told. You'll see that the positive far outweighs the negative, and, if they don't make an action plan to shift your work efforts in a positive direction.

, Another form of paranoia is ego-driven.You may think that as soon as you step into the halls or into a party, that everyone is staring at you, laughing at you, or making fun of you behind your back. Ask yourself how often you stare at a random person who arrived on the scene; chances are, like most people, you are too concerned with how you look and how others perceive you to pay all that much attention to anyone else.

Become a casual observer of your thoughts.,
Try to find recurring patterns.,
Pay attention to the connection your thoughts have with your feelings and actions.,
Find the root of catastrophizing.,
Distinguish between the irrational and rational.",How to Recognize Catastrophic Thoughts1," The most effective way to recognize catastrophic thoughts is by tuning into the non-stop script running through your head. Simply bringing awareness to the thoughts you have can be a powerful tool to improve them.


At this stage, you don’t need to take any action—just pay more attention to your thoughts. What kinds of things are you telling yourself?Some examples of common thoughts include ""I can't do this. I'm not good enough,"" or ""I never do anything right,"" or ""I'm too fat. No one will ever love me."";
, Do you find yourself thinking similarly at the same time each day, or before a certain task or activity? The time of day, task, or activity could be a stimuli or trigger for negative thought patterns.


For example, maybe each day as you drive home from work you find yourself thinking “I’ll never get any time to relax. The kids will keep me going until bedtime.” Or, perhaps, before you go to the gym, you think “I bet everyone will be so embarrassed for me. I’m so out of shape.”, If you ever want to improve a behavior, you have to start with your thought patterns. Catastrophic thinking can prompt you to act irrationally, feel anxious, or even be self-defeating. If you are engaging in destructive behaviors, it’s time for you to pinpoint how your thoughts are influencing your actions.


Write in a journal daily, or keep a daily mood log, that helps facilitate paying attention to your mood and what influences and/or triggers it, such as irrational and/or catastrophic thinking. You can write this information down, find a mood log app for your phone, or use a mood log website to help you do this. This will help you become more aware of the connections between what you were thinking, how you felt, and how you behaved as a result.
For instance, you might take the above thought pattern “I bet everyone will be so embarrassed for me. I’m so out of shape.” Those thoughts might make you feel ashamed. As a result, you find yourself making excuses not to go to the gym., After you have become an observer of your thoughts for a while, you need to start searching for the underlying cause of these thoughts. This can be tough to do, but give it your best shot.


Look at the trigger of catastrophic thoughts then try to examine what these thoughts are suggesting. For example, you say “I’ll never get any time to relax. The kids will keep me going until bedtime” before you pull up at home. The root cause might be chronic stress from your parenting responsibilities. You feel like you are not in control, so your thoughts tend to take a negative route., In some cases, thinking in a worse-case scenario pattern may be helpful for getting you out of trouble or preventing negative consequences. It's important to be able to recognize when your catastrophic thoughts are unlikely and illogical and when they deserve consideration.Your thoughts are irrational when the outcome is highly unlikely given the context. For example, you go to the doctor for a mild fever and assume you will be diagnosed with cancer. Your assumption is largely exaggerated.
However, if you are sick, then a rational thought might be something like, “I might have the flu, or an infection, which needs to be treated.”

Take a deep breath.,
Control what you can.,
Reverse your thoughts to the best-case possibility.,
Face fears head-on.,
Meet with a therapist.",How to Recognize Catastrophic Thoughts2," An effective method for overcoming catastrophic thinking is taking a brief pause. Often, once your thoughts take a negative, self-defeating track you keep on down that road. Once you become more aware of the triggers and causes of your catastrophic thinking, you can learn to slow down and digest what’s happening before letting your thoughts take over.

When you notice catastrophic thoughts, take a few minutes to practice deep breathing. This exercise can give you a moment to pause and think more rationally. It also helps alleviate stress. To do deep breathing, pull in air through your nose for several seconds. Hold the breath for 2 seconds. Then, exhale the breath from your mouth slowly. Repeat for several cycles.

, Lack of control is often one of the root causes of catastrophic thinking. You feel helpless, so you let your thoughts lead—no matter how irrational they may be. Counteract this by finding at least one aspect of a situation that you can control. Focus on that.


Let’s say, you’re worried that you will fail your English final. You find yourself thinking “I’ll fail the course and have to repeat it. This will ruin my GPA.”
What can you control in this situation? You can control your performance on the test, so speak with the instructor and ask for study tips. Create a study guide or a practice test. Although you can’t control all the variables, by focusing on what you can control, you take back some of your power and you also reduce the stressor simultaneously., Another method for disputing worst-case scenario thinking is by challenging yourself to look at the situation in reverse. Instead of dwelling on the worst possible outcome, envision the best possible result. This brings awareness to the fact that there are many possible outcomes—not just the worst.


For example, your boyfriend fails to answer your calls 4 times in a row. You worry that something horrible has happened to him. Maybe he was mugged. Perhaps he had a car accident. You strongly consider calling the police.
Rather than imagining catastrophe, think more positively. You were aware that your boyfriend has been really swamped at work. He’s been stressed out and sleeping poorly. Maybe he’s not answering your calls because he’s finally catching up on some zzz’s. How likely is this outcome?, Catastrophic thinking is often rooted in your worst fears. You dread something happening, and therefore give the event more power in your mind. Sometimes, taking action against catastrophic thinking means facing what you fear the most.In some cases, facing serious fears like phobias requires the assistance of a professional. However, if your fear is mild, challenge yourself to face it.
For instance, if you have a fear of escalators, then you could start by watching other people ride on escalators. Then, as you get more comfortable watching other people ride on escalators, then you could ride on one yourself.

, In more severe cases of resistant catastrophic thinking or chronic phobias, you may need to work with a mental health therapist. A therapist can help you search for the root cause of your disastrous thoughts, figure out triggers, and develop skills to dispute unreasonable thoughts.


Depending on how seriously your thoughts are impacting your life, you might need to try cognitive behavioral therapy or even medication to reduce the symptoms of anxiety.
Talk to your doctor about possible treatment options. Your family doctor can also refer you to an experienced therapist in your area."
"
Recognize how catastrophic thinking increases stress hormones.,
Resist the temptation to use unhealthy coping mechanisms.,
Realize your risk for a full-blown mental disorder.",How to Recognize Catastrophic Thoughts3," Catastrophic thinking is unhealthy because imagining the worst puts your body through the same ordeal it would if the worst was actually happening.


By thinking of terrible scenarios, your body is flooded with the stress hormone, cortisol. You have a fight or flight response in which everything is heightened—your heart beats faster, your palms sweat, and adrenaline courses through your body.This response is healthy when you’re actually in danger, but it’s counterintuitive when you’re not. Plus, when you suffer from chronic stress, you end up feeling constantly on edge. This compromises your immune system, interferes with your thought processes, and hinders sleep.

, Many people who experience recurrent catastrophic thoughts have trouble handling them. As a result, they turn to negative coping mechanisms like risky sex, overeating, gambling, alcohol and drugs.


If you suffer from nonstop catastrophic thinking and can’t seem to get it under control, see a therapist right away. Getting the help you need could prevent you from developing another serious problem like an addiction., Your tendency to magnify problems and blow them out of proportion can be a sign of a budding psychiatric illness. If your negative thought patterns are difficult to dispute, get help from a trained psychologist or mental health therapist.


Research shows that catastrophic thinking is directly related to psychopathology and is a feature in many conditions such as panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder."

Stop worrying about what others think.,
Express yourself.,
Learn to say “no.” Odds are, you probably agree to favors and tasks for others because you don’t feel confident enough to decline.,
Make a list of actionable goals.,
Practice self-love.,
Reach out to friends and loved ones.,
See a professional.,
Take medication to help with your feelings.,
Join a support group.,
Be wary of self-medicating.,
Understand you may experience depression.,
Realize you may start to doubt yourself.",How to Stop Forcing Yourself to Act Okay," To be yourself and stop pretending, you have to stop analyzing how you come across to others. Not focusing on how you’re acting allows you to instead focus on what you’re doing, which is when people are typically themselves. Not constantly seeking approval from others by pretending to feel good when you don’t, allows you to be yourself, which is usually more enjoyable than putting on a charade.Whenever you catch yourself worrying about others' opinions of you, quickly evaluate your situation. Are you okay with the choices you're making? If so, push away any nagging feelings that others are not. Your opinion is the only one that is necessary for your happiness.;
, A part of the reason you feel forced to keep pretending you’re okay is because you don’t feel comfortable speaking up for yourself. Another part of the reason people pretend to be okay is to please others. When you learn assertiveness you are respecting yourself by stating your needs and opinions while also being respectful of others. It’s a win-win.If you have an idea, opinion, or desire, share it. If you’re worried about coming across too strong, use “I” statements like “Hey, I think it’s a great idea to start on the packing early. However, I think our time would be better served if we started with the rooms we use the least—like the library and dining room.”

, Start today and only say “yes” to requests that serve you or make you happy.Say, “I know you need help with babysitting this week, sis. Unfortunately, I have a big test coming up in chemistry and need to study.” You’ll feel better, and others will start being more respectful of your time.

, Ask yourself if you think you need to change. Are you happy with the way you are? Sometimes, we pretend with others because we are not the people we would like to be. Instead of pretending to be something you’re not, why not invest your energy into becoming closer to the person you’d like to be? Set some goals for yourself.If you truly think change in some area of life will benefit you, sit down and make a list of small actionable goals. For example, if you are struggling financially, you might include goals like “start an emergency savings” and “pick up a second job.”

, In a world where everyone is always complaining about their weight, their income, or their relationships, it can seem illegal to actually love yourself. Even if you spot areas in your life that need improvement, you are still worthy of showing yourself compassion. When you love yourself and treat yourself as you would your very best friend, you are less inclined to care what others think and thereby hold in who you truly are.Show self-love and compassion by being gentle with yourself. Think of what you really need. If you feel tired, reduce your activities and get some rest. Practice regular self-care by doing things that relax and calm you. Make an appointment at the spa. Get your hair cut or styled. Take a luxurious bubble bath. Read that new spy novel you’ve been hearing about.

, When you’re feeling down take advantage of your close social circle for support. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, a shoulder to cry on, or an outing to help cheer you up.Think of someone you trust and openly share what’s been going on with you. If you think you need professional help, ask your loved one to accompany you. Asking for help can be as simple as saying “I’ve been feeling really sad lately and can’t seem to get over it. Do you have a moment to talk?”

, In order to truly feel better about yourself you need to find the reason for your unhappiness. You may require the help of a therapist to really get to the root of your feelings. In therapy, you have the opportunity to really get honest with yourself and answer personal questions that allow you to dig deep and understand the reason for your unhappiness. Once you determine why you aren’t okay, you can then take the steps you need to get yourself better.You can find a good therapist by consulting with your primary care doctor. Ask your doctor to give you a mental health referral to a counselor that deals with depression, anxiety, or adjustment disorders.

, A doctor can likely prescribe medication to help you overcome what you are going through. Whether it is anxiety, depression, or other issues that are causing you to hide what you’re really feeling, your doctor can likely give you medicine that can make you feel better. If you are suffering from severe depression, medication may help you feel better about yourself.It's important to note, however, that medication is not a cure-all. People with depression are best treated with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Your doctor may also suggest that you make lifestyle changes like eating better, exercising, and developing a social support system.

, Sometimes talking to others who are experiencing the same things you are is what can help the most. You may be able to receive advice on how to stop hiding how you feel. You may also receive help combating the issues you are struggling with, which can make you feel much better about yourself.


For help finding a support group near you, ask your doctor or therapist for recommendations. You can also look for online support groups, if you can’t find any in your area or would rather attend the group in private., Know that you can turn to the wrong things when looking for happiness. Hiding yourself from your feelings can result in dangerous behaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse. People who don’t want to confront their feelings and thoughts may turn to drugs and alcohol to mask their pain or emotions. Using this as a coping mechanism may feel like it’s the right thing to do in the moment, but they can create health problems, as well as emotional issues for you in the future.Signs that you are struggling with substance abuse include hiding the behavior from your friends and family, experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you aren’t using, having problems going to school and work because of your habit, and hurting yourself and others when you use., Pretending to be OK when you’re really not may seem like a good idea at first, but you may fall into a downward spiral of depression because of it. Feeling like no one knows what you are going through can create a feeling of isolation, which can cause the inescapable sadness.


Eventually you may find yourself not able to get out of bed, distancing yourself from your friends and loved ones, and engaging in dangerous behavior. Depression is a serious illness, but there are treatment options to help you cope with this condition., Attempting to “fake it ‘till you make it” is essentially telling everyone around you a lie. After time, you may lose trust in yourself because of the lie you constantly tell. This may result in you hating yourself and engaging in self-destructive behavior, which makes you even more unhappy.If you find yourself engaging in self-destructive behavior, turn to a close friend or family member. Tell this person how you're feeling, ""Hey, Pam, I've been doing pretty bad lately. I haven't been getting work done and sleeping all day. I've also been drinking more. I really need a friend to talk to.""
Journaling may also help you when you find yourself pretending. Sometimes, we may have dark thoughts that we don't feel comfortable sharing with loved ones. You can use a blank piece of notebook paper to unload these feelings. Journaling also helps you identify negative thought patterns and can be an important problem-solving tool.

Identify your jealous or fearful thoughts.,
Change your thinking.,
Practice gratitude.,
Help others.",How to Stop Being Jealous of Younger Women1," Jealousy and envy are natural, although uncomfortable, emotions.Everyone feels them from time to time.If you ignore it or don’t accept your own jealousy, you could end up feeling angry and resentful.Remind yourself that you are not a helpless victim, you are in control of yourself.
Think of your jealousy as useful information, it is telling you that something needs to change – either in your own thinking or in how you treat or care for yourself.
Understand that idealized beauty standards in culture can make it very difficult for women to interact with other women and can cause conflict.This can negatively affect your well-being.;
, There are many negative thoughts you might have including, ""I think I won't be able to handle an adult relationship. I think I may be too needy. I think I am too much of a rescuer to choose the right kind of partner. I am scared of being vulnerable, of trusting the wrong person.""


List your negative thoughts.

, Separate all the tangled threads of your beliefs and assumptions and start examining them one by one.


Once you have identified negative thoughts such as, “All of the younger women are taking available partners. I will be left out,” change these types of negative thoughts into more realistic alternatives such as, “There are plenty of available partners out there.”
Recognize that everyone has insecurities. Even the most beautiful and wealthy have weaknesses and have made mistakes. Nobody is perfect.

, It is easy to get stuck thinking about what you do not have. When you count all that does exist in your life, all that you can be thankful for, then you may be able to let go of the need to constantly search for that one more thing to make you happy.


Celebrate what you already have instead of worrying about what you don’t have.
Some examples of things to be appreciate of include: If you are making your own money, contributing to charity, being a good friend, and striving to do meaningful work.
Another way to practice gratitude is to make a gratitude journal where each day you list at least three things you are grateful for.

, Focusing on others can not only increase your gratitude, but can help you focus on what is important – human connection.


Help a friend in need. Provide a shoulder to cry on or words of solace.

Consider whether you might need professional help.,
Learn some relaxation techniques.,
Think about what you are afraid of.,
Rank your fear level.,
Start facing your fears.",How to Stop Being Afraid1," Fear can vary in intensity. You might be mildly afraid of something, or you might be so afraid of something that you won’t leave your house. Before you try to face your fear on your own, it is a good idea to consider the degree of your fear.


For example, if you just have a mild fear of public speaking and you get a little nervous before you have to speak in front of a group, then you may be able to overcome this fear by using some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.
However, if you are so afraid of public speaking that you are skipping classes or making excuses to get out of having to give a presentation, then this is a severe fear and you may need to seek the help of a mental health professional to get over your fear.;
, Before you face your fears, it is helpful to learn some relaxation techniques to calm yourself down when you are feeling overwhelmed by fear. These techniques can help you to control unpleasant feelings related to your fear, such as anxiety. Some good relaxation techniques to learn include:



Deep breathing.

Progressive muscle relaxation.
Meditate

, Take some time to consider what you are afraid of. You may even want to create a list of everything you are afraid of so that you can work on becoming less fearful of these things.Include everything that you are afraid of on this list and try to be as specific as possible.
For example, instead of saying you are afraid of people, try to identify what types of people make you feel afraid. Men? Women? Older people? People who look different from you? Be as specific as possible about the people you fear.

, It is important to work through your fear starting with the least scary thing or situation and moving up your list as you get comfortable with these low ranking items. After you have written down all of your fears, you can narrow down what you want to work on first by selecting one fear category and then try ranking these fears on a scale of 1 (least scary) to 10 (scariest).For example, if you are afraid of dogs, then the least scary situation (1) might be looking at a picture of a dog, and the scariest situation (10) might be petting a large dog. Make a ranked list for each fear that you want to work on.

, When you have finished your ranked lists, you can begin to face the items on your lists moving from the least scary to the scariest item on your lists.Work through the items at a pace that is comfortable for you. For example, you might want to try facing one item per day, or you might find that you need to face the same item on your list multiple times to conquer the fear.


Make sure that you are keeping yourself safe as you do this. For example, don’t do something that could actually endanger your life, such as going near a wild or venomous animal.
Use a relaxation technique to soothe feelings of anxiety. When you face the fear, you are likely to experience some feelings of discomfort and anxiety. This is normal. To soothe these feelings, use your chosen relaxation technique to help soothe yourself.

Do some soul-searching.,
Understand your biases.,
Identify your fears.,
Re-define yourself.",How to Stop Being Jealous of Younger Women2," This means identifying your core beliefs and values. Find out what truly matters to you, and your jealousy of another person may fade away.


Begin by writing down everything that you value in life such as: family, friends, relationships, housing, a job, pets, love, friendship, justice, freedom, and equality.
Focus in and be mindful of your thoughts and feelings as they come up. Question your own thoughts.

, Sometimes personal biases can influence your feelings and behaviors. For example, there is a stigma against age (also called ageism), where people may be prejudice of older individuals. If you have this particular bias, then you may be more likely to become jealous of younger people in general because of your implicit judgment of older people (yourself). This can lead to self-stigmatization and lower self-esteem.


You can measure your own thoughts and biases about age through an Implicit Association Test from Harvard University.This test often shows that people tend to have an automatic preference for younger versus older people.

, Sometimes jealousy is driven by fears, and understanding what your fears are can help you eliminate your envy and jealousy.


Create a fear journal. Identify the things you are afraid of such as that: you won't be loved, you will be abandoned, people will not find you attractive, or you might end up alone.
If your fears are not in line with your values, then toss them out. If it’s not truly important to you then being jealous actually goes against your values. This can create cognitive dissonance, which is a feeling you have when two things you are experiencing (i.e. jealousy for someone more attractive, and not thinking attractiveness is valuable) do not match.

, Define yourself and what gives you happiness more clearly. Your identity does not need to depend on youth, beauty, and wealth.


Questions you might ask yourself include: Are my looks all that I am? Am I just an age? Am I defined by whether I am 25 or 30 or 45? Is my identity defined by a man?Am I my own person? Am I living everyday? Am I growing as time passes?

Keep your cool.",How to Stop Being Jealous of Younger Women3," Being prideful and knowing your strengths can help motivate you to persevere when you feel jealous or when times get tough.Own and embrace your sexuality.Think of yourself as intelligent, distinguished, and wise.

, Sometimes, all the love you may need at that moment is the love you give yourself. You can encourage yourself when you feel down and take yourself to a healthier place.


Tell yourself, “I am good enough. I am healthy. I am attractive. I like who I am.”

, Sometimes you can put up a brave face and say it does not matter. But the truth is - you do need love. You need someone who holds a mirror to your pain, who appreciates how hurt you can get, how small and lonely you feel sometimes. Consider how you can get this love that will serve as a balm to your spirit and that will pick you up when you are feeling down.


It may come from friends and family who care about you and love you.

Identify your triggers and avoid them.,
Take a moment to yourself.,
Tune in to your emotions.,
Challenge negative thoughts that arise.,
Take a more reasonable action.,
Reflect on how you handled the situation.",How to Stop Being Dramatic1," One way to keep your reactions under control is to steer clear of situations and people who provoke strong reactions from you. You may not be able to avoid certain people and situations, but you can find ways to limit your exposure or make these experiences more pleasant.For example, if you tend to react in an overdramatic way if you are running late for work, then try to leave 10 minutes earlier than you usually do.
Or, if you have a friend who makes you crazy, then try to limit your contact with him or her. If you bump into the friend, then you can just say something like, “Hi! I wish I could stay and chat, but I am in a hurry. Have a good day!”;
, Before you do or say anything, you might find it helpful to take a moment to yourself and process your emotions a bit. For example, you could go into another room and do some deep breathing to calm yourself down, listen to a soothing song, or just examine how you are feeling.


To excuse yourself, try saying something like, “I have to run to the bathroom. Just give me a few minutes and we can keep talking.”

, If you receive some disappointing news, you may have some string negative emotions coming up. If you want to make sure that you do not overreact to the situation, then you may need to allow yourself to feel these feelings and think about what they mean.For example, if you have just learned that you are failing a class, then you might notice a knot in your stomach or trembling hands. Take a moment to consider why you are feeling this way. For example, you might be fearful about what your parents might say or disappointed in yourself.

, One reason that some people overreact to certain situations is because they have negative thoughts that go unchallenged.For example, if you learned that you are failing a class, then you might think to yourself, “I am a failure!” However, this thought is not an accurate reflection of the situation. It is a dramatic reaction.


When you notice yourself overdramatizing a situation like this, take a moment to identify and challenge the thought. For example, you might reframe the thought “I am a failure!” to something like, “I thought I was passing the class, but I am not. However, I am still doing well in my other classes, so this is just a temporary setback.”

, After you have challenged any negative thoughts, you can begin to look for solutions to your problem. For example, instead of punching a locker or sobbing openly in the hallway, you might decide to schedule an appointment with your teacher to ask if there is anything you can do to bring up your grade.


Even if the action you take does not lead to a positive outcome, keep looking for solutions! For example, if your teacher says that there is nothing you can do, then start making plans to improve your grades for the following semester or school year.

, To ensure that your reactions are appropriate, it is also important to reflect on how you handled the situation. You can ask yourself some questions to determine whether you handled the situation well. If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you may still need to work on some things:Is there anything that you regret about your response or that you wish you could change?
Did you lash out at anyone who was trying to comfort you or help you?
Do you feel the need to apologize for anything you said or did?
Did you feel like you were out of control at any point?
Did you make any unfair assumptions about anyone?
Did you feel the need to withdraw from others to deal with the situation?

See a counselor or therapist.,
Be positive to avoid the drama.,
Work on your body language.",How to Stop Being Dramatic2," Talk through your problems and situations. With professional help and advice, the focus of the problems and drama may be clarified.

Passive-aggressive responses will be minimized. Working out past issues with a therapist will help you avoid the snarky comments that often cause drama.

, Choosing between optimism and pessimism is difficult, but it is a choice. Consider the following changes of perspective to improve your attitude.When your legs are tired after a long day, be happy you can walk.
If you are upset about family drama, be happy that you have living family.
Being tired in the morning can be easily turned around by realizing everyone doesn’t have a bed.

, Having inappropriate or confusing body language can lead to serious misinterpretations and drama. There is no need to cause a scene or challenge someone through a simple misunderstanding. Try to convey non-confrontational body language.Uncross your arms. It looks defensive and closed off.
Find even ground with others. If they are sitting, sit beside them. Stand evenly with them.

Take a step back.,
Practice deep breathing on a daily basis.,
Calm yourself with yoga.",How to Stop Being Dramatic3," Reflect on the situation for what it is. Think about whether or not you should be upset. If you’re removed from the situation or the person with whom you’re aggravated, there is a good chance you can’t create drama.


Take a walk around the block. Make your walk just long enough to ignore what caused you drama.
Go have a coffee break. Sit back and relax. Be in the moment and enjoy the situation instead of dwelling on a dramatic situation.
Read something. Change your focus by immersing yourself in another story or another world. You’ll forget about the drama while imagining characters and scenarios in the book.

, Breathing deeply will calm you down and allow you to speak calmly and clearly. Inhale deeply for a few seconds, then hold the breath for a beat, and exhale for longer than you breathed in. This process will lower your stress, anxiety, and blood pressure, as well as potentially improve brain health, all of which should help you calm down., The benefits of yoga are plentiful. Not only will you reach a calmer state with the meditative actions, but performing yoga can help you stop being dramatic in various other ways.Yoga helps you manage stress. The less stressed you are, the less likely you will be to overdramatize a situation.
Your coping skills will improve. One of the benefits of yoga is that you’ll be better able to handle difficult situations, and you’ll be less likely to get bent out of shape over something minimal or trivial.
Sharpen your concentration with yoga. By sharpening your concentration, it will be easier to identify the issues and situations that can be ignored, and those that warrant an escalated response.

"
Consider your role in the drama.,
Empower yourself.,
Downplay the situation.,
Focus on the positive.,
Avoid other people's business.",How to Stop Being Dramatic4," An easy way to solve a dramatic situation is to stop it. Be introspective about the situation and determine if you’re the one causing the drama.


Do people tend to drift away from you? You may be the drama-filled person that causes stress in every situation, and they don’t want to deal with it.
If people cut conversations short with you, and constantly reply with brief answers like “Sure” or “Whatever” they may just not want to talk with you because of the impending drama.
When you always seem to be in an argument with people around you, and they don’t have the same issues otherwise, you are probably a source of drama.

, Feeling like you do not have control of your life can cause you to react in overdramatic ways. If you are in a situation that makes you unhappy or that arouses other negative emotional responses in you, then remind yourself that you can do something about it. You do not have to stay in a situation that is bad for you.


For example, if you are in a relationship with someone who pushes your buttons or who does not listen to you, then you have the option to say something or to end the relationship.

, Know which battles to choose and people will learn to listen when you do speak up. The more fires you light over little issues, the more likely it is that others will begin to stop listening.


Try to ignore little things that people say and do that get on your nerves. For example, it is not worth getting upset with a friend if she borrows your pencil without asking. However, it would be important to address your friend’s behavior if she has a habit of frequently using your clothes and other personal items without asking you first.

, Negative thinking can cause you to feel unhappy and you may act out some of those emotions, but you can reframe negative thoughts to make them into positive ones. Whenever you have a negative thought, take a moment to reframe it so that it is positive instead.You can also practice positivity by keeping a gratitude journal where you list everything that you are grateful for. Practicing gratitude can improve your self-esteem and help you to feel happier.For example, if you find out that a friend said something behind your back, then you might catch yourself thinking, “Everyone hates me!” To reframe this thought you could change it to something like, “Even though this friend said something mean about me, I have other friends who accept me and care about me.”
To keep a gratitude journal, start listing the things that you are grateful for starting with the most basic. Do you have a bed to sleep in? Food to eat? Clothes on your back? Then, as your list gets longer, start paying attention to little things to be grateful for, such as a beautiful sunset or having a fun time with your friends.

, Not knowing what others are talking about, or missing some of the details, and then interjecting yourself into the situation, is likely to cause confusion. Just stay out of it and don't worry yourself unnecessarily. If it doesn't involve you and it's not really a huge deal then there is no need for you to panic about it or be involved.

Look for possible reasons why you think your life sucks.,
Keep a journal.,
Ask yourself the following questions to help analyze yourself.,
Consider possible biological causes.",How to Stay Positive when You Know Your Life Sucks1," There are a variety of reasons why you may feel like your life sucks.

Keeping a journal will also allow you to identify what elements of your situation you have control over, which will help you stay positive.In general, you should remember that you cannot control anything other than your own actions and responses.


For example, you might notice that you feel most upset and sad when you're at work. You may feel unacknowledged and unappreciated. You may feel overworked. This situation sucks.
Ask yourself what elements you have control over. You can't control whether others appreciate or acknowledge your contributions.

You can also control whether you look for a different job in a place that might be a better fit for you. Find ways to empower yourself, and you may find that you feel like your life sucks less.
Try to come up with a list of things that you can do to help you own your situation. For example, if you feel overworked, you might consider talking to your boss about your workload or negotiating a pay raise. If you don't feel appreciated, you might consider looking for a job in a place with a better corporate environment. Make a list of specific, concrete actions that you can take.

This is too big of a change. = Let's try something new and exciting.

, It can feel like where you are in life defines who you are. If you're in an environment that sucks, it can be hard to remain positive. Focus on your innate qualities, rather than the situation around you. Remember: the situation is always temporary.


For example, if you're worried about being unemployed, remember that your job status doesn't define you as a person. Consider this an opportunity to pursue a new direction, or search for meaningful work in another area, such as volunteering or focusing on your family.

Are there any exceptions?
What is the missing part of the picture here?

Be the change you wish to see. (Mahatma Gandhi)
Action is the antidote to despair. (Joan Baez)
None but ourselves can free our minds. (Bob Marley)
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness. (Eleanor Roosevelt)

, People who feel that life has a purpose tend to be happier than those who think it's meaningless. Have you ever taken time to think about the meaning of life? No one can truly know the answer to this universal question. However, you can decide what life means to you. Finding the meaning in your life will help you keep getting out of bed every day, even when things are at their worst.


Some people find meaning by participating in a religion or nurturing their spiritual side.
Learning more about philosophy might also help you figure out more about your personal worldview.
On a more intimate scale, the most meaningful parts of your life might be your relationships, your work, your art, or something entirely different.

, There are bound to be a few things in your life that bring you comfort or peace. Whether it's drinking that first cup of coffee in the morning, walking to work in the sunshine or taking your ten-minute smoke break, savor the moment. Give yourself permission to slow down and enjoy the good things in life. You'll develop a healthy reserve of positive thoughts you can draw upon when things get bad., Exerting more effort through volunteering will give you even better results. Figure out what you have to give, and share it generously as often as possible.


Think you have nothing to offer? Find a homeless shelter in your area and volunteer for a few hours a week. You'll see that every bit of time you can spare is absolutely needed.

Use sage if you are not following a specific tradition.,
Consider cedar instead if it grows in your area.,
Only burn sweetgrass after the smudging ceremony is done.,
Buy raw, natural tobacco if you want to harvest the plants yourself.,
Obtain these plants from respectful sources.,
Choose a natural container to hold it in, or bundle the herb into a bunch.,
Waft the smoke with a turkey feather (optional).,
Store the materials above waist height and let them dry.,
Know when to smudge.",How to Smudge a House1," Dozens of Native American tribes and other cultures have their own smudging ceremonies, and each one has its own traditions concerning which plants to use. Sage is probably the most common choice, and is especially important for the Cheyenne and other Great Plains cultures. While many cultures consider white sage to be excellent at driving away bad spirits or energies, other varieties are commonly used as well.;
, Cedar is another plant often burned in cleansing ceremonies, especially in the Pacific Northwest or Canada. Note that some trees referred to as ""cedars"" are actually juniper trees, which some tribes use in smudging and some do not.While many people now mix multiple herbs together, the practice is not supported by some Native American elders.Again, there are many different smudging ceremonies, and some of them may call for sweetgrass or a different plant instead of sage or cedar. Follow this advice to perform an effective and respectful ceremony if you have not been taught a specific culture's tradition.

, Sweetgrass, or holy grass, is a sacred plant across North America, and is often considered to represent kindness and please spirits.It is sometimes burned after the sage or cedar have cleared away negative energy.


If you have been taught a specific tribe's tradition that uses sweetgrass in the main ceremony, feel free to use it, or any other plant that tribe allows.

, While tobacco can be added to the smudging ceremony, stick to one herb if this is your first time smudging. Instead, use tobacco as an offering before you harvest a different herb.See below for more information.

, If you can, harvest these plants yourself as described in the sub-steps, preferably in as natural an environment as possible. Otherwise, obtain them from a Native American shop in person or online, to ensure the plants were treated appropriately.


Before picking the plant, many tribes thank the Creator or nature, then place or burn natural, raw tobacco as an offering.
Harvest the correct part of the cedar tree. Pick branches at eye level with green tips. Dry them and crush them into a rough powder before burning.You should not harvest sweetgrass yourself, as it is endangered in some areas.Sweetgrass is usually dried and braided before use, so try to find sustainably harvested sweetgrass braids from a Native American shop or online store., Clay or stone bowls are commonly used in smudging rituals. Abalone shells are another common container, but be aware that some Pacific Northwest tribes believe they are not appropriate for this ritual.


Bundles of herbs, called ""smudge sticks"", can be made yourself or purchased pre-bundled. Some Native American elders question how traditional smudge sticks are, but they are now used even by many Native Americans., Many people use a feather or fan of feathers to waft the smoke during a smudging ceremony. In the US, eagle and hawk feathers are illegal to possess unless you belong to certain native tribes.Turkey feathers are legal, and traditionally used by some tribes in eastern North America. Do not use owl feathers, as these have different ritual purposes.It is illegal to buy wild feathers in the United States.Purchase cruelty-free feathers from farm-raised birds, or use feathers you've obtained yourself from hunting or finding them in the wild.

, Keep your plants and smudging container on a space cleared for them, above the ground. A high bookshelf cleared for their use is a good choice. Do not use the herbs until they are dry, or you will fail to produce the right kind of smoke.

, Many people smudge when they move into a new place or stay in a hotel room, to purify the new space. You may wish to perform a smudging ceremony after you hear bad news, or when you are preparing for a big change in your life.Smudging could also help you deal with the aftereffects of a big argument or a long illness.


Smudging is performed more frequently under certain circumstances, such as in places where other ceremonies take place, or sometimes during archaeological excavations of native remains and sacred materials.
Smudging a dorm room may be against university policy against fire use, although some U.S. institutions have changed these policies after challenges based on the First Amendment and freedom of religion.

Consider following additional rules out of respect.,
Pray or give thanks.,

Let the ashes cool, then return them to the earth.",How to Smudge a House2," Different cultures have different rules for how to participate in smudging ceremonies, but removing metal jewelry, belts, and so forth is a common requirement. This may be considered a way to make yourself spiritually prepared, or can symbolize detachment from valuable possessions.


Many experienced ceremony leaders allow you to keep on wedding rings and other metal objects with spiritual significance, so feel free to do so when performing your own ceremony.

, Different traditions have different ways to prepare their participants, but a couple of the more common ones are listed below. Many elders are not strict about these rules, but consider following them out of respect:Do not drink alcohol or take drugs for at least 24 hours before the ceremony, and preferably not for several days. They may leave you spiritually weakened.
Menstruating or pregnant women are sometimes asked to leave due to beliefs of their spiritual intensity disrupting the ceremony or leaving them vulnerable. Often, they are welcome at the house smudging ceremony but are not personally purified.

, You and anyone else present should enter the ceremony with good intentions. Pray to the world's creator, to spirits, or in whatever way you feel comfortable. If you do not wish to pray, talk or think about your gratitude toward the plants and the earth that produces them.You may continue to pray throughout the ceremony, either silently or aloud. Many people believe the smoke carries your prayers.

, You may already have a prepared ""smudge stick"", or bundle of herbs which can be used for multiple ceremonies. Otherwise, place a small handful of the dried plant material into a natural container, such as a clay, stone, or abalone shell bowl.

, You can light the plants with any source of fire, although some people feel more in touch with the ceremony if they use matches rather than a lighter or torch. Let the fire catch hold for about 30 seconds, then blow it out so the herbs are only producing smoke.


Feel free to relight the herbs or add more during the ceremony if the smoke starts running out.

, Typically, each participant is smudged before the house is. There is no one correct way to perform this part of the ceremony, although one suggestion is described below. Just make sure each participant rubs the smoke against their body and focuses on their ritual purification.


If you have an eagle, hawk, or turkey feather, use it to fan the smoke.
When you are being purified, use your hands as a cup to catch the smoke, then pass it over yourself or rub it against your skin. In some areas, people put their hands palms downward when they're finished.Many people prefer to start with the head and heart, then move the smoke downward across their arms and legs.You may use any method you wish, however.
Menstruating and pregnant women usually do not participate in this part of the ceremony, as they are already in a special spiritual state. Anyone else has the option to politely decline as well.

, Use a feather to push the smoke to each place in the house, or use your hands. As you pass by an open door or window, you may use the feather to push the smoke outside, carrying with it the negative energies.


Different traditions begin at the east wall, west wall, or front entrance.
You may walk clockwise or counterclockwise. As with many aspects of the smudging ceremony, different cultures or individuals follow different practices.

, Some people prepare a new smudging container and burn an additional plant for another effect. Probably the most common of these multi-part ceremonies involves sage and/or cedar for the initial purification, then sweetgrass to please the new spirits or create a positive environment.

, Thank the earth for providing a sacrifice of plants for you to use, and thank the plants and fire as well. Ashes will provide nutrients back to the soil. This act has a different interpretation in some traditions: the Anishinaabe place the ashes outside to symbolize leaving negative feelings outside the door.You can either let the herbs finish smoldering, or extinguish the plant and return what's left along with the ashes.
If using a smudge stick, extinguish it by gently stubbing it against a hard surface. Return the ash and broken fragments to the soil, and store the stick in a special location off the ground for later use.

Think of how you would feel.,
Recognize that eavesdropping is not a little fault.,
Understand that eavesdropping can be dangerous.,
Understand that the eavesdropped person not knowing doesn't justify the act.,
Understand legal implications.,
Ask yourself if you really need to know the information you'd overhear.",How to Resist the Urge to Eavesdrop," Imagine you have some sensitive issue you need to discuss with someone.  (Maybe you're gay, maybe you're suicidal, maybe you're being bullied, maybe you or someone you know is being abused, maybe you're failing a class, the list could go on forever)  You find a trusted person (parent, teacher, best friend, therapist etc), muster your courage and tell this person your situation.  Now, imagine that someone who has no respect for your situation or your privacy comes listening in for their personal amusement.  How would you feel then?;
, Eavesdropping on a private conversation is not something that's slightly out-of-line.  It's not like being late, it's not like cutting in a line-up, and it's often even worse than name calling. It's also not like sneaking up to someone and saying 'boo' or throwing a snowball at them while their back is turned. Eavesdropping cannot be shrugged off with a ""nobody's perfect,"" ""we all have our faults"" or in any way be overlooked by others as long as you're otherwise a nice person.  (You'll never be seen as ""a nice person with a big nose"")


The feelings that an eavesdropped person often feels are that of trespass, betrayal, breach of trust and confidentiality, hurt and humiliation.  These feelings are difficult to dispel even with an apology, let alone the eavesdropped person being able or willing to shrug or laugh them off.
On a moral scale, eavesdropping is about on the same level as following a person everywhere they go and looking at them, laying your hand on a sensitive part of a person's body, or having an affair.

, As is stated in step 1, people depend on their privacy in order to feel comfortable discussing personal situations. If people cannot trust that their conversation is kept between them and their intended recipient alone, they will be unwilling to seek help for theirs, or others' problems, and important, sensitive issues could go unreported. In other words, an eavesdropped person may be left feeling like they can never discuss anything private ever again, and this could have grave outcomes if ever they're being bullied, abused, have mental issues, witness child abuse, or otherwise need help in the future.

, Some eavesdroppers try to justify their eavesdropping with the ever-popular, but false expression ""What they don't know won't hurt.""  Therefore, the eavesdropper will eavesdrop, in secret, for their personal amusement, and then not tell anyone what they did, nor disclose to anyone what they heard.  However, this does not justify eavesdropping. In fact, you are effectively lying to the people conversing that their conversation is being kept private, when it isn't. Think of it this way: would you feel comfortable having a private conversation with someone if someone else MIGHT be listening in?  Maybe your conversation is kept private, but maybe it isn't?  Probably not.


Also, using lack of knowledge to justify eavesdropping would, by extension, justify other surreptitious wrongs, such as cheating in a relationship, being a peeping tom, shoplifting without getting caught, cheating on a test or ""buying"" a paper for school, or a crematorium keeping a body for research and giving the family pretend ashes.  No knowledge does not mean no victim.
Besides, if you had any respect for the people having the private conversation, you would WANT their conversation to remain private between the two of them.

, In some situations, eavesdropping can not only be unethical, but also illegal. This is often true if an auditory or recording device is used to eavesdrop, in which case it's called ""bugging"" and you can go to jail for it. Eavesdropping with the ear alone is not generally considered illegal, but it is unethical, seriously wrong, and the damage is still the same.

, Just what good does it do to you to know another person's private life or information?  Apart from gratification or amusement, which you have no business feeling, probably none.  How does it harm you to not know another person's private life or information?  You may be left feeling like you don't know everything, but hey, nobody knows everything anyway, nor can anybody know everything, so there's no harm done.  Some things are unknown because they're meant to be that way.

They get consumed with these thoughts, wondering if people notice, trying to come up with ways to get rid of it, and beating themselves up over how defective they feel. This leads to serious self-esteem and self-confidence issues. Because of these feelings, you'll likely find them displaying one of two behaviors:


They look at the body part over and over and over. They may carry a mirror with them or not be able to pass a mirror without stopping and staring at their reflection. If they can, they'll stare at the body part directly. Each time they do, they'll get more and more disgusted as the frustration naturally increases every time they look at it. Despite this frustration, they can't not look at it. They keep checking to see if it's still there, confirming their fears.
They avoid looking at the body part. Some people with BDD, on the other hand, have to avoid mirrors completely or have to cover up the body part so they don't see it. If they are presented with the body part they're unhappy with, they may lose control of their emotions, panic, and withdraw.
Whether they're looking into mirrors constantly or they can't look into them at all, this ultimately decreases their self-esteem and confidence. Wherever they go, whoever they're with, they're thinking about this aspect of their appearance, wondering if other people are thinking about it, too, or wondering if they're succeeding in hiding it.;
, If your loved one has BDD, you'll see them sitting in awkward positions, caking on make-up, or wearing specific clothing to mask whatever they can. If you watch them, you may see them fussing with their positioning, checking their makeup, or adjusting their clothing to make sure the defect is hidden. They will do everything possible to prevent its exposure to themselves or to others.


This person you're concerned about likely feels as if they are being judged at all times on the basis of their physical appearance. If no one is around to judge them, they'll do the judging themselves. This leads them to hiding this part of their body as much as possible and in all situations.
For instance, a lot of people wear a cap be it day or night, inside or outside, because they are insecure about the lack of hair on their heads. Some girls wear long and loose tops as they are conscious of their butts. While this is normal behavior, an individual with BDD cannot resist succumbing to the need to hide what worries them and will be incredibly distressed if forced not to.

, If this person in your life has a hard time accepting their body, they probably tend to isolate themselves so no one can see them. Regardless of the situation, they'll want to stay somewhere there are fewer chances of exposing it to someone. For most, that place is home. Your relationship will likely suffer (not to mention their relationship with others) and, while they're not housebound, you'll notice them taking on reclusive tendencies more and more.


Those with BDD usually fear rejection because they feel those around them have legitimate grounds to do it – that one hated body part. Because of this intense fear of rejection, they don't bother making an effort with others, convinced it will lead nowhere.

, Those with BDD and other similar issues often look to online dating in order to have a relationship. These individuals lack confidence in themselves to actually go out and look for a partner; they're afraid to make themselves vulnerable and put that body part they despise in the spotlight. They are much more comfortable through calls or online sources of interaction, able to hide behind a screen. Online dating is just a way to avoid real life interactions but yet still enjoy a relationship at the same time. Unfortunately, no relationship is stable, long-term, and fulfilling when it's behind a screen.


If you can, help them be social. Spend time with them in a tight-knit group of friends they may feel comfortable around. Try to slowly but surely introduce them to people that are trustworthy and non-judgmental.
A lot of times people completely disguise themselves over the Internet because they believe no one will love them. When they eventually find someone they really like, they think revealing their true identity to them would force that person to leave them immediately as the reality might not be that pretty. This leads to web of lies that the person with BDD can't help but weave. If you suspect your loved one is doing this, try talking to them about it calmly and reassuringly from a perspective of understanding. They may open up to you and come clean.

, A person with BDD may worry about his/her thin hair, pimples, hips, body shape, nose shape, eyes structure, wrinkles, or their complexion, either too pale, too dark, too freckly, or too pink. They may consider their face to be disproportional or asymmetrical. It could be about body odor, excessive facial hair – in other words, anything.


The preoccupation is usually specific, i.e. based on only one body part. But it can be vague, too. The person might think that some part of his body is deteriorating and is going to become worse, or could be obsessed with something that affects their entire body, like hair or moles.

, Because this person hates their body so much, they may end up detaching themselves from the situation and from who they really are just to deal with it. They may try to ignore any kind of confrontation with their mind to avoid thinking about the issue at all. This is a defense mechanism that their mind is using to deal with the pain. However, when relied on too heavily it can cause neuroses, leading to further mental issues.


Every time they look at their body, feelings of grievance arise, eventually affecting the stability of their mind. They try to ignore it and ignore it as there is still a part of them that doesn't want to feel this. It protects their ego, but the problem is still there.

, Sometimes the hatred of this part of their body is so bad that they just want it gone, whatever the cost. They feel like they can't be normal or wanted with that part attached to them, and they find it easy to start blaming their everyday failures on that part – all adding up to them wanting that part gone completely.


For instance, a woman who has a slight shudder in her leg might have the desire to completely amputate the whole leg and consider using a fake leg. A boy may deliberately cut his penis because he does not like to be with girls in a sexual way. These cases are, of course, of extreme body dysmorphics.

, With BDD, this person will likely feel that their skin is a burden. They'll want to get rid of it, but the devastating fact is that they cannot. As a result, they often feel the urge to hurt themselves. Help them try to resist this and realize it's just their BDD talking. Hurting themselves won't make the pain go away.


This is done to punish themselves because they think they have a bad body that deserves to be hurt. Each person does it differently. Some scratch their arms, others bite the skin under their nails, while others even get tattoos in an attempt to beautify their bodies.

, With BDD, this person will intensely obsess about their appearance and think about it for hours a day, from when they wake up to when they go to sleep. This obsession is disabling and makes it difficult to perform routine life functions normally. Continuously thinking about this perceived flaw makes concentrating on other aspects of life virtually impossible.


The preoccupation with the perceived defect causes significant impairment in all areas of life, from social and occupational to home life. They don't go out with friends, their work suffers because they can't focus, and at home, they spend their free time obsessing over the body part, trying to find someway to get rid of it.
If the BDD has progressed so far as to be debilitating, this is grounds for treatment. If you're close to this person, nudge them in the direction of therapy. While being self-conscious is a very human problem to have, BDD can be dangerous and life-threatening if left untreated.

, Body dysmorphic disorder shares many symptoms with other psychological disorders. Because of this similarity, it is often misdiagnosed or ignored. If you want to self-assess your loved one's symptoms, first pay attention to the aforementioned associated features. After that, look for a differential diagnosis given below to identify and distinguish between BDD and other associated or related disorders.


You have to pay attention to the analogy and dissimilarities between BDD and other disorders, especially depression. Sometimes one is mistaken for another and sometimes they go hand in hand.

, In today's world, virtually no one is totally happy with their body. Girls start dieting as pre-teens and boys are taught to workout to gain muscle as soon as they can throw a ball. In order to distinguish if this person has BDD versus a general unhappiness with part of their body, make sure they have most of the symptoms below:Frequent checking of defect, either directly or in mirrors
Severe scrutiny of defect using magnifiers, special lights
Excessive grooming behavior, make up etc.
May avoid mirrors altogether
Frequent changing of clothes
Requests for reassurance about defects
Reassurances increase anxiety
Comparison with others
Camouflaging of defect
Delusional thoughts about defected body part
Fear of defected body part being in danger
Fear of being mocked by others
Social isolation
Marital difficulties
Suicidal ideation
May receive several surgical treatments
May apply self-surgery

, This disorder, commonly known as OCD, is a psychological disorder that is likely to develop due to body dysmorphic disorder. Here's how it manifests:


Being extra conscious about the body provokes anxiety. The feeling of having something undesirable always attached to you makes you think about it more than normal – that's the obsession. The compulsion then, is to hide it. This is an urge that a person with BDD and OCD cannot stop.
Obsessions are persistent ideas, thoughts or feelings that are repeated again and again in order to relieve anxiety, but yet causes significant distress. This person finds themselves thinking the same idea for hours. However, they're likely aware that this thought or idea is the creation of their own mind and is not imposed by the outside world.
For instance, a person who does not like hands might keep his hands closed at all times or a person might keep looking in the mirror again and again as discussed previously.

, A person with an anxiety disorder shows restlessness, is easily fatigued, irritable, has muscle tension, and doesn't sleep well. They worry about routine life circumstances, finance, and health of family members, misfortune for family and have even minor, trivial concerns. Their focus of worry shifts from one problem to other. They may often tremble, shake, or have muscular pains. BDD is less generalized and does not shift.


The person with dysmorphophobia also shows persistent anxiety that may cause disturbed sleep. However, their focus of worry is the part of their body which is defected, according to their false perceptions. No other area of life is given such concern.
To differentiate the two, think about what they seem to worry about. Are the worries limited to this aspect of their appearance? If they have these physical symptoms and your answer to that question is yes, they may have BDD. However, if their worry is more general, it may point to an anxiety disorder.

, In BDD, avoiding social situations is similar to the behavior of some people with social anxiety disorder. It's easy to mistake the two, but here are the differences:


In social anxiety disorder, it's common to experience red face or blushing, shortness of breath, nausea, trembling or shaking, and a racing heart. With this disorder, the individual fears that others will judge them to be crazy, stupid or awkward. They'll try to avoid social situations as they fear being embarrassed for their trembling body or shaking hands.While in BDD, the person is not worried about their performance or the coming event. They just want to hide their perceived defects from others and therefore avoid social situations. They will not feel nausea and do not tremble. They won't find difficulty in speaking. They just don't want to be noticed for their ""ugliness.""

, In western society, girls are taught since birth to be smart and keep a slender body, which can sometimes be unhealthy and unreasonable. When they grow up, the peer pressure increases the demand for becoming attractive. Consequently they feel depressed and over conscious about their outlook. This can very easily lead to depression, be it chronic or episodic.


People with BDD are often misdiagnosed as having depression alone. If you can, ask your loved one why they feel depressed. Analyze your thoughts about the reason behind their depression. If the reason seems to be only their physical appearance, they may be suffering from BDD.

, Unfortunately, depression and BDD often are comorbid with each other. In this circumstance, the situation can get pretty serious as suicidal attempts may occur. They feel so deeply that this defect in their body isn't fixable and, therefore, nothing can be done to make them feel any better. The only way is out.


Ask them what makes you feel hopeless. What do they feel about themselves? The world? If they have negative ideas about the world and are disappointed by their life, including their looks, then they may have BDD along with depression.
While in depression, the individual feels their present, past and future is worthless. They have negative feelings about themselves and about the world, but are not concerned about their appearance or what others think about them. None of that matters because the world is so bleak. They may be aggressive or violent to let go of the aggravation and frustration you feel in the world.

, As mentioned earlier, people with body dysmorphic disorder feel unsatisfied with their body appearance. Unfortunately, the same is the case with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Excessive exercising occurs in both disorders. But in eating disorders, this exercising is aimed at losing weight only.


A person with an eating disorder worries about weight and the shape of their overall body, while a person with BDD is disturbed about a specific body part. With BDD alone, they are not worried about losing weight to look perfect.
With an eating disorder like bulimia or anorexia, they'll be excessively conscious about their body weight. Either they eat too little or vomit the food after eating it to avoid gaining weight.
With BDD, they might undergo plastic surgery to improve the shape of a certain part of the body. They are not interested in losing weight by taking laxatives, dieting, inducing vomiting or starving.

Become aware that you are pretending.,
Figure out why you pretend.,
Realize you don’t have to be perfect.,
Understand that people go through unhappy periods.",How to Quit Pretending to Be Happy All the Time1," Often you cannot face that you are not truly happy until you become self-aware. You may not realize you are pretending you are happy. To figure out if you are happy or just pretending, pay attention to yourself, your actions, and your thoughts.As you go through your days, find out how many times you actually feel happy. Be honest with yourself. If you don’t feel happy, admit that.
It may take you awhile to learn how to be observant of your behavior. That is okay. The more you pay attention to your feelings, and the more you are honest with yourself, the easier it will become.;
, As you work to stop pretending, you should figure out why you pretend to be happy. Is it so you won’t show weakness? Is it because you want others to see you as happy and successful? Are you trying to protect your family? Determining the reason you pretend can help you address any underlying problems and get to the real root of what’s causing your discontent.Analyze your actions. Who do you pretend to be happy around? How do you act?
After you realize these things, analyze why you want to pretend to be happy in these situations.
For example, you may pretend to be happy around your spouse and children because you don't want to disappoint them or worry them. You may smile, laugh, and hide things that upset you to protect them because you care about them.

, Many people think they have to be perfect and happy all the time. You don’t. No one is happy every day, and no one has a perfect life. Pretending to be happy to please others or hide your true feelings is a disservice to you.You should focus on being more authentic with your feelings. You don’t want to mope all the time, but you don’t have to pretend to be something you aren’t. You may discover that the less time you spend pretending, the happier you will be.
Remember that you will not hurt or disappoint your family or friends if you stop pretending you are happy. You are not protecting them by faking it; you are only hurting yourself. They will not stop caring about you if you are honest about how you feel.

, It is okay if you are unhappy. Everyone goes through times in their lives where they are not happy. This may be due to a change in circumstances, emotional upheaval, or something else. Accept that it’s okay to be unhappy at certain times.Some unhappy periods may last for weeks or months. However, if you are unhappy for longer than this, it may mean that you have a more serious problem.

Know yourself.,

Forgive yourself and your companions for shortcomings.,
Tailor your work or study approach to yourself.,
Remember that success often depends as much on persistence and determination as on skill or talent, and that skills and talent require a lot of practice to refine.

,
Look for safe outlets for frustrations and negative emotions.,
Focus on solutions and resolutions rather than problems.",How to Stay Calm in an Unfamiliar Situation," Figure out what you enjoy and what you are good at. Figure out what you find difficult. We can't always avoid difficult or unpleasant tasks, but often we have the freedom to choose.;
, Being lazy and snuggling up with a book by the fire will not get the job done. Go out and do some work. It will activate and energize your brain cells. Often a little progress, even if it is tentative or experimental, can lead in to the next steps.

, If you find yourself getting behind, feel overly tired, or begin to get upset, it's time to take a step back. Take a good look at what is going wrong and work to correct the problem.


Allow ample time. If you are learning as you go, you may need more time still.
Get help. If a task is beyond you, look for assistance, instruction, advice, or other resources. Having a companion around can help with progress or simply keep you focused and motivated.
Take a break if you need one. Get enough sleep.
Break up large tasks into manageable pieces, and identify a specific next step.
Seek or create a suitable and supportive environment for your work. Do you need company or background noise or quiet to focus? Do you have the right supplies on hand?

, You can work to improve or work around your weaknesses, but giving in to perfectionism is a good way to feel terrible and take forever to finish.

, Identify your learning style and your working style. Try different things and go with what works best for you in a given context.

,, Instead of making a scene or taking it out on someone, try writing about it and then deleting or burning the letter. Once you have given vent to the emotions, look for realistic solutions. Try nonviolent communication approaches if your frustration stems from interactions with others.

, While clearly stating and defining a problem can often serve as a helpful first step, thinking through to the resolution or completion will help to lift your spirits and keep you focused on your goals.

"
Avoid reacting defensively.,
Stay focused on the present.,
Consider using humor to defuse the situation.,
Address the comments directly.,
Use 'I' statements.,
Maintain your composure.,
Separate yourself from passive-aggressive people when possible.,
Set consequences for passive aggressive behavior.,
Accept that passive-aggressive people may not change their actions.",How to Respond to Passive Aggressive Comments," When someone makes a passive aggressive comment, you may feel the need to defend yourself, or make accusations about them. Getting upset will likely do little good to change their habits.Don’t fall into their trap of getting annoyed. Passive aggressive people act in under-handed ways to get your attention, because they lack maturity in communication.
Act like what they said didn’t bother you instead. Relaxation techniques can help you control your impulses in these situations. Take a couple deep breaths, count to 5, or even smile to keep yourself from responding with anger. Then, respond with something like, ""How about we work together on this or figure what we can both do to make this better?"";
, After someone makes a snide or passive-aggressive comment, you may feel like bringing up the past. You may want to compare the current situation to past transgressions that they made. This will likely just lead to more arguments and little change.Keep the issues in the present. For example, if the current passive-aggressive comment is about the way you clean the dishes, don't start talking about their recurring lack of cleanliness around the house.
Staying focused in the here-and-now will also help to avoid festering problems. Try finding peace with the situation in the present to prevent grudges later on.

, This may not work on all situations, so be careful in how you use humor. You might more appropriately use it with a friend or colleague rather than a boss or authority figure.For example, let’s say that you pass by a co-worker at work and say, “Hi, how’s it going?” Maybe they’ve ignored you in the past or seem to be avoidant. You could respond back to their lack of acknowledgment by saying, “That good, huh?” with a smile.
Use humor as an ice-breaker to help make others feel more comfortable and less aggressive.

, While you may want to ignore what they said and move on, if it bothers you, then it’s important to acknowledge this. Avoid letting the comment go by and then possibly letting it bother you over time. Speak up for yourself.You might also try sleeping on it before you address the comment. If it's still bothering you the next day, then it may be worth addressing. Minor, irrelevant issues will likely no longer be of concern to you the following day.
Use tact and respect when addressing their comments. Even if they were disrespectful to you, don’t reduce yourself to their level. Consider saying, ""I sense that you're annoyed with something. Can we talk about this?""
Be clear and concise about how their comment affected you, and why it may be an issue for you. Sometime others don’t realize how their comments are negatively affecting others. Consider saying, ""I'm not sure if what your intentions were with that comment, but I felt hurt when you said that.""

, Avoid responding to how they are acting with statements use the word “you” and make them seem like the problem. You don’t want to come off as accusing them, as they will likely to see this as more reason that they’re the victim. Instead, focus on how their comments impact you with “I” statements.For example, let’s say a concerned family member make a passive-aggressive comment about your poor diet or health. Consider saying, “I feel sad about what was said about my health. I am trying to stay healthy, and continue to make efforts to change.”
Consider instead using statements that use the words ""we” and “our” to show inclusiveness rather than focusing on blame. However, keep in mind that this can sound condescending when talking one-on-one with someone. This could be helpful when addressing a team at work after someone makes a passive aggressive comment. For example, say, ""I understand your comments and concerns. When we make statements like this, we face greater challenges in our team work. Let's come together and identify solutions in this situation.""

, Demonstrate through your body language that their comments are not impacting you. Display a calm, cool, and powerful presence that is not threatening but also not passive.Sit quietly, nod, and maintain eye contact. Show that you understand what’s going on, and that their comments aren’t affecting you.
Sit high in your chair or keep a firm stance if standing.

, Sometimes the best way to deal with passive-aggressive comments is to avoid the people who make those comments whenever possible. While some people like close family members or co-workers may be unavoidable, you may need to avoid them for your own well-being. However, if this is not possible, then consider limiting your interactions with those who have little to offer except negativity.You may need to discuss this with your therapist to determine what is best for you.


Reconsider interactions with friends or friends of friends who undermine you. Some passive-aggressive people may not be worth your time.
Decline outings or events over time, and consider looking for other friends or people who make you feel more welcome.

, Particularly in a workplace setting or when dealing with frustrating relatives, you may need to set consequences that guide them toward collaboration rather than resistance. When well-articulated, consequences can help passive-aggressive people to rethink about their behavior.For example, if you’re dealing with a co-worker who is disinterested in working on a team project that needs to be completed, address the possible consequences of inaction and the importance of teamwork.
Consider offering consequences that are less threatening and more collaborative. Consider saying, “I see that this is a frustrating situation. But each member of the team relies on each other to do our work. You and I, we’re all part of team. If we can’t meet our deadline, there are consequences for this. Let’s help each other so that none of us faces those repercussions.”

, While confronting someone about their comments in the most direct and assertive approach, avoid assuming that they will change because of this. Some people may continue to disregard your statements or consequences.Focus on what you can control rather than what you can’t. Don’t get bogged down by other people’s misery or unhappiness with life or work.
Be realistic that some interactions with negative or passive-aggressive people are unavoidable. Be strong and confident that you can get through this.

Following a passion allows you to work out negative emotions in a healthy, productive way., Let someone else do the work of catching and keeping your attention. Rent your favorite movie to watch at home, or see what's on at your local cinema. Visit a gallery or sit in a jazz club.

Talk to someone about your day.,
Ask someone about their day.,
Meet up with family, friends, or coworkers.,
Take comfort from touch.",How to Stay Tough After a Hard Day3," Don't be afraid to ask for advice. Good friends are always happy to share their thoughts, or just be there to listen.


If you feel uncomfortable talking to someone in person, you may want to reach out to an online community forum or support group. These are people who share common concerns or challenges, such as battling cancer or struggling with smoking, so they may be able to sympathize., You may feel less alone if you hear about the challenges faced by others on a daily basis. Ask them to provide at least one example of a coping strategy that they use to get through a difficult day.

Talk to yourself.,
Write a list of the positives.,
Identify future goals.",How to Stay Tough After a Hard Day4," You don't have to do this out loud, but it can be helpful! Talk about the day you had and go over everything that has happened. Try to identify a few moments that went well, and give yourself credit for getting through the day.


Self-talk can actually increase memory retention and improve your IQ as well. However, it must be positive in nature to show these benefits., It may be hard to think of these at first, but remember that even the smallest positives are still positives! Even something as basic as a smile can be the best part of your day.

They also provide a creative product that you can be proud of., Move past the present day and look toward the next day, week, and year.

Imagine what your goals will feel like for all of your senses. What will you feel, see, taste at these moments? Imagining engaging all of your senses in these moments will make your goals feel more tangible."

Look for signs of blame.,
Determine if you are always calling others to complain.,
Identify self-loathing.,
Decide if you are hung up by past mistakes.,
Spot comparisons.,
Identify an external locus of control.,
Know legitimate reasons for feeling like a victim.",How to Spot Signs of Victim Mentality1," A major indicator of the victim mentality is the tendency to place blame on outside sources for the state you are in. Maybe you blame your spouse because you stopped going out with friends and ended up feeling socially isolated. Maybe you blame your parents for not exposing you to certain opportunities in life that would ensure your future success.


No matter where blame is directed, it’s essentially useless. When you blame others, you give them power over your life instead of taking your destiny into your own hands. What’s more, you also push people away in the process.;
, Do you spend most days of the week lamenting to any who will listen about your problems or inadequacies? Do you notice friends slowly not taking your phone calls or people avoiding you at work? Even the best relationships have trouble surviving when one person always has something bad to share.


Complaining can be a tempting behavior and nonstop venting may seem to make you feel good on the surface. However, constant complaining sends the message to your brain to look for the negative, which only makes you feel worse in the long run., Feeling inadequate and not good enough is at the core of the victim mentality. A self-loather often views him/herself negatively and is always nervously waiting for others to spot all their inadequacies.


This kind of person is terribly hard to be in a relationship with because they cannot accept praise or compliments. Someone else may say “Wow, you did a great job on this project!” and the person pushes away the compliment with “Oh, no it was Tommy who did all the work.”
One way to stop self-loathing is to accept the reality that how you see yourself isn’t the only or right way for you to be. Recognize that others' perceptions of you may be different, but, at least to them, they may also be accurate., Another clear sign of being a victim is living in the past. You may constantly reflect back on your earlier years and regret decisions or actions that you didn’t take. Dwelling in the past is pointless since you can never go back there. Do you find yourself falling into the shoulda, woulda, coulda trap? If so, you must recognize that you are wasting time today focusing on what’s already done. Instead turn to the present and see what you steps you can take to improve from here.

, If you find yourself always examining the lives of friends, family, or other acquaintances and thinking about how great they have it, you are keeping yourself stuck in misery and failure. Theodore Roosevelt argued that “comparison is the thief of joy” because it’s virtually impossible to be content with your own life when you are always busy measuring yourself up to others.


In some instances, comparisons can spark competition to improve yourself. For example, you notice that a coworker is well on his way to earning a promotion, you may then be inspired to work equally as hard.Yet, if it is not used wisely and carefully, it can backfire and leave you miserable. Keep a careful watch on your comparing nature, and remind yourself that even people that seem to have it all together also deal with trials and tribulations just like you.

, Having an internal locus of control means that you feel like you can influence the outcome of your own situation. However, having an external locus of control means that you feel like you cannot influence the outcome of your situation because the situation controls you. This is a sign of victim mentality.For example, if your boss is unsatisfied with your performance and gives you a negative review, then you might think to yourself, ""He is impossible to please. Guess I am going to get fired."" This would indicate an external locus of control and a victim mentality.
On the other hand, someone who has an internal locus of control might respond to a negative performance review more proactively, such as by thinking, ""Okay, that sucked, but what can I do to improve my performance, ensure that my boss is happy, and secure my job?""
Work on developing your sense of control over your life circumstances and events to overcome this aspect of victim mentality.

, In general, taking on a victim mentality is unhealthy for you personally and socially. However, there are some situations when feeling like a victim is warranted, particularly in situations when you have been harmed physically or emotionally.


For instance, almost anyone is bound to feel sorry for themselves after being betrayed or cheated on by a lover. Or, after having a serious car accident that results in you having to use a wheelchair.
In spite of these circumstances, it's still important for you not to wallow in self-pity or ruminate about how bad your situation is.Taking the positive route is an overall healthier and more adaptive approach and can improve your self-esteem in the long run.

, Some people may resort to eating fattening snacks, seeking instant gratification, or procrastinating as a way to cope with a bad mood.In some cases, individuals may become aggressive or violent as a way to make themselves feel better.However, these coping mechanisms often fall short of really fixing your mood and can lead to unwanted consequences.


Sometimes people will eat in order to regulate their emotions because eating leads to increased endorphins in the brain.However, this is troublesome and can lead to overeating, gaining weight, and having an unhealthy diet. Avoid eating too much comfort food. Limit yourself to one treat and stop there. Remind yourself that eating healthy will ultimately make you feel better, not eating junk food.

Consider your need for contact and attention.,
Evaluate how much jealousy consumes your thoughts.,
Think about your own sense of self worth.,
Consider your personal history.",How to Recognize Abnormal Jealousy in Yourself1," If you're abnormally jealous, this may manifest itself in a high need for contact and attention. You may feel jealous of your romantic partner, worrying what he or she is doing without you. You may also feel jealous of friends and family members, worrying they don't need or want you. If you need a lot of reassurance and attention from the people in your life, your jealousy may be abnormal.When people aren't around, do you text or call frequently? If your partner is out with friends, do you feel the need to check in on him or her regularly? If your friends do not text you back, do you get angry or frustrated?
If you don't receive contact as quickly as you would like, do you panic or become angry?
Healthy people may experience jealousy or feelings of insecurity when they're not receiving as much contact or attention as they want. However, abnormal jealousy is all consuming. If you panic or become angry easily due to lack of contact, you may be abnormally jealous.;
, Most people, while they may occasionally feel jealous or left out, will eventually find a way to distract themselves. The thoughts cease and they begin to relax. If you cannot shift your focus away from jealous thoughts, your feelings of jealousy may be abnormal.It may be helpful to consider how much time you spend consumed with jealousy. If your jealous thoughts are taking up the bulk of your time, to the point you're not completing tasks in a timely fashion, your jealousy may be abnormal.

, Oftentimes, abnormal jealousy is defined as the ability to feel jealous even in a healthy relationship. This type of jealousy may stem from your own issues. Think about your own self esteem.Have you struggled with feelings of worthlessness in the past? Do you not feel good about yourself on most days of the week?

Take responsibility.,
Learn to forgive.,
Practice gratitude.,
Become a calculated risk-taker.,
Embrace criticism and rejection.,
Develop your self-efficacy.",How to Spot Signs of Victim Mentality2," Take ownership of your problems instead of blaming someone else for every bad thing that happens to you. When you learn to take responsibility for the circumstances in your life, you have a greater chance of taking action to resolve negative situations.Plus, if you give yourself credit for the good things that do happen, you start to believe that opportunities are possible. Eventually, you start to seek them out.


Start taking personal responsibility for your life. Empower yourself by believing that, whether negative or positive, you are responsible for your choices and behavior. And, with this acceptance, you can start taking the necessary steps to shape your life to fit your dreams.

, A person who is engulfed in the victim mentality may hold on to wrongdoing or betrayals much longer than others. Unfortunately, staying stuck in anger, resentment, or pain only brings a cloud of doom over your own life. As the old saying from Buddha goes, “Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.”Forgiveness is a requirement in order to overcome your victim mentality and start making positive changes in your life.


Keep in mind that forgiveness does not mean that you are condoning or even forgetting past wrongs that were done to you. Instead view it as a new lease on life. When you forgive, you release yourself from the pain and choose to move forward.
When forgiving, try the following strategies.Think about the upsetting event or betrayal. Try to gain acceptance that it happened to you, and possibly changed you. Consider all the ways you have grown since the event. What did the situation teach you about yourself?
Next, think about the person(s) involved. Remember that he or she is human and, therefore, flawed. Try to look at things from the other person’s perspective. What need was he or she trying fulfill when they hurt you?
Now, let it go. Take a deep, cleansing breath, releasing the pain and hurt and breathing in hope and forgiveness. You can also perform a ritual to help you forgive. Maybe you can write your thoughts down in a letter and rip it to shreds or light it on fire. You don’t have to involve the other person at all if you don’t want. This practice is for you.

, Having a grateful spirit is the antidote to a victim mentality. With this kind of thinking, a person is generally focused on what’s wrong. Gratitude forces you to focus on what’s right.


Spend a few minutes each day writing in a gratitude journal. You can write about some people, places or things that you are thankful for. Or, you can brainstorm situations that could have been worse than what they were. Just spend some time looking on the bright side of your life. Over time, you will start to feel more positive., One downside to being stuck in the victim role is that a person is less likely to take chances that can lead to future success. A part of feeling regret about the past comes from being too safe in your choices and decisions. While you cannot change the circumstances of the past, you can make strides to be more brave and courageous in the future.


Get out of the victim rut by overcoming your tendency to play it safe. Think to yourself: “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?” “Will I regret not taking a chance in this area of my life?” “Is my fear causing me to over-estimate the risk and under-estimate my own abilities?Depending on how you answer these questions, sit down and put a plan together of SMART goals and steps you can take to make wise and informed risks.

, Taking both criticism and rejection personally has kept you in a victim mentality for far too long. In order to move beyond this impaired frame of thinking, you must boldly throw yourself in the path of negative feedback. Avoiding criticism and rejection is quite similar to avoiding risk; you play it safe and fail to challenge yourself because you fear the consequences.


It’s important to keep in mind that neither criticism nor rejection are about you. Another person’s perceptions of you is about them. You have the freedom to consider any feedback you get and whether or not it can serve your future. If it does, find a way to apply it. If it doesn’t, shake it off and keep going.

, Self-efficacy is the sense that you can influence your situation and that you have the ability to accomplish the goals you set. If you do not feel like you can do these things, then it might be beneficial for you to work on your self-efficacy. Some things that might help you include:Focusing on small goals and achievements. Setting big goals and only acknowledging major achievements may reduce your sense of self-efficacy. Instead, focus on setting small manageable goals and celebrate even small success. For example, you might set a goal to exercise for 30 minutes on four days of the week. After each workout, give yourself a pat on the back to celebrate the success.

Thinking back to times when you were successful. Reflecting on times when you succeeded at something can also help to increase your self-efficacy. For example, you might reflect on a time when you scored the winning point for your team, or when you got a high score on an exam.

Looking up to someone who is self-efficacious. Finding a positive role model can also be a good way to build self-efficacy. Try to find someone who has accomplished the things that they wanted to, such as earning a degree, being successful in a career, or losing weight. Allow yourself to admire that person and even model your own behaviors on theirs.

Resist giving the victim the desired attention or sympathy.,
Know that it’s not your responsibility to “fix” them.,
Set clear limits.",How to Spot Signs of Victim Mentality3," A huge part of what keeps people stuck in the victim mentality is the secondary gains they receive from having this outlook.Complaining, self-loathing, and comparing can all grant the person with affection, attention, or offers of help from others. This person may not even be consciously aware of their desire for sympathy, but it’s feeding and reinforcing the behavior.


To cope with a victim in your life, you must learn to starve them. Simply stop rewarding this person with the benefits of this miserable attitude.
Perhaps you used to dedicate hours showing concern to a relentlessly complaining friend. Rather you should be clear and succinct that you will not play into the behavior. You could say “I’m sorry to hear that…” and promptly change the subject. Or, you could challenge the person to take action by asking “So, what are you going to do about it?”

, Just because a friend or family member isn't taking responsibility for his or her own actions, that does not give you reason to shoulder that responsibility. You cannot “fix” this person or resolve their issues for them.


Chances are, you may be attracted to several victims in your life, especially if you like giving advice or resolving other people’s problems. Know that this savior complex is unhealthy for both you and the other person. Seek professional counseling to get to the bottom of your unhealthy need to enable others., When it comes to befriending a victim, your entire life may end up revolving around this other person. In order to help your loved one as best you can, you need to set boundaries to what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable.Learn how to say “no” when the other person’s requests or interruptions are too disruptive to your life.
Be clear about when they can and cannot reach out to you (e.g. refrain from contacting you at work, at school, or late at night).

Change your thinking.,
Problem-Solve.,
Use relaxation techniques.",How to Shake off a Bad Mood2," Suppressing your emotions or trying to avoid them can lead to increased bad moods.Therefore, it is important to process and release your emotions so that they do not build and become more of a problem.


Cry. If you feel like crying, cry your heart out. Sometimes tears can be the most healing if you are feeling emotional.
Write in a journal. Expressive writing is a great way to put your feelings out there and release them. Write about how you feel and what it feels like in your body (tense, heart pounding etc.). Write about why you feel that way and what you’d like to say to someone you are upset with. You could even write a poem if that is something you are interested in.
Avoid shouting and screaming if you are angry. This is a form of aggression and can cause unwanted social consequences like your neighbors calling the police. Instead, hit a pillow or scream into it. This way, you can’t harm yourself and it won’t harm or bother anyone else. Other ways to deal with anger are physical exercise, martial arts, dancing, and boxing.

, People that don’t believe they have control over a bad mood may engage in negative ways of coping such as overeating, eating junk food, or doing things that are unsafe.Believe that you have control over your mood, because you do. You can change your thoughts, which have a direct effect on your emotions.Think of your bad mood as information.Your feelings are telling you that something is wrong. You are reacting to a situation that is negative. Try to understand and analyze what it is you are reacting to and think logically about it.
Try positive self-talk. This is a form of managing your thoughts where you say or thinking positive things such as, “I can do this. I can get through this.”This can be helpful and encouraging when you are suffering from a negative mood.
Think something that will improve your mood instead of negative thoughts that might maintain your bad mood.For example, if you are in a bad mood because your friend didn’t call you back and you’re thinking, “She’s avoiding me,” change this thought to something more realistic. One way to do this is to think of an alternative thought like, “Maybe she is just busy and can’t get to the phone. I don’t think she would intentionally avoid me.” This technique of reappraising your thoughts does wonder for improving moods., Using problem-solving skills can help you change the situation, which can help lift your mood.First identify the problem.
Next, come up with some possible solutions.
Pick the best solution and try it.
If that solution doesn’t work, try another solution, and so on.
If you don’t get it completely solved, at least you are distracted from your bad mood for a period of time while you are thinking logically.

, Deep breathing is one very common and useful relaxation technique. Try practicing deep breathing by blowing one large bubble out of a bubble-blowing kit (bubbles and wand). This requires that you take a deep breath in and let that breath out slowly and steadily as the bubble fills up in the wand.

Examine abstract concepts that trigger jealousy.,
Consider whether you push for premature commitments.,
Think about situations that make you jealous.,
Reflect on whether your jealousy has impaired relationships.,
Examine expectations.",How to Recognize Abnormal Jealousy in Yourself2," Jealousy is often abnormal when it comes in response to something abstract. For example, you may get jealous of your partner's aspirations, even before your partner achieves these goals. You may worry that your partner will abandon you or find someone better if they achieve their dreams. If you frequently get jealous over people's ambitions, or other abstract concepts, you may be experiencing abnormal jealousy., If you're abnormally jealous, you may seek out commitment soon to quell feelings of insecurity. You may feel the need to lock a friendship or relationship down to try and combat jealousy.With romantic relationships, how soon do you push for commitment? Do you want to move fast right away? Do you find yourself pushing your romantic partners to move in or make future plans early on in the relationship?
With friends, you may want to become best friends right away. You may want to hang out every day or text constantly, despite the fact you've just met this person. You may have difficulty accepting that it takes awhile to develop an intimate connection with someone.

, Jealousy is normal in some situations. For example, most people would feel jealous if they saw on Facebook that a friend threw a party without inviting them. However, abnormal jealousy occurs in many situations that are innocuous and may not warrant a jealous response.You may have jealous thoughts when you're having a difficult day, as this may affect your self esteem. You may also get jealous if a friend or romantic partner is away for work or a vacation without you. You may also get jealous at social events if a friend or partner is making conversation with others.
Due to this extreme jealousy, you may become hyper vigilant of others. This means you feel a need to monitor others behaviors to make sure you're not being forgotten or abandoned. For example, you may watch your partner talking to other people at a party. Instead of socializing yourself, you may trail your partner the entire time to make sure he or she is not flirting with others.

, Jealousy can cause a major rift in any relationship. If you've had a lot of friends and romantic partners distance themselves from you, your jealousy may be to blame. In the past, you may have even been confronted about your jealousy.

, If you're abnormally jealous, you may have extremely high expectations of relationships. Usually, these expectations are based around the insecurity that often drives jealousy. You may feel that the relationship would feel more secure if certain expectations were met.If you're dating someone, you may think that person should never be attracted to others. You may also believe you do not have anything to offer another person, which can trigger the sense your partner will leave you. You may be extremely fearful of your partner's past relationships, as you worry they're a threat to your security. You may not want your partner to be friends with his or her exes.
You may also feel you can force your partner to behave the way you want. If you feel neglected or abandon, you may pout or shut down emotionally. You may expect your partner to feel sorry for you and reassure you, which is not reasonable. Behaving in this way is manipulative, and will drive your partner away.

Work on letting go.,
Find healthy ways to manage your emotions.,
See a therapist.,
Look into your underlying fears.,
Avoid acting on jealous feelings.",How to Recognize Abnormal Jealousy in Yourself3," If you want to address your jealousy, take steps to consciously let it go. This can be hard, at first, as abnormal jealousy is often all consuming. Jealousy is toxic to relationships. It's important you learn to manage it better.When you find yourself feeling jealous, try to think to yourself, ""I need to let this go."" Before reacting or lashing out at another person, pause.
Instead of reacting, take a deep breath. It can also help to imagine the jealousy flowing through you and then being released in the air.

, People who are abnormally jealous may struggle deeply to control emotions. You may react instantly to feelings of fear or anger spurred by jealous thoughts. Work on being mindful of your emotions, and allowing yourself to experience them without reacting in a negative manner.Practice mindfulness. This is where you tune into your body, taking your mind off of troublesome thoughts. When you're feeling angry or sad, pay attention to your breathing and your sensations. If you have bad thoughts coming in, acknowledge them and let them go.
It's okay to talk about feelings of jealousy. In a healthy relationship, you should be able to tell your partner how you feel. Wait until you calm down, however. When you've had time to think, then you can address how you feel in a respectful manner. Instead of saying something like, ""Why didn't you answer my last text?"" you can try something like, ""I felt a little stressed when you didn't answer my last text."" You should also explain any underlying issues that fuel your jealousy. For example, if you were abandoned by a parent as a child, this may contribute to feelings of jealousy in the present. The more of your history your partner understands, the more patient he or she will be with you.

, If you're experiencing abnormal jealousy, it's important to see a therapist to work on ways to manage. Jealousy can damage relationships over time, so it needs to be curbed if you want to live a healthy and happy life. A qualified therapist can help you work through the issues driving your jealousy and help you find healthier ways to cope.


You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral. You can also go through your insurance provider by finding a list of therapists covered in your network.
If you are a college student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

, What causes your jealousy? Sometimes, you can better address irrational thoughts by understanding their cause.When you're feeling jealous, ask yourself why. Are you worried your partner will leave you? Have you been cheated on or abandon in past relationships? If so, this may be why you feel jealous easily. Try to understand that is not rational, and your current relationship is different than past experiences.
Identify moments where you're most likely to get jealous. For example, you may respond with jealousy going into a social situation. If this is the case, try to prep yourself ahead of time. Remind yourself about the root causes of your jealousy. This can help you see how jealousy is irrational.

, While you may not be able to completely control your emotions, you can control your actions. If you're feeling jealous, try not to react. For example, your partner may be busy at a social event and he or she may not have time to text you back. Do not react by calling and texting incessantly. Instead, do something to distract yourself.It can be very difficult to control your actions at first, especially if you're a chronically jealous person. This is where seeing a therapist can help. A therapist can help you manage your emotions so they do not affect your actions.

Learn to take a calming breath before and after doing each exercise.,
The exercises are best spread throughout the day.,
Learn and practice the exercises.,
Be grateful for all you have been given--life, others to love, a beautiful world, the many good things in this life.,
Remember The Mission.,
Be with beauty.,
Move your body.,
Remember someone who cared.,
Practice kindness.,
Laugh, play, have some fun.,
Create.,
Indulge in a healthy pleasure.,
Forgive another.,
Forgive yourself.,Be grateful yet again.",How to Practice a Daily Emotional Fitness Training Program," This helps you practice the exercise with full awareness. You take a calming breath by breathing in to a slow count of five, holding your breath for another count of five and then breathing out to final slow count of five. Breathe normally as you do the exercise and when you have completed the exercise, take another calming breath before going on about your day.

, The first three can be done before getting out of bed in the morning, the last three before falling asleep. The others can be spaced out during the day. Some people cycle through the majority of the exercises several times a day.

, Here they are:

,;
, Our purpose in this life is to bring peace and harmony to this world. That is The Mission. Doing what you can to make your part of the world more peaceful is your mission. Your mission is also to bring all your acts in line with The Mission.

, There is beauty all around if only we take the time to see and be with it. The more deeply you examine something, the more beauty you will find. Watch a bird soar, the clouds build. See the beauty in the human face. Listen to music that lifts your soul. Find flowers on the ghetto windowsill.

, This is the only one of two exercises that take more than a few minutes to practice. It is also one of the most important for your overall health. With your doctor's approval, find safe ways to increase your heart rate and strengthen your muscles for 20 to 30 minutes daily. It can be done in 10 minute sessions. Climb stairs, walk, dance, jog, jump rope, play a team sport, lift weights.

, Not one of us would be alive, if we had not had caring people in our lives. This does not mean we have not also had to deal with those who didn't care or who were abusive. Nor does it mean those who cared where always caring. Unfortunately, much of the media focuses us on remembering the bad; not healthy. It is far better to remember the caring in doing so to feel once again the power of caring.

, Practice random acts and planned acts of kindness. The smallest act--saying thank you to a sales clerk, giving your seat to another, complementing a stranger, smiling and greeting those you meet are small acts that move the world toward peace. Do not expect any thing in return. Kindness is its own reward.

, Have a funny face contest with a child, watch a funny movie or tv show, read the comics, tell silly jokes. Play childish games and grown up games, but play only for the fun of it. Fun and laughter help us stay strong.

, Much of what we do does not yield concrete rewards. Exercising your creativity daily does. You can exercise your creativity by singing a song, drawing, painting, knitting, crocheting, braiding, cooking, baking, planting or tending a garden, writing a poem or doing any one of a hundred other things to be creative. You do not have to finish a project. One row of knitting adds up in time to a sweater. Ten minutes of writing can become a novel.

, One piece of chocolate. A cup of tea. A hand massage. A warm bath. Anything that is for you, is healthy, and is an indulgence.

, Forgiveness might mean only making a conscious decision not to seek revenge. Depending on the situation it might mean going on with the relationship; it might mean letting the relationship go. Anger, hardness of heart and thoughts of revenge harm you, not the one who hurt you.

, We all do some wrong. We all need to be forgiven. It starts in our own hearts. If we have hurt another, plan how to make amends. Work daily toward being a more caring person. No one is perfect, everyone needs forgiveness, everyone can seek to do better.

Learn something new.,
Volunteer in your community.,
Ask for an introduction.,
Believe in yourself.",How to Prevent Feelings of Isolation and Loneliness1," You can prevent feelings of isolation and loneliness if you expand your social network. One way to do this is to open yourself and learn a new skill or topic.Taking classes or lessons gives you the opportunity to meet people that you might not meet otherwise. It can also keep you from feeling alone and unconnected to others.


For example, take a foreign language class to expose yourself to different cultures and to interact with other people.
Try something active like a team sport. This will give you the chance to get some physical activity and widen your social circle.;
, This is a way to give back and boost your community as well as support causes you care about. It also helps prevent you from feeling isolated. This is because it gives you the chance to meet people with similar interests and concerns and meet people in your community.Talk to leaders in the community like your religious leader, coach, or a school counselor about ways that you can volunteer. For example, “You might say, I’d like to volunteer, do you have any suggestions?”
When possible, volunteer to do things that will allow you to interact with other people. For example, instead of volunteering to stuff envelopes, you might volunteer to meet visitors at an event.

, One way that you can connect with others and prevent feelings of isolation is to ask someone close to you to introduce you to new people.Having a mutual friend introduce you to others can help make meeting people less awkward for you.


For example, you might tell your sister, “When we go to the party tonight, would you mind introducing me to a few people since I won’t know anyone?”
Or for instance, if you are starting a new job you might ask your HR representative or supervisor to introduce you to key people you may need to know.

, In order for you to prevent feelings of isolation and expand your social network, you’ll have to believe that you can meet new people. Believing in yourself will give you the confidence you need to introduce yourself to others and widen your circle of friends.When you meet new people, remind yourself that you are a great person who is capable of making new friends.

Give yourself a daily compliment. For instance, when you’re getting dressed in the morning, you could tell yourself, “I’m a great person and I’m going to have a great day with the people around me.”

Position your mouth.,
Add some color.,
Plump your lips.,
Practice seductive body language.,
Have the right attitude.,
Pose properly.",How to Pout1," If you want a subtle, sultry pout for your next photo, try parting your lips and sticking your bottom lip out just a little. You may want to practice in the mirror first because it's easy to overdo it and end up looking like a fish!To get your mouth position right for a photo, try saying the word “blue."" It will force your lips forward into a pout. Models often use this tip during photo shoots.
You may want to complement the pouting look with a slightly squinting eye as well.It can take some practice to look seductive, so look at yourself in the mirror and make sure you don't look angry or sad.;
, Nothing brings more pizzazz to your pout than some lipstick! Make sure to choose the right shade for your skin tone and for the occasion. In general, women with warmer complexions should wear shades with yellow or orange undertones, while women with cooler complexions should wear shades with blue undertones. Choose a more neutral shade for the daytime and a more dramatic shade for evening.To help make your lipstick last longer, use a primer. If you don't have one, dab some concealer or foundation on your lips before you apply your lipstick., The size and shape of your lips is also very important. If you're not happy with the way your pout looks, there are some simple ways to make your lips look bigger with makeup.


Try using a plumping lip gloss or lipstick. These products work by increasing the blood flow to your lips, causing them to temporarily swell slightly.For a more dramatic look, try over lining your lips. To do this, trace around your lips with a lip liner pencil, extending a bit beyond the natural lip line in the middles, but not at the corners. Then fill in with a lipstick that is the same color as the lip liner., If you want to look seductive, there's more to it than just your facial expression. If you're taking to someone, try making extended eye contact and gently touching the person every so often. Also make sure to stand up straight and keep your arms uncrossed to show that you are open to others., To complete your seductive look, make sure to act the part. You will need to be cheerful and playful. It helps to raise your eyebrows, laugh, and maybe even break your pout on occasion by smiling or biting your lower lip in a flirty way., If you want to take a great pouty picture, you will need to make sure that the rest of your body is positioned perfectly as well. To look more photogenic, try extending your chin a bit and positioning your face and body at a slight angle. You should also be conscious of your posture, your hands, and your hair.

Get to know yourself.,
Develop hobbies.,
Use tech in moderation.",How to Prevent Feelings of Isolation and Loneliness2," There will be times that you can’t be around other people for some reason or another. Perhaps you are sick and don’t want to get others sick or maybe you are spending a weekday at home while everyone else is at school or at work. You can handle these times and prevent feeling isolated or lonely if you use the time as an opportunity to get to know yourself better.Make a list of all the things you want to do in life. You might surprise yourself by some of the things you want to experience. For example, you may think about it and realize you want to learn fencing.
Spend some time meditating. This is a great way to reduce stress, improve your focus and concentration, and allow you to explore your thoughts and emotions.

, Instead of allowing feelings of isolation and loneliness to overcome you, you can enjoy your time alone by using it to explore and develop some of your hobbies and interests. When you are doing things you enjoy and find interesting, you may be less likely to feel that you aren’t connected to others.


Make a list of hobbies or activities that you have been wanting to try. Include group activities, but also include solo activities like gardening, writing poetry, painting, or blogging.

, Social networking and other uses of technology can help you prevent feeling isolated and lonely, but logging in all the time can also prevent you from forming true connections with people.Use technology as a way to connect with people and to keep in touch when you can’t see each other in person, but don’t let it become a substitute for face-to-face contact.


For example, joining online groups and forums is a good way to meet other people. Be careful, though, with the information that you share over the internet with people that you don’t know in person.
Instead of emailing or texting your friend, give them a call, do a video conference, or better yet, make plans to spend time together.

"
"
Be the first to make contact.,
Talk openly.,
Listen actively.,
Recognize when isolation is bullying.",How to Prevent Feelings of Isolation and Loneliness3," Friendships are a ‘two-way street’. Sometimes your friends will reach out to you first, and sometimes you need to be the one to reach out. Being willing to reach out to others instead of always waiting on someone to reach out to you will help you avoid feeling lonely and isolated.It also lets the people that you care about know that you are thinking about them and want them to be a part of your life.


Call your friends and family members every few days to see how they are doing and what is going on in their life.
Instead of waiting on a friend to ask you to hang out, you might call them and say, “Hey! Do you want to hang out this weekend?

, One reason that people feel isolated and lonely is because they don’t feel that they have made true connections with other people. You may be surrounded by people, but still feel alone if you don’t think anyone understands you. You can prevent these feelings if you open up and let people get close to you.Talk about more than superficial things or “small talk” with the people close to you. For instance, don’t just talk with your teammate about the weather and the game.
Share the good things and the bad things that are happening in your life with your friends and family. For example, you might tell your friend, “I feel like we need to connect more. Can I talk about some things going on with me.”

, Another way to maintain the friendships that you have is to be a good listener when people are talking with you.Actively listening gives you the opportunity to learn more about your friends. It also lets people know that you care about them and what they are talking about. This can make you and them feel more connected and less isolated.


Remove other distractions when you are talking with people close to you so that you can pay attention to the conversation.
Instead of thinking about how you will respond or letting your mind wander, stay focused on what you all are talking about.

, Sometimes bullies won’t attack you directly. Instead, they will tell other people to ignore you or leave you out.You can prevent feeling isolated and lonely by addressing this situation as you would any other type of bullying.


Report the bullying to an adult you trust like your teacher, counselor, or coach.
Get support. Turn to any friends that you do have for support and encouragement. For example, you might tell a classmate, “Would you mind walking with me? Sean is kinda making it lonely for me.”

Realize whether you're clinging to negatives.,
Keep a gratitude journal.,
Remember that it’s not always your fault.,
Avoid catastrophizing.,
Believe in positive outcomes.,
Keep in mind that not everything is simply black or white.",How to Turn Negative Into Positive1," Have you ever had an overwhelmingly successful and productive day, but yet upon reflecting, found yourself focusing on nothing but the negatives? This is called filtering. Like a filter, your mind ‘filters’ out all of the positives and increases the significance of the negatives., This will help you identify and focus on the things that you are grateful for. Write in detail about one particular thing you are thankful for instead of creating a general list.Writing less frequently is better in achieving optimum results, so aim for writing once or twice a week. Try and focus your writing on people, and not things since focusing your gratitude on people tends to be more meaningful.

, Personalizing is another form of negative thinking. It occurs when something negative happens and you automatically assume that you are responsible for it. Instead of jumping to conclusions, become curious and ask how or what questions to gather more information. For example, you call up a friend and tell them that you plan on visiting them later that day. They respond that today wasn’t such a good day and that they will call you tomorrow to reschedule. You assume they are trying to avoid you. Instead of assuming, you could ask, “What happened for you to reschedule our visit?”

, Catastrophizing is irrationally predicting negative outcomes and assuming that if a negative did occur, the results would be catastrophic.One type of catastrophizing is making a catastrophe out of a non-catastrophic situation. For example, that slight burning sensation isn’t a heart attack. You just ate an extra large Philly cheesesteak with the extra onions, green peppers, and jalapenos. It’s just heartburn.Combat this type of thinking by reminding yourself, “I am causing my own suffering. Can I stop doing this?” This thought will remind you that you are responsible for creating your own worrying at the moment, and only you have the power to make it go away., Try to avoid assuming negative outcomes for future events. For example, you have an upcoming interview, and you anticipate the interview going horribly wrong despite all of your diligent preparation.Combat this type of thinking by taking notice of when it occurs. Jot down what happened, your thoughts on what happened and how you reacted and responded. You’ll begin to notice a pattern to your thinking. You can then reverse this type of thinking by engaging in positive self-talk.

For example, you wanted to make a special dinner for your significant other but instead ended up burning the meal. You find yourself thinking that your significant other is going to be angry and the evening will be ruined. Instead, tell yourself that it’s okay because everyone makes mistakes. You can simply go out to eat someplace nice.



, Polarizing is when you tend to view things outright as either good or bad. There is no room for a happy medium. Perfection is the only option.Write down your polarizing thoughts to help recognize your over dramatic thinking. When you put things in writing, it helps make your thinking more concrete and easier to analyze. For example, if you wrote down, “I missed the soccer game. I’m a horrible mother,” you might recognize that you were being too hard on yourself.

Stick your bottom lip out.,
Drop your head slightly.,
Get the eyes right.,
Use your whole body.,
Master a sad voice.",How to Pout2," The extend to which you extend it will depend on how dramatic you want your sad pout to look. Be aware that it will come off looking fake (and not as attractive) if you overdo it.You should feel your chin wrinkle slightly as you do this.
Your mouth should be closed for a sad pout, unlike for a seductive pout.
If you're able to, you may want to quiver your lower lip, which will make you look like you're about to cry., This shows that you are feeling vulnerable or submissive., Make eye contact with the person you are talking to, but don't raise your head. Your eyes should be peering up at him. The more eye contact you make, the more flirtatious you will appear, so be cautious is you want to look genuinely sad.If you're trying to be sad in a flirtatious or playful way, you can bat your eyelashes. Don't do this if you want to look genuinely sad., When you are sad, you can see the emotion in your whole body, not just your face. Try slouching your shoulders a little and loosely crossing your arms in front of you. This will let the other person know that you are hurt and trying to protect yourself. You may also consider fidgeting or nervously moving your hands., To sound sad, try talking in very quiet voice and a monotonous tone. Keep your sentences short and to the point.To take your sad voice a step further, try to make your voice tremble, as if you're fighting back tears."
"
Purse your lips.,
Use the rest of your face.,
Use off-putting body language.,
Use an angry voice.,
Don't be too aggressive.",How to Pout3," To look angry instead of sad, you should engage your upper lip a little. Stick the bottom lip out just as you would for a sad pout, but then stick the upper lip out a bit too.Just like with the sad pout, you can stick your lips out further if you want to exaggerate the expression.

, If you want to sell the angry look, consider wrinkling your nose, rolling your eyes, or squinting at the person you are talking to. Look straight ahead and do not drop your head like you would if you were trying to look sad.
To look downright furious, try knotting your brows and flaring out your nostrils., Crossing your arms very tightly against your body and having a rigid posture will help get the message across that your pout is an angry one., If you are talking, make sure you sell your emotion with your voice as well by talking loudly, repeating the same phrases, and laughing sarcastically.You can also try stomping your feet, closing doors loudly, and making other loud noises to make yourself sound more intimidating., An angry pout should still be somewhat playful, even if you are genuinely annoyed. Avoid screaming and insulting other people. Throwing a temper tantrum will only make you look like a bully."

Focus on the positives.,
Make a list of everything that is going right in your life.,
Journal about the good things in your life.,
Ask a friend to help.,
Do what makes you happy.",How to Pick Yourself up when You're Feeling Down1," When life is a challenge, it can seem as though nothing is going right. Overgeneralizing is something people do often because they look at the world through negative lenses.The truth is that there are still a lot of great things about your life.


If you have a roof over your head and food to eat today, you are doing much better than many people in the world.
If you have friends and family members who care about you, that's something to be thankful for right now.
If you have a job, you are receiving a paycheck that help you pay the bills, and that is something to be thankful for even if it's not your dream job.;
, These positives can be as little or as big as you want them to be. If you’re having a hard time seeing the good in your life, start by practicing gratitude, even for the small things in life and write them down


Job
Food
Shelter
Clothing
Loved ones
Vehicle

, Journaling has a positive effect on your physical and mental well-being.When you journal about all of the great things in your life, you will start to remember many more of them. As you start to gather all of the positives in your life, you may just start to feel better about things because you will remember your life is not so bad.


It’s best to journal a little each day. That way you can go back and look at all of the great things that have happened in your life.
Reserve one journal for what you’re proud of, so you can read it when you’re feeling down. If you like to write about the bad times too, have another journal for that. If you’re having a hard time coming up with ideas on what to write, try these topics: What I Like About Myself, The Basic Needs I Have Right Now, What I Am Grateful For Today, and Why My Friends Love Me.

, Friends are there for you when life gets difficult. They help you remember why you're so great. Remember, they must think you are special if they are your friend. To help you focus on the positives, ask a friend to point them out for you. You can then use some of the other suggestions such as making a list or journaling about them later.


Ask a friend to go out to lunch with you and discuss what has you so upset.
Invite a friend over your house for a pow-wow on your couch.
Call your friend to talk about ways your life is better than you believe right now.

, When you are down in the dumps, the last thing you probably want to do is be active, but it is the best thing you can do for yourself.Spend time with friends.
Take a bath.
Have a mug of hot chocolate. A comfort drink can give you the security you need during difficult times. After you allow yourself to be comforted by something that is warm and yummy, you may feel just a bit better about your situation. Cuddle with a pet. Take time to love your pet for a few minutes. Research shows that petting an animal has amazing health benefits. It reduces stress, which lowers your blood pressure. Engage in a hobby you enjoy. You may not feel like it because you are feeling low, but if you force yourself to get started, you may just end up seeing your mood change. It is your hobby for a reason. You enjoy it. Use it to help you during difficult times.
Find a new hobby. If you’re just not interested in doing any of the hobbies you have enjoyed in the past, it might be time to find a new one.
Listen to music. People who are sad tend to listen to depressing music. Avoid the urge to do that because it will only make you feel worse. Research has found that listening to upbeat music can improve your mood. "

Acknowledge your negative thoughts.,
Release your negative thoughts.,
Have concerns without dwelling on them.,
Don’t buy into the negative thinking.,
Determine the source of your negative thinking.,
Think of the worst possible outcome that could happen.",How to Turn Negative Into Positive2," It takes only about 30 seconds for a thought in your mind to enter your deep consciousness.As a result, thinking that you can simply just push it out of your mind won’t work. In fact, It takes a lot more mental energy and effort to fight against a negative thought.


Acknowledging negative thinking doesn’t mean dwelling on it. Instead, you allow your mind to briefly accept that the thought has entered your mind, and then intentionally releasing the thought from your mind.

, Use visual imagery to allow your negative thoughts to be released. For example, you might want to imagine placing your negative thought on a leaf and then watching it float down the stream., Sometimes you have valid reasons to be concerned or worried about something, especially when feeling like you have no control over the situation. Therefore, it’s okay to recognize that there is reason for concern. Just don’t allow them to fester in your mind.Freeing up your mind from negative thoughts makes space for other, more positive thoughts. With practice and time, you’ll notice that you’ll have a tendency to engage in more positive thinking., If you begin to believe that your negative thoughts are valid, then they become your reality. Instead, ask yourself these three questions when negative thoughts take over: Are these thoughts reasonable? Are they rational? Are they reliable?If you can identify that a negative thought is unreasonable, then it allows you to put things into perspective. If you conclude that your thinking is irrational, then you can cease engaging in irrational behavior. Finally, if your negative thought is unreliable, then you can recognize that it is unlikely to be true., Figure out which personal experiences you’ve had that are behind your negative thoughts to gain perspective on your thinking and reasoning. You can then ask yourself what about that experience has lead to your negative perception., This sounds both counterproductive and extreme, but it works. Why? It allows you to see things in a more realistic perspective.For example, someone who is afraid of flying might be fearful of being in a plane crash. They might imagine themselves being the sole survivor of the crash, stranded on a deserted island and being eaten alive by a pack of wolves. Imagining their greatest fear can help them realize the absurdity of their fear."

Pinpoint specific areas plagued with negative thinking.,
Focus on improving one area at a time.,
Stay in the company of positive people.,
Send out positive signals so you can attract positive people.,
Engage in positive self-talk.",How to Turn Negative Into Positive3," There are probably certain areas in your life that you tend to view in a negative light. It might be your career, family, appearance, etc. If you can identify which areas you need to view more positively, you can work on improving your perspective.

, Once you have identified the areas in your life where you are prone to think about negatively, give you attention to just one area. You can then give this area your full attention and avoid becoming overwhelmed. , You are the company that you keep. Surround yourself with positive people, and their positivity will rub off on you. On the other hand, keeping company with negative people will turn you into a sour-puss as well.Try and connect with individuals who share some or your interests or who are already a part of your social and community groups, such as fellow church members or fellow coworkers.

, Before going out to meet others, focus on conjuring up positive energy. Think about all of your positive qualities that would attract others to you, such as your compassion, sense of humor and kindness.

, Positive self-talk is about focusing your internal thoughts into all of the things that are good about you. How you talk to yourself plays a prominent role in your self perception and worldview.When you have negative thoughts, change it to a positive thought. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m no good at dancing,” tell yourself, “I will get better with practice.” If you’re negatively thinking, “I’m too tired to work,” change it to, “I will put forth my best effort even though I’m tired.”Like anything, practice makes perfect. It takes time to develop a habit, so the more you focus on engaging in positive self-talk, the more natural at it you’ll become.

Exercise more.,
Start playing a sport.,
Take more walks.",How to Pick Yourself up when You're Feeling Down3," Exercise can release endorphins that can make you feel good. This works better if you can get your heart pumping to increase blood flow throughout your body. You can do that in the following ways.

, Playing a sport can help you vent aggression. This can help you feel a lot better, especially when you’re not just sad, but angry too. Football is a good option because you can tackle people.
Baseball allows you to hit a ball as hard as you can, which can release tension.
Tennis can have the same effect as baseball as long as you can control where the ball goes after you hit.
Soccer can be cathartic because you need to run as fast as possible and kick the ball with everything you have inside of you.

, Walking can give you a break from a bad day, which could give you a different perspective.


Take your dog with you. It can be much more fun to have your furry friend with you.
Ask a friend to join you. It can be nice to reconnect with someone on a walk.
Notice the beauty of nature around you. This can help you appreciate the world more to improve your mood.
Park farther away, so you have to walk more.
Take the stairs whenever possible to get in more steps.
Wear a step counter to keep track of how much you’re walking each day. You can set up goals to make sure you get in enough steps.
Use a walking video to help you. For example, Leslie Sansone’s Walk video can help you walk miles a day.

Change your self-talk.,
List what you love about yourself.,
Allow yourself not to care so much.",How to Pick Yourself up when You're Feeling Down4," Everyone experiences self-talk. It's that little voice inside of your head that can make you feel really good or really bad. Many people don't realize they are speaking negatively to themselves and that can make them feel really depressed. You may be experiencing that right now, so try to change the way you talk to yourself.


Tell yourself you are worthy of happiness. It can be easy to feel guilty. Everyone makes mistakes, though. Tell yourself that you have done a lot of good in your life, and you deserve to be happy.
Look at yourself in the mirror, smile and remind yourself of something you are proud of. This may be different for different people, but ideas include: what a great friend you are, how thoughtful you are during birthdays, etc. You need to see yourself looking happy even if you do not feel that way. Studies have found that people who make themselves smile will end up feeling happier. Telling yourself you are awesome even if you don’t feel that way can also change the way you feel because you may not say that often about yourself.
Tell yourself you have done the best you could do. You cannot do more than your best. Allow yourself to know that by saying, “I have done the best I could do.” This can relieve a lot of the pressure you have placed on yourself.
Change your self-talk from you to I statement. Instead of saying, ""You should really start exercising more,"" you should say, ""I'm going to start exercising more."", When you make a list of the things that you're proud of, you'll be able to see how great you really are and whenever you're down in the dumps, you can remind yourself that life isn't all that bad.


Do the same thing with short term and long term goals. Tell yourself that you will achieve them. Think of some good ways you can make progress towards them.
Remind yourself of everything you’ve accomplished over the years. Give yourself a pat on the back for each accomplishment.

, When you care too much, you end up putting too much pressure on yourself. You can tell yourself not to care so much, which can help you release some of that tension. It's being self-compassionate and it can work if you say the right things to yourself.


You can try telling yourself that work will be okay without you for a week. You've set everything up and people will appreciate that about you.
You can tell yourself that you did all you could to save the relationship. It takes two to make it work, and you can't make another person be with you.
Just because someone is mad at you, it doesn't mean you've done something bad. That person may just have an internal struggle that has nothing to do with you. Telling yourself that can help you feel better about the situation.

Breaking down, flipping out or otherwise letting your emotions get the better of you won't help you or anyone around you when the world seems to be crashing down. Figure out what you need to do to stay relaxed in an emergency or when you're under threat. Practice as often as possible so your tough mental state becomes second nature.


Next time you face a difficult situation, consciously pause, stay silent and count to 10 before you react. Take the time to think through the best course of action. Remind yourself that you are strong and you have the presence of mind to face the situation head on.
If someone is bullying or otherwise bothering you, think before you speak. Stay calm and assess the situation instead of running away or lashing out.
You can practice meditation as a way to understand what it feels like to stay focused and calm no matter what outside distractions occur.;
, Dwelling on minutia will sap your strength and make you weaker. If you want to be tough, learn how to let go of trivial stuff that isn't worth your time or brainpower. Save your energy for issues and situations that require your utmost attention and concentration.


Don't get caught up in drama. Try to interact with other people as straightforwardly as possible and inspire the same in others.
Don't get easily offended by offhanded remarks or actions designed to annoy you. These things don't matter in the long run.
Don't get tripped up by worrying. Worrying doesn't accomplish anything except making you feel mentally tired. Deal with problems head-on so you won't have to waste time dwelling on them.

, If you have low confidence, it's going to be hard to make the tough decisions in life, because you'll doubt you're making the right choice. Start making smart, informed choices that you believe in and can back up. Once you take a certain path, stick to it with the confidence that you're taking the right course. Waffling, backing down, and being wishy-washy are signs you aren't mentally tough.



Build confidence by knowing and honing your strengths and working on improving your weak spots. Everyone has room for improvement in certain areas; the difference between those who are tough and those who aren't is that the tough ones are always striving to get better. For example, if you have a propensity for telling white lies to ease your way through life, put in the work to stop your self-destructive behavior.
Eliminate the activities that make you less confident. You can't make informed, smart, reasoned choices in life if you're hindered by behaviors that skew your reality and make you doubt yourself. That means you've got to overcome bad habits like drinking too much alcohol, using drugs, gambling, and any other behaviors that make it harder to clearly see right from wrong.

, Are you all talk and no action? Anyone can hold forth about things they want to accomplish, but it's a different matter entirely to set goals and work toward achieving them. Working toward a goal can be monotonous, painful, and yes, tough. The more you practice getting things done, the more likely you'll be to do it again.


Decide to be resilient. If you take up a new exercise, start a new job, or decide you're going to apply to an educational program, figure out what steps you need to take to succeed, then stick to them.
Take things a day at a time. Being tough enough to achieve big goals means being patient in the meantime. Break a big task into smaller steps, perform each one to the best of your ability, and steadily work toward the prize.

, Even the strongest among us fail sometimes. Knowing how to pick yourself back up when you fall is absolutely key to toughening up. Each time you fail at something, analyze what went wrong and what you can do differently next time. Plot a new strategy for accomplishing your goal and pursue it again with confidence.


Own up to your mistakes. Don't make excuses or place blame elsewhere.
Don't be too hard on yourself. You'll weaken yourself if you dwell too much on how you were responsible for what happened. Have confidence that you'll be able to make things right.

, Face life's hurdles with an optimistic attitude, rather than a defeatist one. If you believe your life has meaning and you have the ability to overcome challenges, you'll be much more able to handle tough situations, stay resilient when things get hard, and try again when failure happens.


It helps to have a sense of humor. Be able to see the lighter side of situations instead of always focusing on the serious parts of life.
Inspire optimism in others, too. Be a positive force in other people's lives. Part of being tough is helping other people get through life's difficult times as well.

, Becoming physically tough takes a lot of ongoing, dedicated work. Your focus should be two-pronged: you want to build strong muscles as well as working on your endurance. Set goals for yourself and make physical training a regular part of your routine. When you've accomplished one set of goals, make new ones, always striving to get in the best shape you possibly can.


Do cardio exercises. Run, bike, or swim several times a week. Once you can go a certain distance, aim to go further. Sign up for marathons and triathlons to push yourself to achieve more.

Get into a weight-lifting routine. Work all of the muscle groups in your body. As you improve, push yourself to lift more weight and do more reps.
Sign up for a team sport if you have the time. This will give you the incentive to work even harder to stay physically fit.
Eat well to keep your body strong. Eat whole foods like fruits and vegetables, lean meats and fish, nuts and legumes, and whole grains. Avoid fast food, packaged food, and empty calories.
Get plenty of sleep. Your body needs time to repair after tough workouts, and sleep keeps you both mentally and physically strong.
Eliminate as many toxins from your diet and lifestyle as possible. Don't use drugs and limit your alcohol intake.

, This approach to fitness is the one taken by the US Marines.Anyone can get in good shape, but to be physically tough your aim should be to get strong enough to be the very best. Train to win competitions, not just qualify for participation.


Sign up for competitions so you can track your progress. Your goal should be to be in the top 10% of any given group of athletes, so that you have a shot at winning.
You can still train to win even if you're nowhere near the top as of yet. Aim to beat your personal best each time you compete.

, There's no way to be at your physical best without experiencing pain. Training this hard hurts, both during workout sessions and afterward, when your muscles are sore. When you're physically tough, you're able to tolerate the pain that comes with breaking down your muscles so they can build up bigger and stronger. You know your efforts will pay off in the end.


When you're working out, go all in. Go further, faster and harder than you think you can. Put in an extra 10 minutes when you think you're finished.
Don't hurt yourself. Make sure you understand the line between pain and injury. Work with a personal trainer if you're new to intense physical training.

, Getting physically tough isn't going to happen if you only train every once in a while. You've got to get out there day after day, week after week, and year after year to keep your body in tip top shape. Pick yourself up and go to your training session even when you're tired, sore and just not feeling it.

, You might have strong muscles and great endurance, but what would you do if a bear attacked, or you got caught in a snowstorm? Toughening up means reacting correctly in a variety of physical situations. Learn about survival techniques that will enable you to be tough when you're faced with danger or extreme weather.


Learn how to handle an animal attack. Know the proper way to save yourself from sharks, bears, dogs, and other wild animals.
Learn how to survive extreme weather. Snowstorms, dust and sand storms, extreme heat, and extreme cold all require you to exhibit physical prowess.
Learn how to survive on your own in the wild. Know how to make shelter for yourself, get food and water, and find your way back to civilization if necessary.

, Whether you're faced with someone trying to mug you on the street or you're standing up for someone who is being bullied, fighting skills will eventually come in handy. Learn the right way to throw a punch or defend yourself from one.


Part of learning how to fight is learning when to fight. You should try to diffuse a situation using other tactics first.
Martial arts training is a great way to learn important fighting skills while also understanding the proper mentality to have about fighting. One of the best ways to do so is taekwondo.

, If you want people to think you're tough, do your best to stay positive and face difficult situations without complaining. Complaining is a waste of time and makes you sound whiny and ineffective. Act like the strong, purposeful, confident person you are. You'll inspire others to want to be more like you.


If you need to let off steam (we all do sometimes), do it privately. Write your thoughts down or channel your pent up energy in a positive way, like through working out.
Sharing negative feelings isn't the same as complaining. You don't have to constantly act like nothing is wrong, or avoid saying what's on your mind; just try not to whine.

, You probably know people who seem to surround themselves with drama, and others who get explosively angry at the drop of a hat. Being reckless with emotions can be a big burden for other people. Take the tougher approach of handling your emotions in such a way that you don't end up negatively affecting others. Find ways to express yourself constructively.


This is not the same as bottling up your emotions, which can have a very bad effect over time. It's completely fine to express sadness, joy, embarrassment, anger, and so on as long as you do it in a way that isn't difficult for others to bear.
Don't mistake emotionless behavior for tough behavior. It's not tough to pretend that you don't have feelings at all. It's tougher to be honest with yourself and acknowledge your emotional pain or happiness, and be brave enough to share it with others.

, Think about what you're running away from or avoiding, and make the effort to face it head-on instead. It's easier to let yourself turn to escapist habits like watching too much TV or going out every night than it is to boldly deal with problems and negative situations. Tough people deal. The ability to do this will allow you to become much more successful in life instead of being held back by bad habits.


Think hard about what you might be avoiding in your own life. Is there a personal failing you're ignoring? A family member who needs your help? A wrong that you could help to right?
Try getting away from distractions for awhile to clear your head and correct your focus. Turn off the TV and put away your phone and computer for a few days.

, You'll never toughen up if you stick to activities you've already mastered. Getting tougher requires learning new things, becoming more well-rounded. Practice going out of your way to try new activities and be open to experiences you might naturally tend to avoid.


What terrifies you? Decide you're going to overcome your fear. If you hate public speaking, make a speech at your friend's wedding. If you're afraid of water, take swimming lessons.

, Tough people take care of others when they are in need. It's a lot harder to take other people into consideration than it is to act solely for your own good. Be strong for your family and friends when they need someone to turn to. If you see a stranger in need of help, offer it. When you're in a group situation, be the one to volunteer to help.


Make sure your family is well cared for. Be reliable and responsible so they know they can count you on.
Step up and be the leader when a leader is called for. For example, if you're in a building and the fire alarm goes off, be the one to help calm people down and get them to safety instead of running away to fend for yourself.

, The very toughest people stay strong in the face of hardship, danger, and criticism, which may be the most difficult obstacle of all. Being tough means knowing what you believe in and standing up for it. You might even have to fight for it sometimes. Don't back down, and don't give up.

Without being armed with this knowledge in regard to everything in the world, one apparently cannot understand an avoid failure. Without taking a break, or distracting your mind from the aim, failure may come unfortunately. In that case, giving rise to fear and thinking of the future is utterly idiotic.


Sometimes, failure comes to our door, despite the fact that we had a good performance in the past. We put our honest efforts in order to earn satisfactory credits, but sometimes it does not give you what you would expect.
Do not think about failure or success. This kind of thinking is completely unreasonable. Instead, be hardworking and have integrity. If we allow this integrity to be seen, failure will never knock on the door.

If you dash by failure, chances are there will be faults in our curriculum. It might be that you did choose the direction in which you were proceeding, or the method. It is solely our area of fight in the battle, which is why we get defeated.


For the ultimate loss, only we are responsible. We have to accept this fact in order to maintain the balance. This psychology, if we able to develop in our mind, it would help us from falling in dark. Failure can comes hundred times, that is to say that, trying as a Rocky is illogical or it is against of the wisdom of life. Self-belief is necessary.;
, When competitors are running in a race, they are finely aware of rising and the falling points of each other. This means that they have compared between themselves. People put two bodies, side by side, and they pass their time by counting their bits and pieces, which is very sad.


Everyone is unique and beyond the comparison with others’ is the statement for this kind of society. We have to decompose or rot ourselves from these kinds of people. Every competitor is allocated with a separate running track. These are the rules of the game after all. No one can violate them, and, if it’s done, rustication or suspension from school is performed.
Similarly, in life, if we compare, we attain rancor, jealousy and greed; all these elements take us to bottom. Consider who is responsible for the failure. The answer to this question is different for everyone, as it is an open question which has more than one answer. Our life is like a race too, in which people blame, compare you with others, and force you to compete which apparently caused a dangerous feeling of ‘losing’.

, It requires effort to forget failure, but lastly it helps in amplifying our endurance. For instance, as success comes, it comes with anticipation. As it is continued for a certain period of time, we reach to a destination where load of expectations are excessively high and “repressibility” (an act of pressurizing) comes to do its work. It comes from the masses around you and it’s hard to sustain.


If you are a successful person, people will match the beats with you. If unfortunately this pleasant situation reverses, these masses doubt on your merits. Don’t care about what people comment or care about you; if you don’t want to do this, create the potential to bear the stress. Otherwise, you will soon be a flagged body.

If you develop this supernatural power in your mind, you will be able to face problems in your life. Our parents are the key to unlock this door. They teach us about composure. Society is like a nature; sometimes, words sound like music to ears and sometimes bitter to taste. In these all circumstances, all we have to do is to make ourselves ‘motionless’. Just give a nod with ‘respect’ and do your work with honesty.



, Consider the fear of failing. To distract your mind from it, you should change the orientation of our lifestyle. Perhaps, it would energize you.


For example, spend your time travelling, try different cuisines at different locations, try to learn something new, and try to teach to your acquaintances if you have a perceived skill. These elements are very important, in order to keep your mind cheerful. If you do these things, you will be able to stop thinking of fear of failure. It will also will spur your conscience which is good thing.
Nobility decreases with failure, but also increases the trepidation of losing. By devouring fear, one can resolve the problems if he or she is committed with his or her aim. One additional effect, heads up in this process. ‘Bad habits’. One can think that, by doing a particular thing, you will be in position to oppose the circumstances. This kind of thought process is absolutely an apex of foolishness.

, Consider how to face the commoners. What most people make a picture of this problem is, they forced to walk as a criminal, bear ridiculous thoughts and unexpected replies.


Society is like a chameleon lizard. These kinds of species are able to change their skin coloration. Similarly, society speaks on what it is based at that instance. Accordingly, it changes its group or community and use a different tongue to speak against you.

To oppose this, we should apply the reverse theory. If they ask you about your failure, give them answer which sounds music to their ears. You can just say, ""I didn’t give my best; my efforts were not that tight, but I will do it with confidence again with full attention and will definitely get success.” You will probably get a reply of silence if you say this. By doing this, you will definitely be able to increase the level of confidence.



, It’s very crucial to stay focused when starting from beginning. Concentrate on one thing at a time and you can expect good results. Conversely, if you are not paying attention in what you are doing, after some period, you realize that, you are in position to stay silent again.


It is dependent upon how you try. If you think in deep, you come to know that concentrating on a single thing is very difficult. We cannot do multiple things at a time. We suck at ‘multitasking’. ‘Eliminating distractions’ is the key to staying focused. When you are doing one thing, eliminate all the other distractions. Take breaks in between to refresh your mind. Switch off the distractions. It’s hard but definitely doable.

, You need a role model and faith for rising from the dark. Developing confidence is easy to speak, but very hard to attain. Don’t think of negative stuff. If you are thinking about bad thoughts, use ‘SRD technique’.  Stop, relax and distract.


Call these three words two to three times in your mind; do this with full attention, and you will feel better. Another idea for getting maximum confidence is to make two colorful posters and write these two sentences, each, on a separate poster, in bold letters. Every morning, read these sentences loudly for exactly ‘21’ days; do this in order to become a supernaturally confident person. You may face contradictions in starting five to six days that you are not doing this work consistently. You could try saying these things, for instance:

I love to be confident.
I am independent of good and bad opinions of the others.



, Consistency is the concept. If you are known of well, then there is nothing wrong in saying that you have conquered the world. If you have set your aim in life, then it is the master key to get there.


It is very hard as a diamond to preserve consistency over a long period of time. ‘Stick to one thing for a long time’ is not a cakewalk. If you are confident, motivated but not consistent, failure will surely come because it is an independent concept. All the other things are simply meaningless. Even if you lack confidence and motivation but have imposing consistency and ability of doing hard work, you can be a successful person. But, it’s very harsh to develop consistency when rising from the failure and it also depends on what kind of company you have.

, This does not mean having virtual friends on Facebook, Twitter and other online sites. Be more social with people in your workplace, college, school, etc. Form a group and be the leader of it so that you will be able to communicate with people very well.


Schedule daily and weekly meetings, go out, have dinner with new people, share your problems with each other and try to resolve them. It may hard for a character who is obsessed with failure. If someone is inviting you for a meet or a small get together, don’t make excuses, just say ‘yes’ and be yourself in meeting. It will increase your bearing capacity and empower your system.

, We choose failure and success, Life is like different cuisines in which every bite tastes different; sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter. However, we never stop the consumption process. When that bite enters in our body, the only useful part is absorbed and remaining is taken off from the body.


Similarly, in life, if we approach by failure, we learn many essentials from it and take off other terms like misery and sadness. We get countless chances to prove ourselves; we just need to be patient. Everyone does these things in order to live a better life. Start from the step where you did fall from. Show confidence and you will definitely be able to digest failure. Stop caring for results and life will be pleasant.

Realize that some things are in our control and others not.,

Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, ""You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be."",

",How to Temper Misfortune," Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.


The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered;
Those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others.;
, You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men.


But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one.
You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.

, And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this:


Whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not;
If it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.

The wise will start each day with the thought…
Fortune gives us nothing which we can really own.
Nothing, whether public or private, is stable;
The destinies of men, no less than those of cities, are in a whirl.
Whatever structure has been reared by a long sequence of years, at the cost of great toil and through the great kindness of the gods, is scattered and dispersed in a single day. No, he who has said ‘a day’ has granted too long a postponement to swift misfortune; an hour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of empires.
How often have cities in Asia, how often in Achaia, been laid low by a single shock of earthquake? How many towns in Syria, how many in Macedonia, have been swallowed up? How often has this kind of devastation laid Cyprus in ruins?

Reflect on any recent loss or trauma.,

Pay attention if you’re continuously calling in sick to work.,
Be wary of any feelings of helplessness or hopelessness.,
Think about whether you feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts.,
Recognize if you’re isolating.,
Pay attention to feelings of numbness and detachment.",How to Tell if You Are Having a Nervous Breakdown1," A breakdown can result from trauma or death of a loved one. It can also be a result of a constant buildup of stress, like work pressures or financial burdens. Think about any recent or unexpected stressors that have overwhelmed you suddenly. Any event that happens suddenly may drain all available resources, leaving you feeling unable to cope.This can include a recent death, breakup, or divorce.
Trauma can include living through a natural disaster, being a victim of theft, violence, or domestic abuse.;
, When suffering from a nervous breakdown, you may experience an inability to feel pleasure. You may feel listless, empty, or apathetic. Nothing may seem to carry any meaning to you, or you feel an overwhelming sense of “going through the motions”. Apathy and withdrawal are symptoms of depression. You may feel deeply depressed as a result or leading up to a nervous breakdown.You may want to be happy and feel normal, but you can no longer enjoy your favorite activities.

, Mood swings are usually in evidence before any nervous breakdown, as they are indicative of emotional exhaustion and poor coping methods. The mood swings may involve:Irritability
Anger combined with guilt and remorse
Excessive crying spells
Phases of extreme quietness
Depressive phases

, Taking a day to mentally, emotionally, or physically recover from an event is one thing, but if you find yourself continuously calling into work sick, this may be an indication of a breakdown. You may lack the motivation to go into work, or find that you physically cannot make your body get ready and go to work.Pay attention if you’ve let your work slide. Even if you come into work, observe your productivity and if it differs drastically from last month.

, These are two very common feelings before and during a nervous breakdown. You may feels like you lack the internal resources to cope with your issues, and thus feels helpless. You may experience a feeling of hopelessness, as you are unable to control the circumstances around you and can see no way out of your current predicament. These are symptoms of depression that may contribute to a nervous breakdown.Some other symptoms of depression that may contribute to a nervous breakdown may include:


Lack of energy
Fatigue
Lack of ability to concentrate
Decreased attention
Isolation

, In case of a breakdown, you may be constantly thinking excessively negative thoughts and even experiencing positive things or feelings as negative. Common thoughts may include:Interpreting meanings in a negative way

Assume the best of others.,
Consider the setting.,
Consider the source.",How to Take a Joke1," Try to remember that most jokes are good-natured attempts at being funny. Sometimes, we take the cheapest route to funny, and that sometimes takes the form of taking a shot at someone. If the shot's aimed at you, try to remember that person is just trying to be funny - it's probably about him or her more than about you.The joke may have been good natured, but worded poorly. Or perhaps the joker misjudged how sensitive you are about a particular topic.
Sometimes people joke about sensitive topics, intending to show support for those who need it most or lighten the mood.;
, Pick up on the atmosphere. If the joke was meant to be lighthearted (without intent to hurt you or anyone else), then you can be lighthearted right back. You may tease the joker back to keep the dialogue going, or smile and brush it off.


Keep your teasing lighthearted when creating banter with the joker. Keep in mind he or she is trying to have fun and be silly with you.
If there's a cruel or threatening undercurrent, then you may want to address appropriate joking with the joker.

, Some people are simply goofy, or are well-meaning but not good at wording things. In these cases it may be better to let it slide. A friend may have a particularly acerbic wit. Recognize that is just part of his humor and he means no harm.


We all have less than desirable traits. An overly sarcastic friend isn't likely to make major personality changes, so there is no benefit to getting upset and potentially harming relationships.

"
"
Forgive minor slights against you.,
Smile and play along with harmless pranks.,
Ignore jokes made in poor taste.",How to Take a Joke2," Recognize we all go a little too far sometimes, and let miner offenses go. If a friend gets caught up in the moment and makes a disparaging comment, forgive him. Decide it was a mistake, assume he's sorry for having said it, and expect him to meet all other duties as a friend with compassion and empathy.If inappropriate comments or mean spirited jokes continue to be a problem, then you might consider addressing the issue with your friend.

, There are a few scenarios where this response might be appropriate, such as at school when those making the jokes don't know you well, or don't realize they're annoying you. At times, if you can show yourself to be a gracious good sport, you can win respect from those making the comments, and make new friends out of the deal.For example, if someone spills water on you and someone asks ""Going for a swim?"" you can say, ""Darn, and I left my beach towel at home!""

, What constitutes humor varies wildly. Our physical maturation, emotional states, and personal circumstances all contribute to what we consider our sense of humor. Accept yours may be radically different than others.Ignoring jokes you don't find funny is an easy way to express your disapproval, without creating unnecessary tension.

"
"
Don't take yourself so seriously.,
Beat the joker to the punch.,
One up the joker.",How to Take a Joke3," Recognize you are human, and you make mistakes just like everyone else, sometimes pretty hilariously.A little lighthearted ribbing might be good to help you lighten your perspective.


If you are having a hard time finding the humor in a joke about you, try taking the perspective of an outsider. Retell the joke in your head but about somebody else, perhaps somebody you don't even know. This may help you reduce your defensiveness.

, If a person is sharing something about you that you might have liked to keep under wraps, take control of your story. Interrupt the joker by correcting or elaborating on some aspect of the story and then finish telling it. Others would probably prefer to hear it from you, so they will likely direct their attention to you rather than the joker.


Embarrassing moments are less embarrassing when you make a joke of it, so take this as an opportunity to rid yourself of some negative feelings.

, Show the joker you aren't bothered by the joke by making an even better one about yourself. Self-depricating humor is excellent for diffusing tense situation, as it makes you more relatable. Others will feel more comfortable with themselves and the situation, when they see you can laugh at yourself.This will shift other's attention to you and help you to take control of the situation.
An easy way to set up your one up joke is ""That was nothing, you should have seen the time I…""

"
"
Calmly express hurt feelings.,
Don't participate in mean spirited teasing of others.,
Call a parley to discuss what topic are appropriate for joking.",How to Take a Joke4," Just as the joker has the freedom to tell jokes, you have the freedom to protest and discuss consequences. Take a deep breath, excuse yourself to the restroom if need be, and compose yourself. Then state the problem as clearly and politely as possible.


For jokes about inappropriate subjects, you can tell the Joker, ""please don't joke about that; it's kind of a sensitive topic for me.""

, Understand that your intentions may be misunderstood as well, so be careful of engaging in potentially hurtful teasing.Model the type of behavior you'd like others to adopt.


If you aren't sure how to engage in humor without possibly offending others, try making fun of yourself. Self-depricating humor actually helps to put others at ease and reduces tension., If the tone of banter has gotten too negative or abusive, pause the dialogue. Explain you feel the interaction is headed in a problematic direction and propose rules to right course. You can suggest topics to be off limit and even establish consequences for violating the terms of the parley.


Making a game of setting rules will change the direction of the conversation without dragging down the intended tone.

Notice if you are able to process your feelings of shame.,
Recognize the purpose of both emotions.",How to Tell the Difference Between Shame and Guilt," Often when we feel shameful or ashamed, we end up feeling low about ourselves. You may have low self-esteem and feel you are worth nothing or a failure. When you feel shameful, you feel bad about who you are. This can then lead to low self-esteem and a feeling of being defective or flawed.You may have moments of shame if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed or under a dark cloud. You may struggle with your appearance and feel shameful about it. Or you may dislike some aspect of your personality, which can lead to feelings of shame.
You may also have feelings of shame that are then made worse by getting shamed by someone. For example, you may be shamed at school for an outfit you are wearing. Or you may be shamed for the type of food you bring to school for lunch.;
, You may also have feelings of shame that then lead you to bully others or put them down so they feel bad or so you can feel superior to them in some way. Your feelings of shame may trigger you to act out and hurt others around you so they feel as worse as you do.You may bully those closest to you, such as friends or family, due to your feelings of shame. You may also take your shame out on strangers, such as the guy who cut you off while driving or the woman who accidentally bumped your arm in the check-out line.
For example, maybe you always put down a person who is smaller than you in class by telling them they are ""stupid"" or ""dumb."" You may also bully your siblings or your family by calling them names and telling them that they are ""worthless"" or ""defective.""

, You may also have a creeping feeling that you are a fraud or a “faker” due to feelings of shame. Perhaps you feel like a phony when you are around others and you struggle to stay calm and relaxed because of your feelings. You may also feel unworthy or inferior to others due to your feelings of shame.For example, you may struggle with acting perfect around others and dress in a certain way to appear cool or hip. You may then have feelings of shame when you walk around in your cool outfit, as you actually feel uncool and like a fraud.
You may try to hide your shame from others because you find it painful to discuss or address. Hiding your shame may lead to a deeper sense of feeling a fraud or a fake.

, It may help you put your feelings of shame into context by learning about the theories behind shame and why we feel shame. There are three main theories of shame, including:The functional theory: This is where you try to use shame to adapt to relationships and fit in with society. You may use feelings of shame to actually fit in and behave morally around others.
The cognitive theory: This theory occurs when you evaluate yourself in relation to the perception others have of you. You may then feel you do not meet certain rules or standards. This can lead to feelings of being a failure or flawed.
The psychoanalytic attachment theory: In this theory, your feelings of shame are attached to your experience with your mother or caretaker as a child. You may experience a disruption in that attachment and this could lead to feelings of being unwanted or unacceptable.

, Guilt often occurs when you feel bad for something you did to someone else. The focus is more on your actions, rather than you as a person. Unlike shame, guilt is more about feeling bad for what you did rather than feeling bad for who you are. Because guilt is attached to actions, it is often easier to remedy feelings of guilt than to address feelings of shame.For example, you may feel guilty if you hurt someone’s feelings or do something that you know will hurt them. You may then feel uncomfortable around the person you have hurt and feel you have made a mistake. Your feelings of guilt may become strong enough for you to apologize or make amends to the person for your actions.

, You may also have feelings of guilt if you break the law or do something illegal. Your feelings of guilt are tied to committing an action that you know is wrong and against the moral code of society. You may then feel you need to be held accountable for your actions to absolve your feelings of guilt.For example, you may feel guilty if you steal something from a store. You may feel good breaking the law in the moment but feelings of guilt will hit you soon after you commit a crime. You may then turn yourself into the police to address your feelings of guilt.

, Chronic guilt occurs when you feel guilty on a regular basis, even after you have addressed your actions and apologized or made amends. Chronic guilt can quickly turn into shame.You should observe your behavior and notice if you feel guilty every day over a period of months or years for a specific action or just in general. You may then be developing feelings of shame around an event or action in your life.

, One way you can tell the difference between shame and guilt is by looking at how you handle each feeling. You can usually address your feelings of guilt more easily than your feelings of shame. If you feel guilty about something you can often address it and work on making amends so you no longer feel guilty.To address your guilt, you may make a heartfelt apology to the person you have hurt and say, “I’m sorry for what I did.” Over time, you may then be able to release your feelings of guilt and move on.
Guilt is known as an adaptive emotion, where you can address the source of your emotion and then work on coming up with a solution to relieve your emotion.

, Shame is a more complicated emotion than guilt, as it is tied more to you as a person than your actions as a person. You may struggle to address or process your feelings of shame, especially if the reasons for your feelings of shame are buried or hidden. You may not be able to simply apologize or make amends and then have your shame fade away over time.Your feelings of shame may not allow you to say to someone, “I’m sorry. I made a mistake.” Instead, your feelings of shame may cause you to say, “I’m sorry. I am the mistake.”
You may need to seek professional help, such as talking to a therapist or a counselor, to help you come to terms with your feelings of shame and work through the causes of your shame. It may take time for you to address and process your feelings of shame, often more time than you may need to address feelings of guilt.

, Shame and guilt are very different emotions and they serve different purposes. Guilt is useful because it allows us to know the difference between right and wrong, and we are often able to process our guilt by making amends for our mistakes. Though guilt may be an intense emotion, it can be addressed and dealt with through thoughtful actions and words. Shame, on the other hand, is a more complex and less useful emotion.Often, we find it difficult to know what to do when we feel shame. Shame is also seen as bad character trait and many people will try to hide their shame, leading to isolation and low self-esteem. Holding on to shame can be exhausting and emotionally damaging.
You should try to accept feelings of guilt and address them accordingly. You should not try to accept feelings of shame and should instead speak to a therapist or counselor so you can work through your emotions and release your feelings of shame.

You may have also experienced physical sensations such as energy, tightening of the stomach, or other actions. Write down what happened just before the self-harming.
Journaling might reveal that you are experiencing certain situations that create the urge to self-harm. Some of these situations might be: problems with peers (including bullying or cyber-bullying), pressure at school, feeling socially isolated, abuse, confusion around sexuality, or issues in your family.The goal is to become aware of your thoughts and not passively acting on negative thoughts that lead to self-harming behaviors., The next step in combating negative thinking is to assess your thought process. Are your thoughts true? Look at your thought record and assess what similar situation you were in, did you learn anything and what were the long-term consequences? Did you handle any situations differently? A good way to assess negative thoughts is to look for words like “should,” “ought,” or “must.” These types of statements are usually negative and critical of yourself.
Ask a friend or trusted family member if you are unsure if thoughts are true.

, Another technique is to interrupt your negative thoughts. Imagine a stop light or noise that stops the thought. Your goals here are to interrupt the negative thought and to remind yourself of your thought patterns. Then, you will experience a sense of control and a sense of awareness to the pattern of thoughts.


Thought stopping can be a physical change, such as doing an activity. Take a walk, talk with a friend, read a book, or work on a chore., When you have negative thoughts, you need to counteract these with positive statements. Look through your thoughts journal and write down alternative, positive statements.For example, if you think, “I always ruin dinner parties because I arrive too late,” you can counter this thought with something positive, such as: “I am a caring person because I like to bring some flowers for the host.”

, This type of worksheet takes you through various steps to acknowledge negative thinking and understand how to replace them with positive thoughts.


A thought record reminds you about questions to ask yourself about your thought process, including describing the situation, identifying what you’re reacting to, looking at the situation from an outside perspective, assessing whether the statement or situation is true, and how you can respond to the situation.There are many cognitive behavioral therapy thought record templates available online, including here and here.

, Positive self-talk refers to your inner voice and the way that you talk to yourself. This inner voice impacts your motivation, outlook, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Positive self-talk is a way to talk to yourself to gain confidence, build a healthier lifestyle and reduce negative thoughts.Examples of positive self-talk include:


I am lovable.
I am special.
I am confident.
I can achieve my goals.
I am beautiful.
Harming myself does not solve my problems.
I can overcome my anger, sadness, and anxiety without harming.
I can trust someone with my feelings right now.
I can seek support.
Remind yourself by using post-it notes or leaving messages on your mirror.
If you have trouble believing abstract statements such as “I am special” or “I am confident,” you don’t have to use them just yet. Instead, use positive statements that focus on the behavior you want to achieve. These might give you more specific guidance, such as “I can trust someone with my feelings right now,” and “Harming myself does not solve my problems.”
Positive self-talk should not be mandated by others. Instead, it should be used when you feel like it is helpful., A coping skilling box or kit is a container that you fill with supplies to help stop the urge to self-harm.These supplies will remind you of what you have. They may also help you redirect your energy into something positive, such as creating art. Some supplies for this box might include:


Pictures of friends, family, or pets
Journal
Art supplies
Inspiring quotes
Music or lyrics

, You don't have to wait until you feel an urge to talk. Share the ups and downs with your close friends and relatives. Surround yourself with their support. When you feel the urge to self-harm, the best thing you can do is tell someone you feel that way.


It is hard to verbalize our feelings and sometimes it is easier to act out our feelings of sadness, anger, or lonely in the form of self-harm. But for long-term success, it is important to address the underlying stress.If you self-harm, it might be embarrassing and hard to talk about. You might worry that the other person will judge you or pressure you to talk about it. But it is important to share your worries about your life with your loved ones. They want to help you.

, If you are struggling with expressing yourself verbally, write a note or text to a friend or family member. This might help you communicate your thoughts without saying them out loud.

, Part of the recovery process is learning new skills to help release feel-good chemicals in your brain that you may experience when you self-harm. Self-soothing techniques are a way to take care of yourself and focus on the here and now. The benefit of the five senses technique is to provide a way to get in a state of mind that allows you to address painful or extreme feelings leading to self-harm., Start in a comfortable position. You can sit on the floor with legs crossed, or in a chair with your feet planted flat on the ground.
Start to become aware of your breath. Focus on each part of your breath (inhale, hold, and exhale). You do not need to breathe in any particular way.
Next, start to bring awareness to each of your 5 senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch).
Spend about one minute focusing on only one sense:
Hear: What sounds do you hear around you? Focus on external sounds (do you hear cars going by, people talking, birds chirping?). Focus on internal sounds (can you hear your breathing or digestion?). As you focus on hearing, did you notice anything you did not before?
Smell: What do you smell? Is there food near you? You might notice smells you did not before, like the smell of paper in the books. Try closing your eyes. Sometimes this helps decrease visual distractions and sharpen other senses.
Sight: What do you see? It is easy to see the couch or desk. Take notice of details such as colors, patterns, shapes and textures.
Taste: What do you taste? Even if you do not have food in your mouth, you can still taste. Notice any aftertaste of a previous drink or meal. Run your tongue over your teeth and cheeks to help you become more aware.
Touch: What do you feel without moving from your seated position? Feel the sensation of your skin being touched by clothing, seating in your chair, and feet on the floor. Feel the texture of your clothes or the chair.

, Meditating has shown to improve positive emotions, satisfaction, health and happiness. Also, it decreases anxiety, stress and depression.There are many different types of mediation but the goal of all mediation is about calming the mind. The example below is a simple mediation to help start the process of calming one’s mind.


Start in a comfortable seat position.
Have a single point to focus on. This could be something visual such a candle flame, a sound such as a repeating single word or prayer, or something physical such as counting beads on a rosary. Keep your focus on this one thing.
While you are focusing, your mind will wander. When you notice your thoughts wandering, let the thought go, and bring your concentration back to your focus point. This might sound easy, but focusing the mind is challenging. Don’t be disappointed if you can only focus for a few minutes at first., Breathing is a natural response that we can control. Research shows that practicing breathing has a positive impact on our stress response or “fight or flight” response. The same stress response can be triggered when we feel the need to self-harm. Learning this skill can help us take control of our triggers. Try this breathing exercise:


Count to 5 while inhaling, hold for 5 counts, and take 5 counts to exhale.
Focus on each part of your breath as you count.
Another way to focus on your breath is to use a deflated balloon. Blow up the balloon and watch it deflate.

, The image is peaceful or reminds you of a happy memory. Sometimes it is easier to have the picture printed out. Then you can focus on it. , Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a type of coping skill that focuses on tensing and relaxing different muscle groups. The benefit of progressive muscle relaxation includes helping you become more aware of physical sensations in your body.


Start in a comfortable position that allows you to focus on different muscle groups. Most people find sitting or lying down the easiest to start.
Focus on one group of muscles that you can tense and then relax. Common areas include face, hands and arms, stomach/ middle section, and legs/feet.
To start with your face, imagine eating a lemon. Feel the tension in your lips, cheeks, jaw, forehead, and eyes when you bite into the lemon. Your face gets all wrinkled around your nose, yours eye close, and your lips pucker. Then focus on relaxing all those muscles. It might help to think about eating something sweet and how your face feels relaxed/calm when you are eating something you enjoy.To work on your shoulders and back, imagine that you are a cat. Think about how a cat arches its back and spreads its paws. Make your body copy the cat. Roll your shoulders up to your ears and arch your back. You can even get on your hands and knees to really arch your back. Then relax and go back to your normal sitting position.
For your middle, it might be easiest to lay on your back. Imagine a heavy ball sitting on your stomach. Take a really deep breath, and relax those muscles.
Tense and relax your feet. This can be done anywhere, even when wearing shoes. Curl your toes. Then stretch them out as wide as they can go. Relax your toes.

, A mindful walk is mindfulness in movement. Benefits of a mindfulness walk include learning awareness in daily life. Additionally, sitting still and doing a “traditional” mediation might be hard for some people. Walking is more active form of meditation. You can also get the added health benefits of walking.While walking, take notice of each step. How do your feet feel on ground? How do your feet feel in your shoes? Focus on your breath. Take notice of the environment: Stop and smell the roses, as the saying goes., If you or someone you are thinking about suicide, get help immediately. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or your local emergency response (911). The following are some signs to look for if you are concerned about a loved one:Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves.
Looking for a way to kill themselves.
Making statements about being hopeless.
Talking about having no reason to live.

, A psychologist or counselor can help you understand difficult emotions and overcome trauma. This person has the education, training, and experience to help you overcome issues that are driving your behaviors.


Ask your doctor for a referral to a counselor or psychologist who specializes in self-harm. Schedule an appointment to talk. If you have trouble being honest with a close friend or family member, you may find it freeing and comforting to share with someone who doesn't know you.
If you have some really difficult life situations, such as abuse or a traumatic incident, or your feelings are so overwhelming that they drive you to cut or harm yourself, the most productive place for you to express those feelings is in a safe, neutral, and nonjudgmental environment.

, Your community may have a self-injury support group. This group can be helpful in identifying, verbalizing and coping with feelings associated with self-harm.Look on the S.A.F.E. Alternatives website for listings of support groups near you.

, Some people who self-harm may be experiencing other mental health issues, such as depression,, substance abuse, eating disorders,schizophrenia, or personality disorders., If you feel that you may have another disorder that is contributing to your self-harm, talk with your doctor or counselor.

, Be truthful with your therapist about what you feel or what's been going on. Remember that he is there to help you. If you aren't honest, you might not get the treatment you really need. It's important to tell the truth. Remember, therapy is confidential, so anything you say to your therapist will not be repeated unless you are planning to hurt yourself or another.

, With an addiction, it's important to take the time to celebrate your achievements. Each day you go without harming yourself should be celebrated as a victory. At the end of your first week, celebrate by treating yourself to something or going out with friends.


Start extending the length of your milestones, celebrating at first with days, and then weeks, months, and years. You may struggle with these thoughts for a while, but celebrating your milestones can help celebrate your efforts, looking forward and looking back.

, In the end, it's up to you: If you think positive and have faith in yourself, your addiction will become a distant memory that may have left you with a few scars. Once you stop self-harming, you'll feel and think much more clearly and honestly about the world, and about yourself. Believe that others care about you, and care about yourself. You can stop.

, Sometimes you will start to think about self-harm or actually harm yourself. This is called a relapse. You can't beat yourself up over this; everyone relapses at one point or another. Remember that self-harm is an addiction, and relapses often happen during recovery. There may be times where you can't help yourself, but that only means you must continue to work hard. Just because you take one step back doesn't mean you can't take three steps forward next.

Use behavioral interventions to redirect your negative thoughts.",How to Stop Ruminating," Even negative events that happen in your life are learning opportunities. Humans learn from trial and error, which isn’t possible without some negative events to help to push us to be creative and innovative. Focus on the chance to grow and learn from each experience.Learn to separate yourself from things that happen to you. Instead of assuming bad things only happen to bad people, realize that bad things do happen every day and it is up to you how you react. You can look at the negative as just an experience that you can learn from. Don’t take the event personally about who you are overall and move forward.;
, Thinking about what’s bothering you in this way can remove some of the power of your fears. The biggest part of the fear is running every scenario through your brain to the point of exhaustion. Taking a realistic approach can help. Figure out what is the worst possible outcome and then realize that, even if it were to occur, it is not the end of the world.


This type of negative thinking can give you very real physical pain, may lead to trouble sleeping and other issues. It is important to find a way to work past the fear and live without these symptoms., Sometimes, you might ruminate after encountering a certain stimulus. Look closely at your rumination behaviors and determine which triggers are causing them. Then, find ways to remove the stimulus.


A good way to start to look at triggers is to keep a journal and write down each time you fall into this behavior. In the moment, record what thoughts or experiences started the process and this would be a trigger for you.An example of a trigger could be a visit from your mother-in-law. If you share a rocky history, you may obsess over her next unannounced visit because you fear it will end badly.

, Changing a bad habit is best achieved by locating another behavior—ideally, a healthier one—that could meet the same objective.


For example, if you tend to worry a lot about emergencies, take some time to get yourself prepared so you know even in an emergency you are OK. Put your thoughts to good use and take it a step further by helping others prepare for these events as well. It is a great distraction from running the worst case scenario in your head over and over.

, This means getting in touch with your thoughts, actions and reactions. This is also a process to that uses calming activities like yoga to move past stress and not focus on the negative.Understanding that you have a tendency to overthink things is a huge step towards being mindful because you can attribute much of your stress to this habit and not to actual events. Awareness relating to the outcomes of the stress will also help in learning to not let the stress hurt you physically.

, You may not be able to completely stop the obsessive thoughts but you can isolate them to a short part of your day.


Set aside 30 minutes each day to sit down and write about what is worrying you. Remind yourself if these worries come up during the rest of your day that you will think about the stressor only during that worry period., Physical activity can help you reduce stress and improve your mood. Exercise releases the feel-good chemicals in the brain called endorphins that you’re your mood and improve your thought processes.Taking a long brisk walk to get the blood flowing or sweating for an hour at the gym is a solid distraction and also a way to cleanse the body of toxins. Many people see sweating as a freeing process as well as it is also a natural high.

, Write about your fears and also about what really ends up happening so in the future you can compare the two. This will help to show you how much worse you make the problem by thinking the worst when it doesn’t always happen., If your obsessive thoughts are interfering with daily life, it may be wise to seek help from a professional.Treatments for rumination can include counseling, EMRD and behavior interventions. There are also prescription drugs one can take for obsessive thoughts.

, Trust a friend, especially someone who's survived similar situations. He or she may have a lot of good tips on how to handle it. Support groups of individuals with depression or rumination disorder are very good for gaining confidence and eliminating the shame or stigma associated with these conditions., Having the mindset that everything you do must be done to an ideal standard will cause both mental exhaustion and anxiety. Changing a perfectionistic attitude starts with accepting that mistakes and flaws are inevitable.Learn to spot perfectionism in yourself. Do you often have trouble meeting your own standards or only do so with immense time and effort? Do you frequently feel down in the process of trying to meet your own standards?
You can adopt a more realistic perspective by reminding yourself with certain phrases like “Everybody makes mistakes!” or “I’m only human!” Try doing this when you make a mistake or fall short of your expectations. Over time, you will be less hard on yourself.

, Change what you can and learn to accept what you can’t. Practice new reactions to stressful situations and challenge yourself over time to end the obsessive thoughts.Work with friends and family to explore ways you can let go of triggers you tend to want to control. Having support of loved ones can be nice and it also adds another level of accountability.

, You learn from both the positives and negatives in life, but for someone who is obsessing you usually focus more on the negative.Take time each day to write down three things that were really great or happy about your day. Take the time to share these “wins” with loved ones and make it a priority. You can also ask them to participate and start to have more positive conversations.

, You may not even be fully aware of how often you have these thoughts until you take this step. These interventions are geared at helping you spot your old unhealthy thinking patterns and adopt a healthier, less obsessive mindset in their place.


This can be as simple as wear a rubber band on your wrist and snapping it each time you catch yourself thinking about it when it is not time to do so. .

Use a checklist to keep things in perspective.,
Interpret others with generosity.,
See humor all around you.,
Develop flexibility.Because you never know where life is going to take you or why, ruined plans and unfinished goals might mean that something entirely different and unexpected is in store.,
Break from habit occasionally.When you take detours and let other things disrupt your regular routine, you get more and more comfortable with life's little surprises.,
Learn techniques to cope with stress.,
Express yourself through movement.,
Incorporate music into your life.,
Seek out opportunities to laugh.,
Make jokes to combat minor frustrations.There will always be little inconveniences that get in your way, but you always have the option to turn them into jokes.,
Surround yourself with fun, supportive folks.Probably the easiest way to remember to stop taking life so seriously is to get swept up in a fun-loving group of people whose very presence knocks the seriousness right out of you.,
Reflect on the pursuit of perfection.Excessive seriousness can sometimes come from trying too hard to live life in a particular way.,
Question if you’re trying to prove yourself.Sometimes seriousness happens when we see everything as evidence of our abilities and value as people.,
Consider that our culture rewards goal-orientation.,
Notice when seriousness becomes defensive.A major source of seriousness is a heightened sense of danger.,
Learn the effects of excessive seriousness.",How to Stop Taking Life Too Seriously," Shake yourself out of a serious demeanor by asking questions that will help you get your priorities straight. When you feel intense seriousness start to bubble up inside, ask yourself the following questions:Is this worth getting upset over?
Is this worth possibly upsetting others?
Is this really so important?
Is this so bad to begin with?
Is the situation really beyond repair?
Is this your problem at all?;
, A serious mentality can make it more difficult to see when things are meant to be taken lightly or in jest.You might jump to conclusions about what someone meant or did. For example, if someone points out to you that you have a small stain on your shirt, you might take them to be making a statement about your inability to look presentable. Just like that, a helpful comment is turned into an offense.


Try searching for alternative meanings beyond your knee jerk response to take people's remarks as having very serious implications. Consider that most people do not have an agenda--they are not trying to send you hints that go beyond what they are actually saying., Being able to find the humor in life is just as important as being able to see the more practical, close-ended way of viewing things.When you are tempted to think ""I'm too mature for this"" or ""Does anyone really find this amusing?"", try to find the part of yourself that can enjoy it--even if it means taking a walk in someone else's shoes.


After all, research shows that the two most desirable qualities for leaders to have are a good work ethic and a good sense of humor.Test out the idea that you can be dedicated and hardworking without being serious all the time. Work hard, play hard--right?

, We all know the old saying that life is about the journey, not the destination. So, rest easy and relax the reins since it is often the unplanned and uncertain that delivers most of the treats and surprises that you would never have thought to seek for yourself.


Try to re-envision your highest-priority goals as possible landmarks along your journey.This way, goals are not ends in themselves (this gives us that serious, tunnel-vision attitude toward them). Instead, goals are simply moments that give you the inspiration to continue making lemonade out of life's lemons.

, What's more, you experience more of the benefits that come along with the unplanned, like meeting cool new friends at a bar that you decide to take a chance on.


Even small departures from routine, like a new route to work, will remind you to pause and focus on things that you normally miss. Little changes still help us out of our heads (and thus distracted from the worries that keep us serious) and into the present moment.

, When you are stressed, you are much more likely to take things seriously; stress is when your body is poised to react in an intense way.This sets up a cycle of getting stressed from taking things seriously and taking things seriously reinforcing stress responses. Learning mental and physical methods to lessen stress is crucial. Examples include the following:Making long-term healthy lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise
Using to-do lists
Reducing negative self-talk
Practicing progressive muscle relaxation
Learning mindfulness and visualization meditations

, Loosening yourself up - literally - will make it much easier to approach life with cheery grace. There is a wide variety of movement-oriented arts that can help ease some of the bodily tension that usually accompanies a serious mind. Depending on your interests, you may want to take up dance, yoga, aerobics, or expressive arts like improvisational comedy or basic acting.


Taking a class in any of these areas might be more helpful than teaching yourself because letting loose in the presence of others can be more encouraging than trying to learn alone.

, Listening to music more frequently can be a great way to alter your mood because it helps exaggerate certain feelings.This means that if you are trying to lighten up and focus on the cheerier parts of life, listening to upbeat music can bring these brighter aspects more clearly into focus.


Try listening to up-tempo music in major keys. Any genre will do as long as it makes you personally feel relaxed and at ease.

, Intentionally giving yourself more to laugh about will help you remind yourself just how much humor lies in all situations. The following are simple ways to introduce yourself to more laughter:Watch a funny movie or TV show
Visit a comedy club
Read the comics section of the newspaper
Share a funny story
Host game night with friends
Play with your pet (if you have one)
Go to a “laughter yoga” class
Goof around with children
Make time for fun activities (e.g. bowling, miniature golfing, karaoke).

, If you don't think there's anything to laugh at when, say, you find a hair in your soup, laugh about the very fact that something so small has the power to throw such a major wrench in your plans (or make you have a little talk with your waiter...).


You could get aggravated and beat yourself up about the fact that your printer is malfunctioning, or you can joke about getting what you deserve for still using your old inkjet from the ‘90s.
Try deliberately turning a molehill into a mountain just to see how silly it is when you do so unintentionally.Rant and rage about breaking a nail or dropping a quarter down into a grate as if it were the most serious thing in the world. This way you'll get an outsider's perspective of how you may be coming off when you really are being serious.

, Take note of friends you already have and new people you meet who seem to laugh effortlessly and encourage you to do the same.


Even when you're not together, imagine what these friends would think of how seriously you're taking whatever the latest issue is. How would they respond to the same problem?
What's more, shared laughter is a highly effective way to keep relationships going strong. Laughing with others builds the same bonds of emotional sharing, but with the added dimensions of joy and vitality., Say you are highly focused on the goal of eating well, preparing only gluten-free, super-food meals for yourself. Chances are good that if somebody offers you some cake at a birthday party, you'll get stern, uncomfortable, and give a long-winded explanation about your diet. Imagine what the person who offered you the cake is thinking: ""Geez, it's just a piece of cake. What's the big deal?""


While goals are great, pursuing them with such fervor can make tiny setbacks seem like enormous hurdles, causing the things that you take seriously to become more and more minute.
Research actually exposes that perfectionism is linked with less success and productivity because it often comes along with procrastination., Remember that student who acts like every tiny assignment is as important as the final exam? Even one bad grade signals that he is a bad student, on track to fail.


When everything feels like a performance of your worth, even trivial tasks or errands become moments where you need to prove yourself.
Also try to pick up on whether or not vulnerability is difficult for you. At work and at home, we are subtly asked to put up strong fronts of high, expert functioning where all facets of life are concerned. The result is that we become reluctant to show any signs of uncertainty or emotional reactions to stress.
This can be even more pronounced if you have high expectations put upon you, or if those in your life already see you as high achieving. Are you trying to maintain your reputation of being a do-all hard worker?

, With capitalist society's great focus on efficiency and productivity, being able to set and reach goals is esteemed to the utmost.It is easy to lose sight of the fact that this is just one tactic that is particularly good for business. When it is applied to all areas of our lives, we get convinced that we know exactly what we need to do and how to get it done.


Being a product of your culture is a wonderful thing, but being aware of where this attitude comes from can help you use it more responsibly rather than compulsively.
This attitude can severely limit you ability to be a good student of the world and take what life throws at you with ease and the delight of pleasant surprises.

, After all, it's impossible to relax and take anything lightly if you're caught up assuming that you may need to defend yourself from the threat of harm. Try to ease seriousness by looking for the positive aspects in what you encounter and considering how you stand to benefit by encountering new things.


Many people are encouraged to develop a sort of overactive conscience by their parents.Even when parents' intentions are good, constant warnings of potential danger and the importance of being careful can make you see (and focus on) the serious and threatening side of everything.

, One of the main drawbacks of having a serious attitude all the time is that taking chances and thinking outside the box are severely limited.An overemphasis on seriousness lends itself to a narrow way of understanding what's worth your time and what isn't. When you ignore things that intrigue your or make you feel good in some immeasurable way, you stand to lose some of your natural ability to expand your horizons.


Ironically, being too serious can also make you even less productive by making you so nervous about one thing in particular. When we walk around with the mindset that the sky will fall if, say, dinner isn’t ready at 7p.m. sharp, we rush and neglect the joys of cooking that really motivate you to make your dishes more challenging and original.
Being serious can also impact your connections with others, making you more likely to judge and criticize what you see around you.You might love someone’s laugh, but a serious attitude will force you to realize that a nice laugh will not pay medical bills if someone gets into an accident.

Get a coaching app.,
Use a management app.",How to Track Mood Disorders Using Technology3," Some mental health providers use text messages to communicate with patients or track their moods.

Remember that you are not alone.,
Believe that you can get better.,
Refrain from seeing yourself as weak.,
Release your need to be in control.",How to Stop Suffering in Silence1," Whether you are suffering from anything from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression, you are not the only one. Though, at night, when you worry or cry yourself to sleep it feels like you are the only soul that feels this way, it's not true. Millions of people have gone through what you have, and many of them channeled the courage to get help.


One in 4 adults will suffer from a mental illness in a given year. One in 17 among them are suffering from more serious conditions, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.
Oftentimes, mental illness is under diagnosed because of people like you suffering in silence. It may not seem like those around you are suffering, but, there's a 1 in 4 chance of someone else you know having a mental illness, too.;
, You might have the belief that this dark cloud will never disappear from over your head, but it can. Mental illness can arise from a variety of reasons — genetic, biological, environmental, etc. Most cannot be completely cured, per se.However, when you seek treatment early on, the chance of recovery is higher.


Despite what many believe, mental illnesses — including depression, bipolar disorder, and ADHD — have research-backed, effective treatment approaches that allow sufferers to someday lead promising lives., One common misconception of people who suffer in silence with psychiatric disorders is the belief that they are weak. ""If I cannot handle my own mind, I am weak"". This is not true, and persisting in this belief can actually worsen your suffering over time.Mental illness is a treatable condition much like hypertension or diabetes. If you had to go to a doctor for either of these conditions, you probably would not call yourself weak-willed or weak-minded. In the same way, mental health conditions do not translate to weakness.
In reality, a person who accepts her inability to cope with life circumstances, and, as a result, turns to a professional for help, is actually strong.

, You think to yourself that all you have to do is keep it together: Stay busy. Put one foot in front of the other. Ignore the symptoms. Act like nothing is wrong. This endless desire to stay in control is built out of fear that if you stop and really notice your suffering, you might lose your mind. Ask yourself these questions to help you surrender control:What are you afraid of about your mental illness?
What do you think will happen if you give up control?
Is there a possibility that letting go and getting help could free you?

Decide how to react before you get angry.,
Look for warning signs.,
Practice stress-reducing activities.,
Question the reason for the bad mood.,
Give your bad mood a time limit.",How to Stop Your Bad Mood from Impacting Your Kids1," You already know you’re in a bad mood, and there’s a good chance your kids will do something to upset you. Before it happens, plan out how you’ll respond. Deciding now, before you are angry, allows you to respond in an appropriate way.


Write down a list of possible responses to what will most likely occur, and refer back to the list when you are upset. Adhering to your pre-committed choices can increase your chances of not taking your mood out on your kids.;
, When you are stressed, you are more likely to snap off on others or become angry more easily. If you are noticing yourself becoming more frustrated, overwhelmed, anxious, or increasingly annoyed at your children, it may be a sign that you need to take a breather and practice self-care.


Excess stress may be identified by crying spells, having headaches or other pain, withdrawing from friends and family, and having trouble sleeping.Talk to your doctor if you are overcome by chronic stress and need help managing it.

, When your kids are screaming and you feel like you’re going to implode, try a stress-reduction activity instead of acting out. Taking a few moments to concentrate on calming down can prevent you from acting in a way that makes you feel guilty and bad. It can also stop your kids from becoming more upset, which can escalate your situation and mood even further.


Breathing deep, listening to music, taking a walk outside, meditating, and exercising are just a few ways you can attempt to keep your stress levels down and not further contribute to your mood., Get honest with yourself and figure out what is contributing to your bad mood. Are you tired, hungry, lonely, sad? If so, determine why and take time to honor your feelings. Instead of resisting what you are feeling, sometimes, taking a closer look and trying to address the matter is the best way to resolve your irritation.See if you can change your circumstances. For instance, if you are a single parent who hardly ever gets time for yourself, maybe you can see if the other parent could watch the kids sometimes. Or, maybe ask a grandparent, other relative, or hire a babysitter for when you need a break.
Work smarter, not harder. You may be in a bad mood because you are taking on too much by yourself. Start learning to delegate work or household tasks to others. See if your coworker can pitch in on that big project. Teach your children to help out with some of the chores depending on their age and abilities.

, When you feel yourself start to get irritated with your children, tell yourself you’ll only be upset for a certain amount of time. However, once you make a commitment to this time, you must honor it. Giving your mood a little bit of freedom, but still reigning it in, may be just what you need to snap out of it.


Tell your children, “I’m really upset, but I’m going to go wash the dishes now and when I’m done, I won’t be angry anymore.” Saying this gives your children reassurance and lets them know you need your space."

Do a cursory search about your illness.,
Join an online support group.,
See a doctor.",How to Stop Suffering in Silence2," One of the major barriers to your getting help for a mental illness is often misinformation. By counting only on our own self-criticisms and the nonchalance of others who are insensitive to mental health suffering, our struggle worsens. Educating yourself about your symptoms or the disorder you are struggling with is the first step towards overcoming self-stigma and others' stigma.Perform a cursory online search of your symptoms or disorder to gain a better understanding of it. Be sure to stick to credible mental health sites, such as the National Institute of Mental Health, PsychCentral, or the American Psychiatric Association., Another method you can use to build up your confidence to get help and reduce stigma is logging on to a support group. These groups allow you to hear the personal stories of others who are struggling with similar issues. You might learn helpful information, such as natural remedies to alleviate certain symptoms, practical coping strategies, and get suggestions for effective treatment approaches in these forums., Most people begin with their general practitioners when it comes to finally gathering the courage to get help. Simply mentioning any symptoms or concerns you have should be an effective way to initiate a candid discussion with your doctor.Keep in mind, however, that while your family doctor may be able to offer some preliminary suggestions or even write a prescription, it's probably best to ask for a referral to see a mental health specialist.These professionals have specialized experience in treating mental illness, and can offer you the best chance at recovery.
Once you do see a mental health provider, you should discuss any natural treatment regimens with them before starting. Never try to treat yourself for a mental illness, because, even if someone has the exact same disorder as you, the way others experience that illness may vary slightly from your own experience. Always allow a doctor or therapist to fully evaluate you in order to know which treatment approaches are right for you.

Stop perpetuating stigmas.,
Get support from a friend or family member.If you are ready to tell someone what's going on, it will be enormously helpful for you to reach out for support.,
Be an advocate.",How to Stop Suffering in Silence3," Mental health stigma remains the number one reason many people do not get the treatment they need. Worrying that you will be viewed or treated negatively by family, friends, or society actually keeps you from getting better. Feeling shame about your illness or isolating yourself because of it perpetuates stigma. The only way to overcome this stigma is to build your knowledge and self-confidence about your illness by getting treatment.Research shows that when people see effective outcomes for mental illnesses and know people who have been successfully treated, they are less likely to stigmatize or discriminate.Another way to reduce stigma is to stop associating yourself with the disorder. Instead of saying ""I'm ADHD"", you should say ""I have ADHD""., Try to find someone in your life who usually supports you without judgment and share some details of what you're going through. If you're not ready for that, it's okay. You can get support in other ways — it could even just be spending time together.


You could say, ""Hey, I need to be around other people tonight. Would you be up for a Netflix binge?"" The ability for you to recognize your need, and build up the courage and skills to actually reach out is a huge part of finding support and getting through a tough time.
Remember that talking to others about mental illness is a great way to reduce stigma and misinformation.Involving others in your life might also help going to the doctor become less frightening.

, After you have become more accepting of your condition, another way to overcome your own tendency to suffer in silence is to speak out and influence others to get help, too. Research either a regional advocacy group or a national group (or both) and figure out how you can get involved.Spreading awareness and educating others about mental illness can help fight stigma and discrimination that may be keeping another suffering in silence."

Admit the issue.,
Identify your values.Your personal values are the beliefs, ideas, and principles that guide your decisions.,
Learn assertive communication.,
Use your body language to express your needs.,
Take ownership of your wants and needs.",How to Stop Suffering in Silence4," When it comes to living a satisfying life, silence about what you want is the enemy. In order to find your voice and stop suffering in silence, you must acknowledge that you are not using your voice. Awareness of the problem is the first step towards changing it. Here are some signs that you may not be using your voice:


You often get stuck with work no one else wants to do.
Other people get credit for your work or ideas.
You often do things because others want to, but not for yourself.
You feel dissatisfied because you are not living life on your own terms.

, Think of your values like a road map--they direct us down the life path that we want to be on. If you often feel like you are suffering in silence, you may be living against your personal values.


If your personal values are unclear, you can learn to identify your values by completing an inventory., Assertiveness gives you the opportunity to be more open, honest, and direct in your communication. This will allow others to recognize your needs and so that you can feel as if your voice is being heard. Practicing assertiveness can help you overcome suffering in silence and boost self-confidence.Practice being assertive frequently, in small ways, to get started. Reach out to someone every other day. Send a text or call family and friends, ask someone to coffee, or let a friend know that you need a shoulder to cry on.
You might text your friend, ""I've been feeling blue today and need a pick-me-up. Are you up for take-out at my place?""

, When you are talking to another person, turn towards them. Stand with your feet planted firmly on the ground. Have a pleasant, but firm, facial expression. Speak with a calm and soft voice, but be sure it is not overly quiet or whiney., Phrase your words in the form of ""I"" statements. This involves stating needs in a way that allows you to take ownership of them while minimizing defensiveness of others.For example, instead of saying ""You never listen to me!"", you could say ""I would appreciate it if you would allow me to finish talking before you interrupt or change the subject.""

What are some of your best qualities? Are you creative? Helpful? Kind?
What have you achieved in your life so far? Have you graduated high school? Did you ace a difficult test? Did you teach yourself a new skill?
Read this list often, even when you're not feeling down.;
, An affirmation is something you say to support or encourage someone--in this case, yourself. It may feel silly, and you may not believe it at first, but start and end your day by looking in the mirror and saying your affirmation out loud.


Write your affirmation on a sticky note a post it on your mirror. Or write it on the back of a business card and keep it in your wallet to remind you throughout the day.Some affirmations include: ""I love myself,"" ""I like and accept myself as I am,"" ""I believe in myself,"" ""I am worthy of love.""

, When you make a mistake, what goes through your mind? Do you call yourself stupid, or a loser, or say any number of negative things about yourself? The moment you start having those thoughts, you need to stop yourself. Say it out loud or under your breath or in your head: Stop. Even if that means you have to say ""stop"" every ten seconds.


Wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it every time you put yourself down.Acknowledge the thought, then imagine throwing it in a trash bin or physically getting rid of it in some way.This won't stop negative thoughts forever, but it will stop you from listening or allowing them to take hold.

, Think about all the ways you put yourself down, then imagine doing those things to a friend or loved one. Or imagine someone doing or saying those things to your best friend. Would you let them get away with that? Start treating yourself with the same respect and courtesy you would show a friend.Instead of putting yourself down when you have a problem, think about how you would help a friend in the same situation., Almost everyone does this, and it can be very destructive to your self esteem. Judging yourself against someone else--whether it's their looks, grades, personality, popularity, achievements--will always leave you unsatisfied. There will always be someone who seems to be better looking, or smarter, or cooler than you are. But these people aren't perfect, either. Focus on your strengths and what makes you great., Focusing on bad decisions and mistakes doesn't undo them. Instead, try to learn from your mistakes and do better next time. Even if you make the same mistake more than once, it's part of being human. You can recognize your shortcomings without wallowing in them.Think about the people you love and admire. They're not perfect, either. They've all made mistakes, and have regrets. But you still love them, and you still think they're worthwhile human beings, just like you.

, If you have people in your life who belittle you and put you down, your self-esteem is going to take a hit. It will be hard to lift yourself without some support in your corner. Cut negative friends out of your life and connect with people who accept and care about you.If you don't feel you can cut this person out of your life, call him out on his negativity. Chances are, he is lashing out because he feel badly about himself, too.
Set boundaries with negative family members. Choose not to engage in their negativity and try to spend less time with them.
Don't play the negativity game and put others down, too. Treating people with kindness and respect can make you feel better about yourself. It's another thing you can add to your list of your positive qualities.

, You may feel so badly about yourself that you start missing out on the things you like doing, like hiking, going out to movies, or playing an instrument. Force yourself to do at least one thing you enjoy every day.Do thing that make use of your skills or fit with your interests. If you like animals, offer to take a friend's dog for a walk, or spend a day at an animal sanctuary.Try taking a class or learning a new skill. You may meet new people and you'll feel good about your new abilities., Take a walk, go for a swim, play basketball with your sister--when you start to feel depressed or down on yourself, decide to do something active instead. Exercising releases endorphins and neurotransmitters that can make you feel better. It can distract you from your negative thoughts and help you gain confidence.Even less intense activities like gardening, yoga, or pushing a grocery cart around a storecan help with depression.Exercising can be a healthy way to cope with depression and negative thoughts. Don't use it to hide from or ignore your problems, but consider it a positive outlet for your feelings.Try setting small, achievable goals, like to walk around the block three times a week. Meeting the challenges you set for yourself can help improve your self-esteem., Sometimes a negative self-image is the result of years of being told you're not good enough, and you may need the help of a professional to get to the root of your poor self-image.

Explain your bad mood.,
Apologize when you make a mistake.,
Increase your time with them.",How to Stop Your Bad Mood from Impacting Your Kids2," Talk to your kids about the stress and anxiety you are feeling. Let them know it doesn’t have anything to do with them. The way you explain your feelings will have to depend on your children’s ages.


One example of what to say to your children is, “Mommy is having a bad day, and because of that, I may not be as happy as I usually am. It’s not because of you, and I love you very much.” If your kids are older, you can explain in more detail, but the most important thing is to let them know your anxiety and anger isn’t directed towards them., If you act out on your children, or can’t seem to snap out of it, apologize to your children. Telling them you are sorry makes them feel better, and can prevent you from feeling guilt. Along with your apology, reassure them that it has nothing to do with them.


For instance, you could say, “I’m sorry. I am stressed out and upset because I have a lot going on right now. I’m not upset with you and I love you very much.”, Although it may sound counter-intuitive, especially if your children are the cause of your mood, spending time doing something fun with your kids could get rid of your negative mindset. First, however, explain to them why you are upset and what they can do differently. Then, go do something fun to get rid of the negative feelings everyone may be feeling."

Ask yourself if your bad mood occurs frequently.,
Determine if you are depressed.,
Make practical changes.",How to Stop Your Bad Mood from Impacting Your Kids3," If you feel like you are in a bad mood more often than not, you may have a mood disorder that is causing them. Talking to a therapist may help you negate these bad feelings. Medication may also be needed to help with your mood.


You may have a mood disorder if you feel anxious, depressed, and irritable, or have feelings of fear, panic, or pain that aren’t explained., Depression can take on a variety of forms, including affecting your mood in a negative way. Feeling helpless and hopeless can cause a parent to lash out and feel upset and angered all of the time. Talking to your doctor and getting on medication or seeking help from a counselor may help you get out of your funk and bad moods., Parenting is rough, particularly if you are a stay-at-home parent or are doing it on your own. As such, you may need to make some changes in your life in order to survive and be the parent you want to be. Although making changes in your routine may be difficult, you’ll likely find that doing so is extremely beneficial.


Hire a babysitter and have a date night with your partner, or go enjoy an activity by yourself. Joining a playgroup can also connect you with other parents and allow you to make friends. Changes may also include hiring help with the kids a day or two a week so that you can find time to breathe."

Figure out how memories affect your daily functioning.,
See if dwelling on memories interferes with your relationships.,
Determine if thinking about the past affects your ability to look forward.,
Practice mindfulness to alleviate anxiety caused by bad memories.",How to Stop Repetitive Bad Memories1," Sometimes bad memories can overwhelm our thoughts and make it difficult to focus on what's happening in the present. How much time do you spend thinking about bad memories? Do the memories pop into your mind when you're trying to focus on other things?


Focusing on bad memories, or ruminating, can hurt your problem-solving skills.For example, you may feel helpless in the face of a work-related hurdle instead of tackling the problem head-on.
Ruminating can also lead to unhealthy behaviors like binge drinking or other forms of self medication intended to stop the negative thoughts.Ruminating on bad memories leads to negative thinking patterns associated with depression and anxiety.;
, If your memories are associated with a certain person, you may find it difficult to spend time with him or her without thinking about what happened in the past. Bad memories can interfere with your other relationships, too. Ruminating on the past can make you feel isolated from others.Thinking about bad memories can also inhibit your ability to forge new connections with people. For example, if you are overwhelmed with bad memories about a breakup, you may not feel open to meeting someone new., Everyone thinks about the past to a certain extent, but dwelling there too often can impede your sense of hope for the future. If you spend time reliving experiences that already happened, you have less energy to think about what's happening now, and what will happen next.


Repetitive bad memories, especially traumatic ones, can create a sense of hopelessness and make it difficult to feel optimistic. You may feel that since something bad already happened, it is bound to happen again.This can affect your ability to take good care of yourself and make plans for your own future., Mindfulness is a practice used to switch focus to the present moment, and research shows it can help relieve anxiety.With mindfulness, you acknowledge the bad memories as they come up, then mindfully choose to switch your focus to the present. In this way you can interrupt the negative thought process.


To practice mindfulness, try focusing on physical sensations you feel in the present moment. Notice the temperature of the air or the pressure of your feet against the ground. Focus on the physical feelings until you're able to stop thinking about the bad memories.
You can also practice mindfulness by repeating a positive statement to yourself. Try telling yourself, ""I don’t have to think about that right now.""

Assess your own biases.,
Keep yourself accountable.,
Recognize the negative effects of prejudice.,
Reduce self-stigma.",How to Overcome Prejudice1," In order to combat your own biases, you first need to know what they are. In social psychology there are tools used to assess implicit feelings and beliefs about different individuals; these are called Implicit Association Tests (IAT).These tests will tell you your level of inherent bias toward certain groups of people.


You can take an IAT, created by Harvard University, on any number of topics including sexuality, religion, and race. These tests can be found online.;
, A prejudice is a kind of handicap to your perspective as it forbids you to think beyond your assumptions and builds a virtual wall around your objective thinking. Your own implicit and explicit attitudes toward individuals of a different race, for example, strongly predicts how friendly you will be toward them (both verbally and nonverbally).Acknowledge your own biases and prejudices, and actively replace them with more reasonable alternatives.For example, if you think something stereotypical about a certain gender, religion, culture or race (i.e. blondes are dumb, females are moody, ), remind yourself that this is a bias against that group and that you are over-generalizing.

, In order to reduce prejudice or bias in yourself, it may be helpful to identify and understand the effects that your biases can have on others. Being a victim of prejudice or overt discrimination can result in devastating mental health effects.


Dealing with prejudice and discrimination can lead to low self-esteem and depression as well as reductions in adequate health care, housing, education, and employment.Being in a situation where someone is prejudiced against you can lead to a decrease in your self-control.Remind yourself that if you have biases against others they may lead to dire consequences for those individuals.

, Some individuals may have internalized self-stereotypes or prejudices.Self-stigma occurs when you have a negative belief about yourself. If you agree with the belief (self-prejudice), it can lead to negative behaviors (self-discrimination).An example of this would be if someone has a negative belief that his mental illness means that he is “crazy.”


Identify the possible ways you stigmatize yourself and actively attempt to change these beliefs. For example instead of thinking, “I’m crazy because I have a diagnosis,” you can change this to, “Mental illnesses are normal and a large amount of the population has them. This does not mean I am crazy.”

Recognize prejudice at play in your life.,
Accept that these prejudices are learned and can be unlearned.,
Commit to changing your personal prejudices.Implementing a change as substantial as transforming your personal prejudices requires great commitment.,
Observe your self-talk.Self-talk includes statements that we tell ourselves throughout the day.",How to Overcome Personal Prejudice1," Prejudice, when broken down, basically means pre-judgment. Having awareness that you do, in fact, make unfair assessments or judgments about others is a great starting place. Take a close look at your life and your everyday interactions. Think about the beliefs, thoughts, and opinions you have developed about others. When did these prejudices take root? What is happening to reinforce them in your life?


Researchers believe that, as early as age 3, children begin developing an attachment with their own cultural or racial group, the in-group, and unconsciously have negative views of all other groups, the out-groups.Some of these biases are learned within the home or cultural group. Others are emphasized within the media.;
, So, we know that children learn prejudice early on in life.Given that prejudice is learned, it, too, can be unlearned. No matter how long you have had certain viewpoints about other groups, it is entirely possible to change these views.


Prejudice can be unlearned with diversity education. One study found that students who took a prejudice seminar had significantly reduced prejudice and stereotypes after completing the seminar., You must truly want to change these biases with maximum effort and continue in the change process despite difficulty or loss of motivation.You can show commitment to changing your personal prejudices by developing a plan to take action. Choose one prejudice at a time that you want to change and identify methods in which you can change it. Set a deadline. Over time, check your progress.

, Bringing awareness to your personal prejudice demands paying very close attention to what you are telling yourself about different groups. In addition to helping you overcome prejudice, improving negative self-talk can also boost your self-esteem and mental well-being.Intentionally listen in to your thoughts when you interact with people from different cultural and racial groups or other backgrounds. What kinds of things are you thinking? What proof do you have that these judgments are valid?

Consider exposure therapy.,
Recall the bad memory in detail.,
Try to let go.",How to Stop Repetitive Bad Memories2," The experience of traumatic, painful, and/or frightening events can cause you to push them away in an effort to not feel them. However, letting yourself feel them may help you move forward. This exercise is called exposure therapy, in which you control your symptoms and fear of an anxiety-provoking event by thinking of it. Studies show that exposure therapy can relieve anxiety and fear associated with bad memories, but this form of treatment is best completed under the supervision of a therapist or psychologist. A therapist will be able to help you gauge your readiness to engage in the therapy and figure out how long the sessions should be. A therapist will also know how to bring you back from the memories once you are finished with the session. If you want to try exposure therapy on your own, be aware that it can make things worse. If possible, consult with a therapist to learn more about the process before attempting exposure therapy by yourself.
If you try exposure therapy and find that you your bad memories are still consistently present, seek outside help.

, Set a date and time to try exposure therapy. When you're ready, sit down and think about the event or situation. Try to remember every detail of it from start to finish. Think about what you were wearing, the sounds you heard, the smells in the air, and so on. Continue to sit with the memory for as long as you can.


Self-guided exposure may be most effective if broken down into several sessions. You may sit with the memory for just five minutes at first, noticing that you are still safe despite bringing up these painful thoughts. You might increase the time you spend thinking about it each day until you notice yourself not responding as severely as before. Over time, the memories will affect you less and less.
If you are having trouble doing this exercise in your head, grab a pen and a notebook and write down the details of the event from beginning to end. Writing a draft may be good enough for a first session. The next time you might read it aloud. If you have to stop due to crying, then always pick up where you left off. If things progress well, you will feel stronger and require fewer breaks each time you read over details of the event.
Don't hold back the emotions associated with these memories. Shout, pound on the floor or cry if you have to. Just let the feeling into your conscious mind. Soak it up, absorb your grief or sorrow.

, After you have sat with these memories, gather your strength to say aloud, ""This is the feeling that I dreaded. I've felt it and faced it. Now I have to let the feeling go, and not fight it anymore."" Sigh. Take a couple deep breaths, and just let the fear and anxiety you have been maintaining about this event go so that you can heal.Another option for letting go is holding a ritual ceremony. If your repetitive memories relate to a loved one you have lost, performing some sort of ritual like lighting candles for the person or releasing balloons can be a symbolic way of letting go of the pain. If the painful memories involve a traumatic event, you can agree to compartmentalize the pain after you have faced it, and each year on a day of your choosing you can purposely feel all the emotions relating to the event. Over time, you will find yourself mourning less.Letting go is a process and you won't be able to rid yourself of these painful memories overnight. If the memories persist, it is best to get professional help.

See a mental health professional.,
Participate in a support group.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Get in touch with your spiritual side.",How to Stop Repetitive Bad Memories3," Repetitive bad memories can be an indicator of post-traumatic stress disorder.This is a chronic condition that consists of intrusive thoughts or memories about a traumatic event; avoidance of things that make you remember the event; irrational and persistent negative beliefs about the event; and other symptoms such as a startle reflex or sleep disruption. If any of these symptoms describe the way you have been feeling, you need to contact a therapist or psychologist who has experience with trauma patients.Possible treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder include cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, stress inoculation training, and medications. If you have PTSD, your mental health provider will discuss with you possible treatment options.

, You may have reached out to friends or family about these distressing memories, and, maybe, they were able to help. Nonetheless, it can be empowering and helpful to join a support group relating to trauma, grief, or anxiety.


Such a group exposes you to others who have encountered and prevailed through distressing situations. You can learn practical coping mechanisms to handle anxiety or stress. You may also make lifelong friends.

, If you truly want to move forward with your life and overcome the fear and anxiety of what happened to you, then your social circle makes a difference. Research shows happiness can be a chain reaction. If others around you are jolly and upbeat, it just might rub off on you.Life is short! Spend it with people whose company you enjoy and who make you feel good about yourself and life.

, How you connect with a higher power or the universe as a whole is up to you. Regardless, spiritual practices including meditation, prayer, and worship can be extremely effective at relieving symptoms of anxiety and depression that may come with painful memories.Having faith in the future and working to understand your purpose in life can be life-changing during distressing times. Consider spirituality as a helpful coping resource to help you manage upsetting memories and thoughts in the future.

Surround yourself with a variety of people.,
Be around people you admire.,
Avoid justifying stereotypes when interacting with others.",How to Overcome Prejudice2," Diversity may also be a factor that contributes to an ability to cope well with prejudice.If you are not exposed to different races, cultures, sexual orientations, and religions, you cannot fully accept the diversity that exists in the world. When we really get to know someone is when we stop judging and start listening and learning.


One way to experience diversity it to travel to another country, or even town. Every small city has its own culture including popular foods, traditions, and activities. For example, people in the city may have different experiences than people in the country – simply because of the environment.

, Expose yourself to individuals different from you (racially, culturally, gender, sexuality, etc) whom you look up to or admire. This may help change implicit negative attitudes toward members from different cultures.Even looking at pictures or reading about diverse people you admire can be helpful tin reducing any bias you have toward a group they are a member of (racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, sexual identity, etc).
Try reading a magazine or book that is written by someone different from you.

, Prejudice may occur when previously held ideas are justified through stigma or stereotypes.This may occur because stereotypes are sometimes seen as socially acceptable. We’ve all heard stereotypes – good and bad. Some examples include that blondes are dumb, Blacks are athletic, Asians are smart, Mexicans work hard, etc. While some of these seem positive, they all can be turned into negatives through prejudice. If you expect a group of people to all be the same, then you may judge individuals negatively if they don’t meet your standards, which can lead to discrimination.


One way to avoid justifying stereotypes is to disagree with people when they make a stereotypical comment. An example could be if your friend says, “All Asians are terrible drivers.” This is obviously a negative stereotype, and can lead to prejudice if this person actually believes it is true. You can counter your friend’s stereotype by gently confronting him and saying something like, “That’s a negative stereotype. You have to take into account different cultures and traditions.”

Be open and accept yourself.,
Join a group.,
Get family support.,
Expect a positive or neutral outcome.,
Cope healthfully and creatively.,
Get involved.",How to Overcome Prejudice3," Sometimes when we feel threatened by prejudice or discrimination we can want to hide ourselves from the world so that no more harm can be done to us. Hiding and concealing your identity may be a self-protective measure, but also may increase stress and negative reactions to prejudice.Know who you are and accept yourself regardless of what you believe others think about you.Identify who you can trust with your personal information and be open around these individuals.

, Group solidarity can help people be more resilient against prejudice and protect against mental health issues.Any kind of group will do, but it will be especially helpful if you join a group that matches your uniqueness (such as a Women’s group, LGBT group , African American group, Religion-based group, etc). This can help you be emotionally resilient (less angry or depressed and more in control) in the face of prejudice., If you have experienced prejudice or discrimination, social support can be crucial in coming to terms with these issues and healing from them. Family support can help reduce the negative mental health effects of prejudice.Talk with your close family or friends about the injustice you have experienced.

, If you have experienced prejudice or discrimination in the past it is understandable that you would be wary of experiencing this again. However, expecting for others to be prejudiced against you, or thinking others will act a certain way can lead to increased stress.Don’t expect to be rejected.Try to look at each situation and interaction as a new experience.
Expecting that others with be prejudiced against you can become a prejudice in itself. Try not to generalize and label others as a certain way (including as prejudiced, judgmental, racist, etc). Remember that if you pre-judge people and expect them to be prejudiced, then you may be the one with the bias.

, Some people may have negative ways of coping with prejudice, including aggressive behaviors or unnecessary confrontations.Instead of sacrificing your values to cope with prejudice, use ways of coping that help to release or process your emotions related to prejudice.


Express yourself through: art, writing, dance, music, acting, or anything else that is creative.

, Being active in reducing prejudice may help give you a sense that you are making a difference.


One option is to become an advocate or volunteer at an organization which aims to reduce prejudice and discrimination.
If you can’t volunteer for an organization, you can donate money or even supplies. Many homeless shelters will accept canned food, clothing, and other items.

Manage stress and anxiety.",How to Overcome Insecurity About Your Stutter1," Stuttering often occurs because of a term called “blocking.” Those who tend to stutter on specific words often get nervous when that word is about to come up in conversation. While attempting to think of an alternate word to use, your anxiety causes you to stutter on the surrounding words anyway.


Embrace the word and practice it as often as you can. Whether your stutter is a mental or physical problem, working on getting that word or sound out frequently may put an end to the stutter, or make you feel more comfortable using it.It may be helpful to keep a log of words that you consistently find difficult so you know which words to practice. In addition, you may want to record any other factors that may cause an increase in stress and anxiety. A lot of variables can contribute to stuttering, so noting what you were doing, where you were, who you were talking to, and the topic of discussion may give you insight into what is causing your stutter.;
, Speaking in public is a fear of many and often one of a person who stutters. Whether it is speaking in front of a crowd or just talking to a stranger, the anxiety one can feel over this situation is often debilitating. Throwing yourself into the situation intentionally may help you get over this fear and boost your confidence over time.


Sign up for a class on public speaking to learn tips on how to boost your confidence and to become more comfortable when making speeches. Additionally, insert yourself into conversations at work, school, or social events. Although it may seem tricky at first, eventually, you’ll likely become a pro at this task., While you’re working on becoming more comfortable with your stutter, you can boost your self-esteem by focusing on other things you’re really good at. Building confidence in these other aspects of your life may allow you to get the courage you need to feel comfortable with yourself, stuttering and all.


Showcase your skills to help you feel more comfortable with yourself. This could mean displaying artwork, joining a dance troupe, making food for a bake sale, or whatever allows you to put your talents and passions out there., There’s no point in hiding your stutter when talking to people. Chances are, they are going to hear it eventually. Instead of attempting to mask the issue, put it out there in the open in a humorous way. Doing so may make you, and those around you, feel more comfortable about the situation.


You don’t have to use self-deprecating humor to make a joke, but you can start the conversation out with something silly, like saying, “I want to get my point across, but it may take a while, I hope you have some time.”
Sometimes, humor is the best medicine and getting the issue out of the way from the start may bring you some ease., How and what you think about yourself is huge, especially if you struggle with an issue that can make you feel self-conscious and negatively impact your self-esteem. Saying or thinking mantras daily that build your self-esteem can make you realize your self-worth. Knowing just how incredible you are, despite the challenges you face, can make you feel more confident about everything in your life.


Mantras don’t have to be long and complicated. In fact, only a sentence or two will suffice. You can repeat to yourself (aloud or silently), “I am good enough,” or “The only approval I need is my own, and I have it.”
Although it may take time, saying this to yourself should eventually help you have the self-esteem that you deserve., Stress and anxiety can often make your stutter worse, which may make you even more insecure and afraid to speak up. Try to identify how you experience stress and anxiety — Do you suddenly feel hot? Does your stomach churn? Do you get a headache? — and use techniques to cope with these feelings when they arise.

Try meditation, yoga, and exercise to manage stress and anxiety long-term.Figure out what helps reduce stress in the moment. Deep breathing, for instance, activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which can have a rapid calming effect. You might also try progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness (being present).

Travel.,
Make friends with people from diverse groups.",How to Overcome Personal Prejudice2," We make prejudice statements looking from the inside out. Can you imagine things from an alternative point of view, from the outside in?


Think about how others see your in-group(s). Are you ever unfairly judged? Are your friends or relatives treated with prejudice? How does that feel to you? What would you say to someone who made an unfair assessment of you based on a stereotype?

, Cracking open a book - either fiction or nonfiction - can ultimately help you counteract misinformation and ignorance of various out-groups, and lead to less personal prejudice. Challenge yourself to choose something that opens your eyes to a new group of people.


Research shows that people who read and identify with Harry Potter's character in the book series were less likely to demonstrate prejudice against minority groups.
Fictional books may have a greater advantage over nonfiction choices for this purpose. The researchers believe that tackling discrimination issues in a fictional world can provoke readers to truly ponder them without defensiveness and self-righteousness getting in the way., If your worldview consists of a single culture, it can be difficult to see beyond it. For that reason, travel is essential in overcoming personal prejudice.Be warned, however, that travel does not require going across the globe. Yes, going to a different country or continent can help shift your worldview, but you can also learn about different groups of people by visiting other areas in your city, other cities in your state, or other states.

, Once you have made progress in shifting your worldview, it can be helpful to open up to other groups in terms of your friendships. One researcher proposed the idea of a contact hypothesis, meaning contact with a member of an out-group can reduce prejudice.The next time you see an opportunity to strike up a conversation with a person from a different group than your own, take it. Keeping everything you have learned about prejudice in mind, aim to get to know this person. Drop your pre-judgments and allow this person to show you who he truly is.

Challenge prejudice with reality testing.When you become aware of the prejudice in your self-talk, you can take action to change these thoughts before they lead to discriminatory behavior against others.,
Try goal-oriented thinking.,
React to other's biases.",How to Overcome Personal Prejudice3,"


Ask yourself what evidence is there for or against a bias. For example, you see a blond and immediately think she may not be very intelligent. What evidence is there for this? None. What evidence is there against it? None.
It is virtually impossible to assess other's intelligence since intelligence involves many factors beyond textbook knowledge, and it certainly isn't gleaned with a mere glance. Therefore, you are making an unfair assessment of this person with little evidence to go on.

, When we are faced with the unknown, our minds may automatically retreat to the worst-case scenario. Elect to override this way of thinking by asking yourself whether it allows you to meet your objectives. When we are not thinking in a goal-oriented way, we are being negative. But, you can change this.For instance, you are walking at night and pass an African American young man. You hurry your footsteps and pat your pants to check for your wallet. Unconsciously, you think ""danger"" or ""bad"".
You can challenge this prejudice with goal-oriented thinking in addition to the reality testing. After asking what evidence you have to think this way, you could also ask yourself how thinking this way is helping you meet your objective of stopping prejudice. It's not.
Thinking this way is causing you to unfairly judge others, allowing you to play into media-driven stereotypes, and keeping you from connecting with those different from you.

, As you continue in your own change process, you must also actively challenge prejudice expressed by those around you. When an acquaintance, friend, or family member forms a pre-judgment about an individual for any reason - race, ethnic group, disability, age, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, etc. - confront them. You can use reality testing to challenge others' views as well.You might ask:


What evidence do you have to support or deny such a statement?
Are you jumping to conclusions about this person?
How can you actually find out if this statement is true rather than making an assumption?

Remember that you're not alone.",How to Overcome Insecurity," If you are feeling like you can't accomplish something, take a step out of yourself for a moment and imagine you are a completely different person. Think about what you would tell another person in your situation. For example, if you're nervous about going to a party where you don't know a lot of people or are interviewing for a new job, think about the advice you would give a person in a similar situation. If you look at it this way, you'll see that there's nothing to be scared about and that you will succeed if you put your mind to it.;
, Write down all of the things that you are worried about, and all of the factors that make you feel like you can't accomplish a thing. Read them over and ask yourself how many of them are rational, and how many are just a product of negative thinking. Take the time to really think of what's at the root of your fears -- whether it's making a fool of yourself, disappointing your parents, or not having the life you want. See how many of your fears you can tackle, and how many positive solutions you can think of for all of the things that are worrying you.


It's perfectly natural to be afraid of failure or of coming off looking bad. Everybody has these fears from time to time. It's unnatural, however, to be so plagued with worry that you feel like you can't get a single thing done.

, Instead of focusing on all the times you embarrassed yourself, failed at something, or just looked silly, you should take a long hard look at all the times that you've done really well. Think of the success you've had in school, the great friendships you've maintained, or just of random times when you made a group of people crack up because of your winning sense of humor. The more great times you remember, the more confidence you'll have that you can have more of them in the future.


It can be helpful to write down each of your successes after they happen. Keep a success journal at your desk and fill it up with proud achievements and fond memories. When you feel incapable of anything and feel like you can't do anything right, you can look over your list and remember what an awesome, capable person you are.

, And be honest with your answer. If you get a new haircut and a few people don't like it, then it's unlikely to end of the world. If you absolutely hate it, then guess what -- hair grows. Don't let these silly worries stop you from trying something different. Once you realize that the worst isn't really that bad, you'll be more likely to be dynamic and to take risks.


If you cannot tell when your responses stop being reasonable and start being ridiculous, try running it by someone whose sensibility you trust. They should be able to tell you if your worst case scenario is feasible or overthought.

, This is something insecure people don't do nearly enough. Let's say you're nervous about going on a first date with someone you're set up with. The best thing that can happen is that you and the person hit it off, and begin a meaningful and satisfying relationship. Isn't this worth going on the date for? Though the best thing ever isn't always likely to happen, having it on the table can help you approach new tasks with a positive mindset.


Before you set out to do something new, you can even write down the best thing that can happen, or the best three things that can happen, so they are fresh in your mind when the time comes.

, To keep yourself feeling secure, you need to keep your positive qualities in the forefront of your mind. Make a list of all of the things you love about yourself, from your friendliness to your intelligence, and keep it at the forefront of your mind whenever you engage with someone. Insecure people tend to focus only on the worst parts about themselves, which leads them to feel unhappy with who they are.


By only looking at the negative things that are distinct about yourself, you focus on them and neglect your positive qualities. If you have been hard on yourself for a long time, it can be difficult to think of anything worthwhile about yourself at first.

, It is especially hard to notice negative self-talk if you have been doing it for a long time. If you're always telling yourself that you're a loser, a failure, or that you can't do anything right, then you're bound to feel that way forever. Instead, work on telling yourself positive things about yourself so you're more likely to attack new tasks with a healthy mindset and a desire to do well.


A helpful exercise to get you more comfortable with positive self-talk and to rein in your self-abuse is to tell yourself two sincerely nice things about yourself for every negative thing. They don't have to be related.

For example, if you burn your tongue because you didn't wait long enough for your coffee to cool off and swear, ""Idiot! That was a stupid move,"" at yourself, you must then remind yourself, ""But I do play tennis pretty well, and I have a great sense of humor."" It may seem odd, but you are shifting your attitude when you praise yourself.



, Start saying yes more often. Instead of telling yourself all the reasons why you want to say no to a new experience, try running through what might happen if you said yes. Even if all of your no answers are true, the yes scenario could lead to new and unexpected things. If you get a little hurt after saying yes to a new experience, you can recover and you have a new experience under your belt than if you had simply said no. If nothing comes of it at all, you can be happy to think that you are the kind of positive and outgoing person who is willing to try new things.


Say a distant friend of yours from your music class approaches you and tells you they want to start a band, and they'd like you to join. Your automatic response might be ""No way, I've never been in a band and you certainly don't seem to know how to make a successful one -- besides, I don't think of myself as a musician and I don't have time with classes and...""

In this way of thinking, before anything has gone anywhere, you have already shut yourself down and denied any exploration into the potential of the idea. You could bond with that friend and their friends, get an interesting experience out of it, and have a new story to tell. Say yes and see where it leads you .



, Pay attention to the friends you keep and their attitudes about others, themselves, and you. If you start noticing that the majority of your friends are highly critical, criticizing clothing, body, decisions, speech, or behavior on a daily basis, you may want to seek less judgmental friends. Try instead to find people who have nice things to say about others and are not quick to pass judgement.


While having a few negative friends is perfectly fine, if you are surrounded by negativity, even if it is not directed at you, you are absorbing its effects. Even if your friend is pointing out the stupid looking hairstyle on someone else, if you happen to like that hairstyle, now you are feeling as though you were mistaken and losing confidence in your own opinion.

, Do not be quick to pass judgment, yourself. Trying to put others down may seem like it raises you up, but really, every time you knock someone else down, you are also criticizing a quality you possess and are knocking yourself down, too. Instead, raise others up. Not only will you have better luck making friends and having meaningful relationships, but you will also be elevating yourself.


If you find yourself condemning other's failures or decisions, think about why you are doing so. If your initial thought is ""because they're wrong,"" think a little harder. Why is it wrong? In what context? Is it your cultural background or how you were raised that makes you think so?
Would someone from another country or cultural background feel the same way? Just because someone is doing something differently than you would or is living in a way you would not choose, it does not automatically make them wrong.

, It doesn't have to be dangerous -- just go to a part of town you've never been to on your own and go into a random store. See what you find there. Try talking to the clerk. The more new and exciting experiences you rack up, the more likely you are to be excited by life instead of being scared of new things or new people. If you know that you're capable of doing exciting things every day, then you'll stop thinking that anything you try will end in failure.


If you're self-conscious about your image, try going to a clothing store somewhere out of the norm and trying on a bunch of clothes that you know don't suit your tastes. Laugh to yourself at your appearance in the mirror. You may actually find something that unexpectedly suits you. If not, you have your own familiar clothes which may seem a bit less ridiculous now. Just try new things as often as you can!

, If you hate your freckles or the sound of your own voice, then there may not be too much you can do about it. If you have flaws you can't change, you have to work on accepting them. But if there are things you can change about yourself, such as how easily you get stressed out, your lack of compassion, or your lack of conviction, then you need to take some steps to work on the things you can work on. Sure, we are all born with a certain disposition and it's hard to transform yourself completely, but you can definitely work on improving the qualities that you can improve.


If you take action to improve the things you don't like about yourself, you'll be on your way to feeling more secure in no time.
Nobody said it was easy to figure out what you want to change about yourself and then to go for it. But this is better than the alternative: forever bemoaning the things you don't like about yourself without lifting a finger to do something about it.

, One of the best ways to guarantee that you'll be insecure is to compare yourself to the people you know, or even to the people you see on television. If you do that, you're sure to find a way to make yourself feel ugly, poor, unsuccessful, or a number of other unflattering things just because you feel like you can never measure up to other people. Instead, focus on the things that would make your life better by your own standards, not by anyone else's.


If you try hard enough, you'll always be able to find someone who is healthier, wealthier, and wiser than you are. But chances are, there are many people who wish they were more like you in some ways, too. The grass is always greener, and the person who you may think is perfect and has it all together may be wishing he or she were someone else.

, One way to overcome your insecurities is to talk them over with a close friend. Having someone who knows and understands you can help you get an unbiased perspective, and can make you feel like your worries or fears are irrational. A good friend will cheer you on, tell you that you can achieve your goals, and can help you dispel any of the negativity and doubt that surrounds your life.


Sometimes, talking something out is half the battle to solving it. You may be feeling worse because you've been bottling your insecurities up inside you.

, If you want to feel better about yourself, then one way to do it is to be good at something. It can be dancing, writing short stories, painting, telling jokes, or being a whiz at foreign languages. It doesn't matter what it is; what matters is that you've devoted enough time and energy into something that you can say, ""Hey, I'm really good at this."" Making the effort to succeed at something and making the commitment to do it regularly can definitely help you feel good about yourself.


To be clear, you shouldn't aim to be the best soccer player on the field or the sharpest student in math class to impress other people. You should do it to make yourself proud.

, In general, people who are insecure take themselves pretty seriously. They are always worrying about failing or embarrassing themselves. People who have a good sense of humor about themselves and understand that everyone makes a fool of himself from time to time tend to be more secure, because they accept that they will mess up sometimes and are okay with it. You should learn to laugh at yourself, and to make jokes if something didn't go as planned, instead of worrying about coming off looking good all the time. It'll be a big relief to face the day with more laughter and less worries about everything going perfectly.


This doesn't mean that you should be super self-deprecating and laugh at your own expense all the time. But it does mean that you should treat yourself more lightly and with more forgiveness; if you laugh at yourself, people will feel more comfortable around you because they won't be afraid of offending you all the time, and you'll find that you feel more comfortable with yourself in return.

, One reason you may be feeling insecure is because you hate dealing with uncertainty. You may not know what to expect at a party, in a new class, or during a trip where you won't know many people. While you can't predict what may happen in a given situation, you can make yourself feel a bit better by gathering more information about it so you feel a bit more in control. This will help you feel more secure about what's going to happen.


For example, if you're going to a party, try to find out who will be there, what kind of things people will do there, what the dress code will be, etc, so that you feel like you have a better sense of what to expect.
If you're worried about giving a presentation, make sure you know how many people will be there, what the room will look like, who else will be presenting, and so on, so that there are less X factors for you to worry about.

, You may feel like you're the only person in the world who is constantly doubting himself or who feels like he doesn't quite measure up. However, you have to remember that everyone has felt insecure at one time or another, even supermodels or extremely successful businessmen. Insecurity is just a part of life, and if you stop feeling insecure about your insecurity, you'll already be on your way to feeling better! Everyone has something that he or she is insecure about, and your doubts are perfectly normal. Knowing this can already put you on the path to feeling better.

Accept yourself for who you are.,
Visualize successful outcomes instead of fearing embarrassment.,
Avoid second guessing every step you take.,
Don’t let someone’s negative judgment define who you are.,
Consider if a person judging you has good intentions.",How to Not Care What People Think1," Be yourself, improve yourself where you can, and accept aspects of yourself that you can’t change. Don’t try to change who you are just to please others.Make a list of all the things that you like about yourself and another of things you’d like to improve. You can ask friends and family to help you build your list, since they may think of things you might not. Think of specific steps you can take to improve, for example: “Sometimes I overreact and snap at other people. Every time someone makes a statement, I should pause before responding and think about what to say before saying it.” Keep this list somewhere you will see it often, such as on your mirror or closet door. Read over it at least once every day.
Accept things about yourself that you can’t change. For example, you might wish you were taller, but that's not something you can change. Instead of focusing on why you wish you were tall, try to think of little things that are nice about being shorter, like the fact that you’ll bump your head less. Try to think of things about yourself that other people would likely envy and want to replicate.;
, Try not to focus on failing, embarrassment, or on what other people will think if you do something wrong. If you find yourself reliving embarrassing moments, consciously redirect yourself to something you have accomplished instead. Break down goals into small pieces, and visualize yourself succeeding at each step.For example, if you want to be more confident when having conversations, break the goal into small parts: maintain eye contact, listen to the other person, nod when they make a point, ask them questions, and offer honest responses based on your own experiences.
If an outcome doesn’t turn out according to plan, try to learn from it instead of getting embarrassed. Write down what you would do differently next time to help solidify what you have learned. Remember that everything is a learning process and that no one is great at everything, especially on the first attempt.

, Try not to assume that everyone is judging every little thing you do. Before getting lost in a cycle of self-doubt, remind yourself that anyone worth your time has more to worry about than criticizing your every thought and action.Also, remind yourself that mistakes serve a purpose and are a necessary part of growth.


Do your best to notice when you start to overthink or second guess yourself. Tell yourself, “Stop over-analyzing. Calm down and don’t worry.”
Self-reflection and learning from your mistakes are good things, provided you focus on positive growth instead of negative overthinking.

, Keep a balanced perspective and don’t view a negative judgment as a permanent, absolute fact. If you think there’s some truth in their judgment, use it as an opportunity to improve instead of letting it define you.For example, suppose someone says that you have a bad temper. If you’ve barely interacted with them and they don’t know you at all, brush off their judgment. However, if they’re a classmate or coworker who spends a lot of time with you, consider why they think you have a temper. Work on developing strategies for keeping your cool, like counting while slowly breathing when you start feeling angry.

, How a person expresses an opinion of you can let you know whether you should brush it off or take it to heart. Ask yourself, “Does this person have my best interests in mind? Is this something I can work on to become a better person, or is it just a petty judgment that’s meant to insult me?”


For example, your good friend might say, “You seem to be disconnected lately - you don’t seem like yourself.” That’s a judgment you’d want to take to heart. On the other hand, you’d want to just brush it off if someone you don’t know well says, “You never pay attention - you’re so dumb!”
Also, remember that petty judgements are usually meant to make the person feel better about themselves and not to hurt you. Consider if you can find some empathy for the person and their self-esteem issues.

Such assessments, like the one from the Barrett Values Centre, are designed to help you get a better sense of the variables driving your goals and decision-making.;
, Ask yourself, “How do I want to be remembered? Am I doing the work I want to be remembered by?” The answer to these questions will probably lead you to knowing what your life's work. Once you know this, you can take the necessary steps to get yourself there, which can ultimately give you a goal and something to work on.Don't mistake your life's work for work in general. Your job or occupation does not necessarily have to be your life's work. This is the work that allows you to share your talents, strengths, and experiences with others to improve the world around you. For some, parenting may be their life's work. For others, it may be starting a business or encouraging other's to start a business. It really depends on you.
You can discover your life's work by paying attention to the things you are naturally good at, the things you absolutely enjoy doing. What can't you go without doing? Thinking about such activities can help you discover your life's work and give you a reason to go on., Adjust your expectations for life. Putting too much pressure on yourself is a sure way to not only experience failure, but to make you feel bad about yourself. It’s OK if you have to scale back on your daily goals; doing so doesn’t mean that you won’t reach your ultimate goals. You’ll just find a more realistic way to get there.Start by defining smart goals. That is, those that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.
For instance, you might say “I want to go back to school.” You will need to come up with a way to measure you progress towards this goal, determine if it is attainable and realistic for you, and set a deadline for reaching it.

, Make your strengths work for you by determining what they are, and then taking advantage of them. Using what you have going for you is an easy way to achieve your goals, and feel more motivated about the future.


For instance, if you know that your ability to talk to anyone is one of your strengths, use it when you are feeling particularly lonely: chat up someone at the grocery store or gym., Keep in your mind the picture of the end result. Seeing an image of what you are working on is excellent motivation to keep going. Whenever you want to quit, ask yourself, do you want to feel the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat? Most likely, you’ll want to know what it feels like to achieve your goal.Spend time every day envisioning your goals. Think about where you are, what you are doing, and how you feel now that your goal has been achieved. Envision this with as much detail as possible.
For example, if you are interested in losing weight and gaining more confidence, you would imagine yourself as thinner and healthier. See the foods you eat. Visualize getting sweaty during your workouts. Think about the complements you'll get from friends and family. Envisioning how you'll feel can help propel you forward and keep you on track.

, Break major goals down into smaller milestones. Doing so reduces fear, clarifies direction, and increases the probability of early successful outcomes.


Buy yourself something nice when you’ve worked out for a week in a row, or take yourself to dinner when you are half-way to your goal. Celebrating these victories keeps you motivated and helps you feel good about your achievements., Understand that the solution you had in mind may not be the correct one, but there is always another way to solve the problem. Know that there is always a way out, but it is up to you to find it.For example, if you want to go back to school, but can’t with a full-time job, consider ways you can cut back hours at work or take online classes.

, Know that comparing yourself to others and thinking negatively about yourself is detrimental and a waste of time and energy. When you start to feel yourself getting down, take time to think of the positives about yourself.


You may want to write them down and pull them back out whenever your thoughts turn crappy. Focusing on the positive instead of the negative can help you realize you have something to live for.For instance, negative talk is that which makes you feel bad or does not serve to improve your situations, like ""I'm such a loser."" On the other hand, positive self-talk lifts your mood and motivates you, such as ""I'm not were I want to be, but I have come a long way. I can do this."" Try to put a positive spin on things when you find yourself thinking negatively.

, Engage in something that you enjoy on a daily basis. Something as simple as cooking a meal or playing with your dog can provide you with small moments of satisfaction. Taking time out to do something just for you that gives you pleasure can make a huge difference in your mood and mindset about your life., Schedule a standing date with a friend or family member to go out together. Getting out of the house and socializing with others is a great way to make yourself feel better.


When you make plans with others, they can hold you accountable, as well, so it will be more difficult to cancel. If you don’t have anyone to hang out with, go to a coffee shop or similar place by yourself. Challenge yourself to make eye contact and start a conversation with a stranger. You never know, you may make friends., Commit to a healthy way of life. The better you treat your body, the better it will feel. This, in turn, can make you feel better about yourself. Eating nutrient-rich food and exercising can enhance your appearance, and ultimately, improve your self-image. Additionally, getting enough sleep can help you feel better, both physically and mentally. Your body is your temple: treat it as such., Make a list of everything in your life that you are thankful for when life starts to get you down. When you focus on what you have to be grateful for, tasks that seem overwhelming can take on a new light. When you take on an attitude of gratitude, you may be surprised with how your life can change for the better., Practice something every day that helps you get in touch with your spirituality. Spending time daily doing this can make you feel stronger in your faith, and uplift your soul.Spiritual practice can include anything you find inspiring, including meditating, praying, spending time on devotions, taking a nature walk or attending a meeting with others who share your beliefs.

Stimulate your brain.,
Practice daily meditation.,
Go outside.,
Do an aerobic exercise.,
Take a nap.,
Laugh.,
Unload with journaling.",How to Overcome Mental Blocks1," Much of your everyday brain function is unconscious, so you typically do not utilize your brain’s full capacity. By becoming more conscious of your actions and thoughts, you can maximize your brain’s function. To help do this, you can:

Go out of your way to learn new things each day. Look up the definitions of new words, complete a new DIY project, or try cooking a new dish.
Practice mental exercises, such as writing with your non-dominant hand, that challenge and rewire your brain.
Incorporate brain-boosting foods into your diet such as: wheat germ, black currents, acorn squash, amalaki, and sage, most of which contain antioxidants and/or high amounts of Vitamin B and Vitamin C.;
, Incorporating daily practices of meditation will help your entire mind and body relax, decreasing any stress built up, and improving your overall body functioning and health. Every time you have a chance to quiet down your environment, close your eyes, and bring your mind inward without external distractions, your brain gets a chance to rest and reset itself. Try practicing the following meditative steps for at least 15 to 20 minutes each day:

Go to a quiet space in your home without any distractions. Dim the lights and use soothing scented candles to help set the relaxing mood.
Find a comfortable place to sit, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and focus on your breathing as you inhale and exhale slowly.
Allow any internal dialogue or thoughts to come and go. Try not to linger on any thought, but don’t try to force it away. Acknowledge it, and just let it go.
Recite a positive and empowering mantra 3-5 times to help improve your perception.

, Nature offers a wonderful outlet to beat stress that may arise from a mental block. Plus, a bit of time outdoors can improve cognitive functioning. Take five and walk around your neighborhood or a nearby park. Or, lace up your trainers and go for a longer hike. You just might have figured out a solution to your problem when you return., If you’re experiencing a mental block, you may have been sitting at a desk or computer for a while. Get up and move your body. Complete 50 jumping jacks. Hit up the local pool for a swim. Or, go for a short run.


Research reveals that aerobic exercises like those mentioned above improve resourcefulness and task performance., Mental blocks can tire you out both mentally and physically. Rejuvenate with a quick nap, and you might experience a major boost in cognitive performance. What’s more, you can experience positive effects from both long (e.g. two hour) and short (e.g. 45 minute) naps., Whether you’re bowling over at a wisecrack comedian or watching cute animal or baby videos, laughter simply feels good. Adding some humor to your day will provide a temporary and stress-relieving distraction from your mental block. Watch a short video or call up your funny friend to reset your mind., Writing about your thoughts and feeling may not sound like a way to improve your mental block. But studies show that cognitive and emotional processing can help you view stressors in a more positive light.Grab a pen and pad and write earnestly about what you’re thinking and feeling. The process just might help you arrive at a solution, too."

Understand hopelessness.,
Recognize hopeless thoughts and statements.,
Identify where your feelings are coming from.,
Adjust your view of happiness.,
Find something to appreciate.,
Find one thing you can change.",How to Overcome Feelings of Hopelessness1," Before you can break the cycle of any negative emotion or feeling, it is important to understand what the term means. Hopelessness is an emotion which is typically characterized by a lack of hope, optimism, and passion. A person who is experiencing the emotion of hopelessness will often have no expectation that their future will improve or get better.

A person who is feeling hopeless may also have low-self esteem, low self-worth, feelings of powerlessness, have increases in isolating behaviors, and feelings of helplessness.
A person who is feeling hopeless may exhibit moods that are dark and low. They may also lose interest in prior activities, events, people or objects they once found enjoyment in, or they may not value things which were important to them before.
Hopelessness is very closely linked to poor mental, cognitive, emotional, and physical health.;
, It’s important to recognize when you or someone around you is feeling hopeless. Some examples of hopeless thoughts you may have, or statements you may hear a friend or loved one who is experiencing feelings of hopelessness make, are:

There is no future for me.
It will never get better.
No one and nothing will be able to help me.
I’ve already given up.
I am a lost cause.
I have no hope.
I will never be happy again.

, Realize that your feelings of hopelessness may be a symptom of other mental health concerns that may not have been addressed. Additionally, the feelings of hopelessness could also be a result of feeling discouraged, dissatisfied, distressed, or experiencing negative events. Take stock of your life, and think about whether a particular situation is causing you to feel hopeless.Loneliness, chronic illness, and low self-esteem are just a few of the common causes of hopelessness.
Hopelessness is also listed as a symptom for several behavioral and mental health concerns, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, substance dependence, and suicidal ideations.

, Examine your current assumptions about happiness. Ask yourself whether you’re waiting for a new job, a significant other, or some other external influence to make you happy. If so, try shifting your focus to yourself instead. Realize that you don’t need anything outside yourself to feel content with your life.Inner happiness can’t come from outer sources. If you aren’t happy now, you won’t be happy when your circumstances change for the better, either.

, Even if you feel miserable today, look for something that you can enjoy. It doesn’t have to be big. Insignificant things that you might take for granted are often the easiest to enjoy when you’re feeling hopeless.For example, you could take a moment to appreciate the free coffee at work or the wildflowers growing along the side of the road.

, Making changes in your life can improve your outlook, but when you’re stuck in the depths of hopelessness, it’s not easy to take action. Start small by identifying just one thing you can do to improve your life. It doesn’t have to be a big change, just something you can do on a regular basis.For instance, maybe you could wash your dishes right away after you cook, apply to one job every day, or start going to bed before midnight.
Hopelessness thrives on the idea that nothing will ever change. Challenging this belief will help you start to feel better.

Join a support group.,
Confide in friends and family.,
Find friends who are like you.",How to Overcome Insecurity About Your Stutter2," No one knows the struggle you are going through like someone who is experiencing it themselves. Sure, those around you can sympathize, but they don’t actually know what it is like. Talking to and surrounding yourself with others who stutter can help you realize you’re not alone, and can give you the support you need when you’re having a rough time.


A variety of support groups are available for those who stutter. Look online to find when a group meets in your area, or join one on the Internet if you are more comfortable with that venue. , Talking to your friends and family about your fears and insecurities may make the situation easier for you. It may also give them a glimpse as to what you are going through. As such, they may be able to offer you support, or have a better understanding of what you are experiencing.


If you’re having a problem with the people in your life ridiculing you, be open and honest with your friends and family about it, particularly if they are the people who are doing the talking. Explain what is going on and how you’ll need them to stop criticizing you and start understanding and defending you, instead. , Being around other people who are like you can help you feel less alone. This is especially important and comforting to children who are struggling with stuttering. Finding friends who share the same obstacles may make them feel more comfortable about themselves.


Look for camps and other social groups that are targeted towards adults or children who stutter. A quick Internet search or a talk with a doctor can likely put you in touch with this type of resource."

Practice at home.,
Work with a speech language pathologist.,
Seek help from a therapist.",How to Overcome Insecurity About Your Stutter3," If you are a youth, you can benefit from being helped with speech issues at home. Working with your parents is often more comfortable than working with a stranger, so this method may remove the pressure. Even adults can benefit from practicing their speech in a familiar environment.


Speak slowly and calmly. If stuttering is caused by thinking you have to hurry while talking, it can help to speak slower and pause in the places where punctuation marks are in sentences.
Talk openly about your stutter with loved ones. It’s not something to be ashamed of or hide, but something you can work on., Many adults and children benefit from the help of speech therapy. Seeking the help of a speech specialist may teach them how to adjust the way they communicate, which may ultimately stop or decrease the amount of stuttering.


A speech pathologist may help you to stop stuttering by working with you to slow down your rate of speech. They may also encourage you to learn to say words differently, or in a more relaxed manner. Speech therapy may also help you adjust your breathing, which could result in a decrease in your stuttering., Cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful for adolescents and adults to eliminate stuttering. The therapist often works with the patient to help you overcome anxieties that may cause the speech disorder. It may also help you change the way you think and speak.


Electronic devices that provide delayed auditory feedback may help you with the stuttering. They require patients to slow down their speech or the speech they hear will come back distorted. Another type mimics the speech of the person wearing it so that is sounds like they are speaking in unison with another person."

Get the facts from multiple sources.,
Decide if a person is informed about a topic.,
Avoid faking agreement just to please others.",How to Not Care What People Think2," When forming an opinion on something like a news topic, try to look for multiple sources. Read articles published by different news outlets, and try to include perspectives that challenge your own beliefs. Try to gather your own information rather than instinctively agreeing or disagreeing with what someone else thinks.For example, your parents might have an opinion about a news story. Instead of just agreeing with them because they’re your parents, you might search online to find articles on the subject from multiple news bureaus. After reading a few perspectives on the topic, you can form your own opinion based on what you’ve learned.

, Before getting too concerned about what someone thinks, consider their expertise and the way they express their opinion. If your teacher wrote their graduate school thesis on a particular historical event, you’ll want to value what they think over someone less informed.In addition to considering the source, think about its package: is someone informed about a subject speaking to you in a clear, thoughtful way? Or are they just hurling insults and criticizing your opinion just for the sake of disagreeing with you?
You may also consider whether someone might have a personal motivation for feeling one way or another.

, Don’t be afraid to have an opinion that goes against the norm, especially if you've put time and thought into forming that opinion. Balance evidence with your gut instincts instead of trying to conform and satisfy others. Respect what others think, and accept that not everyone will think the same way you do.For example, if you prefer dogs over cats, don't pretend to like cats more just to please your friends who think cats are better. You should form your own opinion, even if all of your friends prefer cats.
It can be healthy to challenge your core beliefs, but you should avoid compromising them just for the sake of popularity. For instance, if you were raised in a religious tradition, you might find that a healthy dose of doubt will deepen your faith in the long run. But that doesn’t mean you should change your beliefs just because someone criticizes them out of ignorance.Also, keep in mind that it is okay to disagree with people. You can express your opinion in a non-challenging manner and listen respectfully to their opinion as well. However, it is important to consider your goal for the conversation before moving forward.

Work on getting in touch with yourself.,
Make decisions based on your own values.,
Represent yourself in ways that make you happy.,
Create an inspiration folder to get in touch with your own style.,
Remember that taste is subjective.,
Avoid uninvited judgments.",How to Not Care What People Think3," Consider the similarities and differences between how you act in private versus when you're around lots of people. Ask yourself, “How do I represent myself to strangers, to people I’m more comfortable with, and to myself?”Try to think of what really makes you who you are. Write down a list of character traits that are important to you, like honesty, loyalty, or humor. You can also ask trustworthy friends and family members to help you think of things.
Spend some quiet time reflecting on your traits, talents, and favorite things. Try to develop an appreciation for what makes you a unique individual.

, Make choices that are consistent with your priorities instead of doing what other people think is cool. For example, suppose your friends want to go to a party and get drunk, but you have a soccer game the next day, and soccer is really important to you. Instead of going to the party just to look cool, choose to be well prepared and well rested for your game because it's important to you.Do not feel like you have to defend yourself or your values to other people!

, Think of how to incorporate your interests, likes, and dislikes into your clothes, surroundings, and lifestyle choices. Focus on creating a style that makes you happy instead of just going for what's trendy or popular.For example, if you find that you love to mix and match patterns in your wardrobe, don’t be afraid to wear what you love just because of what one person might think.
Decorate your apartment or room with knick-knacks that have sentimental value, even if someone suggests you should use trendier items or go for a more minimal look. On the other hand, skip out on decorative objects altogether if you can’t stand clutter. Just go with whatever will make your space most livable for you.

, When developing your sense of clothing style, check out fashion magazines and blogs to search for inspiration. Save or cut out images that motivate you, and use them to put together a digital or paper ""look book"" or inspiration folder. Using your new library, assemble looks that make you feel unique and confident.Signature items like a particular piece of jewelry, scarves, funky hats, or pattern can also help put a unique stamp on your style. Think of a specific item or aesthetic element that makes you happy and expresses something you love about yourself. For example, if you love sailing or boats, maybe an anchor necklace and bold nautical stripes would be a unique touch., If someone says something about your taste, remember that their style opinion isn’t the final word. Taste is subjective, and you might not love everything about their fashion or decor. Variety is a great thing: imagine how boring it would be if everyone’s clothes and houses looked exactly the same!While it’s great to dress in a way that expresses your individuality, remember to consider degrees of appropriateness for every situation. Dressing professionally or in accordance with the dress code at work will probably earn you more respect than wearing a tee shirt and ripped jeans., Social media is a great way to stay connected with people. However, it also gives people plenty of opportunities to judge your lifestyle choices. For example, if you don’t want to invite people to criticize your clothes or image, consider sharing fewer selfies on social media platforms.You can also unfollow or unfriend people who are judgmental, rude, or who make you feel bad about yourself.

Explain what you’re doing to someone else.,
Divide the project into smaller parts.,
Start at the end.,
Get feedback.",How to Overcome Mental Blocks2," Sometimes, when you hit a wall, the best way to address it is by going in a different direction. Experts suggest learning something new to overcome mental blocks, so take advantage of this advice and force your brain to look at the problem in a novel way.Try to walk a friend through what you’re doing. Encourage them to ask questions. Having to step back and view your problem from a different perspective may help you derive at a creative solution.

, You can experience a mental block due to feeling overwhelmed by the size and scope of a project. If this is happening to you, stop looking at the project as a whole and focus on one part at a time. Doing this relieves stress and boosts productivity.For example, if you are tasked with building a website, you might start by getting a sheet of paper and drawing up a rough draft of what you want it to look like. Then, go in and build the basic structure, add security and software, and then add content and finishing details.

, It may seem counterintuitive, but one way to get some perspective on your problem is by reconnecting with the desired outcome. You may have hit a wall because you are getting caught up on details. If this is the case, it can help to visualize your end goal and disregard the details for the time being.Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Now, use your senses to envision yourself accomplishing your desired goal. For instance, if your goal is to write a book, see yourself sending a final manuscript to a publisher. Imagine all the energy that you feel around you and inside you—the sounds, sensations, and sights.
Once that image is firm in your mind, envision the process of getting there. See yourself completing every single action from outlining and researching to revising and designing a cover jacket.

, Another method for changing the way you’re looking at your problem is by seeking out advice. This may seem like an obvious solution, but many people overlook the resources at their fingertips. Activate your social network and reach out to a few friends or colleagues who may be able to help.You might say, “I’m working on a project and seem to have a hit a wall. Can you offer any advice?”

There is a correlation between an uncluttered work environment and enhanced creativity. So, if your work space is cluttered, try doing a quick de-cluttering., There’s a reason the vision board trend has taken off with everyone from creative professionals to travelers. Seeing your goals everyday can have a miraculous impact on your actions towards reaching them. In your case, creating or reviewing your board may offer inspiration to help you overcome a mental block.If you don’t already have a board, create one using inspiring quotes, song lyrics, photos, colors, fabrics, or anything else that relates to your project.

Be present in the moment.,
Set achievable goals.,
Get social support.,
Get moving.,
Eat a clean diet.,
Avoid using alcohol and drugs.",How to Overcome Feelings of Hopelessness2," Practice being mindful by focusing on the here and now. Notice the sensations you feel in your body and the thoughts that pass through your mind. Don’t judge yourself or worry about the future – just observe. Mindfulness can help you separate yourself from your feelings, which makes it easier to respond to them constructively.

, Making regular progress at something can lift your mood. Set small, manageable goals and work towards them on a regular basis. Don’t give yourself big, overwhelming goals, or you may feel like you’ll never reach them and get discouraged.Some good goals to set might include applying for two new jobs or completing one task for work or school every day.
If you want to set a big goal for yourself, break it down into smaller sub-goals so you can see your progress more easily.

, Spend time around other people, especially those who care about you. Reach out to your family and friends or meet new people by volunteering in your community. Talk about how you’re feeling instead of bottling it up.Don’t isolate yourself, even if you want to be alone. Isolation makes feelings of sadness and hopelessness stronger.

, Exercise is a powerful mood booster. Aim to get thirty minutes of moderate activity every day. Cardiovascular exercise is best – try going for a walk, run, or bike ride in the fresh air.Consistent workouts are better than intense but infrequent workouts, so don’t push yourself too hard.

, Stay away from highly processed foods, which can contribute to a low mood. Instead, focus on keeping your blood sugar stable and getting plenty of nutrients. Make vegetables and fruits, lean protein, and whole grains the foundation of your diet.Deficiencies in B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids may be linked to mood problems. If you’re not getting enough of these nutrients in your diet, consider taking a supplement.

, Mood-altering substances may help you escape your feelings temporarily, but they will only make you feel worse in the long run. When you’re dealing with feelings of hopelessness, it’s best to avoid alcohol and drugs completely.If you’re struggling with addiction, help is available.

Think about your other symptoms, such as excessive fears or worrying, confusion or loss of memory, detachment from reality, withdrawal from loved ones, trouble understanding and relating to other people and situations, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, or excessive anger, hostility, or violence.Hopelessness is linked to major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, substance dependence, and suicidal ideations.

, A mental health professional can help you figure out why you’re feeling hopeless, learn strategies for identifying and coping with negative thoughts, and set goals for the future. Cognitive behavior therapy is one of the most effective treatments for mental illness. It targets a client's negative thoughts and assumptions, and build a person’s self-esteem and sense of empowerment., Medications aren’t right for everyone, but they’ve helped many people cope with mental illness.

Meditate.,
Listen to music.,
Practice yoga (or another calming physical activity).,
Chant.,
Allow yourself to daydream.",How to Mentally Escape from Reality1," Meditation is a fantastic way to clear your mind and escape reality; it is traditionally used to make the mind calm and peaceful.Proper meditation enables you to take your mind into a calm space and put reality on hold.. The best part is that meditation can be done in the comfort of your own home (or even bed) and requires no prior training or monthly membership.


Choose a peaceful environment, preferably one without distractions. The temperature should be comfortable, it should be as quiet as possible, and you should be able to be alone for 30 minutes.
Find a comfortable position. Many people like to lay on the floor with their bodies relaxed, their feet pointed outwards, and their palms facing upwards. There is no “right” position in which to meditate, so find a position in which it is comfortable for you to lie still. You can also try the lotus position.
Close your eyes. This allows you to tune out anything that is going on around you. If necessary cover your eyes with a mask or a towel. If you are in a noisy place, it may help to wear earplugs. Think of nothing. Relax completely, let your mind go free.
Be aware of your breathing. Don’t necessarily try to control your breath, but simply breathe and be aware of it.Expect good meditation to take practice. At first, it is almost inevitable that your mind will wander. However, with practice, you will be able to completely clear your mind during your period of meditation. When your mind does wander, bring your focus back to your breath.Consider using downloadable meditation programs. Simply go to Google or YouTube and search for “meditation.”;
, Listening to music is a fantastic way to clear your mind and make a mental escape from reality. Music has been scientifically shown to affect many different areas of the brain, and it can actually help you achieve self-awareness and regulate your mood.It is also a commonly used tool to engage in escapism.


If you are unsure of what type or genre of music to listen to, you can try to listen to ambient music or binaural beats.For example, try Dr. Christopher Lloyd Clarke’s relaxation music or The Tranquil Harp: Improvisations for Relaxation, Meditation, Integration by Paul Baker.If you desire something different, try classical music, such as piano concertos, or listen to Gregorian chants.
For something more lively, try listening to drum and bass music that has no lyrics.

, In addition to having physical benefits, yoga has mental and psychological benefits as well. It is an activity in which the participant focuses on breath and body instead of on the worries and stressors associated with reality.Yoga is a great way to have some personal time, clear your mind, temporarily escape your reality, and get a workout in as well.If you’ve never practiced yoga before, do a Google search to find a studio around you. Attend a class for beginners, and try to incorporate yoga into your routine. Many yoga studios will allow you to attend a trial class for free.

Talk to the instructor of your first yoga class. He or she may be able to make some recommendations for types of yoga that will help you with your goal of mentally escaping reality.


To make your own ‘yoga studio’ all you need is a yoga mat, water bottle, and a room that gives you space to lay out your mat. Pick up the necessary accessories from a local store, and ] on your own in the comfort of your own home.
Keep in mind that you may not feel the sensation of escaping reality the first time you try yoga. It will take consistent practice to make yoga an activity that helps with your mental state.

, Chanting can be a powerful way to temporarily escape from reality. Performing chanting, or mantra meditation can allow you to mentally “remove” yourself from your mind, thereby mentally escaping reality.


Chanting inspires a “relaxation” response. This means that your heart rate, brain waves, and respiration will become slower.This physical response can actually make you feel like you are leaving reality behind.
Chanting the mantra “Om” is said to be extremely calming to the mind, actually inciting the release of relaxing hormones.This is because the “Om” sound sends vibrations through your lips and palate and into the back of your throat.

, Daydreaming constitutes the ultimate mental escape from reality, but many of us don’t have the time to allow ourselves to drift into a daydream world. Daydreaming not only helps you mentally escape reality, but also plays an important role in allowing us to recognize our own potential, achieve a greater sense of identity and personal meaning, and enhance our self-control and creativity.Allow yourself to daydream when the external environment is undemanding.This can be while you’re running on a treadmill, sitting in a traffic jam, or ironing clothes.
Let your mind truly wander. This means that you shouldn’t try to control your daydreams- there is no “right” or “wrong” daydream to have.
Keep daydreaming. Studies show that we daydream less as we get older.However, this should not be so: daydreaming is the easiest way to mentally escape reality and requires nothing more than some time alone with your thoughts.

Learn the principles of customer service.",How to Not Care What Others Think of You," There is a simple exercise you can do that helps you care more about yourself and better appreciate the power you have as an individual. It only takes a few minutes and has been proven surprisingly effective in psychological studies:


Make a list. Write down a short list of different topics of interest in your life. Don't write specifics for now. Just make a list that covers general areas of your life that include you as an important element.

A typical example might include the topics “religion, family, school friends, work friends, romantic relationships, artistic ability, musical ability, academic performance, athletic ability.”
Try to come up with categories based on the general divisions you would naturally make in your mind.


Find a point of pride. Pick one category on your list that you have always been especially proud of. For example, maybe you believe you have been (or would make) a wonderful girlfriend or boyfriend. Perhaps there is a subject in school that you have always been particularly interested in. Go with whatever comes to mind based on the list you made.
Write about it. Write your chosen category at the top of another piece of paper, and then spend a few minutes writing about one particular time or instance when it was important to you, and why it was important. If you believe you are a very good friend, write about a time that you went out of your way to help a friend out; if you've always loved playing the guitar, write about a time your guitar playing made a positive impact on your day.;
, More than just a one-time step, centering yourself is an ongoing process that yields consistent benefits. Exactly what it means to center yourself varies slightly depending on who you ask, but the general consensus is that it means refocusing your priorities to be more in line with your personal beliefs. Try these popular centering techniques:



Meditation is probably the most common centering technique, and one of the most effective. Simply stand or sit comfortably in a place with no distractions, and focus on clearing your mind.

Some people find it useful to focus their thoughts inward on themselves, while others prefer to focus their thoughts outward into the world at large.
Whichever way you choose, put yourself in a mental place where you can see the elements of your life more clearly and observe them without getting confused or overwhelmed.



Visualization often goes hand-in-hand with meditation, but can also be done in just about any place and at just about any time. Visualization is the practice of using imagery to help guide your thoughts.

Spirituality often informs visualization, as people will envision themselves being lifted by angels out of their own bodies, or growing deep roots and becoming a part of the Earth.
Other common motifs include floating in space, or traveling through a portal into a different time or place. Go with whatever attracts you.
Clear your mind for a moment and visualize a scenario that lets you feel calm, free, and unashamed, and use that scenario any time you need to visualize in the future. It will become like a good friend to you, a safe place for your mind to go when you are feeling overwhelmed.



, Make a small journal and write down everything you did at the end of each day before you go to sleep, including meditations.


Write down everything. Even mundane things like “went to school” and “washed dishes” should go into this journal – anything that you technically had a choice about doing, and chose to do anyway.
Take pride in your achievements. When you do something you're particularly proud of, such as passing a test or finishing a project, feel free to write it into your journal with some kind of extra mark to show that you are proud of it.
Lean on your words. Keep your journal to yourself and read over it at the end of every week. It will remind you of all the things you do every day to maintain and improve your life, and serve as proof that your voice deserves to be heard as much as anybody else's.

, Now that you are taking steps to affirm and nurture yourself, it's time to translate those good feelings into action.


Be civil, but be firm. The next time you're asked to do something you don't really feel like doing, politely decline the request.
Enjoy the results. You'll be pleasantly surprised to find that when you stand your ground in a civil manner, people usually respect your choice and drop the subject.
Don't sweat excuses. You don't need an excuse to say no. Courteous excuses are all well and good, but often, not wanting to do something is as simple as not wanting to do it, and that's okay.

The sole exception is times when you are shirking your regular responsibilities (for example, refusing to perform a regular task at work).


Feel free to explain yourself. If you do have a concrete reason for not wanting to do something, and you can explain it quickly on the spot, go ahead and do so. There's no harm in explaining your thought process. Just remember that you don't owe it to anyone as a matter of course.

, You've rediscovered things about yourself that you can be proud of, lessened the influence that the opinions of others have on your self-image, found time to track your achievements and center yourself every day, and learned that you can say no without dire consequences. You're ready to truly be yourself with everyone around you.


Embody your new self. Act from your personal center whenever possible, take time to sort things out when you become upset, and let your presence, rather than your actions, please the people in your life.
Arm yourself with knowledge. Read the subsections below for useful advice on handling different social environments.

, You might be surprised by the positive reaction you'll get when you say what's on your mind and act according to your beliefs. People like people who do their own thing and go their own way.


Be yourself. You don't have to make an effort to stand out – just stop making so much of an effort to fit in.
Don't take any shade. There will often be a small minority of people who will be critical of your new found poise and presence. Their words may sting, but you can handle it.

Use visualization and meditation to review what's being said and who is saying it. Generally you'll discover that it's a tiny percentage of your overall peer group, and people you don't even like or respect very much to begin with.



, Work to surround yourself with people who accept you.


Let your bad friends go. Since you have always bent to the wishes of others in the past, you may find that some of your friends don't like that they can't take advantage of you anymore. Leave them behind and seek out people who like you for your personality instead.
Count on your good friends. With the support of those who like you for who you are, it will be much easier to handle the few people who don't like your new backbone with grace and calmness.

, Take extra time to practice feeling good. You are who you are and that's okay.


Stand your ground. Family members have a level of power over your emotional state that only you can match, but you can indeed match it if you focus and give yourself the support you need.
Control your inner voice. Silence the voice in your head that agrees with familial criticisms and adds on to them.
Keep your perspective. Remember, nobody is perfect, but you're at least as good as anybody else, and not even members of your family have the right to say otherwise.

, This is your family – you can't choose them, for better or worse. While there are times it is prudent to say nothing, the root of the problem will have to be addressed at some point.


Draw a line. Caring what your family thinks of you is normal and healthy, but only to a point. If you feel like there's too much pressure on you to make other members of your family happy, speak up.
Stay poised. Be calm and methodical, and ask your family to help you be free to be yourself. They may not even have realized you felt so much pressure.

, When there's no other choice, the fine art of saying nothing at all is quite useful in dealing with the opinions of family members who won't stop hurting your feelings.


Hang tough. If nothing else, you can at least learn to bear hurtful words from your relatives silently in the heat of the moment. Work it out for yourself later in meditation or around a good friend instead.

, Like it or not, a big part of keeping your job and making a good impression at work boils down to caring what others – particularly your bosses and your customers – think of you. Work is not the place to let your freak flag fly, in most cases.

Take a moderate approach. Try to balance your responsibility to the job with your individuality so that you don't have to feel as though you're being crushed under the weight of expectations.







, Caring less about what others think of you doesn't always translate to doing and saying whatever you want, especially on the job. Instead, channel the part of yourself that politely and thoughtfully has different ideas and approaches.

Enjoy the results. As with your peers, you will probably be pleasantly surprised by the change in treatment you will receive when you stop being a “yes-man” (or woman) and start being a constructive contributor instead.
Look on the sunny side. With some luck, your independent spirit might even get you noticed for a raise or a promotion.







, These are not very difficult to understand, but internalizing them can take time. The principles are not only for strict customer service jobs; they're quite useful in any situation (such as the workplace) where it is often imprudent to speak your mind, even politely. By embodying them, you will learn to separate your emotions from the work you do, making it easier to worry less about what the people around you think of you. They are as follows:

Keep your personal life to yourself. Leave your private life at home, and you won't bring any insecurities or vulnerabilities with you to the workplace.
Don't dwell on anything the people around you say or do. Don't take anything personally or let anything fester. Don't gossip if you can possibly help it. Be a smooth piece of the workplace machine and you won't encounter any resistance.






Be glad to see each new face every day. Smile and say hello every time until it becomes a habit.
Give people the benefit of the doubt. When a customer or coworker lashes out at you, not rising to the bait will often defuse their anger before it has a chance to manifest a second time.
When in doubt, get a manager and let him or her handle the issue. If a manager is the issue, get that manager's manager.

But in that case , spend few hours alone with the nature . Go out for a walk . Think why you are discouraged ? Talk to yourself . And enjoy the cool breeze of the nature , chirping of birds and rustling of nature . Just dilute yourself in it .;
, Your biggest mistake is that you are letting that discouragement to fill your mind . There's only one person who can truly understand you and it is YOU . Don't care of things or persons that discourages you . Bury them somewhere .

, Don't believe something that someone else said. Just keep minimizing that thought and throw it out of your brain.

, You are special . You are different . You are strong . Live every moment as it will be your last . Your life , your way of living . And you must know that there is always someone who will care for you and will always love you . (If you are a Christian know that no matter what Jesus always loves)

Build your opinion of yourself.,
Do the things that you want to do.,
Allow them to reject you.,
Realize that it won’t matter in the long run.",How to Not Care1," Don't care what people see in you. Oftentimes, the reason we care what others think of us is because we see ourselves through their eyes...but it’s not good for us to base our opinion of ourselves solely on what others think of us. The best thing you can do to not care what others think of you is to build your opinion of yourself. Do things that make you proud of yourself so that no matter what they say, you know that you are a good, worthwhile person.


Volunteering is a wonderful way to make you feel good about yourself while also providing invaluable support to your community.
Learn a skill, like drawing, playing an instrument, or playing a sport. Tired of being that loner guy who no one talks to? Be that guy who plays killer bass.
Travel and see things that you want to see. Traveling will make you more confident and give you wonderful memories and stories to tell for the rest of your life.
Put effort into the things you do. If you try hard at school, work, sports, housework, etc, it's easy to not care what others think of your performance. When you know that you did your best, don't care about anything negative anyone says.;
, Don’t let the opinion of others stop you from doing the things that you like to do. Your happiness shouldn’t hinge on their approval. Ignore them and you will find that the more time you spend doing whatever you want, regardless of what they say, the less you care. You will enjoy yourself so much that you’ll find you simply don’t care any more.


Pursuing things that make you happy is also a great way to meet people who think like you do and like the same things. These new people will celebrate, rather than judge, the things that you love!

, A great step towards not caring when people judge you is to just let them judge you. Let them judge you and, in experiencing that judgement, you will see that it isn’t the end of the world. You still get up each day and you can still do all the things that you want to do. Their opinion doesn’t actually impact your life.


There is especially little point in fighting their judgement because it will be almost impossible to make them stop. The people that most harshly judge you are usually those that most harshly judge themselves, and they will continue to judge you because it makes them feel better. They have issues, but don’t let their issues drag you down.

, It is also important to remember that these people have problems and lives of their own. In five years, they probably won’t even remember you, much less all the things about you that they didn’t like. Their opinions won’t impact you at all just a few years from now. If you spend the mean time enjoying your life and taking advantage of your opportunities, you will be much happier in the long run than if you waste a bunch of time trying to gain the good opinion of people you probably won’t even see any more in a few years."

Accept your feelings.,

Practice rhythmic breathing.,

Learn to induce a trance-like state.,
Experiment with suffering meditation.,
Talk to your doctor if you're struggling.",How to Not Feel," If you feel too strongly, you need a plan to strengthen your sensitive spots. Get real about the things that affect you, the things that make you uncomfortable. What bothers you? What pushes your buttons? Consider the following questions, as specifically as possible:


What do you love the most?
What creates the strongest feelings in you?
What makes you cry, or feel like crying?
What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? The ugliest?
What would you like to avoid at all costs?
What is the most important thing in your life?
What could you never do without?;
, Find your raw nerve. Is it a fear, an attachment, or a devotion? Whatever the case, try to expose yourself to that thing as much as possible. Give it less power in your life. Confront it.


Think of it as facing your fears. If something causes you to feel too much, you can learn to desensitize yourself to it. If you watch a hundred horror movies, the hundred-and-first will be much less scary.

, If you're scared of dogs, make a visit to the pound once a week and just be in the room with some. Pet a gentle little one when you get the chance and work your way up to taking a bigger dog for a walk. If you're scared of horror movies, start with something PG-13 and work your way up to the really graphic ones.

, Experiencing strong emotions will help you become less affected by them. You may even start to like that hundred-and-first horror flick. And once something has less power? You've got the power to get rid of it. You've got the power to forget it.


If you can't stop thinking about an ex who brought you great pain, look through old photos. Remembering the good times, one last time. Then create a box in your mind and burn those memories. Burn those photos.
Treat it like a serious ritual, as silly as it may feel or sound. Say out-loud, ""This is the final time that a horror movie will bother me. I will never fear another, and I never need to see another."" Discard the photos for real.

, Your feelings are your own business. Listen to your own voice and your own instincts. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for caring deeply about something. There's nothing uncool about your passions.


Only keep friends who support you and bring positive energy, not friends who criticize or tease. If your friends don't, get new ones.

, If you struggle to rein in your emotions, distract yourself with other things instead. Don't control them, outrun them. If you stay more active than your emotions, you'll hardly even notice them.


Some people may come across as cold or unfeeling, because they're drowning in work. Keep your schedule as busy as possible, your time as occupied as you can. Get busy.
Pick up a new hobby, if you're struggling to think of things to do. Play an instrument, pick up a new sport, or take up some kind of collection. Always be active in something, working toward a goal.

, ""Not feeling"" doesn't mean ignoring your emotions, or repressing them. If you feel negativity, accept it. If you feel love, accept it. Strive to be fully aware and present in the emotions you experience.


Your feelings will always be a part of you on some level. Even the Dali Lama gets angry occasionally, and the toughest MMA fighter will occasionally be brought to tears. If your emotions don't rule you, you'll be calm, cool, and collected. You'll be unflappable. It's not ""losing"" your emotions, it's keeping them far away and under control.

, The better you can learn to talk about how you're feeling, the less it will rule over your actions, without identifying yourself with it.


As you feel a particular emotion coming on, name it: ""I feel anger happening,"" or ""There's anger here."" It might sound weird, but it helps you put the emotion somewhere else.
Don't identify with your feelings. Don't say, ""I am angry."" How you feel doesn't define you as a person. You're not the sum of the things you feel. You're bigger than your feelings.

, Sometimes, you can't control your feelings. They're not things that we choose, and they're not things that we have much control over. If you're feeling scared of horror films, you're scared of horror films. If you're feeling sad about your break-up with an ex, you're sad about your break-up.


Imagine you could ""watch"" your suffering happen, as if it were happening to another person. Distance it, away from your conception of yourself. Put your suffering just over there.

, When you learn to accept your feelings, you can learn to loosen yourself up. Express yourself as freely as possible. Think of it less as ""feeling"" or ""not feeling,"" and more as staying unattached to those feelings that you experience. Feel your feelings come into your mind and send them back out of your mind as easily as they arrived.


Work on thinking less about how you feel and more in just feeling it in the moment and letting it go. If something makes you mad, don't bury it under the surface. Say, ""That just made me mad"" and explain why.

, The mind and the body are connected in ways that are difficult to understand, but your breath is often at the meeting point of that connection. Breathing deeply helps to calm emotions and settle your mind, as well as it helps to oxygenate your bloodstream, which helps to create feelings of euphoria and calmness.Each day, try sitting and taking deep breaths for 15-20 minutes, or more if you're comfortable and have the time. Breathe in deeply for 10 seconds, hold your breath for 5 seconds, and exhale again for 10 seconds.

, Sometimes called ""runner's high,"" a kind of mind-body euphoria is thought to exist when you start to push your body with strenuous exercise. While science struggles to understand the phenomenon, hypothesis have been proposed that suggest endorphins might play a role, resulting in the common description of calmness and euphoria associated with running, or other types of exercise.Don't push yourself too hard, if you're not a regular exerciser, but try to get into shape if you want to experience this, then try challenging yourself to the ""one more"" game. If you're out jogging and you reach the point that you were about to stop, make yourself do one more lap, or go one more block. Do one more rep squat, or one more minute of burpees.

, Some people suggest that sitting and meditating on your breath, then progressively focusing a ""vibration"" on certain areas of your body can help you induce a trance-like state, where your cares and feelings will be far away, and your sense of time will all but disappear. Start by meditating normally, sitting and breathing deeply, focusing on your breath.Then:


Try focusing on making your feet ""vibrate,"" imagining them slowly shifting into and out of your control. Continue moving up your legs, your stomach, your chest, and down your arms. Eventually vibrate your head.
Imagine yourself walking down a long flight of stairs, slowly placing one foot in front of the next, continually walking down, and down, and down...
Some people also like to imagine themselves floating down a big cavern as a feather, or climbing down a big woven rope, hand over hand, or imagining being swallowed by a series of smoke rings., A particular style of Buddhist meditation known as ""tonglen"" focuses on connecting the mind and the body around the concept of suffering. If you're interested in letting go of obsessive thoughts, of feeling less, the famous Buddhist and author Pema Chodron suggests practicing guided meditation like tonglen, to cultivate a sense of peace.When you feel emotional discomfort, or pain, force yourself to say (or think): ""Other people feel this."" Your suffering is not unique. It is the suffering that others have experienced and do experience on a regular basis.
Breathe that suffering in. Take on the burden of that suffering from others, each time you breathe, and exhale positive energy and emotions back into the world. Say, ""May others be relieved of this suffering, as I take it on.""

, If you're struggling with serious emotional problems, obsessive thoughts, or are just extremely upset, consider reaching out and getting help. Not all emotional problems are controllable all by yourself. Guided therapy, prescription medication, and a variety of treatment options are available.


If you're in serious physical pain, it's also important to discuss pain management options with your doctor. Don't suffer in silence. Try to describe your pain as accurately and honestly as possible, and seek a variety of treatment options.

Spend time alone.,
Try a calming, repetitive activity.,
Read a book.",How to Mentally Escape from Reality2," As your partner, colleagues, and children are potentially a part of your everyday life, escaping reality means leaving them behind temporarily and refocusing on yourself. Because the society that we live in is perceived by most to be hectic and filled with stressors, spending some dedicated time alone can help you to refresh your mind and be more ready to handle reality when you return.Solitude allows your brain to “reboot.”Turn off your phone and sign out of your social media. When you are no longer “connected” to everyone and everything, you will find yourself much more able to mentally escape reality.
Wake up 30 minutes before anyone else and enjoy the peace and quiet of the morning. Use that time to reflect, meditate, and daydream.Make alone time a priority. Many of us spend the majority of our day catering to others, whether colleagues, family, or friends. Make it a point to set aside a block of time each day to allow yourself some time to escape your otherwise hectic reality., Instead of passively allowing your mind to wander, some people may find it helpful to actively engage in an activity that they can associate with a mental escape from reality. There are a wide range of activities that can facilitate an escape from reality.


Try painting or knitting. The repetitive motion may help you find peace and solace and allow your mind to wander away from reality.
If you’re looking to get exercise at the same time, go for a walk. Walking for 7,000-8,000 steps each day is great for your physical health and if you use your walking time to also meditate, daydream, or otherwise escape reality, you will be benefitting your mind as well as your body.If you want to enjoy the outdoors, try hiking, fishing, or gardening. Being in nature can be another avenue for your mental escape of reality.
There is no “best” activity to help you mentally escape reality; however, you should always do something that you enjoy. Some people may find the best way to mentally escape reality is to go skydiving or snorkeling, while others may enjoy playing a computer game or putting together a puzzle.

, Books are a fantastic avenue for escapism because they allow you to escape your reality and enter another world without ever leaving your sofa.Choose a book from your favorite author, a time-honored classic, or a best-seller.


Find a book that takes you into a make-believe world. This could be a fictional world, such as that of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or a book that takes place in another time or location, such as a work of historical fiction.
Choose a series (something available in a trilogy or more) for an even longer escape from reality!

"
"
Set aside some dedicated time.,
Choose a location.,
Take along a journal.,
Do something you enjoy.,
Stop and smell the roses.",How to Mentally Escape from Reality3," While it would be ideal to have 1-2 days to make a mental escape from reality, even a few hours will suffice!

, It can be a location that you associate with a sense of calmness and peace or it can be a place you’ve never been to before.


Consider outdoor options, such as a cabin in the woods.
You may want to try going to the seaside, which many people find to be very calming.
If you're looking for total relaxation, consider going to a monastery for peace and quiet in an austere environment.

, Write down your thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Write letters to people who have hurt you, and burn them if you want to. Write down your fears and bury them in the forest. These small activities can help you refocus and re-center while you are on your retreat.

, Take a long drive in the country, go to a movie, sit by a bonfire, try a new beer, visit a museum. Treat yourself to something that you normally wouldn’t have the time to do in your reality.

, The goal is to slow down from the pace of your “real life” and embrace the world around you. This can be especially enjoyable when you are in a new place thanks to your mini-retreat.


Sit back and observe and appreciate all the beauty of life around you.
Think about the good things in your life, and let go of the rest, even if only temporarily.
Take a slow walk, look at the landscape, feel the breeze, hear the birds sing- do anything you don't normally take the time or have the patience to do!

"
Realize that things could be worse.,
Appreciate the good things in your life.,
Believe that it is not the end of the world.,
Move on to the next thing.",How to Not Care2," When bad things happen to you, try to remember that things could be worse. This is not to diminish the pain of the things going on in your life: no, those things still suck. There’s no changing that. But when you understand that things could be worse, you’ll find it much easier to appreciate the things that you do have.

, So, knowing that you could lose so much more but that you haven’t, take the time to appreciate the things in your life that make you happy. Hug your mom, tell your best friend how much they mean to you, and watch a sunset...because right now, in this moment, you’re alive and that (in itself) is amazing and wonderful.


If it feels like you don’t have things in your life to appreciate or being happy about, then you need to go out and get some things to be happy about. Start volunteering, make a new friend, or do something you’ve always wanted to do. Our lives are short and we shouldn’t spend them being bored and unhappy.

, Things will go wrong. It happens. It happens a lot, actually. But if you believe and understand that things go wrong, then you will know that things going wrong doesn’t make the world end. Our problems will sometimes seem big, and they often are incredibly painful and difficult to handle, but (as the proverb goes) this too shall pass. You will have other problems and you will have other happiness.

, You can’t change the past, you can’t undo something that’s gone wrong. All you can do is pick yourself up and move on. Take a new approach and fix the problem if you can. If you can’t, just go on to the next thing. Giving yourself a new goal, a new purpose, and new successes will help you not care about the failures you have experienced.

Care when someone else is being hurt.,
Care when you might hurt someone else.,
Care when people need you.,
Care about your own life and your well-being.",How to Not Care3," There are times when you should always care. When someone else is being hurt is probably the most important. It’s very reasonable to want to not care about people bullying you, but if you see people bullying someone else you should always care. If we stand up for each other then no one will ever have to get intentionally hurt like that, yourself included.

, You can’t kill people you don’t like, you can’t bully others, and you should always about how your words and actions hurt other people. If we want to live happily and peacefully in this world, we have to love and care for each other rather than driving hate with hate. If you don’t care that you’re hurting someone else, you need to think about how your actions are going to impact your life.

, Oftentimes, people will rely on you. You may not even known that they rely on you. There will be, throughout your life, people that need you for different reasons. You should care about them and you should care about yourself enough to do what you need to do to help them.


These can be friends that need your emotional support through hard times or family members who need your love to keep their lives bright. It might be a shelter where you volunteer or it might be your children who need you to survive.

, It is also extremely important for you to care about your own life and your own well-being. At times it can be hard, especially if you have had bad things happen to you, to understand why you should care about yourself. But when you feel down, remember that there are so many people who love you (even if you don’t know it) and your future has so many wonderful things in store for you (even if you don’t think good things will ever happen to you again). Be strong, because you are so strong, and just wait.

"
"
Realize why they hurt you.,
Believe that it is their loss.,
Appreciate the people who really care about you.,
Find new people to care about.",How to Not Care4," Realizing why someone hurt you will go a long way towards helping you not care about it, as it will help you understand and empathize with them and what they did. If you understand someone’s reasons for doing something, it becomes harder to judge them and hold it against them.


Maybe they hurt you because they are hurt, or lonely, or afraid. Maybe they hurt you because they worry that you’ll hurt them first. Maybe they don’t have a good example from their own lives of how to love others or treat people well. There are a number of reasons why people hurt other people, intentionally or unintentionally.

, If someone hurts you or otherwise shows that they don’t appreciate you and your role in their life, just understand that it is their loss. If they want to be angry or hurtful or alone, that is going to affect them much more negatively in the long run than it will affect you. Realize that your time and affection are much better spent on someone who appreciates you.

, Take the time to appreciate the people who do care about. There are plenty of people who love you and love being around you. These friends, family members, coworkers or teachers are much more worth your time than someone who is all wrapped up in their own problems.

, When this hurtful person leaves your life, find new people to care about. This will give you new purpose and happiness and help you forget the things that they did. When you find new, wonderful people who appreciate you for who you are, you will find that all the things that other jerk did suddenly don’t matter to you at all. It’s hard to be hurt and angry when you’re so happy!

Calm yourself.,
Catch your thoughts before they spiral by repeating mantras and truths to yourself which you planned and memorized ahead of time.,
Find the root.,
Be prepared.,
Insert humor.,
Try supplements.,
Get counseling.",How to Manage Minor Paranoia," Try calming techniques when you feel suspicions and racing thoughts coming on. These involve yoga, meditation, deep breathing, counting with eyes closed, and focusing on your center.;
, These can range anywhere from, ""It's going to be OK,"" to, ""I am worth this.""

, Identify the root cause that is making you anxious or arousing your suspicions. If it is a TV show or reading material, stop watching and/or reading it. If it is more along the lines of generalized social anxiety, focus on just one person at a time and remind yourself that everything will be OK.

, Knowing that you took action and are prepared helps ease anxiety. Arm yourself with plans, sentences, and self-defense techniques just in case you should need these. Just knowing that you are powerful, in control, and can defend yourself can ease paranoia.

, Find things to laugh about around you, in life, in people. Watch comedy shows. Hang out with funny friends. It is more than OK to laugh and smile once in a while. You won't lose control. Instead, you will gain more of it by becoming less fearful and more attune with life, yourself, and what you want.

, If all of the above techniques just are not helping, you could always try medication, herbal supplements, and certain vitamins to help. Talk to your doctor about what might be the right course of action for you.

, Now-a-days, counseling is somewhat systematized, but it shouldn't be. Counseling is necessary and healthy for any and everyone, and it does a world of good just knowing that another human being has heard what you said and doesn't judge it at all. It is very healing to get to speak deep, true concerns, thoughts, worries, fears, and pondering each session.

Understand your emotional needs.,
Know your triggers.,
Shift your focus.,
Calm down.,
Take a time-out.",How to Manage Emotions1," In order to manage your emotions, you need to fully understand them. All of us have certain emotional needs that are just as important as our physical needs. Spend some time taking an inventory of the emotional needs that are most important to you.For example, some important emotional needs are feeling in control, feeling respected, and feeling comfort. If your brain feels one of those needs is not being met, that can trigger the negative emotions.;
, Throughout the course of a day, it is normal to go through a wide range of emotions. When things aren't going your way, it is very common to feel anger or irritation. The key is to be able to manage your emotions so that they do not negatively impact your daily life. Knowing the things that trigger negative emotions is an important part of remaining in control.When your brain feels as though it has lost or been deprived of something it needs, the most common emotions are anger, fear, or sadness. Needs are not bad, but it is important to understand your needs and how to manage them.
Maybe your boss criticized you for sloppy work on a project. You might feel that you are not being respected, because you spent months creating a great product. Your initial reaction is probably very negative. Take note of this, and remember that not feeling respected is one of your triggers.

, Once you know your triggers, you can use that to your advantage. When you know that something is triggering a negative emotion, try to shift your focus away from that person or situation. Instead, refocus on something positive in order to help you regain your composure.Perhaps feeling out of control is one of your triggers. When you are in a traffic jam and running late, you are likely to feel frustration and anger. Try to shift your focus. Turn on your favorite CD or have an interesting podcast downloaded for just such an occasion. Shift your focus from the traffic to listening to something you enjoy.
Many of us are very critical of ourselves. If you are feeling mad at yourself for not going to the gym all week, shift your focus. Instead, congratulate yourself on getting caught up on much needed housework.

, When you are experiencing very strong emotions, it can be difficult to think and act rationally. When you are angry or frightened, your body goes into a flight or fight mode, which can cause you to react emotionally instead of logically. This type of response is generally not helpful in professional or social settings, so it is important to learn to calm yourself down when you are experiencing negative emotions.Take deep breaths. Focusing on your breathing will not only shift your focus, but it will help you calm down, physically and emotionally.
Breathe in slowly for five counts, then let your breath out slowly for two counts. Repeat this for a few minutes, or as long as needed.
Do something repetitive. Repetition can calm your nerves. Try walking, or even rhythmically tapping your feet.

, Strong emotions can cause you to act impulsively. This is true for both positive and negative feelings, like extreme sadness or happiness. A good way to manage your emotions is to take a time-out before acting when you are feeling intense emotions.Step away from the situation. If you are in a tense meeting at work, suggest that everyone take a five minute break to regroup.
If you are having a heated discussion with your partner, calm down before making decisions. Say that you need to take a quick walk around the block before continuing the conversation.

It is likely that finding a different way to respond in tough situations will be high on your list of priorities.Once you have identified your triggers, you can work on finding more positive ways to respond to those triggers. For example, maybe you typically raise your voice when your child complains about eating broccoli for dinner. Next time this happens, actively choose to keep your tone neutral.
Maybe you tend to burst into tears when you are criticized. When you feel the tears coming, choose to take deep breaths and voice your frustrations calmly instead.

, Small changes can make a big impact on your emotional health. Try altering your living space to make it a more calming place. For example, try buying some fresh flowers to put in your living room. Look at them and think calming thoughts when you are feeling stressed.If your negative emotions stem from feeling out of control, try organizing your work space. Getting rid of clutter can make you feel on top of things.
Try adding more light. Natural and artificial light can help ease anxiety. So open your curtains and add some higher wattage bulbs to your lamps.

Learn how to handle a Herxheimer reaction.,
Avoid sugar, dairy, and gluten.,
Exercise when you are able to.,
Get enough rest.",How to Maintain a Positive Outlook when Living with Lyme Disease2," Medication is one of the most essential parts of managing Lyme disease. Take all your antibiotics and other medications as directed, and check in with your doctor frequently to make any necessary changes.If you are taking antibiotics, make sure to also take a probiotic daily to reduce the risk of yeast infections.
Keep a daily log of your activities, the medications you take, and how you feel. Bring it to your checkups to help your doctor determine which meds are working for you and which, if any, aren’t.

, It can be helpful to talk to your doctor about supplements and other alternative treatments. Many people have successfully incorporated herbal and nutritional supplements into their Lyme disease treatment plan. Ask your doctor which supplements are safe and appropriate for you to take.Do not try to use supplements as a replacement for medications prescribed by your doctor.

, A Herxheimer reaction occurs when Lyme disease bacteria die off faster than your body can process them. This can make you feel sick for a few days. Drinking plenty of water, consuming lemon juice, and exercising are a few ways to ease the discomfort of a Herxheimer reaction, or “herx.”Dry brushing your skin before a shower and rinsing your mouth out with vegetable oil can also help you detox during a Herxheimer reaction.
When you rinse your mouth with vegetable oil, swish it around for about sixty seconds before spitting it out.

, Processed sugar, dairy products, and foods containing gluten can all contribute to inflammation and feed the Lyme bacteria in your body. Stay away from these foods and eat a nutrient-dense diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and lean protein.Consider avoiding coffee and energy drinks, too. Caffeine can disrupt your sleep cycle, which may make your Lyme disease symptoms worse.

, Build up your strength and immune system by exercising gently when you feel well enough. Some simple stretching, light resistance training, or walking can help you feel better and prevent Lyme relapses.If you have lost a lot of strength during your battle with Lyme disease, a physical therapy program can help you recover.

Listen to your body and go more slowly than you think you need to. It’s easy to overdo exercise when you have Lyme disease.

, Aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night, and make time to rest during the day. On days when you feel well, resist the urge to jump back into your regular activities. This will probably just wear you out, and it might even cause a relapse.If you have trouble sleeping at night, work on your sleep hygiene. Several steps you can take include establishing a regular sleep schedule, turning your electronics off an hour before bedtime, and creating a nightly ritual that helps you relax.

Search the internet for information about Lyme disease and educate yourself about the various treatment options available to you.Make sure that you are getting your information from reputable websites backed by research, such as the Center for Disease Control, LymeDisease.org, or the Mayo Clinic.
Never change your treatment based on information found online without first checking in with your doctor.
Blogs and chat rooms can help provide support, but if you find that they make you worried or upset about your symptoms, you may not want to read them.

, You can’t get rid of your disease, but you can empower yourself to manage it effectively. Regain a sense of control over your health by building habits that improve your well-being.For instance, instead of resenting the fact that you can’t eat sugary foods anymore, focus on how much better you feel when you make nutritious food choices.

, Mindfulness, or the practice of giving your full attention to the present moment, can help you cultivate a sense of peaceful acceptance in your life. To build the habit of mindfulness, try incorporating yoga, meditation, or journaling into your daily routine. You can also practice mindfulness by slowing down and immersing yourself in an activity like taking a walk or eating a meal.
Mindfulness may be difficult at first. Do not get discouraged. With practice, you will find it becoming easier over time. It can take a while to retrain your brain to operate differently.

, If you’re having trouble adjusting to life with a chronic condition, make an appointment with a mental health professional. Therapy can be a good way to process the changes and new emotions that go along with a diagnosis of Lyme disease.Look for a therapist who has experience working with people who have chronic conditions.
You may want to look for a therapist that emphasizes pain management.

Obtain permission.,
Gather the appropriate data before commencing the autopsy.,
Begin with an examination of the outside of the body.First, note the height, weight, age, and sex of the body.,
Perform an X-ray.,
Check the genital area for any signs of rape.,
Take a blood sample.,
Open the body cavity once the initial examinations are complete.,
Examine each organ in the chest cavity individually.Weigh each organ, record anything notable, and take a tissue sample in case further examination is needed.,
Observe the eyes carefully.,
Look at the head.,
Finish your notes or your dictated recording after the autopsy is complete.",How to Perform an Autopsy on a Human Being," An autopsy is a detailed examination (and dissection) of a human body after death. It is used to determine the likely time and cause of death, as well as to evaluate the presence of disease and/or injuries.An autopsy is conducted by a pathologist, which is a doctor with specialty level training in how to do the procedure and how to effectively analyze the tissues and body fluids.
If the person's death is being investigated forensically, an autopsy may be legally mandated.
Similarly, if the person's death occurs during a medical clinical trial, an autopsy will likely be required to provide the study with information on the cause of death.
Otherwise, it is the family's choice whether or not they would like an autopsy for their loved one. Common reasons to get an autopsy include uncertainty around what caused the person's death, worry of a genetic condition that may affect other family members, or a desire to advance medical knowledge.;
, Normally permission for an autopsy is given by the deceased person's family. However, if there are legal or forensic concerns surrounding the cause of death, an autopsy may be mandated by the courts or by a coroner.Obtaining permission is a serious issue, and most often requires a consent form signed in the presence of a witness.

, There are many factors that can play into a person's death, and it is important to have their full medical history, as well as a full history surrounding the events preceding their death in order to make your investigation and the dissection of the body as helpful as possible.The police may play a role in investigating the ""crime scene,"" if there is one, and further look into evidence that could support a potential cause of death.
Depending upon the suspected cause of death, an autopsy may only need to be done on certain body parts, and not necessarily on the whole body. It varies depending upon the case. For instance, in someone who died of lung disease an examination of the lungs alone may be sufficient to confirm the cause of death.

, Note any distinguishing characteristics like birthmarks, scars, or tattoos as well.You should also take fingerprints at this point, as they may be needed in police investigations.
Check the clothing and skin for any marks that look out of the ordinary. Note any droplets of blood, organic materials, and any residues found on clothing. Also make note of any bruises, wounds, or marks on the skin.
Photographs may be helpful as well, to document the appearance of the body and any significant findings or unusual things you notice amidst your investigation. Take photographs both with clothes on, as well as nude.
Either document your findings with pen and paper notes, or through a dictation device that records what you say and is later typed up by a medical transcriptionist.

, An X-ray will help you to find any broken or fractured bones, or medical devices, such as a pace-maker.These records can also be used to identify the subject.


Check for any dental work. Dental records are often used to identify bodies.

, Bruising and tearing are common in such cases.

, It can be used for DNA purposes, or it can help to determine if the victim was on drugs, had been using alcohol, or whether there was poisoning involved.


A urine sample should also be taken from the bladder using a syringe. Just like blood, the urine can be used in tests to detect drugs or poisons.

, Using a scalpel, make one large ""Y"" shaped incision from each shoulder across the chest, then down to the pubic bone. Spread open the skin and check to see if any ribs are broken.Split the ribcage using rib shears, open it up, and examine the lungs and heart.Note any abnormalities, then take a second blood sample directly from the heart.

,


You can also sub-dissect many of the majors organs by opening them up and examining them to look for disease.
Next, repeat the same process for the organs in the lower body, like the spleen and intestines, as sometimes partially digested food is used to determine time of death.

, The presence of a petechial rash (tiny, broken blood vessels) can be a sign of choking or strangulation.

, Check for any trauma to the skull, including fractures or bruises. Then remove the top of the skull, and remove the brain.Follow the same procedure as with all other organs.Weigh it, and take a sample.

, State the cause of death, and the reasons that brought you to that conclusion. Mention any details, no matter how small, as they may be the final clues needed to stop a murderer or to put a family member's mind at ease.


Based on your findings (assuming you're a licensed pathologist), the Chief Medical Examiner will issue a Death Certificate.
The body will then be returned to surviving family members for funeral arrangements."

After you have taken as much water as you can hold, gently remove the nozzle.,
After you have retained the liquid for several minutes, sit on the toilet and relax.,
You’re done!",How to Perform an Enema at Home2," A cleansing enema is what most people think of when they hear the word ""enema"": designed to be quick and easy, this enema is supposed to cause quick evacuation and help clean the colon. There are several different kinds of cleansing enemas. Here are just a few that you can safely use at home:


Lemon Juice. Helps cleanse the colon and adjust the pH in the colon. Reputed to detoxify the system.Apple cider vinegar (ACV) and water. Also a way to adjust the pH in the colon. Supposed to help clear out mucous from the body.Catnip Tea. Helps with constipation and has the ability to bring down a high fever.Burdock Root. Widely used in Asian societies, is reputed to help flush out calcium deposits and sanitize the blood.Chamomile tea. Very soothing and effective.;
, Err on the side of caution: Always dilute the enema solution more than you think is necessary. An enema is supposed to be mainly water. The supplements are the supporting acts, not the main gig.

, Hold the insertion end of the tube over the bathtub or toilet. Open the clamp to let the water travel through the tube until it comes out steadily. Be sure that there aren’t any air pockets in the tube. Once you are sure of this, clamp the tube to stop the flow.

, Depending on your comfort level or size, you might also find it more advantageous to lie down on your side; some people find it easier to take in more liquid while resting on their side.

, Stop if you feel any resistance and adjust the angle slightly until you can easily insert the tube.

, Go slowly, as going too quickly can create the need to evacuate immediately. The key to a successful enema is to take in and hold in the liquid until the body's natural peristaltic movements begin. If you experience cramping, clamp the tube and take a deep breath before continuing. Lightly massaging the abdomen will also help.

, Continue lying on the floor, or move to the toilet.

, Wait until you are able to expel what you need to.

, Clean your equipment and let it air-dry before storage.

Instead of letting the body void naturally, hold the enema solution inside the rectum for 5 to 15 minutes.,

,
You’re done!",How to Perform an Enema at Home3," If a cleansing enema is a short stroll through the park, a retention enema is a long hike. Retention enemas are exactly what the name suggests they are: Instead of introducing the fluid and quickly expelling it and any other waste matter, you're supposed to hold it in for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Common ingredients of retention enemas include:



Coffee. Normal brew works best, although instant can be used in a pinch. Coffee enemas are reputed to stimulate the colon and the gallbladder.Be sure to choose the right kind or you may stay up all night since the colon is very absorbent.
Probiotics. Reputedly good for yeast infections and other candidiasis.Any probiotic will do.
Red Raspberry Leaf. Supposedly beneficial for women, red raspberry leaf is high in iron and improves eyesight.Wheatgrass infusion. Supposed to replace friendly bacteria and help nourish the colon. It's the second part of a total colon cleanse.

, Retention enemas can feel great, but they have the power of causing more harm if done ineffectively. Make sure that whatever you're using is something that you'd feel comfortable swallowing.

, The process is exactly the same.

, Again, if you experience cramping, lightly massage the abdomen and try to find a comfortable position.

, If your to-do list is not something you can reasonably accomplish in a day, create a to-do list for the following day, so that you can reduce the load. When faced with too much work, you may become unmotivated knowing you can’t accomplish everything.Opt to have a five or seven day to-do list. Use a dry erase board or pencil, so that you can change it every morning before you begin. It will result in fewer things falling through the cracks.

, If you haven’t tried it before, schedule your day where you have two periods for answering emails, a period for calling and time for Internet use and several breaks. Calls, emails and texts can break up the flow of work on a project, resulting in distractions and procrastination.

, Your cell phone probably has an easy timer. Unless you like to work at something for more than a few hours, set an alarm at hour intervals to get up, move around and change tasks.

Be sure to offer the patient a drape to cover their upper body with. These are usually present in the examination room. Ask the physician you are working with where to find them if you are unsure.
A patient with his or her bare chest exposed can feel uneasy, so it is important to provide the patient with a proper drape for their comfort and as an indication of professionalism. The drape can be removed as needed during the cardiac exam., Standing at the right side makes auscultation easier., Also known as palpation, place your right hand over the patient's left pectoral. The heel of your hand should be against the sternal border and your fingers should lie just below the nipple. You hand should lay flat against the chest, fingers extended.Make sure you tell the patient what you are going to do before you begin, and explain the purpose. While palpating, be aware of the following:Can you feel a point of maximum impulse (PMI), which indicates the location of the left ventricle? Try to pinpoint its exact location, which is usually near the mid-clavicular line.If the ventricle is normal-sized and functioning, it should be about the size of a penny. If it is enlarged, it may be located closer to the armpit.
What is the duration of the impulse? If the patient suffers from hypertension, the impulse will last longer. This is subtle and largely a subjective assessment, however.
How strong is the impulse?
Do you feel a vibration (or thrill)? If a valve is partially obstructed, you may detect this. If you notice a murmur during auscultation, then check again for a thrill.

, Gentle upward displacement of the left breast must be done in women to hear the heart sounds. Once the diaphragm of your stethoscope is in place, listen intently.


The diaphragm is the auscultatory part of the stethoscope with the wider circumference and flat surface.The diaphragm helps in auscultation of high-pitched normal heart sounds.
There are two normal heart sounds, S1 and S2.S1 corresponds to mitral and tricuspid heart valve closure during heart contraction. S2 corresponds to aortic and pulmonic valve closure during heart relaxation. S1 is louder than S2 at the apex since it is closer to the mitral valve.

, After auscultating the apex, it is important to listen to the following areas with your stethoscope:

The left side of the patient's sternum, at the bottom (in the 5th intercostal space). This is the best place to auscultate the tricuspid valve.The left side of the patient's sternum, near the top (in the 2nd intercostal space). This is the best place to auscultate the pulmonic valve.The right side of the patient's sternum, near the top (in the 2nd intercostal space). This is the best place to auscultate the aortic valve.Note that listening to the heart's apex is the best spot to assess the mitral valve., The bell is the auscultatory part of the stethoscope with the smaller circumference and concave surface. It is sensitive to abnormal heart sounds called murmurs.The bell should be applied lightly over the skin to increase sensitivity to murmurs. Pinch the sides of the bell with your thumb and index finger. Rest the heel of your hand against the patient’s chest to ensure that the bell is placed lightly.
The bell should create an air-tight seal with the skin to easily hear abnormal heart sounds.

, This position amplifies the apex’s heart sounds.Place the bell lightly on the apex and listen for murmurs.


Ask the patient to sit up, lean forward, exhale completely and suspend breathing. This maneuver accentuates murmurs.Both of these maneuvers are ""specialty techniques"" used to better assess for any heart pathology or murmurs.

, Do not discuss your physical examination findings with the patient still undressed.

, While palpating the pulse, establish which sound is the first one (S1). The S1 sound is the one that is synchronized with the pulse. Then you need to establish whether the rhythm is a regular one or an irregular one, by following the S1 sound.If the rhythm is irregular, an electrocardiogram must be taken immediately.

, If his resting heart rate is below 60 bpm or above 100 bpm, an electrocardiogram should also be taken and additional medication may follow.


You need to keep in mind that sometimes a patient’s pulse may not be identical with his heartbeat, like in atrial fibrillation. For this reason, it is preferable to listen to the patient’s heart without taking his pulse when assessing his cardiac rhythm and rate.
By counting how many sounds you hear between the S1 sounds, you can establish if it is a gallop rhythm (when you hear an extra two or even three sounds between the S1 sounds).A gallop rhythm often indicates heart problems, but it is normal in children and athletes.

, Murmurs are pathological heart sounds with long duration, usually lasting between either S1 to S2 or S2 to S1. ""Systolic murmurs"" are the ones that can be heard between S1 to S2, while ""diastolic murmurs"" are the ones that can be heard between S2 and S1.Mitral insufficiency is characterized by a systolic murmur heard at the mitral area.Mitral stenosis is characterized by a diastolic murmur heard at the mitral area.Aortic insufficiency is characterized by a diastolic murmur heard at the aortic area.Aortic stenosis is characterized by a systolic murmur heard at the aortic area.
Ventricular and atrial septal defects are characterized by both systolic and diastolic murmurs., A gallop is an extra heart sound that occurs following S2 (S3) or just before S1 (S4). The S3 and S4 heart sounds are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope.

An S3 is normal in patients under 40, but in older patients it may indicate left ventricular failure. It occurs during ventricular filling and is usually due to an enlargement of the ventricular chamber.
The presence of an S3 indicates decreased contractility, myocardial failure, or volume overload of the ventricle.
An S4 is due to decreased ventricular compliance, increased ventricular stiffness, and increased resistance. This can be heard in trained athletes or in older adults.
Causes of S4 include hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and cardiomyopathy.

Pay attention to an increase in heart rate or pounding heartbeat. You may also notice clenching your fists, clenching your teeth, or tension in your neck or shoulders. People respond differently to anger, so pay attention to your unique signs.


When you notice the physical signs that you're becoming angry, try to calm yourself and create a mental space so you can calmly respond to your anger. This will keep you from simply reacting and possibly harming someone.;
, Stop yourself as soon as you notice physical signs of anger. This will help you regain control over your emotional reaction. Pay attention to the angry thoughts that begin going through your head and the physical signs of anger. As soon as you notice your breathing increase or your adrenaline surge, just stop whatever it is you're doing.If you are interacting with someone, try to step away for a break. You can say something like, ""Please excuse me, I need to step away for a moment."" If you're in the middle of an argument, you can assure the other person you will talk later by saying something like ""I'm having trouble focusing right now. I'd like to take a 15-minute break, and then come back and continue this discussion when I feel calmer.""
Stop is the first step in the acronym STOP which stands for Stop, Take a breath, Observe, and Proceed with awareness. This anger management technique helps you regain your control when you notice yourself getting carried away by anger. , Breathe deeply into your belly, inhaling through your nose and then exhaling slowly through your mouth, until you feel your heart rate slow down. Take as many breaths as you need to calm yourself down. Pay attention to yourself, your body, and your surroundings. Become aware of yourself and the world again. Observe yourself in this moment and notice your anger. Observe the reasons that you're angry in the first place.For example, you may observe that your hands are clenched in anger. Open and close them several times to unclench them. Pay attention to your surroundings to calm your anger.
Taking time to breathe will help you relax and avoid acting impulsively in anger.

, Once you've created some mental space to express your anger, decide what actions you want to take. You can choose to walk away from the situation, address the situation at a later time when you are calmer, or practice more relaxation and breathing to help calm yourself down. You can also choose to remove yourself from the situation and deal with your anger privately. Most importantly, you can choose to not react to your anger with aggression or by hurting someone.Realize the power you have over the situation. You can be in control of your own thoughts and behaviors., Avoid confronting someone in the anger of the moment. Once you've calmed down, approach the person you're upset with and explain how you're feeling. You shouldn't accuse, yell, or demand an apology of the other person. Instead, simply tell the person what you're feeling and why. Speaking calmly and clearly will help your communication stay effective and respectful, and won't put the other person on the defensive (which would shut down communication).


Try to use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements. This will prevent you from sounding accusatory and hurting the other person.For example, if your friend is late to pick you up and you miss the start of the movie you were seeing, avoid saying something ""you""-focused, such as ""You were late and you made me so mad!"" Instead, focus on your own feelings and communicate clearly, without being accusative or angry: ""When we didn't make the movie on time, I felt irritated because I'd been looking forward to seeing it. I'm frustrated because it seems like we often have trouble getting to things on time when you drive. Can we talk about this?"" Notice how this focuses on your own feelings and responses and uses qualified language such as as ""seems like"" to avoid sounding judgmental.

, Take 10 minutes every day to focus on breathing. Sit in a quiet place, place your hands on your belly, and breathe deeply. Breathe and become aware of your body. Notice places you are holding tension in your body and imagine your breath being directed into the tension. Notice what you hear and how every single part of your body feels. Practicing this simple breathing exercise every day can help you de-stress, oxygenate your body and brain, and with regular practice, it can become a buffer to reacting in anger.Taking the time to do daily breathing exercises helps improve your body's reaction to stress so that you don't ""fly off the handle"" as soon as you encounter a negative stimulus. It also improves your ability to self-regulate, or handle your emotional levels and responses.
You can set a timer on your phone or clock so that you won’t be distracted while breathing.

, Sometimes anger is a reaction to feeling powerless, or out of control. Start a journal listing the real life stressors that you are dealing with right now, such as relationship issues, employment frustrations, financial stress, parental stress, world and political concerns or worries, health problems, or anything that makes you feel worried, anxious, or out of control. Write down ways you can make changes in your life to feel more in control.


Writing things down gives you a way to examine and process them. If your feelings involve others, writing them down gives you a way to explore these feelings in private first, without telling the other person the first thing that comes into your head. This will help you avoid hurting others when you're working through your anger.
Remember that you can control how you react to events. If there are stressors outside of your control, you can still decide how you're going to react, even if you can't change the situation., Green environments such as parks, lakes, or gardens can have an overall calming effect. Try to get out into a green space as much as you can, even if for only ten minutes. Let yourself get lost in the great outdoors, and as you walk, imagine your anger and stressors flowing right out of your feet into the ground.The world is a big place, and sometimes a change in perspective about the little things that can make you angry can be very helpful.

, When you notice yourself thinking a negative thought, write it down in a journal. Make this a running list of all the times you're angry at someone or yourself. Then, change, or reframe, the thoughts into less harmful statements. With time and practice, you'll be able to view yourself, your life, and others in a more gentle caring way.For example, say you spilled your coffee on yourself right before leaving for work. An angry reaction might be: ""I can’t believe what an idiot I am. I always ruin everything, nothing ever works out for me, I hate everything."" Instead, change your statement to: ""I’m just a person who makes mistakes.""
Remember to do this for others, too. For example, if your server is running late with your dinner, you might have a negative, angry reaction such as ""This server is so stupid. She can't do anything right, even getting me my meal."" Take a moment to remember your common humanity with her and extend her compassion: ""She is probably swamped and is doing the best she can. I can be patient.""

, Anger is really a defense mechanism to help you feel protected when you actually feel insecure or frightened. Feeling rejected by others can trigger feelings of hurt and anger. Learning to reframe situations will help soothe these feelings so that you don't become angry and lash out at others.Focus on noticing how these incidents make you feel and thinking about other ways to interpret them.


For example, if you've just experienced rejection from a potential romantic partner, the hurt in you might say: ""Of course she rejected me. I’m stupid. I’m a loser. I hate myself."" This totalizes you, which is unfair to yourself. Generalizing about yourself (or others) based on a particular experience is a common cognitive distortion, or ""thought trap.""If you allow your hurt feelings to fester, they may become anger, especially if you believe that your treatment has been unfair.For example, you may begin to think, ""How dare she reject me when she doesn't even know me? That's so unfair! She's a terrible person.""
Instead, acknowledge that you feel hurt by this rejection, but don't allow it to take over how you define yourself. Honor yourself: ""Being rejected really hurt. I'm disappointed, but I was brave and put myself out there for someone I was interested in. I don't know why she rejected me, but this one instance doesn't define me as a person. I can try again with someone else.""

, Make sure you are taking time to laugh, relax, and have fun. Go see a movie, get together with a friend that always makes you smile, enjoy your favorite foods, watch a comedy, stand up, or TV show that makes you laugh, make a special night out with your friends or partner. Be vigilant in making time to lighten up and enjoy the little things., Just make sure that you don't rely on humor so much that you dismiss deeper issues causing your anger., If you're angry because you believe someone has wronged or hurt you, you need to choose to let go of the anger and resentment you feel. This doesn't mean that you are suddenly all right with whatever caused you pain, but it does show that you're not going to hold a grudge or take it out on another person. By forgiving the other person, you not only let go of the anger without hurting someone, but you take control of the situation by choosing to not be a victim.One reason it can be hard to forgive is that we often focus on ""fairness."" Recognize that you are not forgiving someone for his/her benefit -- you're doing it so that you don't have to carry the burden of anger around yourself. Forgiveness doesn't mean you excuse the action or say it was right.You may also feel worried about forgiving someone if you believe that s/he will hurt you again. Expressing your concerns with the person whom you want to forgive can help you feel better about offering forgiveness., For most people, anger can be triggered by specific thoughts, situations, or incidents. Keeping an anger journal can help you determine what situations and experiences trigger your anger so that you can work on managing it.In general, anger triggers fall into two broad categories: feeling that you're in danger of being harmed, or feeling that you have been harmed or done some injury.A common trigger thought is that someone has not done something they were ""supposed"" to do (or has done something they were not ""supposed"" to do). For example, if you get cut off in traffic, you might feel angry because the other driver has violated the rules of the road.
Another common trigger thought is that someone is causing you harm, damage, or inconvenience in some way. For example, a computer that constantly loses internet connection or someone bumping into you are not generally big deals, but they might provoke anger if you feel like you have received harm in some way.
When you experience angry thoughts, note down the thought and emotion. Also take note of what happened just before, and how you responded to it. This will help you learn what is triggering your feelings of anger.

, If you feel you've been hurt or slighted, avoid constantly thinking about the event or argument. Avoid dwelling on what made you angry by learning to let go and looking at the event so you don't feel like you've been victimized. Accept the anger and then reframe or move on from the event. In this sense, you're retraining yourself in how you choose to cope with things that frustrate you, which might take time.For example, imagine you had a partner in the past who broke your heart, which still angers you. Write about how angry this makes you feel, take a deep breath, then reframe the event. Reframing could be as simple as accepting that the break up happened, you were hurt, you will heal, and you will move on.

, Low-self esteem can cause feelings of anger, so you need to change how you think about yourself. Consider how angry you may be at yourself. Rather than beat yourself up about your negative qualities, start to be aware of your positive traits. Remember to acknowledge that all humans make mistakes. Forgive yourself for your mistakes and note things that you feel you need to improve.You can write in a journal, practice breathing, and reframe your mindset to start seeing yourself in a more positive light.

, If you've unsuccessfully tried to manage your anger and aggression, you may want to seek outside help. Consider meeting with a mental health therapist who specializes in anger management therapies. Or, find a support group. It may help to realize that you're not alone and that others are also struggling with anger and aggression. Get help if:You feel out of control
Your anger has caused significant problems in your life
You've hurt someone
Your anger frightens you or others
Your anger interferes with your personal or employment relationships
Friends or family are concerned about your destructive tendencies
You take your anger out (physically or verbally) on children, your partner, or your friends

, Talk with your therapist about trying a therapeutic treatment that addresses the cause of your anger. Your therapist might work with you using one of the following therapies:


Dialectical Behavior Therapy: This therapy combines behavior change, meditation and mindfulness to help you regulate your emotions, become present in your life, and take control over your behaviors.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: This therapy will help you discover core issues that might be causing your anger and aggression problems. Being aware of these issues will help you change your behavior and thought patterns.Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction: This therapy uses meditation, relaxation, and physical techniques to help lower stress levels. This can make you calmer and less emotionally provoked.Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: This therapy challenges your irrational thoughts and beliefs by comparing them to actual events which can make you realize the harmful consequences of these ideas. This awareness will help you change negative behaviors, thoughts, and reactions into healthier beliefs., If you find yourself frequently angry with someone, like a romantic partner, this may be a signal that you need to change the relationship in some way. Maybe you need more space and independence or would like to redefine your boundaries.Or perhaps you need to be clearer in your communication about your needs and desires.


Explain to the other person what changes you'd like to make and why you're doing it. For example, you might say, ""I've been angry lately because I feel like I never have any time to myself. I think I need to take Friday evenings for myself so that I can unwind and more fully enjoy the time we spend together on weekends.""

Consider sharing your experiences.",How to Keep People from Pushing Your Buttons," First and foremost, you need to realize that no one else can truly force you to feel one way or another. You are ultimately responsible for your own feelings and responses.


You cannot keep people from doing things that could push your buttons, but you can keep your buttons from being pushed.;
, Just as others cannot force you to react the way they want, you cannot force others to act and react the way you want. Give up in the idea of stopping someone from antagonizing you.Identify any desire you have to change someone, make someone wrong so that you can feel right, control someone, or force someone to hear you. Also identify any expectations you have over how things ""must"" be between you and other people.
These desires can be general tendencies or desires that only apply to specific people. Either way, you need to identify them and stop yourself from clinging to them.

, Think about the last time someone pushed your buttons and set you off. Ask yourself what your sore spots are and think about how to mend them.Try to identify the root cause of your buttons. Ask yourself what insecurity or fear they connect to at your core.
If you cannot figure these things out on your own, try talking things over with a counselor or objective friend.

, Remind yourself that the world doesn't revolve around you. You are just as important as anyone else, but ultimately, everyone else has just as much innate right to happiness and an overall sense of well-being as you have.


Commit to the idea of having peaceful reactions. Reaffirm this commitment in your mind each day to help it stick.

, Think about the people who regularly push your buttons and set up healthy boundaries between you and them. You cannot control how they behave, but you can limit the number of opportunities they have to push your buttons.


People who want nothing more than to make you feel bad should be cut out of your life as completely as possible.
A loved one who will use your weaknesses against you when it benefits him or her may stay in your life, depending on the circumstances, but you need to have a serious conversation about the problems between you both. If the behavior continues even after you discuss your boundaries, draw your own boundaries by ceasing to communicate anything that could later be used against you.

, Your reactions are determined by your feelings, and your feelings are determined by your thoughts. Get in the habit of regularly viewing things from a positive perspective so that you'll have fewer buttons to press.


Thoughts generate emotions. Emotions generate behavioral choices, and each choice you make will have an outcome, whether that outcome is good or bad. If you start the process with negative thoughts, the outcome will probably be negative. On the other hand, positive thoughts are more likely to lead to positive outcomes.For instance, if you have a long-distance friend who never calls or writes to you first, you may view their behavior in a negative light. Maybe that same friend always replies to you quickly and seriously, though. Focus on the seriousness your friend does display instead of the neglect to shift your perspective from negative to positive.

, Respect often begets respect. The treatment you give others is the treatment your actions deem to be acceptable.


Showing someone respect does not guarantee that he or she will respect you in return, especially if that person has no intention of getting along with you. Respecting your loved ones and treating them fairly will usually encourage them to do likewise, though.

, When someone says or does something that pushes one of your buttons, step away from the situation before you have a chance to react.


By giving yourself time to process your feelings, you create a filter between your brain and your mouth. This filter can prevent you from reacting in a manner that will make the situation worse.
Let yourself feel whatever you feel during this time. Cry, swear, or shout into a pillow if you need to.
Once you've vented your emotions, do something to calm yourself down. Meditate, do deep breathing exercises, or go for a walk.

, There are different types of hurt. Ask yourself what exactly you're feeling and why the situation made you feel the way you do.


You'll need to stop blaming the person who antagonized you for this to work. Only by focusing on yourself can you properly address your emotions.
Among other possibilities, your hurt may result from feeling misunderstood, lonely, rejected, abandoned, neglected, or insufficient. It can even be a blend of different feelings., Think about the past and identify other times when you felt this way. Figure out how these separate incidents are all connected.


If you did your homework beforehand, you may already have some idea of what your major buttons are. That will usually make it easier to connect this incident to one of your known buttons.
If you cannot connect this issue to a known button, however, take the time to figure out which button you missed and what lies at the root of it.

, Step back and try to look at things from an objective perspective. Ask yourself if any of your current feelings or thought processes are irrational. Challenge these irrational ideas.


Ask yourself about the meaning you've assigned to this particular hurt. What does your gut think this incident means? Once you've specifically identified the perceived meaning of the drama, you can determine whether or not that meaning is actually accurate or fair.
For instance, having one confrontation with your new boyfriend or girlfriend does not mean that the entire relationship is doomed, even if your gut reaction is to believe as much.
Look for emotional excesses. Negative emotional responses are normal and healthy when bad things happen, but when a negative emotion swells inside to a size that is difficult to manage, it might be an irrational response.

, Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Try to figure out why that individual may have behaved as he or she did.


Ask yourself if he or she might be dealing with an issue that caused the poor behavior. Try to understand that person's pain while acknowledging your own.
Determine whether the incident was accidental or intentional. You may find it easier to move past this particular case if you realize that there was no ill will behind it.

, Consider the sort of effect you're having on yourself. You will probably realize that your own reaction is hurting you more than it should.


Consider what might happen if you react in the way your irrational responses tell you to do. Ask yourself if the consequences would benefit you as an individual or if they would benefit your relationship with the other involved person. If the answer is ""no,"" your gut reaction is probably an unhealthy one.

, Make a mental list of the other responses you could have to this current incident. Go through this list and ask yourself what a better response might be.


While the specifics will vary on a case by case basis, your two basic options will be to vent your hurt on the other person or to remain calm in spite of it.
Consider your long-term options, as well. You can set boundaries in the future to limit both yourself and your antagonist if you deem it necessary to do so.

, Return to the irrational meanings and conclusions you identified previously. Alter these conclusions so that they become more realistic.Look at the conclusions you initially drew from the incident. Having already determined which aspects of your response were irrational, you should already know what an unreasonable expectation looks like. You can build a more reasonable expectation from your knowledge of what is unreasonable.
For instance, you may have concluded that your relationship is doomed after one large argument. Once you identify that as an irrational conclusion, you can lead yourself to conclude that arguments will occur in any relationship and can often be resolved.

, When you successfully keep your buttons from being pushed, congratulate yourself. The process takes a lot of discipline and is something to be proud of.On the other hand, you also need to forgive yourself for the failures. If you slip up and explode after having your buttons pushed, acknowledge the failure and forgive yourself for it. Only after forgiving yourself can you let the negative experience go.

, Instead of viewing each incident as a needless test of your patience and goodwill, tell yourself that each one is an opportunity for you to learn and grow into a better person.


Reflect on each experience after it passes. Ask yourself if you've learned any lessons about the process and apply those lessons to future incidents.
As time passes, you may find old wounds beginning to heal and ancient misconceptions being corrected.

, When someone pushes a button without meaning to do so, approach him or her after you've calmed down and explain what happened. By sharing the experience with the other person, you may help that individual learn his or her own lessons. Your relationship with that person may also become stronger.


The key is to approach the discussion calmly and fairly. You are engaging in honest communication, and to do so, you must take responsibility or the experience without putting any blame on the other person.
Avoid doing this when handling someone who intentionally presses your buttons, though, since these individuals are only interested in causing you grief and may even look for a way to use this experience against you.

Think about whether your bad mood is caused by stress.,
Examine your social media habits.,
Look at your sleep habits.,
Consider if you have a poor diet or an unhealthy lifestyle.",How to Make Good Use of a Bad Mood1," Many bad moods are caused by stress, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed. If you notice a bad mood coming on during a hectic day, you may want to step back and take this as a warning sign to slow down. You may need to take a five minute break and have some downtime so you can calm down. Once you do this, you may feel your bad mood start to lift.Be willing to listen to your body and pay attention to your moods, even bad ones. Admit that you are in a bad mood due to stress and then address it by taking some relaxation time to yourself.
Make a list of warning signs that let you know when you are feeling stressed out. If you notice that you are experience any of those signs, take some time to take care of yourself.
You may also try moving tasks off your plate by handing some of them off to someone else. These are important steps to staying balanced and not letting your moods get the better of you.;
, Sometimes a bad mood may be due to using social media too often or in unhealthy ways. Excessive use of social media can contribute to feelings of depression, because it tempts you to compare your life negatively to those of your friends.If you notice you get into a negative headspace while using social media, this may be a warning sign that you need to adjust your social media habits.


To avoid bad moods, you may try limiting your social media use to only a few times a day or try to stay off social media completely. You may also try using social media in a more productive way by sharing information about current events, social issues, or articles that are happy and uplifting.
Always keep in mind that people’s lives as they appear on social media are heavily filtered. It is unrealistic to compare your own life to the edited snippets of other people’s lives that you might see on Facebook or Instagram.

, Another common cause of a bad mood is not getting enough sleep. If you tend to wake up in a bad mood or feel your bad mood is the result of exhaustion or lack of sleep, you may need to adjust your sleep patterns. Often when you are overtired, you can end up feeling irritable, grouchy, and unhappy throughout the day.You may try adjusting your sleep environment so you get a good night’s sleep. Or you may need to adjust your sleep position or your routine before bed to help fall asleep faster and for a longer period of time.
Cut back on screen time before bed, as it can be overstimulating and make it harder for you to fall asleep. The blue light from cell phone, tablet, computer, or TV screens can disrupt sleep patterns., If you tend to eat unhealthy food and do not do much physical activity, you may not feel your best. An unhealthy lifestyle can lead to feelings of anxiety, irritability, and fatigue. You may want to consider if your bad mood is a sign that your lifestyle needs to change or shift.For example, maybe you tend to skip breakfast in the morning and do not do any physical exercise during the week. As a result, you may end up in a bad mood at the midpoint in the day because you did not eat enough and you have been sitting in a cramped office or a classroom all day.
The health of your gut can have a surprising impact on your emotional health. For this reason, eating a healthy diet can make a big difference in your mood, and can help you manage anxiety and depression."
"
Identify your feelings.,
Determine your triggers.,
Accept your feelings.",How to Keep Unwanted Feelings Away1," The first step to deal with your unwanted feelings is to identify exactly what you are feeling. Ask yourself, what am I feeling? Are you angry, sad, jealous, hurt, frustrated, disappointed? Write down your feelings in a journal. Keep in mind that anger is usually a secondary emotion that is covering up something else. If you feel anger, the underlying emotion may be hurt, shame, or fear. Noticing how your body reacts (e.g. heart racing, dry mouth, clenched teeth, tense shoulders, etc.) can also help you identify your feelings. For example, a racing heart and fast breathing could indicate that you are angry. ;
, Once you know what you are feeling, begin to examine how you arrived at that emotion. What were you doing? Who were you with? Where were you when you began to feel this way? For example, if you feel jealous, you would ask yourself some specific questions about your jealousy. Were you around someone that made you feel inadequate? Did your partner make a comment about how attractive another person was? Did you watch something on television?
Your emotions can also be triggered by certain thoughts or memories you may have. If you begin to have a feeling without any external trigger, your thoughts may be affecting your emotions.

, Even though your feelings are unwanted, you do not have to be controlled or defined by them. Acknowledge that your feelings are natural and real, but you can choose how you deal with them. Tell yourself, ""I accept that I am feeling ____ in this moment.""Remind yourself that you are well equipped to deal with your emotions. Tell yourself, ""I am strong, capable, and can handle this feeling.""
Think about a time you have experienced this feeling before and handled it in the past.
It is important to accept and acknowledge your feelings. Suppressing your feelings will actually cause you to experience them even more. "

Connect with nature.,
Reach out to others.,
Take a five minute break in your day.,
Take a power nap.,
Channel your bad mood into getting chores or a project done.",How to Make Good Use of a Bad Mood2," One way to deal with a bad mood in a healthy way is to spend time in a natural setting. Go outside for a ten minute walk around the block or sit down on a bench in a park and read or people watch. Taking some time to relax in nature can help to alleviate a bad mood.Another way you can connect with nature and boost your mood is to go for a run outside or bike on an outdoor path. Exercise can help to improve your mood and doing it outside get help you feel that much better.

, Another way to snap out of a bad mood is to get in touch with friends, family, and peers that tend to cheer you up. Call up a friend who is often positive and cheerful. Or text a close friend who can sympathize with your bad mood and make you feel better. Sometimes talking to someone who is a good listener can help you let go of any anger or anxiety you are dealing with.For example, you may try talking to a friend about a bad grade and do something with them to cheer yourself up, such as going for lunch or heading out for a walk.

, Sometimes you just need a five minute break in your day to chill out and be with yourself. If you tend to have a hectic schedule, you may plan in a five minute coffee break in your day so you can have time to relax and let go of any negative feelings.During the five minute break, you may try doing breathing exercises or meditation. You may also do a relaxing activity, such as listening to your favorite song or doing some yoga stretches.

, Even a brief nap (about 20 minutes) can boost your mood and help you feel refreshed. If you feel exhausted or stressed, take a little time to lie down and snooze, or even just put your head down on your desk for a few minutes.If you can, take your nap between 1 and 4 PM, so that you will not disrupt your nighttime sleep schedule.
Be careful not to nap longer than 30 minutes, or you may feel groggy instead of refreshed when you wake up.

, If you are feeling angry or upset, you may need to channel these intense feelings into an action. You may release these feelings by doing chores and cleaning around the house to keep yourself occupied. Or you may use your negative energy to complete a project you've been meaning to do. Channeling your bad mood into a productive action can help you feel better and help you to release your anger. Focusing on a task can also help take your mind off of whatever is bothering you.


For example, you may use your bad mood to motivate yourself to complete a home improvement project or to get your homework done. Use your negative energy to get something done so you can feel accomplished and productive.

Identify the cause of your bad mood.,
Investigate the cause of your bad mood.,
Take action to address or change the cause.,
Consult a mental health specialist, if your bad mood lasts more than two weeks.",How to Make Good Use of a Bad Mood3," Start by thinking about why you are in a bad mood. Reflect on the cause of your negative thoughts. Maybe you felt the bad mood coming on on your way to work, when someone cut you off or made a rude remark. Perhaps you had a fight with a friend and this lead to your bad mood. Or maybe you failed an important test and your bad mood started to kick in.Identifying the cause of your bad mood can be difficult, especially if you are wrapped up in your emotions. One option is to sit down and do a short freewrite on the prompt, “I’m in a bad mood because…”. Try to write your thoughts down, unedited, and then read them back to yourself when you are done to try to determine the cause of your mood.
You may also try talking out loud to yourself to help determine the cause of the bad mood. Perhaps you ask yourself out loud, Why am I in such a bad mood? Then, try to answer your question as best you can.

, You should then do some thinking on the cause of your bad mood, once it has been identified, and go deeper into why you are so shaken by the issue or event. Do some further investigating into why the cause of your bad mood got you so upset. You may ask yourself, Why did this issue lead to my bad mood? Why was I so upset by this event or situation?For example, you may be in a bad mood due to a poor grade on a test. You may realize that you are in a bad mood because you studied hard but failed to perform well during the test. This upsets you because you did all the legwork but did not do well in the end.
Another scenario is you end up in a bad mood because someone says something rude and disrespectful to you at work. In the moment, you were so upset that you froze and did not know how to respond. You may be in a bad mood because of the person’s actions and because you failed to address their actions with them.

, Once you have investigated your bad mood, you should think about whether you can do anything to change or address the cause of your mood. Addressing or changing the issue that made you upset can make you feel empowered and motivated. This can help to lift your bad mood and use it in a productive way.For example, you may try to address the poor test mark by speaking to your teacher after class about extra credit you can do to raise your grade. Or you may try adjusting your test taking habits so you are more calm and prepared during the next test, and get a better mark.
To address the rude remark from a coworker, you may decide to sit down with the coworker and explain why their comment upset you. Having a mature, open conversation with the coworker can help you both come to a resolution and feel better about the situation.

, An extremely long-lasting bad mood can be a sign of a more serious underlying issue. If you just can’t shake your bad mood after a couple of weeks, talk to your doctor, or consider seeing a counselor or psychotherapist."

Avoid your triggers.,
Shift your attention.,
Change your thoughts about the situation.,
Change how you respond.,
Throw your feelings in the trash.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Keep Unwanted Feelings Away2," If possible, avoid the situations and people that trigger these unwanted feelings. In some cases, you may not be able to avoid the trigger. For example, if the trigger is your job, school, or a close family member, you may not be able to completely avoid the situation. In these cases, you will need to use other techniques. For example, if you are nervous about a test and your friend asks you have you been studying for the test, tell your friend that you do not want to talk about it and then suggest another unrelated topic.
If you are jealous of your partner's ex, do not look at the ex on social media. If need be, block the ex, so you are unable to access the profile.

, All situations have multiple aspects. There are always different you can focus on to avoid your particular trigger. You may be in a triggering situation and are unable to remove yourself from it. If you find yourself in a triggering situation, you can focus your attention away from the aspect of the situation that is causing your unwanted feelings. For example, if you are having a conversation with someone that is upsetting, you could count the ceiling tiles to distract yourself.
If you are in a room and feel inferior compared to the really attractive people around you, you may scan the room for people who are more average looking or focus on the things you find attractive about yourself (e.g. smile, eyes, outfit, etc.)

, You may not be able to change the situation, but you can change the meaning that you apply to the situation. The meaning you assign to a situation dictates your feelings and behavior towards the situation. By changing the meaning, you can influence how you feel about something. For example, instead of getting nervous or fearful any time someone asks about your upcoming exam, tell yourself, ""This is only a test. My personal value or success is not tied to this single test.""
Your goal is to replace these unwanted feelings with feelings that either bring you joy or make you feel content. , Avoiding triggers, shifting your attention, and changing thoughts are all ways to prevent your unwanted feelings. If all of these strategies fail, you may begin to experience these feelings. When this happens, your best option is to manage how you respond. Modifying your response can include dealing with any physical sensations you experience and any behavior that is a result of your feelings.
For example, if you become angry and your heart is racing and you are breathing heavily, you may practice breathing exercises to change how your body responds to your anger.
If you tend to cry when you have upsetting conversations, you may excuse yourself and go to the bathroom when you feel the tears coming to avoid crying during the conversation.

, Write down the undesirable feelings on a piece of paper. By writing your feelings down, you turn them into external objects. Once you have written the feeling down, ball up the piece of paper and throw it away. When you throw your feeling away, you are saying that the thought is invalid and unimportant.
Throwing your feelings away will decrease the impact these feelings have on your behavior and attitude.
You can also use the computer and type your feelings in a document. Once you are finished, move the document into the recycle bin.

, When you do not get enough sleep, it is more difficult for your brain to regulate your emotions. Your brain becomes fatigued and cannot tell the difference between things that are important and things that are unimportant. Your negative situations may feel more important or more difficult than they would have if you were well rested. If you are an adult, try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. If you are a teenager, try to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.

Create a list of interventions.,
Engage in positive activities daily.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Seek professional help.",How to Keep Unwanted Feelings Away3," Keep a list of interventions that you can do to feel better when you experience negative feelings. Think of interventions that you can do by yourself, with other people, and some physical activities. Having interventions that fall in all three categories will ensure that you always have an intervention no matter what situation you are in. Make sure your interventions are things that you have done before and are feasible. Interventions you can do by yourself include journaling, reading, listening to music, or meditating.
Interventions you can do with other people may include talking to a supportive friend or talking to a counselor.
Physical activities that are good interventions include taking a walk, going to the gym, playing a sport, or doing a workout video at home.
For example, if you become upset, you may listen to a specific song, talk to your best friend, or go for a walk. Knowing your response to a situation can keep you from experiencing unwanted feelings.

, Regularly participating in positive activities will increase the amount of positive emotions that you experience. Try to make these activities a part of your daily life. Find activities that you enjoy (e.g. spending time with friends, read a book, watch your favorite TV show).


Other positive activities include writing down what you are grateful for at the end of each day or counting the number of times you were kind to someone else each day. Activities that require your full attention and focus are best for promoting positive emotions.

, When you experience unwanted feelings, those feelings tend to take over your present mental state. You can become distracted or consumed by those feelings. Practicing mindfulness teaches you to focus on your present, regulate your emotions, and react less to emotions you experience. The most common way to learn mindfulness is to practice focused breathing. Sit in an upright position and take deep breaths. Focus on the air moving in and out of your body and all of the sensations that you experience.
The more you practice, the better your ability to focus on the present and manage your emotions will be.

, If you are unable to deal with your unwanted feelings on your own, you may need to work with a professional counselor or therapist. They can help you identify the source of your unwanted feelings and give you tools to handle your situation. Look for a therapist that is licensed and has experience with your specific problem.


For example, if your unwanted feelings are due to trauma you have experienced, seek out a therapist who specializes in trauma.
You can call 1-800-950-6264to find resources in your area or visit the American Psychological Association website to find a licensed psychologist in your area. "

Challenge your existing beliefs.,
Examine your ideas about the world.,
Take responsibility for your attitude.,
Re-frame your focus.,
Fake it until you make it.",How to Improve Your Attitude Toward Life and Self1," If you believe the world is a bad place, you will probably tend to have a negative attitude. As such, if you can work on changing your beliefs about the world, your attitude will likely follow suit.Also remember that beliefs tend to be quite subjective and there are multiple ways of looking at the same thing. So, try to look for evidence that runs contrary to the belief that you hold.
For example, if you believe the world is a bad place, you might spend a couple hours researching all the ways in which people help each other in times of need.;
, Your negative ideas about the world may cause you to act a certain way and this can determine the outcome of some situations. Your negative ideas may even start to take the form of predictions and, each time one of your predictions comes true, your negative views are reinforced. This is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy.


An example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is if you think that the world is a cold, mean place and so you are cold and mean to people. As a result, people may be cold and mean to you in return. You might then interpret their actions as being in line with your view of the world, which reinforces your attitude., You have a lot of control over the way you think about the world. Try to keep that in mind and use it to your advantage. Ultimately, you are responsible for your attitude and cannot blame how you think on others or on your situation.Remember that although you may not be able to change your circumstances sometimes, you can still change how you react to them by adopting one kind of attitude over another.

, In some sense, much of reality is subjective, such as whether you enjoy what you are doing or not. This depends in large part on the thoughts that you emphasize and focus on. For example, if you do not much enjoy your job, you might think with a bad attitude ""This really sucks and is pointless.""
However, you could also take a more positive attitude toward the exact same situation and think ""It is pretty amazing that I can do a task and get money to feed myself and my family. Imagine living in a time when people had to forage for food and no meal was guaranteed.""

, In part, your attitude is formed when you watch yourself act in certain ways. This is called self-perception theory, and it is the idea that people infer their own attitudes by perceiving their own behavior.For example, one study found that if you focus people's attention on the number of religious activities they have participated in before, they tend to report more favorable attitudes towards religion.
So, if you want to improve your attitude about life and yourself, you can partly get there by behaving like you want your attitude to be. This ""faking it until you make it"" can be an effective way to improve your attitude.

Set reasonable goals.,
See failure as an opportunity to learn.,
Smile.,
Look to those around you.,
Keep things in perspective.,
Monitor and expel negative self-talk.",How to Improve Your Attitude Toward Life and Self2," Setting goals that are not achievable is a surefire way to reinforce a negative attitude about the world; that it is too difficult, that it is unfair, that the tide is always working against you, etc. Setting such improbable goals can also kill your motivation.Rather than setting goals such as ""I'm going to get all As in school this semester"", try setting goals such as ""I'm going to try my best to do well in my classes""; or, instead of setting the goal of becoming a famous musician, you might set the goal of practicing music regularly.

, The idea that your talents and skills aren't fixed and unchangeable but that you can learn and grow from your mistakes is a great one to tap into. You can use the power of that idea to become more skilled and talented and positive in your life.By seeing failures as opportunities to learn and grow, you will be less likely to become pessimistic in the face of any defeats that come your way.
For example, if you perform badly on a paper at school, rather than beating yourself up about it and calling yourself dumb, you might tell yourself ""I really didn't do as well as I wanted to on this paper but I can talk to my teacher and find out how to improve my work for next time.""

, If you are having trouble adopting a more positive attitude toward life and yourself, try putting on your happy face. Force yourself to smile for a few minutes each day while you reflect on life and yourself. Studies show that there is a bi-directional relationship between the facial muscles and one's emotional state: while we generally feel happy and then smile, we can also smile and then feel happy.If you want help smiling, try sticking a pencil between your teeth so that the eraser is towards one corner of your mouth and the tip is toward the other corner; holding a pencil between your teeth in this way will cause you to smile.

, We are great at learning from those around us. So, become inspired by the actions of people around you, what they’ve done, by their biographies or simply the life stories of the people you meet. Try to be on the lookout for a unique and inspiring quality in each person you meet.


When you find someone with an attitude toward life and self that you are particularly impressed by, try to adopt the aspects of her attitude that you like best.

, Sometimes little events come up in life that may get you in a foul mood or reinforce a negative or pessimistic attitude in you. However, try to keep in mind that in the grand scheme of things, these minor events matter very little.For example, if you ruin your favorite shirt doing laundry, ask yourself whether you will still upset by this a week or month from now. Chances are you won't be because, in the bigger picture, it doesn't matter all that much.

, Your self-talk is all the unspoken words that run through your mind. Sometimes the ways in which you talk to yourself may be irrational or based on a lack of accurate information. Try to watch out for this kind of negative and inaccurate self-talk so that you can expel it from your mind. For example, if you're telling yourself that you're worthless because you should have finished your college degree by now, ask yourself some questions about this, such as:
Why does the fact that you didn't finish college exactly when most of your peers did make you worthless? Why should college define your self-worth? Was what you went through while not in college a learning experience? Did it help to shape who you are today?
Instead, use positive language to re-frame things. Try this even if you don't feel like being positive. Rather than saying things like ""I'm never going to succeed"" re-frame your thoughts to be more positive by saying things such as ""I will try my best"" or ""I will give it my all."""
"
Forgive others' mistakes.,
Don't ruminate on the problems of life.,
Look to the future.,
Cultivate gratitude.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Volunteer and help others.,
Accept your body.",How to Improve Your Attitude Toward Life and Self3," No one is perfect and people will let you down from time to time. To improve your attitude towards life, try practicing some forgiveness. By forgiving others, you will let go of negative emotion; doing so is also good for your physical health. There are several things to keep in mind to cultivate forgiveness. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time, including yourself. Try to remember the last time you did something like what was done to you. This will make it easier to take the perspective of the individual who wronged you and facilitate your forgiving him.
Treat forgiveness as something for you, and not as a gift for the person you are trying to forgive. This is something that will bring you peace, and so is beneficial for you.
Look for hidden benefits in the transgression. Although this is somewhat of a controversial point, trying to find the silver lining, that is, searching for possible ways being hurt may actually benefit you (e.g., by making you more resilient in the future) can be an effective way to forgive someone.
Remember that forgiveness will take time; it isn't something that will happen instantly.

, When you overthink the things you don’t like, the lack of money, the feeling that you're too fat, too weak, or not appreciated, you will likely just bring more misfortune and unhappiness into your life. This can happen because of self-fulfilling prophecies where you think something is some way so it becomes that way, or because you become depressed and think that you cannot possibly change, or simply because rumination can fuel negative feelings. Instead, try to focus on positive things in your life or on changing for the better.
You can also fight against rumination by letting go of things you have identified that are out of your control, or by thinking about what the worst case scenario is and asking yourself whether you could survive it (most likely the answer is yes, which will help you stop ruminating over it).For example, imagine that you dislike something about yourself that you can't change, such as how tall you are. You might let go of this by reminding yourself: ""since I can't really change my height, there's not much point in thinking about it, so I may as well turn my attention to things in my life that I can change, such as how confident I act or my sense of humor.""

, Avoid spending too much time in the past, because that time has already come and gone. If you are upset about something you did in the past, you could ask yourself how you can use that information to improve for the future, but other than that don't dwell on the past. Instead, look to creating the future that you want. Try to remind yourself that whatever great opportunities you missed in the past are not as important as the potential opportunities that lie ahead.
Also, remember that the past is something that you can't change, whereas you can change your future. Doesn't it make more sense to spend more time thinking about what you can change over what you cannot?

, Gratitude involves being thankful of and acknowledging that there are good things in the world beyond ourselves. Practicing gratitude is good for your physical and mental health, and can improve your relationships, all of which can help you improve your attitude toward life. To cultivate gratitude you can: Keep a journal and write down a few things each day that you are thankful for.
Write and send a letter of gratitude to someone.
Focus on the intentions of others' actions and not necessarily just the outcomes that are brought about.

, To be mindful is to maintain an awareness of your thoughts, feelings, sensations, and surroundings in the moment and to accept them without judgment. Studies show that practicing mindfulness can lead to better physical and mental health, and can lead people to be more compassionate and prosocial — all of which are important for an improved life attitude. To practice mindfulness you can: Pay close attention to your surrounding environment.
Listen closely to your breathing.
Focus intently on your sensations, the sights, smells, sounds, etc., you are experiencing.
Accept your thoughts and feelings but do not judge them; you can do this by acknowledging that they are real, and then moving on to other sensations, thoughts, feelings.

, Studies show that helping others, such as by volunteering, can help foster a positive self-image. This may be because helping others can provide you with a sense of worth and accomplishment.Look online or in your local newspaper for ways to become involved in your community.

, People are bombarded with unrealistic body images by the media. This can make it difficult to accept how you look. Accepting and loving yourself is an important part of improving your attitude towards life. To better accept your body you can:Stop dieting and eat normally. By dieting, you are telling yourself through your behavior that there is something wrong with you that needs fixing. Instead of dieting, work on eating normally, eating only when you are hungry, having balanced meals, and getting exercise and being healthy.
Focus on yourself in your entirety, not just how you look. Remember that you are a unique individual who is so much more than just a body; you have a personality, a mind, a unique history, and a way of looking at the world (your attitude!).
Respect how others look; if you find yourself judging others negatively for how they look, you may be more likely to judge yourself, too. Try to accept people as unique individuals and remember that looks can have an automatic but dubious impact on your impressions of others."

Determine who you are trying to hide your feelings from.,
Understand that some feelings should not be contained.,
Know when your feelings are a warning sign of something deeper.",How to Hide What You Feel1," Are you hiding them from just one friend? Other friends? Both? Everyone? This is going to determine how you proceed and to what degree you must hide your feelings.


Hiding your feelings from everyone works only if the feelings are temporary and not likely to affect other aspects of your life. For instance, if you are angry at your parents for grounding you, but you know that you will get over it soon, you can choose to ignore and hide those feelings from everyone. But if you are angry at your parents for abusing you, this is not something you are likely to overcome without telling someone in authority, discussing it with friends, and eventually confronting your parents about it (when you are older, assuming you want to maintain a relationship with them).
It is often helpful if you have a trusted friend you can confide in. This person may be able to help you sort through your complex emotions and understand your options. Someone who has no connection to the person you have feelings for is ideal.;
, Sometimes, the healthiest choice for you is to express your feelings and deal with the fallout. Often, containing the way you feel causes those feelings to grow instead of recede, and eventually you have to let them out.


Tell your friend if you have romantic feelings for them, if those feelings are making it difficult for you to be a good and supportive friend. Your friend has the right to know and if you have a strong enough friendship, you can work through the way you are feeling together.
Most often, feelings of hurt or betrayal at the hands of someone you love should be dealt with. If someone has caused you pain, you deserve to let them know and give them the chance to make it right. If they care about you, they would want to know that you are hurting. If they don't care about you, then you deserve to know that, too, so that you can move on with your life.

, Containing or hiding your feelings is not the best answer if your feelings are an indication that you need to seek help. In those rare cases, it's important to recognize that your feelings are a symptom of something else.


If you have an urge to hurt yourself or others, seek help immediately. Self-harm and/or violent tendencies can signal underlying disorders and you don't have to live like that! If you're in the United States, call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or search online for your country's resources.
If your feelings are inappropriate or illegal-- for example, sexual feelings for minors or an overwhelming urge to use illegal drugs-- please seek help from a licensed counselor or psychologist. There are treatment plans available for you. If you don't have a mental health care provider, your general practitioner can give you a recommendation.
If you have ongoing feelings of despair, sadness, or like life does not have the same meaning it used to have, you may be experiencing depression. Seek help from a licensed mental health care provider, who can help you with a personalized treatment plan. Ask your general practitioner for a recommendation.

Challenge negative thought patterns.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Cultivate an attitude of gratitude.,
Boost your self-esteem with positive affirmations.",How to Improve Mental Hygiene1," The way you perceive the situations that happen in your life can greatly determine your mood and outlook. Thinking about your problems over and over without actually coming up with a solution is called rumination. This process can promote feelings of depression and even lead to cardiovascular disease.Challenge your negative thought patterns by questioning the validity or certainty of your thought.For example, you turned in an assignment late and think to yourself “Now, my professor hates me.”
Ask yourself whether the situation is as bad as you are making it out to be. Does turning in a paper late really call for such a strong word as hate? Consider that your teacher may be disappointed, but it is highly unlikely that he hates you because of it.;
, Comparison diminishes the unique talents and gifts of yourself or others in an attempt to size up achievements or personal traits. The thing is, it is a lose-lose no matter how you look at it.If you are pumping yourself up by comparing yourself to someone who is worse off than you in some area, then you are giving you are giving yourself a false sense of satisfaction. Comparing your own abilities to someone else who is better than you causes you to depreciate your strengths.
Everyone is on a different journey. What’s more, everyone has areas where they are talented and areas of weakness. Comparing takes away from individuality. The only person you should compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday.

, One of the greatest protective factors against negative life events is your ability to swap self-pity for thankfulness. Positive aspects exist in most life ordeals if you only just look for them. Research shows that gratitude combats toxic emotions, increases empathy, promotes better sleep, enables the development of positive relationships, and boosts physical health.You can cultivate gratitude in a number of ways.Let people who are dear to you know how important they are in your life. At the end of each day, think about 2 to 3 things that you are thankful for. Or, start a gratitude journal.

, People don’t always have an ever-flowing stream of self-esteem. Sometimes, particularly after a failure or setback, you have to search for positive things to say about yourself. But, that’s okay. In addition to changing self-talk, you also want to change what you say about yourself when you look in the mirror (and other parts of your day). Use these affirmations daily.I love who I am.
I believe in myself.
I am a valuable person who is worthy of respect.
My success is determined by how warm and loving I am to myself.
I count my blessings.
I am a work in progress.
My opinions match who I am.
I recognize my strengths.

Identify the running commentary in your head.,
Accept that your inner voice is often wrong.,
Use your feelings as a cue to examine your thoughts.,
Figure out if you are “filtering.” Although negative self talk can take any variety of types and topics, it usually derives from a common set of general forms.,
Perceive if you are “personalizing.” Have you ever blamed yourself for the weather (“It only stormed because I wanted to go to the beach.”) or your favorite sports team’s performance (“They always lose when I watch.”)?,
Catch yourself “catastrophizing.” Do you assume that it will rain on your wedding day?,
Pick up on your habit of “polarizing.” Some people perceive themselves and the world in a strictly binary fashion — black or white, good or bad, yes or no, positive or negative, and so on.,
See if you are “self-limiting.” If you make up your mind beforehand that you can’t accomplish something, you create a self-fulfilling prophecy that sabotages your chances of success.,
Judge whether you are “jumping to conclusions.” This form of negative self talk is very similar to the other forms that draw from assuming the worst in a situation.,
Home in on your “habits of speech.” Do you, without thinking, call yourself “stupid” under your breath when you make a mistake, or say to yourself “Good idea, fatso” when you succumb to a tempting dessert?,
Observe how you make others’ thoughts your own.,
Challenge your inner voice.,
Practice positive self talk.,
Create a healthier environment.",How to Identify Negative Self Talk," If you’ve ever watched a DVD movie with the audio commentary track running, you know that sometimes you’re actively listening to what the art director and third lead actress have to say, while at other times you’re drawn into what’s happening onscreen. The inner voice within you operates similarly; it’s always “talking,” even when you aren’t paying attention.However, even when your inner voice is running in the background, it impacts your perceptions and feelings about yourself and your surroundings. Therefore, it is important to pause often and take stock of this running commentary.;
, No one’s inner voice is positive, supportive, and accurate all the time. Many people, especially those who experience episodes of depression, have an inner voice that usually skews negative (that is, negative self talk). Sometimes this negativity is justified, but other times it is completely off the mark.Negative self talk is justified and reasonable if you are about to cliff dive even though you don’t know how to swim (“This is crazy! I can’t do this!”). It is unhelpful and quite possibly inaccurate when it tells you that you are going to fail a test before it even begins.
Basically, you inner voice is not always right. It can be very wrong, to your detriment.

, None of us can be attuned to our self talk at all times, or we’d all be “listening” so intently that we’d never get anything done. However, there are clear emotional signs that negative self talk may be occurring and should be examined.When you begin to feel depressed, angry, anxious, or upset, use this as a cue to take a moment and examine your self talk more closely. What are you “telling” yourself? Once you’re paying closer attention, you can begin the process of identifying negative self talk and eventually doing something about it.

, One of these is “filtering,” in which your inner self is magnifying the negative aspects of a situation and “filtering” out the positive aspects.If you won the lottery and could only think about all the taxes, financial advisor fees, and requests for loans or handouts by so-called friends, that would be a case of filtering.

, These are extreme examples of a very real form of negative self talk called “personalizing,” in which you blame yourself whenever anything bad occurs.If you find out your parents are getting divorced, and the first thought in your head is “I must have caused too much trouble and made them unhappy,” then you’re personalizing.

, That you’ll never be able to figure out how to parallel park a car? That the restaurant will be sold out of your favorite dish? That you’ll die alone? If so, you’ve experienced “catastrophizing,” or anticipating the worst in a situation.Preparing for the worst-case scenario isn’t a bad thing, but when you expect the worst even in the face of ample evidence to the contrary, you are experiencing a damaging form of negative self talk.

, When you experience “polarizing” self talk, you simplify a complex situation into a strict dichotomy with no “middle ground.”People who regularly experience polarizing self talk tend to perceive that they can only either be perfect or a failure, with no space in between. Since it’s impossible to be the former, they label themselves as the latter.

, Self-limiting talk that emerges from your inner voice imposes artificial limitations on your achievements and your happiness.If you find yourself saying “I can’t do this — it’s too hard!” before you even begin trying, you are self-limiting.

, “Jumping to conclusions,” though, occurs most particularly when you turn a worst-case assumption into fact before there is any possible reason to do so.If you think “I did so terrible at that job interview” before you even leave the room or “They’re going to hate this cake I baked” before it’s even out of the oven, you’re jumping to conclusions without any justification based in reality.

, Even when you don’t fully realize or mean what you say, such negative habits of speech can slowly but surely impact your self-perception.If you exclaim “I’m such an idiot!” reflexively enough times, your image of yourself will begin to shift to match this claim. In time, it will become your starting assumption (“I’m an idiot, so of course I can’t do this.”).

, Your mother or some other trusted source of wisdom may have begun many pieces of advice with the phrases “You really shouldn’t …” or “You ought to …”. Over time, this advice can become internalized, combining someone else’s voice with your own inner voice. And, even if the advice is well-meaning and sensible, this can be a problem for you.These external voices will feel as though they are part of your own voice, yet you will act out of guilt when you follow them, instead of desire. For instance, you might not quit your job and seize a new opportunity because you hear your father’s voice (working through your own self talk) saying not to “throw away” a good job. For better or worse, you are not being true to yourself.

, When you recognize your negative self talk, don’t let it go unchallenged. It might be legitimate, rational, and beneficial, or it may be inaccurate and damaging. Interrogate your self talk with questions that will determine whether it deserves to stay or needs to go.Test your negative self talk against reality. Is there any factual basis for feeling this way? What is the evidence that the worst is about to happen?
Consider alternative explanations. Is there another way you could look at this situation? Is there something else going on that you haven’t considered?
Put things in perspective. Think about whether this is really the worst (or best) thing that could happen. Will it really matter in five days, five weeks, or five years?
Use goal-directed thinking. Re-state your life goals (career, family, personal fulfillment, etc.) and determine whether this mode of thinking will help or hamper you in achieving them. Can this be a learning experience? Or is it simply a roadblock that needs to be cleared away?

, We all experience negative self talk that is unwarranted and damaging. Thankfully, there are ways to confront the negativity and replace it with positive self talk. This can involve repeating positive affirmations or turning negative thoughts “inside out” and making them positive. The assistance of a therapist or other mental health professional may be beneficial in developing positive self talk strategies, especially if you regularly experience symptoms of depression.For instance, with practice and patience, you can turn your inner voice telling you “I can’t do this” into “Let’s see what I learn when I give this a try.” Or “No one there even cares enough to know my name” into “This is an opportunity to make a good impression on them.”

, If you surround yourself with positive people, who exude and “live” their own positive self talk, this will make it easier for you to identify and embrace your own positivity. Without even knowing it, they can help you “turn around” your negative self talk into something better.Additionally, if you live a healthier lifestyle — by exercising regularly, eating well, reducing stress, etc. — you may be less prone to negative self talk, and more capable of overcoming it. A healthy body supports healthy mental and emotional states.

Boost your self-esteem.Going through an intense emotional situation can cause one’s self-esteem to plummet.,
Focus on the positives.It's incredibly easy to lose sight of the good things happening in your life when an important element is under fire.",How to Heal Emotional Pain," Acknowledging the pain you feel is the first step towards healing. Maybe you just went through a devastating breakup. You can’t refuse to look at it and just tuck it away, acting as if the hurt didn't happen. If you do not attend to emotional pain, the wound will only grow larger.


Write a summary about what happened to you and read it aloud.Get some distance from what happened to you by placing it in front of you and trying to objectively describe it. Explain what happened in great detail and then read it aloud.
For example, you might explain in detail what happened to incite the breakup and how you felt then and now.
It can also be helpful to share your testimony with others when you’re ready. You might tell a friend or loved one who is going through something similar or even participate in a support group pertaining to the issue you have faced.;
, Listen to your mind and body and see what they are trying to tell you.


Perhaps your chest is tight and you feel hollow as if there is a piece missing from your body. Maybe you are thinking that you are afraid to be alone and you don't know how you will move forward. Acknowledge the physical and mental aspects of your emotions.

, Now that you have acknowledged and tuned into your feelings, it’s time to validate what you’re feeling by caring for yourself. Say aloud what you’re feeling and be okay with that. “I want to cry because I am hurt, but this, too, shall pass.”Other ways to show self-compassion may include giving yourself a hug, rubbing your shoulders as if you were comforting yourself, or treating yourself to something special that will cheer you up.

, Don’t let your emotions run the show. Even if we do not enjoy experiencing negative emotions, it is a natural part of being human. Feeling hurt, disappointed, rejected, or betrayed is absolutely acceptable. What is not acceptable is to use those emotions as fuel to perseverate hurt and pain. You might want to call your ex and beg to fix the relationship. Or, you may want to lash out in anger and betrayal. Gain control

of your emotions so that you do not act out in a way you may regret later.

Try deep breathing. Inhale through your nose for about 4 counts. Hold the breath for a few counts and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Repeat this until you start to feel more relaxed and in control.Remind yourself of who you are and what you stand for. Make sure that your actions align with your own goals and are not impulsive responses to being hurt.

, When your body and mind are healthy, you are better equipped to deal with emotional trauma and stress. Make sure that you are getting adequate sleep (at least 7 to 9 hours per night), eating healthy, balanced meals, getting physical activity, avoiding self-medicating with alcohol and drugs, as well as doing things that soothe you and help you manage stress.You can manage stress by performing relaxation techniques, practicing mindfulness, hanging out with fun and supportive friends, or exercising.

, Brainstorm a way you can use your unfortunate circumstance to improve your own life or the lives of others. There are tons of ways you can channel negative emotions into something positive.


For example, you can use negative emotions to fuel creativity and problem-solving. When something bad has happened you are extremely motivated and equipped to think of solutions that can prevent the situation from happening again. You can also find ways to use the pain for good like sharing testimony to empower others or starting a non-profit group to protect other survivors like yourself.Let's say you lost a loved one in a preventable tragedy like a car accident. You can spread the word about the incident and educate others on how they can prevent such a thing from happening to them, like not texting and driving or not getting behind the wheel after drinking or when sleepy.

, Touch is the most basic form of communication that humans have. When you are reeling from a heartbreak or betrayal, it can be incredibly comforting to be touched. Science tells us that touch provides emotional balance and can even lead to better health.Ask a friend for a hug. Simply grab your child or loved one’s hand and squeeze it tight. Visit a spa for an invigorating massage. Touching another person can provide an untapped source for healing.
If the emotional pain you have experienced was caused by touch, you may not yet be ready for this step. Use your judgment to determine if touch will heal or hurt depending on what you have gone through and how you are processing the pain.

, Try to overcome this instinct and instead move into a circle of supportive, positive people who can help you heal.


A support system can be a natural one such as your family, a group of friends, or others who may have experienced a similar loss in their lives.
It can feel awkward reaching out of help. Choose someone who is usually supportive and positive. Approach the person by sharing a little about what you're going through and then asking for advice: ""I've been having a tough time coping with Jessica's death. How do you cope after a loss?""

, When you're reeling after an upsetting event it's best to treat yourself gently. Soothe yourself through this difficult time by leaning in to the activities that make you smile. These can be virtually anything--listening to music and dancing, riding your bike, chatting with a long-distance friend, or binge-watching your favorite TV show. Don't feel guilty about treating yourself. It can help lift your mood and remind you that there are good things in your life despite the bad., If your emotional pain is preventing you from being able to function in your everyday life, you may need to speak with a professional. Signs that you need to get professional help may also include using alcohol and drugs to self-medicate, avoiding people, places or things that remind you of what happened, withdrawing from close friends and family, or having flashbacks of the upsetting event.A therapist can help you process your emotions and learn to cope with them in a safe and effective way. Search for a therapist in your local area, if you are having trouble finding healing on your own.

, Rumination is the act of thinking about the upsetting event or situation over and over again. Maybe you were fired from your job and you now feel like a failure. You might constantly tell yourself “what if” and beat yourself up for not predicting it would happen. Rumination is poisonous to a health frame of mind and can ultimately lead to depression.


Stop rumination by looking at the situation as a learning experience. Ask yourself what lesson you learned from losing your job, and use that as fuel to inspire future actions.
You can also overcome a rumination habit by scheduling a daily worry period. This is a period of about 15 to 30 minutes where you are allowed to think about your worries each day. Any other worrying done outside this time period must be postponed. Empower your worry periods even more by making strategic problem-solving plans about the things you find yourself worrying about. Maybe you can write out a plan to update your resume and start job-hunting., When you feel guilty about something, you become the architect of your own unhappiness. Guilt keeps you from moving forward in your life because there is unresolved shame or pain that needs to be addressed.


To move on from guilt, you must apologize—to yourself or another person—for the role you played in an upsetting situation. You must forgive yourself and give yourself permission to reengage with your life and stop standing in the past., Failing in an important aspect of life can result in a great emotional hit. When you face disappointment or failure, it’s necessary to gain a different perspective so that you do not get bogged down and lose your focus.


You can gain perspective by talking to others about your perceived failure. Friends and loved ones can help you to understand that failure in one area does not immediately result in failure in all areas or even a pattern of failure.You can also reframe the failure as a lesson learned or one more obstacle you have surpassed that is pushing you that much closer to a future success. You may have lost your job, but perhaps this happened to push you towards changing careers and doing something you really enjoy.

, Constantly running failures through your head, feeling rejected, being knocked down by failure—all of these circumstances have the power to take your self-confidence down a notch.


Bypass this hit to your self-esteem by showing compassion for yourself. Remind yourself that you are only human, not a superhero. These negative circumstances serve to make you stronger.
It can also help to take an inventory of all the characteristics you have that serve as strengths. Recall these attributes when you feel poorly about yourself. In addition, be willing to accept compliments as well-intentioned rather than questioning their authenticity. Be proud of who you are despite past hurts and shortcomings.

, Try to maintain a balanced perspective. Nothing is all bad. No matter how long it rains, at some point, you can be sure the sun will shine again. Focus on the good and you may start to feel better about your situation.


Make a list of things you are grateful for in your life. Maybe losing your job showed you how wonderful your support network is. Maybe the setback made you grateful you were always such a consistent saver because now you have a little money tucked away until you find a new opportunity. Look to the good in your life. You may be surprised to learn that you have a lot more going for you than you previously thought.

Avoid one-on-one time.,
Act normal.,
See them in a new light.,
Avoid them if you must.",How to Hide What You Feel2," It's easy to become lost in your own little world with someone that you have feelings for, but if you're trying to hide your feelings, it's best if you avoid spending time alone together where situations are more likely to make it hard to hide how you feel.


Spending time alone will only cause your feelings to grow and create more opportunities for you to accidentally give yourself away-- a hug that lingers too long, a brush of the hands that leads to hand-holding, or a gaze into his or her eyes that says more than you meant to say. Keeping other friends nearby can give you a way to avoid those tempting scenarios and also keep your affection from growing.
If you typically spend time alone with this person, avoid setting off any alarm bells in their mind by gradually shifting to more group-oriented get togethers. For example, if you usually grab drinks after work together, arrange beforehand for another mutual friend to meet up with the you at a particular location. That way, when the object of your feelings asks if you want to grab a drink, you can say that you already have plans but he or she is welcome to join.

, Don't try to impress them or show off too much for them. It shows that you're looking for attention and most people will figure out why.


Similarly, don't go out of your way to run errands or do favors for your friend. It might be easy to go overboard with helpful favors since you really like this person and care for his or her well-being, but it will be obvious that your feelings are not what they were before if you start acting in new ways.

, Try to notice their flaws or things about them that you don't find attractive or sexy. We often tend to elevate people we like to a superhuman status and forget that they have flaws and failures just like everyone else.


Try to think of them as a sibling. If a relationship with this person is just not possible (for instance, you're gay and they are not, or they are married), the best thing you can do is re-frame how you view the person so that he or she is off-limits to you, too, instead of just the other way around.

, If the feelings have gotten too strong and you feel you can't hide them any longer, you may have to reduce the amount of time you spend with them or cut out your relationship altogether.


For example, if your friend is married or in a serious relationship, and you cannot stop thinking about them romantically and you are afraid you are going to try to act on your feelings, it might be better for both of you to lose a friendship than for your friend to lose their marriage.

"
"
Watch what you say.,
Lie if you must.,
Avoid them.",How to Hide What You Feel3," Be quick on your feet to respond, especially if you are nervous as your other friends will tell everyone if you admit your feelings.


Be ready to change the subject or divert the focus from you if the sensitive topic arises. When questioned about your feelings you have to have a determined-sounding response and fire back your response without too much (or too little) delay.
One of the biggest tell-tale signs of someone who is hiding their feelings is that they become uncharacteristically quiet or standoffish. If you want to hide your feelings, you have to hide the fact that you're hiding them as well! So be sure to try not to come across as overly quiet., If they ask you directly, and you still don't want to admit, you're going to have to consciousness look them in the eye and lie. Make your response simple and to the point.


Many people believe that making eye contact is a sign that the speaker is telling the truth so this along with your brief responses will help to keep your feelings secret.

, If you are overcome with anger or sadness and those feelings intensify in the presence of others, you may have to take some time out and avoid the people who stir those feelings in you.


In many cases, time will help alleviate some of your emotions, and you will be able to resume your relationship once things have cooled down.
In some cases, such as instances of extreme betrayal or abuse, it might be better to eliminate that relationship altogether.

"
Avoid coping mechanisms.,
Choose healthy outlets for your emotions.,
Express your emotions in appropriate ways.",How to Hide What You Feel4," If you decide to conceal your feelings, you might be tempted to turn to common but unhealthy coping mechanisms, but doing so just makes the problem worse.


Avoid drugs or alcohol. Many people who are sad or experiencing unrequited love turn to alcohol or drugs to cope with the pain, but doing so tends to make the sadness even worse when soberness returns, and can lead to problems with addiction and health consequences.
Watch out for the sugar trap. Many people cope with sadness or feelings of rejection by eating, particularly carb- and sugar-heavy foods like ice cream and chocolate. But the body responds to sugar and carbs by creating a fake emotional ""high"" that quickly plummets into a sugar crash that is even worse than the way you felt before you ate the sugar. Don’t fall into that trap!Don't turn to empty relationships and sex. Especially if your feelings are related to unexpressed love or feelings of rejection from a romantic partner, you might be tempted to turn to casual sex and empty relationships to fill that void. But these relationships will not fill your craving for affection and intimacy. Give yourself time to grieve your lost love and then give it time. You will find someone to fill the emotional needs you have as well as the physical ones.

, Instead of unhealthy coping mechanisms, look for healthy ways to express your feelings.


Try exercise. Focusing your anger or disappointment on physical fitness can be a great way to distract yourself. Consider high intensity exercise like boxing, weightlifting, or circuit training. Just be sure you don't take it too far and exercise without resting or without taking proper precautions to protect your body from injuries.
Learn a new art form. Expressing yourself through creativity can help to get some of your emotions out in safe, healthy ways. Try painting, writing music, writing short stories or poetry, or a craft like sewing or woodworking. Even if the art is unrelated to your particular feelings that you're hiding, it can be a way to take your mind off of things and focus your energy on something productive.

, You may have been fearful to express your emotions for fear that the confrontation would get out of control. It's important to develop and practice healthy ways of expressing yourself so that you can be in control of your interactions with others.


Feelings of anger should not automatically result in shouting fests. In fact, yelling when you're angry often makes it hard to communicate what it is that has you upset, and also makes it more likely that the person you're yelling at will tune you out and not listen. Instead, let anger lead you to be more assertive and brave in your confrontations without letting it get the better of you. Use your anger to guide you toward rational conversations that can help solve the problem rather than creating new ones.Express your sadness without fearing that you shouldn't. Some people have been raised to think that it's childish or inappropriate to cry or mourn a loss, especially for men, but actually letting yourself feel sadness when sad things happen is an important sign of maturity. It's ok to feel sad and let yourself experience that feeling by crying.Expressing your feelings can help you avoid negative health consequences of holding them in, such as hypertension, depression, and weight gain.Check out this helpful wikiHow article for more advice about healthy ways to express your emotions.

Acknowledge when you’re not feeling great.,
Express your emotions in a healthy way.,
Understand that both negative and positive emotions are essential.",How to Improve Mental Hygiene2," Emotional awareness is the process of recognizing and acknowledging your feelings. Having emotional awareness can equip you to properly manage and improve your mental hygiene. When humans feel a certain emotion, generally, there is a physical or mental reaction that accompanies it. Paying attention to your own physical and mental cues can help you identify when you are experiencing specific emotions.


For example, you are sitting in a restaurant. A friend is meeting you for lunch. She is already 10 minutes late. You think “Geez, she always has me waiting.” And, you notice yourself tapping your straw repeatedly against your water glass. Both the resulting thought and action help you realize that you are feeling impatient.Choose a span of time to observe your thoughts and actions. How do they clue you in to your emotional state? Record these observations in a journal as a first step towards greater emotional awareness.

, After you have learned to spot the mental and physical cues of your emotions, you can then find positive ways of expressing them. Emotional expression is necessary as withholding or suppressing your emotions can lead to unhealthy outcomes like depression or anxiety. There are many ways you can express your feelings in an adaptive way.Talking to others is one of the best methods to getting your feelings out.Just be sure that whoever you are sharing with is supportive and non-judgmental. Consider a best friend, a sibling, or a counselor.
Writing about your feelings is also helpful. Jot down your thoughts into a journal. Over time, you can look back on these entries to see if any patterns emerge. Journal writing is naturally good for mental health, especially when it is used not just for venting, but for problem-solving, too.
Cry if you need to. When people feel sad, they may withhold this emotion out of guilt or shame. Other times, you may feel sadness, but be unable to cry. Watch a movie, read literature, or listen to music that speaks to your emotional state to help you shed those tears.
Release the tension. Anger can be one of the most difficult emotions to express because what you do when you are angry may not be socially acceptable. For example, it may not be a good idea to shout at your loved ones, break things, or punch walls. Instead, you can use some of the same stress management techniques to conquer anger. Try completing a vigorous workout or screaming into a pillow.

, Humans like to express joy, excitement, and love. But, it may seem like the right thing to push away negative emotions. You may have been raised on the idea that showing anger, shame, or frustration was a no-no, so you push away these feelings. Suppressing your emotions can actually worsen how you feel to mounting anxiety, phobias or depression.Remember to always counteract your temptation to hide or withhold negative emotions. Negative emotions like sadness or anger are as equally significant to your mental health as are positive feelings."

Exercise regularly to manage stress.,
Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Get an appropriate amount of sleep.,
Prepare a stress-relief toolbox.,
Develop a strong support system.",How to Improve Mental Hygiene3," One of your biggest weapons against stress is in your ability to move your body. Staying physically active offers tons of meaningful benefits such as greater resistance to disease, weight loss, and an immunity boost. However, regular exercise also helps reduce tension, lift your mood, improve self-esteem, and help you sleep.Find an enjoyable activity that increases your heart rate and challenges you physically. Some ideas can be swimming, hiking, weight-lifting, yoga, and even walking your dog.

, What you eat can help you fend off stress, too. Certain foods and beverages can actually exacerbate or cause stress like fast food, certain cheeses, some kinds of nuts, caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. On the other hand, some foods can help your body fight stress. These include fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, yogurt, and drinking plenty of water., When it comes to stress and sleep, you can easily get confused as to which came first. Do problems with sleep cause stress? Or, does stress cause sleep disruption? Scientists believe both are highly probable. Americans get far less than the recommended 7 to 9 hours each night and when they do sleep, the quality is poor due to stress.To improve your sleep habits, try the following.Go to sleep at the same time each night, and rise at the same time each morning.
Create a “winding down” period each night in which you turn off all electronics, stop working, and engage in relaxing activities such as reading or taking a warm bath.
Make sure that your sleeping environment is dark enough and comfortable. Save the bedroom for bedroom activities only. Refrain from watching TV or doing work in bed.
Stop caffeine intake 4 to 6 hours before bed. Refrain from smoking cigarettes or drinking excessive alcohol too close to bedtime. , You can successfully do all the things to prevent stress, but you will still be faced with stressful situations at times. During troubling periods in your life, turn to your stress-relief toolbox to help you ease anxiety and improve your mood. There are a variety of activities you can do to manage your stress.


Practice deep breathing. In the moment, a deep breathing exercise can relieve tension and promote calm. Try the 4-7-8 method.Inhale through the mouth for 4 counts, hold the breath for 7 counts, and then exhale for 8 counts. Repeat as needed.
Try meditation. This is a practice of focused attention that enables you to be in the moment and bring greater awareness to your focus (e.g. your breathing, your body, your environment, etc.). There are many types of meditation that are useful for various conditions. Find one that works for you by trying out several variations.Take care of yourself. Regularly take out the time to do things you enjoy, whether that is getting a manicure, taking a long walk or cuddling up with your partner to watch Netflix.

, The people you spend the most time with are as critical to your health and well-being as other factors like diet and exercise. Psychologists often prescribe strong social support for getting over mental illnesses like depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.Even if you are not dealing with a serious mental disorder, you can still gain the positive benefits of social support.


Research has shown that a positive network of friends, family and peers can help you develop a sense of security, increased self-worth, and belongingness.Get out more to enhance your support system. Try to meet new people by joining a gym or social club, volunteering, approaching peers at school or work, or by initiating connections online. You will also want to show continued dedication to any existing positive relationships as well.

Don’t react immediately.,
Excuse yourself from the situation.,
Breathe deeply.,
Think about something else.,
Control your response.",How to Keep Negative Emotions Contained1," When you are in a situation that triggers a negative emotion, don’t react right away! Instead, try taking several deep breaths before reacting. If you don’t feel calmer after several breaths, you can continue breathing deeply for several minutes until you feel calm enough to address the situation.Some other things you can try include:


Going into a different rom for a few minutes.
Counting to 10.
Listening to some soothing music.
Going for a walk.;
, Sometimes the best strategy for keeping a negative emotion contained in the moment is to temporarily remove yourself from the situation. For example, if your co-worker insults you at work, kindly excuse yourself and take a moment to go to the bathroom or grab a drink of water. This will allow you to temporarily disconnect from the situation and gain some composure., When you encounter a situation that evokes intense emotion like crying, taking a few moments to breathe deeply can help you contain your emotions. For example, if you see your ex-boyfriend out at the movies with another man, try breathing deeply for at least five breaths. This will help you contain your negative emotions in the moment so that you don’t do something you might regret such as lashing at him or his new boyfriend., Shifting the focus of your attention to something other than the person or situation that is causing you to feel a negative emotion can help you control unwanted emotional reactions or outbursts. For example, if you find yourself furious at your boss’s behavior try thinking about the wonderful weekend you have planned with your wife and children. This will help deflect the negative emotion in the moment so you can focus on accomplishing your goals for the rest of the work day., You can’t change how you feel about a situation, but you can shift your response. For example, instead of reacting to your co-worker’s insult with one of your own, try smiling and asking them to clarify what they meant by their statement. Instead of yelling at whomever left their socks on the steps again, try calmly saying, “Somebody left their socks on the stairs again and caused me to fall. Can you please come pick them up?”"

Choose not to be affected by it.,

Don't try to please everyone.,
Keep yourself motivated.",How to Handle Negative Situations," Before doing anything, give yourself a moment to calm down. When you're in a negative situation, you can get stressed out very easily and do the wrong thing. Take a moment, take a few deep breaths, relax, and think clearly. If you respond when you're still emotional, chances are you'll only make things worse. Once you've collected yourself, your emotions, and your thoughts, you'll be able to deal with the situation much better. Life will always present you with bad situations, but it's up to you how you're going to react to them.;
, In order for you to move on from this negative situation, you'll need to be able to let go. It's very hard to do this when you keep your emotions bottled up inside of you. Talk to someone about it; a friend, family member, etc. Vent about your feelings in a journal or blog, or even a loose leaf paper that you shred afterwards. Cry, scream, or punch a pillow if you need to. Doing this will release the tension inside of you and help you start to move on.

, Life will throw many obstacles at you, and there's no use crumpling at the sight of them. If you work hard, you can overcome those obstacles and move on with your life.

, Sometimes something you've done has gotten you in a negative situation. If this is so, instead of keeping everything cooped up inside of you, admit that you've made a mistake. Apologize and move on.

, The best way to deal with negative situations is to stay positive! It's not as easy as it sounds, but it can be done. Don't allow yourself to become jaded by something bad that's happened. Stay positive, don't jump to conclusions, and keep an open mind. Eliminate negative thoughts; dwelling on the bad won't make a difference. Every cloud has a silver lining, so find a bit of positivity in every bad situation.

, Don't be so serious! Have a sense of humor and learn to laugh at yourself and your situation. Embarrassing moments happen, and there's nothing you can do, so why not just laugh about it? Laughter is the best medicine, after all.

, Not all bad situations are permanently bad. Instead of focusing on the problem, focus on the solution. Did you lose your job?


You can respond by becoming despondent and give up, draw unemployment compensation, and spend your savings or,
Look at options like improving your skills by attending school or other training opportunities

, Know that you always have a choice. Even though you can't control what happens to you, you can always control how it affects you. For example, you can't control the person who is bullying you, but you can control the way you feel about it. Realize that the bully is wrong about you and that you shouldn't listen to what they say, or take it to heart. Let's say that your sibling is making fun of you. You have a choice of what to do in this situation:


Think positively, and take their comments as incentive to change and improve yourself.
Fight back, and deepen the rift or even cause lasting ill will.

, When someone says something negative, look into their message and see if there's something helpful in there. If someone insulted your hairstyle, why not try getting a new one? This is a great opportunity for change, and you might find that you love your new style even more than your old one.


If the message is 100% negative, just ignore it.

, Instead of getting angry, sad, or upset, learn from what has happened. Was it something inside of your control? How can you learn from your mistake and avoid repeating it later in life? Was it something out of your control? You shouldn't be so upset if there was nothing you could have done to stop the negative thing from happening. Que sera, sera, after all. Instead of viewing this situation as a horrible thing, think about it as a learning opportunity.

, Nobody can please everyone. Instead of focusing on making other people happy, focus on making yourself happy. This will improve your life vastly. Don't waste your time around negative people that you're always trying to impress. Spend time with positive people who love you and accept you for who you are.

, Listen to a motivational speaker or program. Find quotes that inspire you and place them in places that you go to often to help keep you happy throughout the day.

You can also reassure yourself that it is not the end of the world, and that there will be more opportunities for you to win., If you find yourself in a losing situation, always remember to be a good sport. Don't trash talk the winner or the other team. Instead, congratulate them on a job well done. In your heart, you know that they worked as hard as you to earn that win.You can congratulate the winner by telling them, ""Congratulations"" and shaking their hand. You can even ask them to give you some pointers if they have time.
If it was a team effort, tell your opponents, ""Good game!"" with a smile.

, Even though you lost, you're still healthy right? Try to think about all the good things that came from your journey from start to finish. Even though you lost, you still probably learned some great skills along the way. Think about your potential and how far you have come; you are definitely not the same person as you were when you started this game.If you think about these things in the moment, it is much easier to accept and be humble about your defeat.

Check if your dental insurance covers your dental work.,
Ask your dentist if he is a preferred provider with your insurance company.,
Provide your dental insurance card to your dentist.,
Confirm the payment with your dental insurance company.",How to Pay a Dentist1," You can qualify for dental insurance in two ways: through your employer or through a government assistance program. You can also qualify for healthcare if you are a war pensioner or if you are retired and have a pension. You can enroll in private healthcare on your own, but this is often expensive and only done if you cannot get health care through an employer or through the government.In the U.S., most health insurance does not cover basic and preventive dental work. Only dental work that is determined to be ""medically necessary,"" such as certain dental surgeries and endodontic procedures. Separate dental insurance is necessary for basic and preventive dental coverage.In the UK, you can qualify for free dental treatment if you are under 18 years old, are 19 or younger and a full time student, or are pregnant or have had a baby within the last 12 months.In the United States, you may qualify for Medicaid, which covers basic dental care, if you are 21 years old or younger, if you are 21 or older and a full time student, or if you qualify under other Medicaid requirements.Medicaid is a health benefit program available to some low-income individuals and families based on eligibility. Medicaid is only available to those who qualify based on income and family size.
Call your insurance provider to check if they will cover your dental work. Most dental insurance covers basic dental work like cleanings, fillings, and check ups or dental work to a certain dollar amount. More extensive procedures like dental surgery or dental appliances may not be covered by your provider or only partly covered by your provider. Find out exactly how much you are expected to pay for your dental work, as you will need to budget for a partial or full payment.;
, Many dental plans provide a list of dentists recognized under your insurance, known as preferred providers. These dentists have a contract with the dental benefit plan you are enrolled in.When booking a dental appointment, you should try to go to a preferred dental provider, as your insurance company will then be required to cover all or some of costs of your visit. If you go to a dentist outside of the preferred providers, you may have to pay for your dental work out of pocket.

, If your dental insurance company can provide coverage for your dental work, you can give your dental insurance card to your dentist’s receptionist when it is time to pay for your appointment. The receptionist will then use your dental insurance number to charge your insurance company for the dental work.


Some insurance companies arranged through an employer may require you to pay for the dental work upfront and then submit a receipt to be reimbursed for the cost of the dental work. If so, you may need to pay for the dental work and then send in a receipt so your dental insurance company can reimburse you.

, Contact your dental plan if there are any discrepancies or issues with your dental bill.


It can be useful to check with your dental insurance company before you arrange any dental work to confirm your plan will cover your expenses. That way, you will not be surprised by a large dental bill after you have already had your dental work done.

Acknowledge and name the emotion.,
Recognize how the emotion is affecting you.,
Acknowledge the cause of the emotion.",How to Keep Negative Emotions Contained2," The first part of dealing with a negative emotion is to recognize it. Sweeping it under the rug or repeatedly brushing it off will prevent you from handling the emotion effectively. When you experience a negative emotion, take a piece of paper and write it down or say it aloud. Try saying or writing, “I am angry.”If you have a hard time identifying the emotion you are having, try looking at a list of different emotions to help you figure out what you are experiencing.

, Negative emotions often affect our behavior and thought processes in negative ways. Think deeply about your behavior and how the negative emotion is affecting it. For example, you might yell at your child because you are feeling anger toward your boss.


Sit down with a piece of paper and pencil. Make a list of all the ways the negative emotions you are experiencing affect your behavior, thought processes, and relationships with others.

, In order to effectively manage negative emotions, you must be mindful of what is causing you to feel a particular way. Identifying the root of the emotion is key to processing it and moving forward. Don’t blame someone else or yourself for the emotion. Just acknowledge the cause or causes of why you’re feeling a particular way.Keep in mind that it is okay to guess at one cause or multiple causes when you are having an emotion. Practice attributing your emotions and it will become easier to identify the causes over time.

"
"
Recognize the emotion is temporary.,
Set aside time to process the negative emotion.,
Accept your negative emotions.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Find an outlet for your negative emotions.,
Keep the bigger picture in perspective.",How to Keep Negative Emotions Contained3," Everyone experiences negative emotions on a regular basis. It’s part of being human. Understanding that your anger, sadness, or rage is temporary and will not last forever is a critical step in processing negative emotions in a healthy manner. If you feel overwhelmed with anger, try saying to yourself, “I am very angry at my husband right now, but I know this anger is not permanent.”

, Sometimes you have to give yourself time and space to effectively process negative emotions. This could be as simple as taking a walk during lunch after your boss upsets you, or soaking in a long, hot bath while crying about your best friend’s bad behavior. Whatever the activity, be sure you let yourself feel the range of emotions associated with a particular person, event, or situation.

, Understand that negative emotions are as much a part of the human experience as are positive emotions. Don’t try to bottle them up or ignore them. Accept your anger, sadness, rage, or grief as part of your journey as a human. Try telling yourself that this emotion is exactly what you need to be feeling at this particular moment in time., Having a person you can confide in will help you respond to negative emotions in a healthy manner. Instead of reacting immediately to the nasty email you received from a family member, try calling your best friend instead. Talk to them about what you are feeling and what is causing the negative emotion. Having a second opinion will broaden your perspective on the situation and help you respond in a more controlled manner., Having a healthy outlet can help you manage your emotions. Your outlet can be a journal in which you write about your emotional experiences or a kickboxing class where you let go of your anger through a high intensity workout. Whatever the medium find an activity that will help you process and manage your emotions in a healthy way.


Try going for a run or long walk the next time you feel angry about work,
The next time you feel sad, try turning on your favorite album and singing at the top of your lungs.

, It’s easy to get wrapped up in your emotions and let them dictate even the tiniest parts of your life. Understanding that how you’re feeling today and that the events or situations that facilitated these emotions are part of the bigger picture of your life will help you gain some perspective."

Focus on the process rather than the result.,
Let yourself be upset, but set limits.,
Don’t let defeat define you.,
Take responsibility.",How to Handle Defeat2," Instead of looking at the whole situation as a defeat, try to look at the process and all of the work you did. Even though the outcome was not what you wanted, you can still feel proud of the little victories along the way.

For example, if your team lost a big game, then think back on all of the things that you accomplished on your way to that big game or even during that big game. Did you play well together? Score difficult goals? Or give your best effort? These are all things to be proud of.

, When dealing with defeat for the first, second, or third time, it is OK to feel bad. This is normal. If you feel like crying, then cry. If you feel anger, let yourself be mad. However, it is important to set limits on your feelings. For example, it is OK to feel bad for a day or two, but don’t wallow in your sorrows for a week or two. It is important to acknowledge your mistakes, and to get back on your feet as soon as possible.If you need to, call a friend or family member to talk it out. Often times, talking it out will help you realize where you went wrong, and you will be able to find ways to improve your mistakes.

, You may experience a time in your life where it seems as though defeat is never ending. But don’t let little defeats define who you are. Remember that the real game is you against yourself. If you let yourself give up, this is the real defeat.Tell yourself that you will try again, and put forth your best effort. If you are not going to put forth your best effort, then it is not worth it.

, When handling defeat, always take responsibility for it. Do not act like the world owes you something. Do not blame your coworker, the economy, or the competition for your failure. The sooner you can accept your defeat as your responsibility, the sooner you will be able to learn from your mistakes and move on.For example, perhaps you had too much on your plate and were not able to put forth your best effort. Or, maybe you didn’t assess your competition accurately. Whatever the problem was, take responsibility for it.

Learn to see opportunity in your defeat.,
Look for guidance.,
Continue to work at and do the things you love.",How to Handle Defeat3," Although it is hard to see at first, there is opportunity in every defeat. By assessing what went wrong, you can learn valuable lessons that will prevent you from making the same mistakes.


Reflect on the situation and look for opportunities to improve in the future. Try asking yourself questions like, ""Where are my opportunities for improvement?"" or ""What knowledge have I gained as a result of this process?""
Perhaps the defeat will reveal that you were meant to do something else, or that you wanted it for the wrong reasons. Remember that tomorrow is always an opportunity to begin anew.

, When something doesn’t go as planned, look for guidance from an expert in your field. If you have a mentor, speak to your mentor about what went wrong, and about the ways you can fix the issue. You can also look into blogs, social media, or discussion boards for advice and support. Remember that you are a student who is always learning and improving.

, You can deal with your defeat by continuing to work at and do the things that give your life meaning. For example, if you blog, continue to blog. You can even blog about your experiences with defeat. This way you can help yourself, as well as other people who are experiencing the same thing.If you enjoy volunteering, volunteer for your favorite charity. The point is to not let defeat ruin other opportunities that might be available to you.

Reaffirm your goals.,
Develop back-up plans.,
Believe in yourself.,
Get outside help.",How to Handle Defeat4," Keep moving forward by setting goals. Identify the next steps you will take to achieve your goals. For example, if your goal is to get into graduate school, mark on your planner when you plan to have your personal statements written, your recommendation letters sent out, and the application completed. By setting goals, you can keep your mind off of defeat, and stay focused on the future.

, Don’t assume that you will win or be successful. Over-confidence can lead to defeat just as often as not being well prepared. You can buffer yourself from defeat by having back-up plans. For example, have your main plan, i.e., getting into graduate school. But if you don’t get accepted into a graduate program of your choice, keep a couple of job opportunities or internships in mind just in case., If you believe in yourself, and are passionate about what you do, there is no such thing as defeat. Always remember to keep a positive mind set.


Identify negative self-talk such as, “I’m not good enough” or “I can’t do it.” Reverse this negative self-talk by telling yourself, “I can do it, I have done it before, and I will do it again.”
Take time to reflect. Reflect on previous situations in your life where, against all odds, you pulled through and made something happen. They can be as small as making the basketball team or as big as landing a job. By remembering these instances, you will be able to pool your inner resources, and find the strength to do it again.

, If you cannot find the inner strength to refocus, don't hesitate to ask for help. Contact a mentor, a friend, a family member, or a therapist. Tell them that you are having a hard time focusing or refocusing on your goals. Review with them what happened, and what you want your new goals to be.


Make a list of the goals that you would like to accomplish in the next week or month. Try to start out small so that you can accomplish these goals and feel better about your situation. For example, one of your goals could be to look for and read books about how to bounce back after you have experienced a major defeat.

Talk to your dentist about a payment plan.,
Ask if you can get a cash discount.,
Discuss prioritizing only the most necessary dental work.,
Consider other dentist rates in your area.",How to Pay a Dentist2," If you have been a long standing patient at your dental office or if you have a payment history at the dentist that shows you can pay your bills on time, you may be able to arrange a payment plan with your dentist. In this arrangement, you would have to pay for a portion of the dental work up front as a down payment, usually one-third to one-half of the total bill. This will ensure you cover the dentist’s fixed costs, such as the dental lab bill and the overhead expenses for maintaining the office.You can then arrange to pay the remainder of the bill in monthly fixed payments. Your dentist may set a repayment time frame, usually several months, depending on the cost of the dental work.
You should also discuss if your dentist is going to be charging you interest each month on top of the payments. “No Interest” payment plans are typically offered if you have a short time period to pay off your balance, between six to eighteen months. You will be required to pay the minimum balance once a month and pay off the balance within the allotted time. Otherwise, interest will be added.
“Low Interest” payment plans are typically arranged when you have a longer term to pay off the bill, usually up to five years. You should try to pay off the monthly payments on time and as fast as possible to avoid paying interest.

, If you are able to pay for your dental work upfront with cash, you may qualify for a cash discount. Ask your dentist if he can offer you a tax-free amount if you can pay your bill in a lump sum on the spot.Often, paying in cash can allow your dentist to avoid processing costs or third party costs via dental financing. Your dentist may be more amenable to a cash discount if you present the cost savings for the office that are involved.

, Go over your treatment plan with your dentist and prioritize the most necessary dental work first. Look at treatments that are urgent or required and treatments that may be nice to haves or not as necessary. You and your dentist should schedule the required treatments first, such as a treatment to prevent further deterioration of your teeth or gums.Focusing on the most necessary dental work first will help to spread your dental costs over a longer period of time and ensure you are able to get essential treatments out of the way. You can then work to save for other dental work at a later date.

, If you feel your dentist’s rates are high, you may want to consider shopping around before you make your next dental appointment. You should also look at payment plans offered through other dental offices and compare them to the payment plan offered by your dentist.If you feel your dentist’s interest rates are high or his payment plan window is shorter than other dental office plans, you can negotiate with your dentist for a better plan. Your dentist may agree to meet you halfway if you show you have done research into other dental office plans and have found a more competitive rate.

"
"
Ask your dentist if he offers dental financing.,
Consider financing with a healthcare credit card.,
Make appointments with low cost dental providers in your area.,
Go to a dental school clinic.",How to Pay a Dentist3," Some dentists offer dental financing through a third party source like a medical loan company. These credit plans work like a personal loan that you take out with your dentist. They are unsecured and you do not need to put up any money as collateral against the loan. Because you do not need to make a down payment for this type of financing, it is considered a high risk option for your dentist. Your dentist may only offer this type of financing if you are a long standing patient or you have a history of good credit.Many dental credit plans are done through financing companies that will try to make the agreement as favorable for them as possible. This means the loan will likely have a high interest rate, possibly even higher than your credit card interest rate.
Some credit plans will have a no-interest option and may not charge interest for the first one to two years. However, you will need to strictly adhere to the repayment terms of the credit plan and there may be strict penalties if you fail to repay your loan on time after a certain interest free date. Make sure you are aware of the terms of the loan and are prepared to pay back the loan within the allotted timeframe to avoid steep penalties or high interest payments.

, Another option is to apply for a healthcare credit card to pay for your dental work. Just make sure that the dentist you are planning to go to will accept this payment option. You can apply for healthcare credit cards by searching for dental financiers online or by asking your dentist to refer you to a dental financier. These healthcare credit cards work in a similar way as regular credit cards and offer competitive interest rates.Many healthcare credit cards require minimum monthly down payments and may offer low interest or no interest options. Healthcare credit cards can be useful if you require emergency dental work or dental work that you would like to get done sooner rather than later. You can then proceed with the dental work and pay off the cost of the dental work over a set period of time.
Make sure you are aware of the penalties for not paying your minimum monthly payments and are prepared to make your payments on time every month. Treat the healthcare credit card like you would a regular credit card and focus on paying it off as soon as possible to avoid being charged interest.

, If you are looking to save money on your dental work in the future, you should consider going to a low cost dental provider in your area. Look up low cost dental providers in your state by contacting your local or state health department and asking about their financial assistance programs.You can dial 2-1-1 in the U.S. for information and referrals to human services in your area., Another way to get reduced rates on dental work is to make a dental appointment at a local dental school clinic. Many dental school clinics offer reduced dental care by dental students who are trying to gain practical experience and improve their patient treatment skills. As well, dental hygiene schools often offer low-cost preventive dental care as part of their training. This care is supervised by a more experienced dental hygienist or an instructor.You can find a list of dental schools at the American Dental Association website: http://www.ada.org/267.aspx.

Know where you're covered.,
Start saving.,
Decide if you need to go to the emergency room.,
Verify coverage.",How to Pay for the Emergency Room1," Choosing the right hospital can make all the difference. Do your research before you need to go to the emergency room so you will know exactly where to go when an emergency happens.


If you have insurance, make sure you know which hospitals are considered in-network and which are considered out-of-network. Your bill will likely be much lower if you choose an in-network facility.
If you do not have insurance, contact the hospitals in your area to see if any of them offer discounts to uninsured patients. You may even be able to find a facility that offers up-front cash prices, so there won't be any surprises.;
, Even if you have insurance, your copayment and deductible may be very high for an emergency room visit. If possible, set aside some money for emergencies little by little.


If you have access to a flexible spending account through work, this is a great way to pay for medical expenses. You can generally deposit up to $2500/year into your account, and you won't have to pay income taxes on this money.If you don't have access to a flexible spending account, consider opening a savings account at your bank to use as an emergency fund. Setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to you savings account might make it easier to get in the habit of putting money away.

, You should never avoid going to the emergency room for financial reasons during a true emergency. Depending on the situation, however, the emergency room might not be the best choice. Choosing a doctor's office or urgent care facility over an emergency room for appropriate conditions can save you thousands.If you do not need immediate treatment for your condition, consider scheduling an appointment with a doctor.
If you need immediate care, but your condition is not serious or life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility.
If there is any danger whatsoever that your condition may be serious, it is best to visit the emergency room.

, If you end up going to the emergency room, verify that the hospital is included in your insurance plan if possible. You may want to call your insurance company's service center if you are not sure if the hospital is in-network.


Provide your insurance information during the emergency room visit. If you have insurance, your policy will be billed. Whether you are insured or lack coverage, usually you won't be asked to pay anything upfront. Bills arrive later.
Confirm that the hospital will not charge you anything upfront. Most hospitals will not deny you help because of your inability to pay.

Avoid drugs for 72 hours before the test.,
Swab your mouth.,
Keep up saliva production.,
Brush your teeth twice daily.,
Suck sour candies.,
Chew gum or breath mints.,
Rinse with water.,
Consider rinsing with mouthwash.",How to Pass a Mouth Swab Test," The mouth swab test can only reliably detect drugs ingested in the last 48 hours.Spending at least 72 hours drug-free is recommended to be on the safe side, especially if you are a heavy user.


Also avoid cough suppressant medication that contains codeine.
Being in the same room as marijuana smoke is unlikely to affect your saliva for longer than 30–45 minutes.;
, Wipe down the sides of your mouth with a cotton swab. This may remove some old oral fluids from earlier drug use. There's no evidence backing up this tactic, but it's possible this has a minor effect.

, In theory, new saliva will have lower concentrations of drug-related chemicals than old. Unfortunately, most of the chemicals get there from your bloodstream, which can't be ""flushed out"" the same way. Still, there's no harm in trying this for a few days before the test. Stay hydrated by sipping water frequently, so you can produce more saliva. Chew gum to stimulate saliva production when your mouth feels dry.

, Brush for several minutes, and include your tongue and cheeks as well as your teeth. Rinse and spit at the end. This won't work any miracles, but it will ensure that old oral fluids aren't built up in your mouth.

, The more acidic your saliva, the more difficult it is to detect drugs. Multiple studies have shown lower drug test results right after people sucked citrus candies.Believe it or not, some drug testers will give you a citrus candy to stimulate your saliva flow before testing.You may need to suck several before going in to have a major effect.

, Chewing gum or breath mints will change your oral fluids, which can make the mouth swab test less effective.Most people choose the cinnamon or strong mint flavors, but it's unclear which is best.

, If this has any effect, it's small and short-lived.But it's also one of the easiest steps you can take.

, This might remove more drug-related molecules than water. However, alcohol-based mouthwashes can lead to a false positive for alcohol abuse.


There are mouthwash products advertised at people taking drug tests, but one study found no reason these would be more effective than normal mouthwash."

Understand the purpose of an autopsy.,
Check your state’s policy on autopsy results.,
Write a request for the autopsy report.,
View the autopsy in person.,
Pay for the report, if necessary.,
Receive the report by mail.",How to Obtain Autopsy Reports & Results," An autopsy is an examination of the body of a deceased person, carried out by a qualified pathologist. The pathologist creates a written record of the autopsy findings, including the microscopic and laboratory tests. Next of kin or other authorized individuals can then request copies of these reports. There are two types of autopsies:The hospital autopsy: This type is often referred to as a post-mortem exam or necropsy. During hospital autopsies, the pathologist use surgical techniques to perform an external and internal examination on the deceased. Hospital autopsies are performed to help answer specific questions about the cause of death and identify diseases or problems related to the patient’s death.
The forensic autopsy: This type determines the person’s cause of death, as well as the manner of death (for example, natural, accident, suicide, homicide). Forensic autopsies are also performed to determine the identity of the deceased, as well as the time of death and/or the fatal injury. The evidence collected from the body during a forensic autopsy may be used in a criminal case to prove or disprove a person’s guilt or innocence.;
, Autopsy policies vary from state to state, and country to country. However, in general, most final autopsy reports are available 30 to 45 days after the autopsy. Complex cases may take up to 90 days before the final autopsy results are complete and available.A comprehensive chart of the autopsy policy by state is available here. Some states limit autopsy reports to next of kin or individuals who have a legitimate interest in the report. Several states make autopsy reports public records, though in certain circumstances, the records can be withheld., Most states require a written request for the autopsy report. The details on the request, as well as the address for the request and the request form, can be found on the website of your state’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and/or coroner's office.In most written requests, you will need to include your full name, your address, your telephone number, your relationship to the deceased, their date of death, and the county in which the death occurred.
In some states, such as Iowa and Maryland, the cause and manner of death of the deceased becomes part of the public record. The remainder of the information contained within the autopsy report is confidential and considered a medical record. Next of kin can write a request for the detailed autopsy report, as well as other legitimate individuals such as treating physicians, law enforcement investigating the death, and county attorneys., In some states, for example Maryland, you can read and review the autopsy report in person by appointment at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, free of charge. However, you cannot copy the autopsy or take it with you without paying for a copy.


Check the website of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in your state for more information.
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will have most of the information that you need to request an autopsy report. Most large cities and counties have a coroner's and medical examiner's office

, Most autopsy reports are provided at no charge to the next of kin and other legitimate individuals. However, some states, like Maryland and Texas, require a fee for a completed, detailed autopsy report.


The fee may vary. For example, the fee for an autopsy in Texas is $0.10 per a page, and the fee for the autopsy in Maryland is $30 for family members.

, Processing of your written request will vary state by state. However, you will receive the autopsy report via regular mail. Remember to be patient as this might take some time to receive.

Ask your caregivers for access to your medical files.,
Copy all the documents in your medical files.,
Organize and put your hard copies in a binder.,
Create a table of contents.,
Keep your binder/notebook secure.,
Scan your medical records into your computer.,
Buy software specifically for personal medical records.,
Check for online health records.,
Store your health records online.",How to Organize Medical Records," The first step in organizing your personal medical record is to collect hard (physical) copies of as much information about your treatments and diagnoses as you can from all your caregivers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists, psychologists, etc. Keep in mind that federal law requires all doctors and medical facilities to allow you access to your medical records.Remember to be polite and patient when asking to access your medical files. Tell them it's to establish your own personal records. Some doctors and medical facilities might be hesitant to allow you access due to fear of malpractice litigation.
Your caregiver may need some time to organize your medical information because it may not all be in a single file. Schedule an appointment to come back if that's the case.
Keep in mind that a personal medical record combines all the medical information collected by each caregiver/medical facility that you've been to into a single file that's easily accessed.While federal law gives you the right to access most of your Patient Health Information (medical records, imaging, test results, billing records, etc.), some types of information are exempted. For example, you do not have a right to access psychotherapy notes (i.e., notes taken by a mental health professional during a counseling session) or documents compiled for use in a civil or criminal proceeding.;
, Once you've notified the caregiver of your intentions and they've organized your medical information, it's time to make copies of it all. Your personal medical record should include copies of all test/lab results, diagnoses, treatment reports, radiology reports, progress notes insurance statements and referrals from each caregiver/medical facility you've visited.Don't expect the actual caregiver to copy your file for you. Likely their support staff will be the ones to do the actual copying.


Although you own your medical information, you don't own the actual paper, files and x-rays that your info is on, so don't expect to walk out with the originals. You're only entitled to copies from the originals.
Your caregiver/medical facility has the legal right to charge you a copying fee, so ask how much it might cost. They may charge per page or a flat fee for the copying service.
You'll likely need to sign a release form at every facility that you request records from.

, Once you've copied your original medical files, separate them by making a pile for each medical provider. Then, order the records for each provider from your earliest visit to your most recent, in chronological order. This type of organization will make it quick and easy to find information. Punch holes in your medical records along the left margin with a 3-hole punch and place them in a sturdy three-ring binder or wire-bound notebook (maybe with dividers for each family member, or even a binder for each family member).


Use different colored index dividers to organize your medical records by medical provider and/or facility. In addition to color coding, organize multiple doctors alphabetically within the binder.
Consider reinforcing the punch holes of your copied documents, especially if you or your caregivers are looking through the binder frequently.
Keep in mind that any documents related to insurance claims/payments should be kept for up to five years, although if they're related to your tax returns, keep them for at least seven years.

, Use a word processing program on your computer to type up a table of contents for your personal medical records. The table of content page should outline the color-coded providers that you've seen and be listed chronologically and/or alphabetically — it'll be much easier for busy healthcare professionals to navigate.Print the table of contents out onto a thicker piece of paper so it'll be more resistant to tearing or wearing out.


Use large and legible font for the content page — nothing too fancy or artistic (remember it's not a scrapbook you're making).
If necessary, visit the website of the company that manufactured your index dividers for assistance in creating a printed table of contents.
Use the blank table of contents that may have been included with the index dividers that you purchased for your binder.

, Once you have all the hard copies of your medical records organized in a sturdy three-ring binder or wire-bound notebook, store it on a stable bookshelf or in a lockable filing cabinet at home, away from the grasp of children and pets. Having your medical records at home allows you to read and understand them at your leisure, which can help you feel more in control of your health and better choose your therapies.For additional security and safety, consider keeping your binder of hard copies in a fireproof home safe or box.
It may be more convenient to have your hard copies handy and near to where your desk and computer are, then focus on securing the digital copies instead (see below).

, Once you've got all the hard copies of your health record, you should also scan them into digital/electronic copies.Having a digital copy of your medical records will protect you in the event that your paper copies are damaged or lost — this is of particular concern for people who live in areas that have high risk of flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.


Most printers have the ability to scan documents, so no other equipment is typically required.
Once you scan the hard copies into your computer, create a ""Medical Records"" folder and then a few subfolders for each medical provider. Drop the scanned files into the applicable folders.
As an alternative, you can input the data from your hard copies into your computer by hand (by typing), but that's a lot more time consuming then scanning them.

, If you have word processing software you're familiar with, that's great, but realize that there's also software specifically designed to organize your personal medical records. You'll still have to scan the physical documents, but the special software will do virtually all of the organizing for you.


The cost of new software typically ranges from $25 to $75, and may include some sort of online technical support as well.
Search online for the software that best suits your budget and level of computer expertise. Some companies may offer free trials for limited periods of time.

Request an audit from the facility.,
Hire an outside company to perform an audit.,
Review all emergency room bills yourself.,
Appeal insurance decisions.,
Wait for all revised bills to arrive.",How to Pay for the Emergency Room2," Contact the emergency room medical care providers that sent the bill and tell their billing departments that you are requesting an account audit to look for billing errors. Facilities don't perform this service unless a patient asks for one.


Inform the representative that you will be investigating the bills and will not send payment until you confirm the accuracy of every charge.

, A medical billing professional may be able to locate errors in your bill, such as coding mistakes, duplicate charges, or overcharges..

, Document any unnecessary charges you find on paper or in a spreadsheet. Then contact the facilities that sent you the bill to discuss the charges.


Look for inflated prices such as overpriced bandages. Compare and document hospital charges for those items against their retail cost in a pharmacy.
Ensure that you received all of the treatments listed on the bill.

, If you have been denied coverage, exercise your right to Challenge an HMO's Denial of Coverage.

, No matter how you identified inaccurate charges, you should receive an updated bill. Review the charges and the amount you owe for accuracy.


Be sure to explain to the facility that you will not pay anything until the correct bills are sent. Doing so can indicate that you agree to the original charges.

"
"
Ask for a payment plan.,
Request a reduction.,
Get a patient advocate.,
Ask the hospital for a list of charities.",How to Pay for the Emergency Room3," If you cannot afford to pay the entire bill, you may be able to arrange to make monthly payments. Most facilities will not charge interest rates on balances due if payments are arranged and made on time.Do not send partial payments without arranging an installment plan with the medical facility. Doing so may put your account in default status.

, Some hospitals may be willing to negotiate your bill, especially if you do not have insurance.Document your financial situation. Discuss why you want a reduction in your bill and then ask for the facilities to negotiate lower rates.
You may be able to support your argument for a lower rate if you can find out how much insurance companies are billed for the same services you received. This amount is often less than the amount uninsured patients are billed., You may be able to find a nonprofit to help you, or you can consider hiring a firm that will charge you a percentage of your savings to help you reduce your bill., If you still cannot afford to make payments, some charities will help patients pay for the emergency room.


Locate your financial information such as completed tax forms. Charities will need to verify your inability to pay.

Maintain a healthy diet to reduce your symptoms.,
Substitute red meat for alternatives.,
Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.,
Eat a variety of antioxidant-rich foods.,
Eat foods rich in magnesium and low in calcium.,
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.,
Consume fish oil.",How to Naturally Ease the Symptoms of Lung Sarcoidosis1," You are what you eat, and your health depends on it.


The diet for a patient suffering from sarcoidosis should include healthy amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, lean meats, fish, and low-fat milk and milk products.
A few additional dietary changes should be made to keep inflammation to a minimum in all the organs of your body, as sarcoidosis may affect any organ, at any point in time.;
, Eat fewer red meats and more lean meats, cold-water fish, tofu (soy, if no allergy), or beans to get your protein.


Red meat from corn-fed animals tends to increase inflammation in the body and should be avoided.

, Drink water throughout your day to keep your body well-hydrated and flush out any toxins from your body.


Drinking around 6-8 glasses of water helps detoxify your system of heavy metals and other toxins that might aggravate sarcoidosis.

, Antioxidant-rich foods reduce inflammation throughout the body.


Antioxidant-rich foods include tomatoes, cherries, blueberries, bell peppers, and squash.
Eating these foods regularly may help alleviate some symptoms of sarcoidosis.

, Maintaining adequate levels of nutrients in your diet is the best way to stay healthy and prevent unnecessary inflammation.


Foods rich in magnesium and low in calcium such as bran, oats, corn, barley, brown rice, soy, potato and banana should be a main part of your diet.

, Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco must be avoided, as they promote inflammation in the body and may worsen sarcoidosis.

, Fish oil seems to help reduce inflammation throughout the body.


Cold-water fish, such as salmon or halibut, are good sources of fish oil."

Sync your movements with your assistant and then lift the patient.,
Position the patient comfortable back on the bed.,
Recognize the symptoms of paralysis.,
Notice if your patient has paraplegia or quadriplegia.,
Recognize how bed sores develop on a paralyzed patient.",How to Move a Paralyzed Patient," You want to constantly check and assess their skin for any redness or tenderness that may be warm or cool to the touch. If prolonged pressure is applied in areas that are irritated or inflamed, they may break and become open wounds.


Turning the patient at least every two hours will ensure any bed sores do not get worse or turn into open wounds.;
, A paralyzed patient can urinate and move their bowels in bed involuntarily or voluntarily and may accidentally soak their diapers and clothing. Urine causes the skin to become moist with prolonged contact, which will increase the risk of skin breakdown. Bacteria in the feces can enter the cracks and wounds, thus, increasing the risk of infection.So if their diaper or clothing are wet, change them before you move the patient.

, If done properly, moving a paralyzed patient will require minimal strength. But in cases where the patient is larger than you or heavier, always get assistance from a family member or a friend.


It is very risky to lift larger, heavier patients on your own as this can lead to falls and injuries to yourself and/or the patient.

, Place the bed sheet on the patient’s shoulders up to the middle portion of their thigh.

, This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms., Explaining the procedure before you turn them helps to establish trust and cooperation.

, Follow this procedure to properly turn the patient.


Put the arm closest to you at a 90 degree (right) angle, with the palm facing up. Then, lift the knee furthest away from you so the leg is bent and the foot lays flat on the bed.
Place the freehand of the person under their head, so their cheek is on the back of their hand and their palm is on the bed.
Pull the farthest knee towards you, while supporting the person’s head with your other hand until the patient is lying on their side.
Bend the knee closest to you at a 90 degree (right) angle., Now that the patient is lying on their side, insert the draw sheet or bed sheet at the person’s shoulder up to the middle portion of their thigh.

, You can do this by slowly pulling their upper shoulder and thigh down and away from you., So, if you first turned the person to their right side and inserted the draw sheet, turn the person to their left side to easily move the draw sheet.

, To turn them to the other side, pull the exposed sheet at their shoulder to the middle portion of their thigh. Then, return the patient to lay on their back by slowly pulling their upper shoulder and thigh down and away from you., Ask someone close by to assist you with this.

, Then, position the patient’s arms over their chest and bend their knee over their other leg. If their leg cannot bend, put one ankle over the other ankle to allow their hip to move more freely., They can be laying on their left or right side. Position their head comfortably on a pillow and ask the patient to slightly bend their knees to help maintain this position for at least two hours.


You can place a pillow behind the patient’s back so they do not roll backwards.You can also place a pillow between their knees to avoid any friction that may cause skin irritation.While the patient is in this position, check their hips and lower back for any red spots. If you see any bed sores, let the patient’s physician know so they can be treated.

, You can start by turning them to the right and then back to the supine position (lying on their back) after 2 hours. After another 2 hour interval on their back, turn them to the left and then back to the supine position again after 2 hours.


You can also complete this procedure starting from the left, then back to supine, and then right and back to supine with at least 2 hour intervals in each position.

, This will prevent the transmission of harmful microorganisms to the patient., Paralyzed patients tend to slip down towards the edge of the bed when they have resting in the same position for a long time. So it’s important to lift them up to ensure they are comfortable.

, This will prevent the moving or shifting of the bed and create stability so there are no accidental trips or falls.

, You will need the help of an assistant to hold the sheet on the opposite side of the patient.

, You and your assistant can count to three to ensure you are lifting the patient out of their original position on the bed at the same time.


If the patient cannot lift their head, place the draw sheet as high as possible so their head will be lifted as the sheet is raised.

, You can fix the sheets and place a pillow under their head.

, Paralysis refers to the loss of muscle function in any part of a person’s body, and will occur if there is a defect in the channel that carries messages between the muscles and the brain.This condition may affect only one side of the body (partial) or both sides (complete). It may also develop in a particular area or it may be general.

, Paralysis can be classified in two ways: paraplegia and quadriplegia. Paraplegia is a form of paralysis that affects the lower portion of the body, together with both legs, while quadriplegia affects both extremities, including the arms and legs., If a person develops partial or complete paralysis, the circulation of blood in the affected area tends to become limited as the area is under pressure. If this pressure is not managed right away, it may cut off blood supply into the affected area. This condition may then lead to the death of affected body tissues, which then sloughs off and develops into a decubitus ulcer or bedsore.


Bed sores usually develop on a patient's hips, sacrum, heels and buttocks.Decubitus ulcers that are not treated properly may harbour infectious microorganisms that can pose serious threats.

Familiarize yourself with how the heart works.,
Understand what an EKG is used for.,
Know what the EKG can identify.,
Ask the patient to lie down.,
Make sure the electrodes are positioned correctly.,
Request that the patient lies very still and holds their breath.,
Wait for the depolarization of the sinus node.,
Look for the P wave followed by the PR interval.,
Identify the QRS complex.,
Learn how the EKG results are recorded.,
Use the results of the EKG to determine the heart rate.",How to Measure PR Interval," To understand how the test is done it is important to understand how the heart works.


When the heart beats, electrical conductivity takes place from the top of the heart to the bottom. This enables the heart to contract and pump blood to the rest of the body.
The heart pumps blood with each heart beat and therefore electrical conductivity takes place with each heartbeat.;
, An EKG is usually done to show any abnormalities that may be present in the heart, for example arrhythmias and abnormal heart beats. This is important, so the EKG is the first test that is done on cardiac patients to help in the diagnosis of abnormalities of the heart.

, The EKG helps to show the speed at which the heart is beating and identify whether it is beating slower or faster than it should.


A regular heartbeat is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. When the heart beats less than 60 beats per minute, this is an abnormality called bradycardia and when the heart beats at a speed of more than 100 beats per minute, this is an abnormality called tachycardia.
The EKG also helps to assess the heart rhythm, as it shows whether the heartbeats are irregular or steady. It also shows the timing and strength of the heart's electrical conductivity as the impulses pass through the heart with every heartbeat.

, Once the patient is lying down, small patches called electrodes will be attached to the chest, arms and legs.


These areas are cleaned with a special EKG paste that helps in improving the transmission of the electrical impulses. The area may need to be shaved prior to the EKG so that the electrodes stick on the skin.
The patches are then connected to the EKG machine by wires and this helps to turn the electrical conductivity of the patient’s heart into wavy lines that are printed on a paper.

, The ten electrodes of the EKG machine should be clearly labeled, as this helps the caregiver to know where they should be placed on the patient’s body. The correct labels and corresponding positions on the body are as follows:


RA: Positioned on the right arm making sure to avoid the thick muscle
LA: Positioned on the same place as RA but on the left arm
RL: Placed on the lateral calf muscle of the right leg
LL: Positioned on the same place as RL but on the left leg
V1: Placed between the fourth and fifth ribs at the intercostals space, at the right side of the sternum (breastbone)
V2: Placed between the fourth and fifth ribs at the intercostals space, to the left of the sternum
V3: Placed between leads V4 and V2
V4: Positioned in the fifth intercostal space between the fifth and sixth ribs, in the middle of the clavicle.
V5: Placed horizontally at an even place with V4 in the anterior axillary line on the left
V6: Placed horizontally at an even place with V4 and V5 in the middle place of the axillary line.

, The patient is advised not to move while the procedure is being done, because any movement will alter the results of the test and prevent a clear diagnosis.


The health care provider may also ask the patient to hold their breath while the procedure is being done, and it is important for the patient to follow the instructions that are given.

, The normal cardiac cycle starts with depolarization of the sinus node. This occurs in a specialized tissue that is located in the right atrium (RA).


The electrical activity (depolarization) commences from the right atrium through the inter-atrial septum to the left atrium (LA). The atrium and ventricles are separated by the atrioventricular node (AV). The AV node delays the electrical activity for a short while and then it spreads down through the interventricular septum into the right (RV) and left ventricles (LV).
The electrical wave passes through the bundle of His and the left bundle branches to reach the RV and the LV. The two ventricles contract concurrently to push blood and this is important to maximize the efficiency of the heart.

, The first chamber of the heart to undergo an electrical activity is the right atrium and then it spreads to the left atrium. The first electrical activity initiates in the atrium and it is called the P wave.


The EKG usually shows one P wave but it is the sum of the electrical conductivity of the two atria on the left and the right.
There is a short delay as the AV node sends the electrical activity to the ventricles and this is the PR interva. The PR interval is the period when there is no electrical activity visible on the EKG.

, Depolarization of the lower chambers of the heart then follows. This is the largest part of the signals visible on the EKG and it is called the QRS complex.


The Q wave is the initial downward deflection. The R wave follows as the rising deflection and then S wave as the last downward deflection.
Electrical activity reflects on the EKG as the depolarization of the myocardium. This occurs as the T wave and ST segment. The T wave appears as an upright deflection of variable duration and amplitude while the ST segment is isoelectric.

, The recording of an EKG is done on a standard paper and this allows the electrical activity to be measured, usually in terms of milliseconds.


Normal PR intervals range from 120-200 ms, which is equivalent to 3 to 5 small squares on the EKG paper.
The standard EKG paper can give an approximate heart rate from the recording of the EKG. The time in seconds is represented by 250mm and this is measured along the horizontal axis.

, The number of large squares between each of the QRS complex helps to determine the heart rate.


When there are five squares, the heart rate is 60 beats per minute.
When there are three squares, the heart rate is 100 beats per minute.
When there are two squares, the heart rate is 150 beats per minute.

Use turmeric to relieve inflammation.,
Try cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa).,
Drink chamomile tea.,
Take goldenseal tablets.",How to Naturally Ease the Symptoms of Lung Sarcoidosis2," Turmeric, also known as Curcuma longa, is an herb that may be helpful in treating sarcoidosis.


Turmeric is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory herb that may be helpful in treating various inflammatory disorders.
Turmeric, a member of the ginger family, has been used for hundreds of years in both Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine as an anti-inflammatory to help treat numerous health problems.
Turmeric has a bitter, pungent taste and cooling and stimulating properties.The rhizome, or underground stem of the plant, is used medicinally.
A standardized extract, 300 mg three times a day, may help reduce inflammation.
Also, adding about 5 grams of the root to milk, boiling it, and consuming it twice daily may help relieve some symptoms.

, Cat's claw may be useful in treating sarcoidosis, because it has shown positive effects in treatment of other autoimmune disorders.


The exact mode of action of this popular herbal remedy is unclear.
A standardized extract, 20 mg three times a day, may help reduce inflammation., Chamomile, also known as Matricaria recutita, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic (painkiller), and antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties.


Chamomile may reduce the amount of arachidonic acid in your body, which in turn could reduce your levels of inflammation and sarcoidosis-related symptoms.
Prepare your tea with 3-5 fresh or dried flowers of chamomile plant, brewed for 15 minutes in hot water.
This tea should be consumed twice daily for 6 months.

, Goldenseal, also known as Hydrastis canadensis, possesses cooling and drying properties.


The root of the plant is used for medicinal purposes.
Goldenseal is an alternative, or an herb that helps cleanse, revitalize, and nourish the lymphatic fluids and cleanse the blood, which may be helpful in combating lymphatic system problems that lead to sarcoidosis symptoms.Goldenseal contains alkaloids like hydrastine and berberine that provide its anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic properties.
Goldenseal can be used in tincture or powder form.
The dried root of the goldenseal may be consumed orally, 3 times per day, in the form of 1 gram tablets or 1 gram of decoction.
It should avoided during pregnancy and lactation.

Meditate to reduce stress and inflammation.,
Do yoga to improve your respiratory system.,
Try Bhastrika Pranayama.,
Exercise with the tadasana.",How to Naturally Ease the Symptoms of Lung Sarcoidosis3," The symptoms of sarcoidosis can flare-up when you are stressed out, and meditation can be a useful way to combat increased stress.


Meditation and relaxing techniques can be used to overcome the challenges brought on by day-day life.
Perfecting the art of meditation takes some time, but all you need is time alone and a calm space free of distractions.
Close your eyes, focus on your breathing, and take time for yourself. This helps to free the mind of unwanted stress and worries.

, Yoga can be an effective pulmonary sarcoidosis remedy, because it helps clean out the lungs and respiratory system.


Pranayama is a form of yoga that may help treat a number of respiratory conditions, because it is focused on promoting respiratory health and clearing the lungs and respiratory passages.
Remain calm throughout your yoga exercises, as holistic approaches may take some time to improve your condition.A few Pranayama exercises are highlighted below.

, Find a comfortable seated position to begin the exercise.


Inhale rapidly and forcefully.
Then exhale rapidly making a sound like ‘hmph’, with the same kind of force as a large sneeze.
Do at least 4 vigorous breaths, making a bellows sound.
After the last one, release your breath slowly and begin some relaxing breaths.
Move back into the bellows breath and repeat the whole process.
These breathing exercises have a calming effect.
Alternatively, try anuloma viloma, another breathing exercise that involves inhaling through both nostrils together and exhaling alternately between the left and right nostrils.
The thumb of the right hand is used to manipulate the right nostril, while the pinky and ring finger are used to control the left nostril., Stand with the base of your big toes touching, heels slightly apart (so that your second toes are parallel). Lift and spread your toes and the balls of your feet, then lay them softly down on the floor.


Rock back and forth and side to side. Gradually reduce this swaying to a standstill, with your weight balanced evenly on the feet.
Tighten your thigh muscles and lift your knee caps, without hardening your lower belly. Lift your inner ankles to strengthen the inner arches, then imagine a line of energy running all the way up along your inner thighs to your groins, and from there through the core of your torso, neck, and head, and out through the crown of your head.
Turn your upper thighs slightly inward. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor and lift your pubis toward your navel.
Stretch your ribcage. Press your shoulder blades into your back, then widen them across and release them down your back.
Without pushing your lower front ribs forward, lift the top of your sternum straight toward the ceiling. Widen your collarbone and hang your arms beside your torso.
Balance the crown of your head directly over the center of your pelvis, with the underside of your chin parallel to the floor, throat soft, and tongue wide and flat on the floor of your mouth. Soften your eyes.
Tadasana is usually the starting position for all the standing poses. But it's useful to practice Tadasana as a pose in itself.
Stay in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing easily."

Consider why you struggle being happy.,
Give yourself permission to be happy.,
Recognize that happiness is an intention, not a destination.,
Lower your expectations.",How to Handle Feeling Unhappy After Reaching Your Goal1," Discontent can come from many places including low self-esteem, continued struggles with negative experiences, or an upbringing where discipline was overemphasized. Ask yourself, ""What in my life stops me from feeling happy?"" Write down your answers, and use them to help you understand what you need to work on moving forward.You may also want to consider speaking with a therapist if you are having trouble identifying the causes your discontent. They can help you with structured reflection so that you can more readily determine what is holding you back.;
, Although it seems counterintuitive, you may simply need to believe that you are deserving of happiness. When you set big goals for yourself there is a tendency to delay happiness until the goal is reached. To avoid complacency, you may have sacrificed feeling good about yourself in order to keep your head down and continue striving for your dreams.This tactic may have served you well during the process of goal-attainment, but it is no longer necessary.
Tell yourself, “I deserve happiness.” Look in the mirror, smile at yourself and repeat this phrase until you start to believe it.
You may also consider a celebratory gesture as a symbol that you have accomplished what you wanted. Getting yourself a gift, taking a small trip, or celebrating with friends and family may all help you feel a bit more comfortable being happy.

, You may feel underwhelmed by your accomplishment because you built yourself up to believing that there was a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In reality, most people know that life is a series of ups and downs. Even after you have worked hard for a time to accomplish a goal, your life will still hold challenges and disappointment down the road.


You can improve your level of happiness by understanding that it is a daily choice, not a destination you arrive at. You can deny yourself contentment, or you can choose to embrace it every single day—no matter what you have achieved.Try it out by rewarding yourself for doing a small portion of a task related to a bigger goal. Doing this helps you reinforce the idea that happiness is something you can choose to have every day. Designate a reward for spending a certain number of hours working on a task, or divide the task up into small steps and reward yourself as each step is completed.

, If your life standards are enormously high, you could be sabotaging your own happiness. When you set the bar unreasonably high you set yourself up for failure and unhappiness. Consider what sort of expectations you have been holding yourself and others to.


Take a moment to think about what you expected would happen when you achieve your goal. Write your expectations down and consider whether each one is reasonable. This can help you figure out if you had certain expectations that were not realized.
High expectations may be beneficial when you are trying to improve, but they can sabotage happiness when you’re searching for contentment. That’s why you need to carefully manage your expectations.
Expect little out of others or the universe, and you will find yourself pleased no matter what the outcome. On the contrary, expect much out of yourself when you are moving towards goals, but be flexible when you don’t always meet the target."

Manually check your heart rate (pulse).,
Check your pulse on your neck.,
Do NOT use your thumb to determine your heart rate.,
Understand a normal heart rate.,
Calculate your maximum heart rate.,
Find your target heart rate.",How to Monitor Your Heart Rate1," Place the tips of your first two fingers on your wrist, just below your thumb (palm up).


If you are feeling your pulse using your right hand, place your fingers below your thumb (palm up), on the side of your wrist near your thumb.
Press softly and you should begin to feel a pulsing sensation.
One pulse is equivalent to a heartbeat.
Take a clock and count the number of times your heart beats in 20 seconds.
Multiply that number by 3 – and that will be your heart rate.;
, Another way to manually check your heart rate is to place your first two fingers on the side of your lower heck, on either side of your trachea.


You should begin to feel a pulse. It is often easier to feel your pulse in your neck, rather than in your wrist.
Again, count the number of beats in 20 seconds, multiply that number by 3 – and that will be your heart rate.

, This is because you have a small artery that runs in your thumb.


That may cause you to double count your pulse.

, Having a normal heart rate indicates good cardiovascular health, but some variation is perfectly natural.


Normal: Pulse rate of 60-100 beats per minute while resting.
Bradycardia: A pulse rate below 60 beats per minute while resting. Causes of bradycardia include: certain medications that slow down the heart rate (e.g. beta-blockers, sedatives), heart failure. Athletes often have a heart rate below 60 at rest because their heart is in good shape, so each beat pumps more blood through their body (as opposed to having to beat more often and pump less blood with each beat).
Tachycardia: A pulse rate higher than 100 while resting. Causes of tachycardia include anxiety, illness (running a fever may elevate your heart rate), some medications that can elevate your heart rate (such as thyroid hormone supplements), caffeine intake, and being out of shape and overweight.

, Your maximum heart rate is the highest number of beats per minute that your heart can beat.


The following formula will allow you to calculate your heart rate: 220 – (your age in years) = Maximum Heart rate.

, Your target heart rate is the range in which you should keep your pulse while exercising, to gain the greatest health benefits.


For younger persons, it is generally 60-80% of your maximum heart rate.
For older, sedentary persons, your target heart rate may be 40-50% of their maximum heart rate.
Your doctor or an exercise trainer can help determine the ideal target heart rate for you.
To calculate your target heart rate: Maximum heart rate x .60 (for 60%) = Target Heart rate.

Complete the best possible future exercise.,
Set new goals.Some people enjoy the challenge of goal-attainment.,
Start celebrating yourself.,
Share your success with others.,
Don’t allow societal standards to influence your version of success.",How to Handle Feeling Unhappy After Reaching Your Goal2," If reaching one goal seems unsatisfactory, it may help to explore how this achievement fits into the bigger picture of your future. Research shows that completing the best possible future exercise can create motivation to work towards new goals and help you feel happier in the present.Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to think about how you envision your life in the future. Think about all the important aspects of your life: your profession, your relationships, your hobbies, your health, etc. In your best possible future, how would each of these areas look? Write it down in vivid detail.
This exercise can be inspiring for those with post-achievement underwhelm because it can help you to see that, although you aren’t exactly where you want to be, you may be on the right path. In fact, doing this exercise might help you to realize that you have nearly all the variables at hand right now for your best possible future.

, If this is you, you might be experiencing dissatisfaction because the spark you felt while moving towards your goal died after you completed it. Use the results of your best possible future exercise to figure out some new goals you would like to set for yourself. Then, get moving to feel purposeful, and possibly happier!


Set SMART goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. For instance, your best possible future involves buying a home and you just got a promotion on your job. At this point, you might set a new goal to save money for a down-payment. This new goal aligns with your future vision and can boost your contentment that you are moving in the right direction.
Remind yourself as you work toward your new goals that the present moment is enjoyable, as well. Every part of your life will come with different achievements that may or may not be a designated goal. Remember to celebrate all of those moments, not just achieving the goals you set.

, Since some of your disappointment may have come from others not giving you the recognition you expected, you can counteract this dilemma by recognizing yourself. Frequently, people hold happiness at bay because they think someone else needs to permit them to feel good about themselves. Only you can make you happy. So stop waiting on others to praise you and start praising yourself.Make a list of your achievements and read over it regularly.
Bask in your accomplishments by experiencing pride over what you have done so far.
Accept compliments graciously. Don’t minimize your achievements to appear modest.

, One terrific way to feel happier about minor successes is to spread your excitement with others. There are many ways you can do this, but doing so reinforces that you are deserving of happiness and allows those who support you to bask in your accomplishment with you.


Maybe you lost 20 pounds on the road to a 50-pound weight loss goal. When you reach this milestone consider throwing yourself a little party with healthy foods. This helps you and your loved ones appreciate your progress, and teaches everyone that you can have a good time while making healthy choices.
Another potential way to share your success is by helping someone else. Research shows that you are happier when you help others.So, why not make a generous donation to charity when you get that big promotion, or maybe plan and pay for a trip to take your friends or family to an exotic location to celebrate.
Remember to check your expectations for other's reactions. You know better than anyone how hard you've worked, and others may not react with the same level of enthusiasm or excitement. Remember that your feelings are what matter. Celebrate with those you care about, but don't use their excitement as a measure of your happiness.

, Redefining success means giving it your own definition based on what you value in life. Your happiness will never come from others, so you need to release yourself from trying to meet the standards of others, also.


If parents, peers, or even partners don’t believe in your dreams, it shouldn’t detract from your enthusiasm. Instead of defending your dreams to them, focus on the things you do have in common with these individuals, and kindly decline to discuss contentious subjects if they bring them up.
You can also find your own tribe of like-minded supporters. On the internet, in your local community, or at work, locate people who have similar visions and goals as you and spend time with them.

Assess your growth.,
Learn mindfulness.,
Approach life from a place of exploration.",How to Handle Feeling Unhappy After Reaching Your Goal3," Part of your unhappiness could arise from connecting success and happiness to an end result. In truth, happiness and success are fluid.They are found in the journey. The steps you take in between goals are what bring about powerful growth. You can become more aware of this when you take time out to regularly observe your progress.


Start a Month (or Week) in Review practice. Spend some time at the end of each month appreciating the challenges and milestones you overcame, and reflecting on the lessons you learned. You can also revisit your larger goals to ensure you are taking steps each day to reach them.
Reviewing your progress regularly can result in greater contentment for the overall process and invigorate you to keep pushing forward.

, If you are future-oriented, it can be difficult to find joy in the journey.However, if you are honest with yourself, you’ll realize that the present moment is all you ever have. Starting a mindfulness practice can help you learn to actually be in the here and now rather than always being caught up in future goals and successes.


An easy way to adopt mindfulness is to implement the practice into everyday monotonous activities. For instance, choose a daily activity such as washing dishes and bring greater focus to it. Think about the actions involved in doing this chore. Notice the smells, sights, sensations or sounds. Pay attention to your thoughts as you wash dishes. Move through this task being fully engaged. If you catch your mind wandering, refocus your attention on the chore.Mindfulness or meditation classes can also help you get started with your mindfulness practice. Such practices get easier over time, but taking a class in the beginning can help you develop mindful habits and stay motivated early on.

, Discontentment after reaching a goal may also come from desperately trying to control everything. When one thing doesn’t go like you think it should your satisfaction with the entire process dwindles. Releasing yourself from harsh judgment and the need to control can open you up to more possibilities and joy in life.Explore more in life by shifting how you go about your daily activities. Take a different route home from work. Be a tourist in your hometown, visiting museums and shops that you’ve never explored. Start a day off without a rigid plan and see how it unfolds.
Implementing small strategies like this can help you realize that things are no less enjoyable simply because they don’t happen exactly as we want them to. There is joy found in the familiar or the unexpected, too.

Get a blood pressure screening.,
Look into electrocardiography to identify any heart problems.,
Use a holter monitor or ambulatory ECG to monitor your heart rate over a 24 to 48 hour period.,
Consider a portable pulse monitor to aid precision athletic training.,
Do stress testing to evaluate your heart function during exercise.,
Try a cardiac monitor to monitor your heart rate in the ER.",How to Monitor Your Heart Rate2," Anytime you have your blood pressure checked, your pulse is checked as well.


You can have this done at your doctors office, or do it with a blood pressure cuff that you purchase at the pharmacy.
You may also stop by any fire station and have your blood pressure and pulse checked.
Many stores and pharmacies have blood pressure check machines; these machines check not only your blood pressure, but your heart rate as well.

, Electrocardiography is a graphic recording generated by reading the heart muscle using 12 leads while you are lying still.


It is a safe and simple procedure and takes 5 to 10 minutes to perform.
First, expose your chest, arms, and legs.
Color-coded electrodes will be attached to you and to the recording machine.
The electrodes are coated with conductive gel and applied to the skin surface on your wrists, ankles, and chest.
Make sure you are not wearing any metallic jewelry, and inform the person taking your ECG if you have a pacemaker or any other implants.
The ECG will be interpreted by your physician.

,


The holter monitor is worn on a belt or carried as a shoulder strap, and consists of a tape recorder connected to ECG leads on your chest.
During the test period, you will keep a diary of activities and associated symptoms.
Record all your activities, including brushing teeth, climbing stairs, bowel movements, eating, etc.
At the end of the recording period, return the monitor to the hospital or physician.
They will analyze the tape, comparing it with your diary.
This information can help detect cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia that occur sporadically during activity or rest.
Do not remove the electrodes, and try not to get the electrodes and wires wet.
Wear a loose fitting shirt during the test.

, Portable pulse monitors can aid athletic training, and look like a watch with buttons that switch on and off.


It records your pulse and blood pressure at timed intervals according to your settings.
It can also recall previous readings and times to match the current readings.
Some models are safe for use in extreme temperatures and underwater.
Some are rechargeable, while some use small batteries.

, During stress testing, the electrical activity of your heart is assessed with an ECG monitor while you walk on a treadmill, pedal a stationary bike, or climb up and down stairs.


A resting ECG is taken as a baseline before you begin the activity.
During the test, the speed of the treadmill, the force required to pedal the bicycle, or the pace of stair-climbing is gradually increased. The goal is to increase the heart's workload until a predetermined target rate is reached.
Your heart rate and rhythm are monitored continuously and ECG waveforms are recorded.
Your blood pressure and respiratory rate are also monitored.
You should report the onset of chest pain, dizziness, leg cramps or weakness, to avoid any injury.
The readings of the ECG tracings will be interpreted by your physician.

, A cardiac monitor continuously records the electrical activity that produces your heart rhythms. This type of monitoring is usually implemented in ERs for patients with cardiac problems.


Electrodes will be placed on your chest and connected to a machine that displays the cardiac rhythm.
A paper strip of the cardiac rhythm will be printed and attached to your medical record.
Some units include the option for the signals to be sent to a central station for continuous observation, to allow you to walk around the nursing unit.
Most cardiac monitors sound an alarm and automatically print out abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias or dysrhythmias).

It can loosen mucus in the nose, clear the head, relieve congestion and soothe tense muscles.Your bath or shower water should be between 36 and 40°C (or 95 to 105°F) to minimize the risk of burning your skin. Check the temperature with a thermometer or simply adjust the temperature on your water heater.Breathe in the steam from the water.
Add Epsom salts or an aromatherapy oil such as eucalyptus or peppermint to the water. Either product can have a sedative effect and also open up stuffed nasal passages and your head.Consider keeping a humidifier near you to help keep your head clear of congestion throughout the day.;
, Rinsing your throat with saltwater can relieve a sore and scratchy throat.This remedy can relieve inflammation and may make it easier to swallow and talk.Mix 1/2 a teaspoon of salt into an 8-oz glass of warm water to make saltwater.
Rinse with a mouthful of the solution for 30 seconds. You can do this as often as necessary.

, You may not have any choice but to go to work or school, or even just stay home. Reducing your workload by eliminating strenuous tasks can help you get much needed rest as well as relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort.Take it easy wherever you can. For example, try and reschedule meetings or don’t participate in gym class. If you work at home, leave strenuous work such as the laundry or cleaning until you feel better.
Decreasing and shifting your workload can be especially important if you are taking medications that make you foggy or drowsy.
Stay away from exercise until you feel better. This may give you enough energy to get through the day.

, If you are feeling too sick to get through your day, call in sick to work or school. This may help you feel better more quickly while minimizing the risk that you spread any illness to colleagues.


Be honest with your superiors about why you are not coming. For example, “I’m suffering from terrible congestion and a very bad headache. It makes it difficult to concentrate.”
This is a good option if you work at a job such as construction where you cannot do less strenuous activity until you feel better.If you work with children, the elderly, or people with weakened or compromised immune systems, or if you work with food, you absolutely should not go to work when sick.

, Ensuring that you are properly hydrated can replace fluids you lose as a result of being sick.This may help relieve your symptoms so that you feel well enough to push through the day.Drink at least nine cups of water for proper hydration if you are a woman and 13 cups if you are a man.Drink clear liquids such as water, juice, clear broth, or non-caffeinated soft drinks.Steer clear of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, black teas, and soft drinks. They could dehydrate you and exacerbate your symptoms., Several studies have shown eating chicken soup can relieve the symptoms of a cold or other illness.Having some chicken soup can help keep you hydrated as well as minimizing your symptoms.Chicken soup possesses anti-inflammatory properties. It can also help increase the movement of mucus through the nose, which can alleviate congestion and other symptoms., The BRAT diet, which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast is low in fiber and easy to digest. It can help ease an upset stomach and replace nutrients.You can also eat crackers, boiled potatoes, and gelatin to help soothe an upset stomach.Add more complex foods such as cereal, fruits, and vegetables once you are able to keep down BRAT foods and chicken soup.Be gentle on your stomach, especially if you’re nauseous, vomiting, or have diarrhea. Dairy, fatty or fried foods, or spicy dishes may exacerbate your symptoms., Alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products can exacerbate the symptoms of a cold. Avoiding these products while you are sick may make you feel better and reduce the duration of your symptoms., Ensuring that you’re getting sufficient rest is an important part of feeling well enough to get through your day. You can take naps or even just sit quietly to give your body rest.Take naps during the day and get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Both an make it much easier to get through the day if you’re sick.Sleep in a space that is comfortable, warm, and slightly humid.
Use a vaporizer or cool-mist humidifier keep the air moist and help alleviate congestion and coughing.Allow a fan to circulate air. You can also open a window if it is not cold outside., If your symptoms persist and resting doesn’t make you able to function through the day, schedule an appointment with the doctor. She can treat your symptoms and may give you medication that can help you function enough to make it through any day., Throat lozenges or sprays generally contain mild analgesics and other elements such as eucalyptus or camphor. These products can not only alleviate throat pain and inflammation, but may also relieve congestion.Use oral analgesics every two to three hours.Don't try to chew or swallow analgesic lozenges. This may numb your throat and cause further difficulty swallowing., Nasal and head congestion can make you feel particularly miserable, especially if you have to get through a class or meeting. Using nasal drops may reduce overall congestion and help you feel well enough to tackle the day.Use saline nasal drops to relieve congestion. You can purchase these at most pharmacies., If you have nasal, head, or bronchial congestion, take a decongestant or antihistamine. These may relieve your symptoms enough to help you get through the day. Look for ""non-drowsy"" decongestants if you need to be at work or school.There are a wide variety of decongestants and antihistamines on the market. You can also find options that also contain pain relievers.Take decongestants such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine and antihistamines such as loratadine or triprolidine.Read the labels to see what ingredients are in your chosen product. This can help ensure that you don’t overlap with other medications you are taking to help you get through the day.

, Most people have body aches when they’re sick. Taking an over-the-counter medication can help get rid of any aches, pains, and discomfort you’re experiencing.Pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium can get rid of any aches you have that keep you from getting through the day. Never take more than 4grams total in a 24hour period of all of these combined to avoid liver toxicity

, If you have any illness that is accompanied by diarrhea, consider taking an anti-diarrheal medication. These can help reduce the number of watery bowel movements you have.Take over the counter anti-diarrheals such as loperamide (Imodium A-D) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol).If your diarrhea doesn’t subside or gets worse, make sure to see your doctor to rule out a serious condition.

, Although there is no definitive scientific evidence that alternative medicine can relieve illness, many people still use natural remedies. See if taking vitamin C, echinacea, or zinc can help alleviate your symptoms enough to help you get through the day.Avoid intranasal zinc, which may permanently damage your sense of smell.Try raw garlic, which may help relieve sore throat symptoms.
Even if alternative medicines don't work, they may help based on the placebo effect — if you expect the treatment to help you feel better, you might actually experience real relief.Just make sure the treatment doesn't also have any negative side effects.

Understand that you must seek the help of a doctor if your palpitations are not normal.,
Control your palpitations caused by stress.,
Hold your breath.,
Make yourself cough.,
Use cold water to control your palpitations.,
Try to tense the muscles of your stomach or try the Valsalva maneuver.,
Stop palpitations caused by intense exercise.,
Cut out substances that can trigger palpitations.",How to Manage Palpitations1," One point must be emphasized before discussing management of individual causes of palpitations one by one. All the palpitations which are not normal must be evaluated by a doctor, and you must begin a management plan as prescribed by your doctor.


If you do not know whether or not your palpitations are normal, scroll down to Method 3.;
, For management of palpitations caused by stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks, your doctor may have prescribed you some medications. In addition to those medications, the following strategies have been tried with variable success. These strategies can help to stop palpitations from occurring.


The following steps can also be used to try to control palpitations caused by intense exercise.

, Holding your breath for a few seconds, or taking slow and deep breaths to calm yourself can help to control your palpitations. Breathing deeply can help you to feel relaxed. This can be a particularly effective method for people who experience fast, shallow breathing along with your palpitations.


Try to breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath in for two seconds, and then release the air slowly through your mouth for four seconds.

, Coughing can help to ‘reset’ your heart’s rhythm and can end spells of tachycardia.This is particularly effective for people who have panic attacks that cause palpitations.

, Taking a cold shower, jumping in a cold pool, or even washing your face with cold water can help to control your palpitations.


In particular, this can help if you feel like your heart is racing uncontrollably.The cold water can have a soothing effect on your body and slows your heartbeat.

, Tensing the muscles in your stomach, or the muscles all over your body, can help to focus your body and end your palpitations. The Valsalva maneuver may also help to do this:


The Valsalva maneuver involves forcefully exhaling against a closed airway. This is done by closing your mouth, pinching your nose, and then pressing out as if you are trying to blow up a balloon. This can also help with other forms of abnormal heart rhythm., If you are feeling palpitations during intense workouts, the most effective way to control them is to take break. Get a drink, take a slow-paced walk, and focus on your breathing. When you begin again, or trying working out the next day, you should warm up to help prevent palpitations.To do this:


Start with a mild exercise at the beginning of the workout, and then work your way into intense exercise. This will help your body transition into the intense exercise, so palpitations are less likely to occur.

, Palpitations caused by excessive consumption of coffee, tea, tobacco, alcohol and chocolateare usually short-lived and terminate automatically. To find fast relief, immediately stop consuming the substance that is triggering the palpitations. You should avoid excessive consumption of these substances in future.


However, if you have palpitations even when you only eat small quantities of these substances, you should talk to your doctor.

Introduce yourself appropriately.,
Choose an appropriate setting to conduct the history.,
Conduct the patient history.,
Determine an appropriate setting for the exam.,
Take the patient’s vital signs.,
Perform the exam.,
Evaluate your patient's overall functioning at home.,
Finish the appointment.,
Document appropriately.,
Follow-up with your patient.",How to Make House Calls As a Medical Professional," If this is your first visit with the patient, and if someone else (such as your nurse or your receptionist) has set up the appointment, it is key to take time for a proper introduction and to develop rapport with the patient.Introduce yourself, and explain a little bit about your medical practice (if the patient is new) and what this particular visit will be about.
Ask the patient how they prefer to be addressed. For example, “Do you prefer to be called Mrs. Jones, or may I call you Mary?”
Make some small talk with the patient to create rapport and make them comfortable. Consider asking about your patient's job, their kids, or their hobbies.;
, Let your patient know that you need to ask them a few questions about their health history before you begin the exam. Ask where they would be most comfortable doing this. During a house call, the history can normally take place in the main room (the living room), or occasionally in the kitchen. Choose a location that is quiet, free from distraction, and will allow you to easily take notes.

, Ask the patient about any relevant background health information, as well as any current health concerns that form the focus of the day's visit. Sometimes the history is based on a specific concern the patient has, and sometimes it is the result of a concern that you, as the physician, may have about your patient.The history can be done with the presence of other people, if this helps with data gathering. For instance, especially with elderly patients, having others there, such as the patient's children, can provide collateral information that the patient may not have remembered or been able to provide themselves.

, This will depend in part on the nature of the exam. Decide whether you can conduct the physical examination with the patient sitting (which is possible if it is an examination of the heart or lungs, for instance), or if you need to have the patient lying down (such as for an abdominal exam). Try to choose a comfortable, quiet location where you will have enough room to work and set up whatever equipment you need.If you need the patient to be lying down, they may be able to do so on a sofa. Alternatively, they may need to lie on their bed, especially if the patient is older and/or frail and you want to offer them maximum ease and comfort.

, Measure and record the heart rate, the respiratory rate, the patient's blood pressure and, if applicable, their oxygen saturation. You may also wish to get the patient’s weight and height at this point.Be sure to wash your hands prior to commencing the physical examination., Be sure to explain the steps of your exam to the patient prior to performing them. This way, the patient will be prepared and not surprised as to what is coming next. Be prepared to answer any questions the patient or their family members may have during the exam.Address your patient in a polite, respectful manner. Ask (rather than tell) your patient to do whatever is required of them during the exam. For example: “Would you please raise your right arm for me?” rather than “Raise your right arm.”

, The unique benefit of a home visit is that is offers you an ability to evaluate (and to see first-hand) your patient's ability to perform daily tasks around the house. You can ask about their ability to bathe themselves, to get dressed, and to cook, clean, and complete tasks around the house.A house call will also give you a chance to assess home safety.You can look for things such as railings where needed if your patient is unstable, and evaluate other safety issues such as whether your patient is capable of climbing stairs.

, When you have completed all you need to in terms of both history-taking and the physical exam, you are ready to finish the appointment with your patient. Allow the patient privacy to get dressed again (if the physical examination required removing any clothing), and then ask them to sit down with you to discuss your findings. Inform the patient of what you found during the exam, and what your thoughts are with regards to their health, any potential diagnoses, or treatments that may be needed.


At this time, you can also discuss any investigations (such as blood tests, urine tests, or imaging) that may be helpful for your patient. If your patient is on board, you can fill out the forms for these tests now.
Be sure to ask your patient if he or she has any questions for you at this time. You want your patient to have a sense of completion and understanding of their condition when you close the appointment. Allow time for questions so that your patient is not left with worries on their mind.

, Make sure you document your findings in your notebook or on your laptop (in your patient's electronic medical record) prior to leaving the appointment, or shortly after leaving. Recording all the relevant medical notes sooner rather than later will help to ensure that you don't miss any important details or results in your patient's medical records., A few days after your appointment, it is wise to check in with your patient (or to have your assistant or nurse check in with them) to ask how they are doing and if there are any additional concerns. This follow-up portion is optional, but it is an easy way to show your patient that you care about them and want to provide optimal healthcare.


Once you have established rapport with your patient and done a few house calls, you can give the patient the responsibility of calling your office if they have any follow-up concerns.

Treat noncardiac medical conditions that cause palpitations.,
Meet with your doctor if you are experiencing palpitations caused by cardiac conditions.,
Follow your doctor’s orders.",How to Manage Palpitations2," Some conditions that are not related to the heart (noncardiac) can cause heart palpitations. If you think you may have a condition that is causing your palpitations, it is important to talk to your doctor about what you can do to treat the condition. Noncardiac conditions that can lead to palpitations include:


Anemia.
Anxiety.
Beta-blocker withdrawal.
Pregnancy.
Hypoglycemia.
Mastocytosis.
Some medications.

, Cardiac conditions are conditions that involve your heart. Your doctor will create a prescribed plan for you to follow to treat or manage these conditions.


The next step will describe some of the recommendations or requirements your doctor may prescribe for you so that you can keep your palpitations to a minimum.

, As mentioned above, if you have a cardiac condition that can cause palpitations, you will have to create a management plan with your doctor. This management plan may involve things like:


Avoid substances and drugs that cause palpitations, like caffeine, alcohol or cocaine.
If you have tachycardia, your doctor may advise you to take rate controlling drugs like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
Your doctor may advise you to take anti-arrhythmic medications to control arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and to prevent their occurrence in future.
Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor may advise you to use ‘Pill in the pocket strategy’. This means that he or she may prescribe you drugs that are supposed to be kept in your pocket always, and taken once you feel palpitations.
Some arrhythmias are due to structural problems in the electrical pathways of heart (called accessory pathways). In such cases, your doctor may advise you to get these structural problems corrected by advanced medical techniques like catheter ablation.

Consider psychiatric causes of palpitations.,
Think about whether your palpitations may be caused by a non cardiac medical condition.,
Understand that palpitations during strenuous exercise are generally normal.,
Be aware that palpitations caused by substances are generally normal.,
Understand that most palpitations during pregnancy are normal.,
Understand that palpitations caused by medical conditions are not considered normal.,
Understand that some palpitations can be dangerous.",How to Manage Palpitations3," Psychiatric and non-cardiac medical diagnoses can both lead to palpitations. Read the following and consider whether or not they pertain to your life and situation. The following sub steps cover psychiatric conditions that may lead to palpitations:


Focus on the situation that triggers the onset of palpitations. If palpitations are triggered by facing a stressful situation (stress reaction), follow a traumatic event (post-traumatic stress), by exposure to an object or a situation to which you have abnormal and excessive fear (phobias),your palpitations are most likely caused by a psychological or a psychiatric cause.
If you have repeated attacks of severe anxiety that occur at any time, not specified to any particular situation, the probable diagnosis is that your palpitations are caused by panic attacks.

, As mentioned above, palpitations can be triggered by medical conditions that do not relate to your heart. Consider the following:


If you have fever which has triggered palpitations, your palpitations will settle once the cause of fever has been removed. However, if the cause of fever is not obvious, you should get yourself checked by your doctor so that he may exclude the possibility of infective endocarditis (an infection of heart) as the cause of fever.
If you have other symptoms of medical conditions like thyrotoxicosis (increased appetite but weight loss, sweating, tremors and enlarged thyroid gland) and Pheochromocytoma (facial blushing, episodic high blood pressure, abdominal pain and constipation), you must get yourself evaluated by your doctor for the presence of these conditions (both of which are noncardiac medical conditions).
If you have are experiencing fatigue, shortness of breath on minimal exertion and a pale complexion, you may be suffering from anaemia. You should get your level of hemoglobin measured to determine if this is the cause of your palpitations.

, If you are not used to doing exercise, short lived palpitations (less than five minutes in length) caused by strenuous exercise are completely normal.


However, you should talk to your doctor if you are experiencing these palpitations and also have prior medical history.

, Similarly, short lived palpitations caused by excessive intake of coffee or tea, excessive smoking, or the use of other forms of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs like cocaine or amphetamines, do not indicate a serious medical cause of palpitations.


Again, you should contact your doctor if you have consumed any of these substances and also have significant prior medical history.

, Many pregnant women experience palpitations while they are pregnant, which means that they are generally not something that you should be overly concerned about.


However, you should still report your palpitations to your attending gynecologist, because he or she will be able to create a plan to manage any conditions, like anemia, that may be causing these palpitations.

, If you do not have the above causes of palpitations, your palpitations are not normal. It is highly likely that your palpitations are caused by some medical problem that should be evaluated by your doctor.


It must also be kept in mind that if palpitations are brought on by mild exercise or little consumption of coffee, tea, tobacco or alcohol, you should also consult your doctor.

, The palpitations caused by cardiac pathologies can be potentially dangerous, or even life threatening. Therefore, it is important to work with your doctor to determine if you have a cardiac disease. You may have a cardiac condition if:


Your palpitations lead to feelings of dizziness or cause you to lose consciousness. You may also experience shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness. If you are experiencing these symptoms, go to the hospital immediately.

Understand the fines.,
Read the Security Rule.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
Research HIPAA Compliant Email Service Providers.,
Contact HIPAA Compliant Email Service Providers.,
Get patient consent.,
Use encryption.,
Retain records.,
Don’t use email, if necessary.",How to Make Email HIPAA Compliant," HIPAA includes both a Privacy Rule and a Security Rule. The Privacy Rule protects identifiable patient information, and the Security Rule sets national standards for the security of protected information in electronic form.These rules have teeth: a violation carries a maximum penalty of $1.5 million per violation.;
, The federal government requires that the electronic communication of health care information meet certain safety and privacy requirements. These requirements are complex. To make an email HIPAA compliant, you need to make sure that you employ sufficient safeguards to ensure the integrity, security, and confidentiality of the electronic information.You can read the Security Rule by visiting the Health and Human Services website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/. Links are provided to the relevant statutory text.
You can also read the regulatory text at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf. This document will contain all of the regulations which have been enacted to implement the HIPAA statute.
This information is highly technical and hard for a non-expert to understand. You should meet with a health care attorney to discuss your requirements with respect to email security.

, An experienced health care attorney should be able to help you understand the legal requirements and also find ways for you to make your email system compliant. You will want to meet with a lawyer who specializes in health care law especially.


To find a health care attorney, visit your state’s bar association. It should have links to referral programs (or host a referral program itself). Once at the website, you will be provided with a phone number to call or a directory that you can search., The technical requirements are so complicated that, unless you are an expert in information systems, you will need to hire a HIPAA Compliant Email Service Provider to provide your email system. Free, web-based email services like Yahoo and Gmail are not sufficient email systems.In fact, they provide no security. To find a compliant service provider, you can do the following:


Talk with your health care attorney. He or she should be familiar with HIPAA Compliant Email Service Providers.
Search the Internet. Several companies advertise their services on the Internet. Search “hipaa compliant email.”, Once you have the names of email service providers, you should look at the companies’ websites and see if they look professional. Then call a company and ask if it can give you referrals. You should also ask about the services that they provide. A HIPAA Compliant Email Service Provider should:


Limit access to the electronic information. The email service provider should keep its servers in a secure location, accessible only by authorized personnel.
Audit who accesses the information. The service provider should be able to track who accesses the information in the system. An adequate security log should track the user who accessed the information, the day and time it was accessed, and who the information was sent to.
Secure email transmissions. A service provider should also adequately secure all email transmissions using encryption and other techniques.

, Regardless of the service provider you use, you must always get a patient’s consent for transmitting health care information electronically. Sometimes a patient will send you information by email, but you shouldn’t assume that this means the patient consents to receiving information electronically.Instead, you should have patients sign a Contact Sheet. In this form, the patient will tell you how they prefer to be contacted. You should have current patients sign one and make sure that all new patients sign one on their first visit.

, According to Health and Human Services, encryption is not mandatory unless, after a risk assessment, it is found to be an appropriate safeguard.In practice, however, this means that you will almost always need to encrypt emails and attachments.


Encryption is a technique which converts the original text into encoded text.It is a way to secure information in case it is intercepted by a third party.
Your HIPAA Compliant Email Service Provider should explain to you its techniques for encrypting communications.

, HIPAA requires that you preserve emails for up to six years. This is called the “Six-Year Retention Rule.” Your email service provider should be able to warrant that it will hold onto the emails for this length of time.

, You might find that the compliance costs for sending patient health information legally is beyond your budget. If so, you always have the option of not sending this information electronically.


Instead, you could require patients to come into the office to pick up health care information.

Open your account.,
Check the annual contribution limit each year.,
Alter your contribution amounts as you age.,
Set up payroll deductions.,
Keep track of any after-tax contributions.",How to Make the Most of Your Health Savings Account1," If you haven't already, find an HSA administrator so you can get your account started. Many employers have a relationship with a specific bank or brokerage firm, but it isn't necessary for you to use that one.Check with your employer's human resources department to find out if they have a relationship with a particular HSA administrator, and the benefits of using that administrator over using another.
In some cases, you can only get employer contributions if you use their preferred administrator.
You also may want to shop around for a plan with low fees and other benefits that suit your needs. Try searching on the website HSASearch.com.;
, The IRS sets a limit each year for the maximum amount that you can contribute to your HSA tax free. Ideally, if you want to make the most of your health savings account, you'll contribute up to that limit.For example, for 2017 the maximum annual contribution limit is $3,400 for an individual account and $6,750 for a family account. If you are over 55, you can contribute an additional $1,000 tax free.
Even if your account is not open for the full year, you still can contribute up to the maximum limit.
The contribution limit applies both to contributions you make as well as any contributions made by your employer, so make sure you know if your employer makes contributions and how much those are when you set up your contribution amounts.

, If you can't or don't want to make the maximum allowed contribution, you still should try to contribute more while you are younger and have fewer responsibilities.Contributing more to your HSA while you are younger and don't have to tap into those funds as much means that money will be in your account longer and will be growing tax-free.
If you are older, have chronic medical conditions, or children who need extensive medical treatment, you may need to tap into the account more often or decrease your payments.

, Most employers allow you to have HSA contributions deducted from your paycheck before taxes are taken out of your income, so you can receive the maximum tax benefits for your contributions.For some employers, you must set up payroll deductions to be eligible to receive any employer matching funds.
In addition to payroll deductions, you also can make direct contributions yourself. These after-tax contributions are tax deductible provided they don't put you over the maximum annual contribution limit set by the IRS.

, If you make any direct contributions to your HSA, you'll need to retain a copy of the transaction for your tax records so you can prove to the IRS that the money is deductible from your income.Contact your HSA administrator or read the welcome packet you received when you opened your account to find out how to make direct contributions.
If you make an electronic transfer from a checking or savings account to your HSA, print a copy of the account statement or transaction receipt for your tax records.

That way, the glucose in the blood can be taken to the cells where it is used for the production of energy.
Type 1 diabetic patients are advised to use insulin injections everyday to ensure that their blood sugar is controlled.;
, You must learn to inject yourself unless you are too young to understand. Learning how to administer insulin to yourself effectively will ensure that you do not suffer from spiked blood sugar every time you are away from someone who can administer your insulin.

Your child will be taught how to inject him/herself as they grow up and are able to understand.
Most children are able to self-administer the injections when they reach the age of 14.

, Insulin is usually injected into the skin using a pump, insulin pen, or syringe. You can choose what method you would prefer to administer your own insulin.


Insulin is usually given via injection because it cannot be taken through the mouth.
This is because the acid that is in the stomach will destroy the insulin.

, There are different types of insulin and they all act differently. As you age, your doctor will advise you on the best type for you.


Some of them are long acting, meaning that they are released slowly in the body, and this type includes NPH.
Some are short acting, meaning that they take effect immediately, which may cause the blood sugar drop rapidly. Short acting insulins include Humalog and Novolog.

Find out what expenses are qualified.,
Check your balance regularly.,
Save receipts for purchases.",How to Make the Most of Your Health Savings Account2," Most HSA administrators give you the option of setting up an online account.

, You may be called upon by the IRS to demonstrate that you only spent money from your HSA for qualified medical expenses. Whenever you use your HSA to pay for something, make sure you have proof of how that money was used.For this reason, even if you have a debit card attached to your HSA, it's generally a good idea to avoid taking out cash at an ATM, because that money may be more difficult to account for.

, If you're shopping around for an HSA with investment options, find the one that best meets your financial needs and has the lowest possible fees.Look for accounts that offer mutual funds or other long-term investment options, rather than active brokerage accounts, which typically have higher fees.

Listen carefully to your healthcare provider.,
Have the person who came with you take notes on the visit.,
Get a time frame for your decision.,
Review your notes.,
Take a bit of time to research your diagnosis on the internet.,
Try to avoid chat rooms or unreliable sources of information on the internet.,
Check out some of the sites which deal specifically with your particular problems.,
Ask a pharmacist about any medication options or considerations.,
Seek counsel from your family.",How to Make a Good Decision in Health Care," Remember this, you are your own best analyst when it comes to your health and only you really know your values and the risks you are willing to take.;
, Ask questions when you are done listening to get all the information you can. Take your best friend, a nurse friend, your mom, sister, dad or brother with you to the office visit.

, Also have them document the answers that your healthcare provider gives you when you ask questions so you can review the notes together later.

, Once you have finished your visit, if there is a treatment decision, then ask your healthcare provider for evaluation time. Hopefully, you have some time to make decisions about treatment and will have an opportunity to review your notes before you engage in appointment making and plans for treatment. Do not let office staff or scheduling issues pressure you to make a commitment before you have had time to evaluate your decision fully.

, Once you are back home, go over your notes with whomever accompanied you to the visit. See if there are any gaps in information, or further questions you have formed as a result of the review.

, Use well respected sites. Some good resources are Web MD, Mayo Clinic, and the National Institute for Health web sites. There are many other excellent sites but these are three trusted and general health related resources.

, You want top of the line research based material to make the best possible decision. You do not want to be reading about worse case scenarios or fear inducing drama when you are facing tough choices.

Decide on the scope of your complaint.,
Determine where you should file your complaint.,
Consider what you want the outcome to be.,
Keep your expectations realistic.,
Contact a patient advocate if you are overwhelmed.,
Hire an attorney.,
Review your insurance.",How to Make a Medical Complaint1," There are many ways in which care may be insufficient and, depending upon what happened, you may want to complain about a specific doctor or an entire hospital. Things to consider include:Was it a single incident involving one individual that led to you receiving inadequate care?
Was it a larger systemic problem such as unsafe conditions in a hospital?
What needs to occur to correct the problem so that it doesn’t happen to other people?;
, Many hospitals, medical review boards, states, and government agencies, including Medicare, have formal procedures for filing complaints. You need to complaint to the appropriate authority so that they can conduct an investigation. If you complain to the wrong organization, they won’t be able to address it.


First try filing a complaint through the hospital itself. Many will have a specific department that handles grievances and will follow up on your complaint.
Search online to see if there is a national or state medical review board that has authority over your health care provider. Many have formal complaint processes which can be conducted online.If you have a government run healthcare plan such as Medicare in the US or a National Health Services plan in the UK, you may be able to complain to them. The websites will guide you through the process for making a complaint.If you do not have a computer, search the phonebook for the numbers of your state’s Department of Public Health. Many have departments that deal with licensing and regulations. If they do not accept complaints, they will be able to direct you where to go next., Generally the medical board or organization will conduct an investigation and notify you of the outcome. If you have thoughts about what you feel would be appropriate, make your opinions known in your complaint. The review board will do what they feel is necessary to protect the public’s health and safety, but, depending upon the severity of the incident, they may take your thoughts into consideration. Several outcomes are possible, including the following serious consequences:Formally reprimanding the healthcare provider
Suspending a license
Placing conditions on a license
Revoking a license

, This means understanding what the authority will not do. Read the instructions on the websites of the medical review organization carefully to make sure that the outcome you want is possible to achieve through a complaint to them.If you are complaining about rudeness or an unprofessional manner, that may not be within the scope of a state or national review board. Such complaints might be more effectively addressed to the hospital or health care provider directly.
If you are seeking monetary compensation for damages, you will likely need to file a lawsuit in addition to a medical complaint. This would need to go before a court. Make sure you research your lawyer and choose reputable representation.

, Healthcare services can be extremely bureaucratic and difficult to navigate. A patient advocate may be able to guide you or even file the complaint on your behalf.


Many hospitals have patient advocates on staff. If you talk to a patient advocate who is employed by the hospital about which you would like to complain, ask them whether their assistance will be confidential.Search in the phonebook or online for patient advocate organizations, such as The Empowered Patient Coalition in the US or Healthwatch in England. These organizations should be able to help you find resources that are near you or relevant to your situation., If your issue concerns medical bills or you believe you were taken advantage of, you may want to speak with an attorney. The attorney can give you legal advice on what is permissible by law and help you seek damages if necessary. Common reasons for needing an attorney include:Denial of benefits and requests for assistance with the appeals process
Fraudulent billing or unreasonably high charges
Unnecessary medical procedures

, Specific insurance plans can be hard to understand. Before filing a complaint in regards to billing, ensure that your insurance was filed correctly with correct diagnosis code. Ensure that coverage is reviewed to make certain that deductibles have been met and the service was a covered benefit.

Speak clearly.,
Ask them questions.,
Offer them lots of information.,
Communicate with the doctor during your physical examination.,
Think about whether they enjoy their work.,
See if your doctor takes notes.,
Watch to see if the doctor is distracted.,
Ask friends.,
Read reviews.,
Find out if the doctor will take your phone calls.,
Look for other signs that a doctor may not listen to you.",How to Make Sure Your Doctor Is Listening," By speaking clearly, you’ll make sure the doctor hears and understands what you say. Ultimately, without speaking clearly, your doctor won’t be able to understand what you’re saying.


Speak slowly. Don’t rush your words.
Talk at an audible tone. In other words, don’t mumble or speak quietly.
Avoid slang. For instance, avoid terms such as “tootsies” (feet), “noggin” (head), and “peepers” (eyes). These terms will slow communication between you and your doctor. Avoiding slang is very important since slang terms may mean different things to different people.
Enunciate your words. Say your words clearly and enunciate the syllables.
Be cognizant of any language barrier or an accent barrier between you and your doctor. If one exists, you will both have to work harder to communicate. If the problem is serious, you may need to find a doctor with whom you can better communicate.;
, By asking questions, you’ll compel your doctors to listen to you and to spend time answering your questions. In addition, you’ll show that you’re an active patient who wants to establish a true dialogue about your healthcare.


Ask them to explain medications and the uses of medications they prescribe to you. For example, if they prescribe an antibiotic, ask a verifying question such as “Doctor, will this antibiotic target the bacteria that is causing my infection?”
Ask them if they understood what you said. Simple verifying questions like, “Should I explain more?” or “Do you know what I mean?” might suffice.
Inquire about a diagnosis after they’ve recommended further tests. This is a great way to compel them to listen to your concerns and to spend more time communicating with you.
Feel free to ask them to run diagnostic tests, if you think they are jumping to a conclusion about your illness. Simply by asking them to run a specific test, you’ll compel them to engage you and think about their diagnosis a little bit more., By offering lots of information, you’ll increase the chance that they hear and process your thoughts and concerns. Without letting them know the details of your condition, they might jump to a conclusion that is inaccurate.


Avoid answering questions in “yes” or “no” terms. Your doctor may ask open-ended questions to get more details from you. These are questions that require more than a “yes” or “no” answer. If your doctor asks close-ended questions that do warrant a “yes” or “no” answer, then offer details along with your answer if possible.
Explain your answer in several sentences. Include relevant details that might give them better information about your condition. For instance, if your doctor asks you if you experience pain when you bend over, explain the pain. Say: ""Yes. It hurts in my lower back and the pain radiates outward into my sides. It almost feels as if someone is stabbing me all over my lower back and sides.""
Repeat yourself, if you don’t think they’re listening. Don’t use the exact same words when you repeat yourself. For instance, if you already told the doctor that you have a migraine and can't see correctly, tell them again: ""I feel severe pain in my head, and my vision is sort of blurred."", By talking to the doctor as they examine you, you’ll make sure they’re paying attention and you’ll better understand what they’re looking for. In the end, you’ll be better able to talk about your condition.


Comment about any problems you experience while they are examining you. For example, as they begin their examination, say “I’ve got a pain in my lower back and in my side.”
Ask what certain problems they find may mean for your diagnosis. For instance, if you feel pain along your shoulder blade, ask them what that might indicate., Assessing whether a doctor enjoys their work is one of the most effective ways to determine if they listen to you. Ultimately, if a doctor does not enjoy their work, they’ll probably treat their patients as if they don’t care about them.


See if the doctor will chat with you. You might chat about the weather, events in your community, or about your family.
Notice if your doctor smiles and seems excited to chat with you.
Observe whether they seem happy. If your doctor is exhausted and makes cynical or insulting comments, chances are they don’t like their work. Thus, they may not actually listen to you.
Ask them how they’re doing. Your doctor will probably answer with a pleasantry or they might even be frank. By asking, you’ll create the chance for them to express how they feel – potentially giving you insight into whether they enjoy their work., Note taking is a great indication of whether the doctor is engaged, pays attention to what you’re saying, and if they’re actively assessing your condition. Without notes, the doctor will likely forget details and may not give you the treatment you need.


Your doctor should have a clipboard, your patient files, or a tablet to take notes on.
While your doctor may not take copious notes, they should make some notations while they see you.
Notes will help your doctor (or other medical professionals) to evaluate your condition or health history on subsequent visits., There are a wide variety of distractions that doctors face every day at the office. If your doctor is distracted, chances are they aren’t listening to you. Thus, they may incorrectly diagnose you and give you improper treatment.


Notice if your doctor is constantly looking at a cell phone or tablet.
Observe if nurses or other office staff interrupt your time with the doctor. If so, ask for privacy
Ask the doctor to limit distractions. For instance, if your examination room door is open and noise is coming into the room, say “Can we please close the door? I can’t hear you.”, Your friends are perhaps your greatest source of referrals for professionals, including doctors. By relying on your friends, you’ll tap their personal experience and save yourself a lot of time sifting through third party reviews.


Approach a friend and ask them if they like their doctor. For instance, say “John, do you like your general practitioner? I’m looking for a new one.”
Ask your friend whether their doctor is responsive. For example, say “Is your doctor responsive? Do they genuinely listen to your concerns?”
Explain that in the past you’ve dealt with doctors that don’t listen to you and don’t take your thoughts and concerns seriously.
Consider using social media to ask your friends for references to good doctors., Reviews are another great source of locating doctors who are responsive and listen to their patients. By reading reviews, you’ll be able to gather information about many doctors and from a variety of sources.


Visit websites that focus on medical professional reviews like Healthgrades, Zocdoc, and Webmd.
Also, try more general websites like Yelp and Consumerreports.org.
By reading reviews, you’ll have access to critical information about a variety of medical professionals., Doctors who are unwilling or unable to speak individually with their patients over the phone, may be doctors who are not responsive to the needs of their patients.


Doctors who don’t personally respond to their patient’s phone calls or messages may not be responsible and may not listen.
Evaluate the doctor’s office staff and message service. If the office staff are unresponsive, chances are the doctor may not listen to you.
If a doctor ever gives you their personal number, they are probably very responsive and will listen to you.
Remember that time is money. Time on the phone also comes at a price, a price that doctors are usually unable to bill to insurance companies. Don’t let this be the only way you assess your doctor’s responsiveness., There are a wide variety of signs you can look for when assessing whether your potential doctor is responsive and listens to you. Some warning signs include:


There are a lot of people in the waiting room.
You experience long wait times.
Your time with the doctor is very short. Doctors who breeze in and out of patient rooms may not be listening to their patients.
Your doctor relies on physician assistants or nurse practitioners to do the bulk of their work.
The doctor does not ask you questions or cuts you off when you are speaking."

Get vaccinated before traveling internationally.",How to Prevent Mumps1," Mumps is most common in children. Prevent your children from getting mumps by getting them vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccination against mumps is much safer than getting a mumps infection. The mumps vaccine is usually administered in two dosages. The first dosage should be administered to your child at 12 to 15 months of age. The second dosage is usually given between four to six years of age. It is possible to give the second dose as soon as 28 days after the first dose.There are two types of mumps vaccinations: MMR and MMRV. The MMRV vaccine includes the vaccination for varicella or chickenpox. Consult your doctor about which vaccine your child should get.Call your doctor if your child develops a reaction to the vaccine. Reactions include fever, rash, and fever-related seizure. In rare cases deafness, long-term seizures, coma and brain damage have been reported.;
, If you are a teenager or an adult who has not been vaccinated, have not had the disease, or do not know if you have been vaccinated, the best way to prevent mumps is to get vaccinated. Adults born during or after 1957 and who have no evidence of immunity should get vaccinated. Also, students who attend post-high school educational institutions (college, trade schools, and training programs) who do not have evidence of immunity should get vaccinated. Healthcare personnel who cannot prove they are immune should get vaccinated. Those recently exposed to mumps, or those living in a community with a recent mumps outbreak should consider vaccination as soon as possible. Additionally, adults who received inactivated measles during 1963 to 1967, or adults vaccinated before 1979 with either a mumps vaccine of an unknown type or a killed mumps vaccine should consider vaccination.Evidence of immunity in adults includes: documentation of the administration of two doses of MMR, on or after their first birthday; birth before 1957; laboratory evidence of immunity; or documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps.If you are pregnant, you should wait to get the MMR until after you have given birth. Women should also avoid getting pregnant for at least four weeks after getting the MMR vaccine.
Adults who should not get the vaccine include those who are moderately or severely ill, or adults who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, a previous dose of MMR, or the antibiotic neomycin.
Adults who should check with their healthcare provider before they get the vaccine include those who: have HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system; are being treated with drugs that affect the immune system for two weeks or longer, like steroids; have a low platelet count or a blood disorder; or adults who have any kind of cancer or are taking cancer treatments., To get the mumps vaccination, you can visit your general practitioner or your primary doctor. Your doctor will administer two doses of the mumps vaccine at least 28 days apart.Private health insurance is required to cover the MMR vaccine without charging a coinsurance or copayment.Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage Plan Part C may also offer coverage for the MMR vaccine.
Most state Medicaid agencies will cover at least some of the adult vaccinations, but may not cover all. For more information, check with your state Medicaid agency.

, If you do not have a primary care doctor, you can visit a local pharmacy for the administration of the MMR vaccine. Government-funded health centers, community health clinics, state health departments, workplaces, and other community locations like religious centers and schools offer the MMR vaccine., The mumps vaccine is not widely used throughout the world. For example, Japan does not routinely vaccinate against the mumps. As a result, it is a fairly common disease in many countries. Even in industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, the risk for mumps is high; since 2004 there have been several outbreaks in the United Kingdom. The risk is especially high for children and adults who have not been vaccinated. Therefore, make sure you and your children are vaccinated before traveling abroad."

Midday when the sun is at its highest point is thought to be the most effective time to walk during winter months.;
, The effects of daylight are beneficial, even on cloudy days.

,, Regular physical activity helps reduce both depression and fatigue. When possible, exercise during the day near sources of light. If possible, find an outdoor sport or hobby that you can enjoy during the winter months to encourage you to spend more time outdoors.

, Social contact and support is very important when suffering from mood disorders.

, Discuss higher doses with your healthcare professional for the time of year when your SAD symptoms are present. Begin the higher doses before the first symptoms appear and continue until you are able to get sufficient daily natural sunlight again.

, Arrange the rooms in your home so that you can maximize your exposure to light while eating, reading, working, or watching television.

,, Generally, light therapy consists of sitting for 30 minutes in front of a 10,000-lux light box in early morning to mimic the benefits of natural sunlight. Begin light therapy before symptoms of SAD start.

, In addition to finding support, you may also learn of other strategies and resources that people are using to effectively combat their symptoms.

Use steam.,
Bake the needle.,
Use fire.,
Boil the needle in water.,
Use chemicals.",How to Sterilize a Needle," Before you handle any needles, you need to wear gloves. If you don't have gloves, make sure you wash your hands (and wrists) thoroughly., When you are sterilizing needles, you need to make sure that you don't contaminate the needle after you sterilize it.


Use sterilized tongs or spoons to pick the needle out of whatever device you place it in. Don't touch the newly sterilized needle with your hands or gloves. You could have contaminants on them.
Place the needle in a sterilized container if you are storing it., Before you sterilize the needle, make sure to wash it. This removes any dirt, grime, or blood left on the needle. This is extremely important if you have used the needle before.


Make sure to clean inside the needle if it is hollow. Use a clean or sterilized syringe to run water and soap through the inside.

, After washing the needles with soap or disinfectant, you need to rinse them with sterile water. Make sure to use sterile water instead of distilled water. Distilled water can still contain bacteria. You need to rinse the needles to make sure there are no deposits from the washing left behind., Steam is one of the most widely used and effective methods for sterilizing needles. No living thing can survive direct exposure to saturated steam at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius) for longer than 15 minutes.


Use a steaming pot to do this. Put water in the bottom pot. When it starts to boil, place the needle in the pot with the holes over the boiling pot, then cover it with a lid. Let it steam for at least 20 minutes.An autoclave is a tool specifically made for sterilizing needles and other tools by steam. If you need to sterilize needles often and precisely, you may want to invest in one., Wrap the needle in multiple layers of clean cloth. Bake the needle for 1 hour at 340 degrees Fahrenheit.This is one way to completely sterilize the needle by killing all the microorganisms. Make sure you leave it in the oven long enough. This method can be used to sterilize needles used for acupuncture, medical use, and piercings and tattoos.Dry heat can cause the needle to become brittle.

, Use a gas-fueled fire because they leave less residue behind. Place the needle tip in the flame until it glows red.Sterilizing a needle in a flame is good for home use, but doesn't get completely sterile because the needle can pick up contaminants in the air afterwards.If there are any soot or carbon deposits on the needle, wipe it with a sterile gauze pad.This method is effective for removing a splinter, but is not the most sterile. Therefore, it is not recommended for piercing, tattooing, or medical uses., One way to sterilize a needle is to drop it in boiling water. After you wash and rinse your tools, cover them with water and boil for 20 minutes. Start counting the 20 minutes after the water has reached a boil.

, You can sterilize a needle by using chemicals. Soak in the mixture for at least 20 minutes, unless it's drinking alcohol. If you use drinking alcohol, soak it in that solution for an entire day.You can rinse the needle in the following chemicals:


Bleach. If it's 5% available chlorine, you can use it undiluted. If it is 10%, use 1 part bleach to 1 part water; for 15%, use 1 part bleach to 2 parts water.If you don’t have bleach, use one of the following chemicals: ethanol (medical alcohol) 70%, isopropyl alcohol 70%, or hydrogen peroxide 6%.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Avoid contact.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough.,
Do not share cups and eating utensils.,
Clean surfaces that are touched regularly.,
Seek medical help immediately.",How to Prevent Mumps2," You can prevent the spread of mumps by recognizing the symptoms. The most common symptoms are headache, fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite followed by the onset of parotitis. Parotitis is tender and swollen salivary glands under the ears on either one or both sides.These swollen glands typically appear 16 to 18 days after exposure to mumps.

, Once an infection is detected, experts recommend that patients be isolated for five days after the onset of parotitis.Infected persons should avoid going to workplaces, schools, sporting events and practices, and all public places and gatherings for five days after symptoms start.Infected persons should minimize close contact with people who live with them, babies, and people with weak immune systems.

, You can also prevent mumps by washing your hands regularly with soap and water. You should wash your hands before and after preparing your food, before eating, while caring for someone who is sick, before and after treating a wound, after using the bathroom, after changing diapers, after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose, after touching or feeding an animal, and after touching garbage.Teach your children how to wash their hands properly, as well.

, Make sure to always cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough. You can cover your mouth with a tissue, or if you do not have a tissue, sneeze into your elbow or upper sleeve (not your hand). Make sure to wash your hands after sneezing and coughing.

, Avoid getting mumps by using your own cups and eating utensils. Always make sure your cups and eating utensils are cleaned before and after you use them. Clean them with soap and hot water.

, Surfaces that are touched regularly need to be cleaned frequently, as well. These surfaces include doorknobs and handles, toys, keyboards, tables, countertops, and remote controls. Clean these items with common household cleaners like antibacterial wipes, 409, or soap and water. These surfaces should be cleaned at least once a week.

, If you suspect mumps, contact your primary care doctor or a health center, preferably by telephone, for advice. The ill person may need to be seen at a clinic or medical office to get a proper diagnosis. Calling first for advice will help medical staff minimize the risk of exposing other patients to mumps. Some offices may ask a patient suspected of having mumps to be met at a side door, rather than sit in a waiting room.

Familiarize yourself with the treatment for CHF.",How to Recognize Congestive Heart Failure Symptoms," Shortness of breath is one of the hallmark symptoms of congestive heart failure (particularly left-sided heart failure). This shortness of breath may occur during physical activity, at rest or while sleeping.


This shortness of breath may be caused by fluid in the lungs, or by the inability of the heart to pump adequate amounts of blood during physical activity.;
, In addition to the shortness of breath, you may be prone to fits of coughing and experience wheezing or crackling sensations in the lungs when lying down.

, One visible symptom of CHF is when the jugular vein becomes distended when you are in a semi-upright position. The vein may pulsate as your heart beats.

, Swelling may occur in the legs, feet and ankles as a result of poor circulation, which causes fluid to accumulate in the lower extremities. This is known as peripheral edema.


One of the telltale signs that your ankles and feet are swollen is when your shoes and socks feel tight.

, Hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver caused by the accumulation of fluid) is often a symptom of CHF. Signs of an enlarged liver include abdominal swelling and nausea.

, Along with the liver, fluid may accumulate in the abdomen as a result of CHF. This is known as ascites. Ascites leads to abdominal distension (or swelling) and feeling bloated and nauseous.

, Feeling too warm (even though everyone else in the room feels fine) may be a symptom of CHF. This is because poor circulation prevents the release of body heat.


However, even if you feel too warm, the skin on your hands and feet may feel pale and cool, as these parts of your body are not receiving enough blood.

, Another symptom of CHF is fatigue and dizziness following physical activity, which may force you to sit or lie down. Again, these symptoms occur as a result of poor blood circulation.

, Another possible symptom of CHF is mental confusion brought on by inadequate circulation of blood to and from the brain. This mental confusion may manifest itself as anxiety, irritability, depression and/or in difficulty concentrating or remembering.

, The key to understanding CHF is the word congestion. Congestion develops when the heart is unable to pump blood as quickly as it should.This may occur because the heart muscle is too weak or because blood vessels throughout the body are narrowed and constricted, causing the heart muscle to become exhausted.


Poorly functioning valves may cause the chamber to dilate from blood back-up, thinning the myocardium, decreasing pumping ability and increasing the workload. Normally, the ventricles of the heart contract (while the atria are relaxing) allowing for the filling and emptying of each chamber. If the muscle wall of the left ventricle cannot contract properly, some of the blood is left in the ventricles.
Blood then backs up into the pulmonary vessels, the pressure within those vessels increases and fluid leaks into the lung tissue, producing congestion and eventually pulmonary edema (swelling) .If not corrected, the back-up of blood will soon lead to failure of the right side of the heart. This condition is called congestive heart failure.

, Congestive heart failure is actually a complication of other cardiovascular conditions rather than a disease in itself. CHF is frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contractions resulting in myocardial failure. However, CHF may also be triggered by acute hypertensive crisis, rupture of an aortic valve cusp or a massive pulmonary embolism.

, There are a number of things that can be done to treat CHF - these usually involve correcting the underlying cause of the heart failure, such as hypertension or dysrhythmia.


Follow a strict low sodium diet and avoid drinking too much fluid.
Get plenty of bed rest and gradually re-introduce slower-paced activity.
Avoid emotional stress.
Take prescription medications to treat CHF, such as diuretics, vasodilators, dobutamine and ACE inhibitors.

Feel a heat or warmth radiating from the infected area.,
Watch from swollen glands.,
Notice if you experience fever and/or chills.,
Feel fatigued for no apparent reason.,
Notice if you are sweating for no apparent reason.,
Pay attention to pain that seems more serious than the size of the infection would indicate.,
Observe lymphangitic spread.,
Treat wounds immediately to help prevent infection.,
Recognize that cellulitis is caused by a bacterial infection.,
Take antibiotics to treat cellulitis.",How to Recognize Cellulitis Symptoms," These are the tell-tale sign of cellulitis. Inflammation, redness, and warmth in the affected region of your body will likely be the first signs of infection. Patients should monitor their infection closely. Consider:


Inflammation and redness might occur after some pain at the point of infection.
Once you notice inflammation and redness at the point of infection, you should monitor it closely as the infection can spread very quickly.
If the infection turns from red to a purple or violet color and expands, you should see a doctor as soon as possible.;
, A good indication of cellulitis is that we can observe a central area – the initial place of infection – that is abscessed and swollen. This initial place of infection is often filled with pus. Treatment might, in some cases, demand that the abscess is drained. , Many patients inflicted by cellulitis report sensitivity to the infected area if touched. While this sensitivity or pain might be minimal at first, it can quickly develop into a much more intense level of pain and discomfort. If your pain increases in intensity quickly, contact a medical professional., A common symptom of cellulitis is that the infected area is warm or even hot to the touch. At first this warmth might seem like nothing, but it can quickly escalate and cause discomfort to the patient. In addition, heat or warmth radiating from the infected area is an indication that the infection is spreading and expanding, possibly becoming systemic., Serious cases of cellulitis will spread beyond the initially infected region to become systemic and impact the rest of the body. One common sign of systemic cellulitis is swollen lymph glands. You should consider that:


Lymph glands nearest to the infection will swell first.
Lymph glands may become tender and exhibit pain when touched.
Swollen lymph glands indicate that the infection is spreading well beyond the initially infected region and the patient requires immediate medical care.
Lymph nodes are located on your neck, in your armpits, and around your groin, among other places., While systemic symptoms vary from patient to patient, bad cases of cellulitis can cause someone to experience a fever or chills. The fever or chills might seem to go and come with no predictability; however, the worse the infection is, the more the fever and chills will persist.


Fever is an indication of a serious case of systemic infection.
See your doctor immediately if your case of cellulitis is accompanied by fever and/or chills.A doctor might advise Tylenol or other fever reducing medicines.

, People who suffer from a serious case of cellulitis may experience fatigue for no apparent reason. They will feel tired and drained of energy. A feeling of fatigue is a systemic symptom that indicates a case of cellulitis that is expanding. Consult your doctor immediately if your cellulitis is accompanied by prolonged fatigue., Another symptom of a serious systemic case of cellulitis is when the patient sweats for no clear reason. Sweating may or may not be accompanied by fatigue, fever, and or chills. Regardless, a case of cellulitis accompanied by sweating is an indication that the infection is expanding and affecting more than the area of initial infection., Many serious cases of cellulitis will have associated pain emanating from the infected area. This pain will seem much more severe than the size of the infection would suggest. If you have an infection with intense pain, you should contact a doctor immediately., Lymphangitic spread appears as red lines emanating outward from the infected area. If you observe this spreading, it means that your cellulitis is potentially severe. Observed spreading indicates that the infection is radiating outward and will become a systemic infection if it goes untreated., Treating wounds immediately is important because cellulitis can be introduced to the body through an open wound. Any open would, however innocuous and seemingly harmless, can create an opportunity for the development of cellulitis. Inflammation generally starts at the point where skin was previously broken. As a result, you should treat all newly opened wounds as soon as possible. Introduction of cellulitis can be caused by:Cuts
Blisters
Burns
Cracks in the skin
Surgical wounds
Sites of intravenous catheter insertion

, Cellulitis is most often caused by Streptococcus type A and Staphylococcus aureus; however, while these are the two most common causes, it can be caused by other types of bacteria. Blood test and cultures are needed in order to determine exactly the type of bacteria that is causing cellulitis.If you have a known or suspected underlying condition, such as diabetes, your doctor will likely want to perform more tests.
Be conscious of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a bacteria that is resistant to antibiotic treatment. Oral medication will not work on this type of infection and you will need to be given vancomycin intravenously. MRSA must be treated quickly or it can become life-threatening.

, Treatment for mild forms of cellulitis include elevation of the affected area and treatment of the underlying conditions. Patients that have edema as one of their underlying conditions may benefit from compression stockings or diuretics. Nevertheless, antibiotics are usually the best solution to heal this type of infection. Antibiotics are used orally or intravenously depending of severity affected skin area.For mild infections, your doctor may give you the oral antibiotic cephalexin. In more severe cases, you may be treated with vancomycin or meropenem.
One major complication of cellulitis includes infection of deeper structures, such as bone. This can lead to a disease called osteomyelitis, which is the infection of the bone and requires aggressive treatment.
In cases of recurrence of disease treatment with antibiotics may last up to several months."

Eat a well balanced diet.,
Remember to replenish vital electrolytes.,
Keep your body cool to prevent diaphoresis, or profuse sweating.,
Recognize and pay attention to other symptoms.,
Take frequent breaks throughout the day and try to cool yourself off.,
Watch the color of your urination when in the bathroom.,
Remember to wear sunscreen every day you are outside in the bright sun.,
Rest up!",How to Prevent Hyponatremia (Low Blood Sodium)," Please refer to the Food Pyramid or suggestions of nutritionists if you are unsure about what you should be eating each day. Normally, you should have 3-5 servings of fruits and vegetables, 5-8 servings of grains, 2-4 servings of protein, and 2-4 servings of dairy each day. Remember to eat three meals a day to sustain your energy and keep your sodium levels in check.;
, These include not only sodium but also potassium, glucose, proteins, and others. You can usually do this through a sports drink such as Gatorade. Switch between this and water while working, exercising, etc.

, This sweating is one of the major symptoms of hyponatremia. In order to keep your body cool while working outside, stay in the shade, wear a sun hat, and try to wear loose, light-colored clothing. Wear less restrictive clothing if possible, such as shorts, sandals, loose synthetic T-shirts, etc.

, These often resemble those of the flu. Early symptoms may include mild sweating, dizziness, or fatigue. Later stages include vomiting, severe confusion, convulsions or even coma. Please stay alert and call the Emergency Services immediately if you are experiencing any late stage symptoms.

, Going inside and resting by a fan or dripping ice cold water down your hair or back can help alleviate overheating. Try to do this at least twice an hour, or 5 minutes for every hour that you work or exercise hard.

, If your urine is clear or only pale yellow you are likely getting enough water and probably do not need any more fluid at the moment. If your urine is dark yellow it is a sign your body is not getting nearly enough water to be able to function properly. If it does not get better soon or is closer to a brown tint seek immediate medical attention.

, Remember to reapply at least every two hours with an SPF of at least 35. Though this does definitely have to do with skin cancer having dry sunburned skin; can severely increase the dangers of hyponatremia.

, After working hard your body and brain need to restore energy. Don't be afraid to nap but not more than 2 hours or you may not be able to sleep well in the night.

Get an x-ray from your doctor.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Wrist Sprain and a Wrist Fracture," Wrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch or tearing to the ligament(s). A mild wrist sprain (Grade 1), infers some ligament stretching, but no significant tearing; a moderate sprain (Grade 2) infers significant tearing (up to 50% of the fibers) and may be associated with some loss of function; a severe sprain (Grade 3) infers a greater degree of tearing or complete rupture of ligaments.As such, movement in your wrist will be relatively normal (albeit painful) with Grade 1 and 2 sprains. A Grade 3 sprain often leads to instability (too much range of motion) with movement because the ligaments attaching the wrist bones are completely torn.


In general, only some Grade 2 and all Grade 3 wrist sprains need medical attention. All Grade 1 and most Grade 2 sprains can be managed at home.
A Grade 3 wrist sprain can involve an avulsion fracture — the ligament tears away from the bone and takes a small chip of bone with it.The most common ligament sprained in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone.;
, Again, wrist sprains are highly variable in severity, so the type and/or amount of pain varies greatly also.Grade 1 wrist sprains are mildly painful and the pain is often described as a soreness that can be sharp with movement. Grade 2 sprains are moderately or severely painful, depending on the degree of tearing; the pain is sharper than a Grade 1 tear and sometimes also throbbing because of the increased inflammation. Perhaps paradoxically, Grade 3 sprains are often less painful initially than a Grade 2 sprain because the ligament is completely severed and not irritating surrounding nerves as much. However, Grade 3 wrist sprains eventually start to throb quite a bit due to the accumulating inflammation.


Grade 3 sprains that involve an avulsion fracture are very painful immediately, and involve both sharp and throbbing type pain.
Sprains generate the most pain with movement and are usually much less symptomatic with lack of movement (immobilization).
In general, if your wrist is very painful and difficult to move, see your doctor right away and get it assessed.

, Sprains of all grades respond well to ice or cold therapy because it reduces inflammation and numbs surrounding nerve fibers that generate pain.Ice is particularly important for Grade 2 and 3 wrist sprains because they cause more inflammation to accumulate around the injury site. Applying ice to a sprained wrist for 10–15 minutes every one to two hours immediately following an injury makes a big impact after a day or so and significantly reduces the intensity of pain, which makes movement much easier. In contrast, icing a wrist fracture is certainly helpful for pain and inflammation control, but the symptoms often return after the effects wear off. Thus, as a general rule, cold therapy is more impactful on sprains that it is on most fractures.


The more serious the sprain, the more swelling you'll see localized around the injury, which will make the area look puffy and enlarged.
Small hairline (stress) fractures are often more impacted by cold therapy (long term) than more serious fractures, which require medical attention.

, Inflammation creates swelling, but that's not the same as bruising.Instead, bruising is caused by localized bleeding into the tissues from injured small arteries or veins. Grade 1 wrist sprains usually don't cause bruising, unless the injury was from a hard blow that crushed the small subcutaneous blood vessels. Grade 2 sprains involve more swelling, but again, not necessarily much bruising — it depends how the injury occurred. Grade 3 sprains involve lots of swelling and typically significant bruising because trauma that causes ruptured ligaments is usually severe enough to also rip or damage the surrounding blood vessels.


Swelling from inflammation doesn't cause much color change in the skin, aside from some redness from ""flushing"" due to the heat created.
The dark blue color of bruising is caused by blood leaking into the tissues just below the surface of the skin. As the blood degrades and gets flushed out of those tissues, the bruise changes color (lighter blue, then eventually yellowish).

, Essentially all Grade 1 wrist sprains, and some Grade 2 sprains, feel significantly better after a few days, especially if you rest the injury and apply cold therapy to it.As such, if your wrist feels pretty good, there's no visible swelling and you can move it without much pain, then likely no medical intervention is needed. If your wrist was more seriously sprained (Grade 2), but feels significantly better after a few days (even if some swelling is noted and the pain is still moderate), then give it a little more time to recover. However, if your injury hasn't improved much or is actually worse after a few days, then a medical assessment is likely needed as soon as possible.


Grade 1 and some Grade 2 sprains heal quickly (one to two weeks), whereas Grade 3 sprains (particularly with avulsion fractures) take the most amount of time to heal (sometimes a few months).
Hairline (stress) fractures can also heal pretty quickly (couple of weeks), whereas more serious fractures can take a few months or more, depending if surgery is done.

, A wrist fracture can be caused by similar types of accidents and trauma that cause wrist sprains. In general, the larger and stronger bones are, the less likely they are to break in response to trauma — instead, the ligaments will stretch and tear. But when they do, they often create a misaligned or crooked appearance.The eight carpal bones of the wrist are small, so a misaligned or crooked wrist may be difficult (or impossible) to notice, especially with hairline fractures, but more serious breaks are easier to tell.


The most commonly broken long bone within the wrist area is the radius, which is a forearm bone that attaches to the small carpal bones.The most commonly fractured carpal bone is the scaphoid bone, which is unlikely to cause a noticeable wrist deformity.When a bone penetrates the skin and becomes visible, this is known as an open or compound fracture.

, Pain from a wrist fracture also depends upon severity, but it's usually described as very sharp with movement, and deep and achy without movement. The severe pain of wrist fractures tends to increase during gripping or squeezing of the hand, which is not often the case with wrist sprains.Wrist fractures usually cause more symptoms in the hand, such as stiffness, numbness or inability to move the fingers, in comparison to wrist sprains because there is a greater chance of nerve injury/damage with fractures.Furthermore, there can be a grinding or crunching sound when moving a fractured wrist, which doesn't occur with wrist sprains.


Pain from a wrist fracture is often (but not always) preceded by a ""cracking"" sound or feeling. In contrast, only Grade 3 sprains can produce a sound or similar sensations, and that's sometimes a ""popping"" sound as the ligament ruptures.
As a general guideline, wrist pain from a fracture will get worse at night, whereas pain from a wrist sprain will plateau and not flare-up in the night if the wrist is immobilized.

, As noted above, a day or two of rest and cold therapy can make a big different in a mild-to-moderate wrist sprain, but the same can't be said for fractures.With the possible exception of hairline fractures, most broken bones need significantly more time to heal than ligament sprains. Thus, a couple days of rest and icing doesn't make much impact on the symptoms caused by most fractures, and in some cases, you may feel worse once your body gets over the initial ""shock"" of the injury.


If a broken bone in the wrist pokes through the skin, then the risk of infection and significant loss of blood are high. Get medical attention as soon as you can.
A severely broken bone in the wrist may completely cut off circulation to the hand. The swelling from the blood causes what is called ""compartment syndrome,"" which is considered a medical emergency. When this occurs, the hand will feel cold to touch (from lack of blood) and turn pale (a bluish white).
A broken bone may also pinch or sever a nearby nerve, which might lead to complete numbness in the region of the hand that the nerve innervates.

, Although the above information can guide you to make an educated guess on whether your wrist injury is a sprain or a fracture, only an x-ray, MRI or CT scan can tell for sure in most cases — unless a bone is poking through your skin. An x-ray is the most economical and common way to view the small bones of the wrist. Your doctor will likely refer you for a wrist x-ray and get the results verified by a radiologist before consulting with you. X-rays only visualize bone and not soft tissues such as ligaments or tendons. Fractured bones can be tricky to see on x-ray because of their small size and the confined space, and it can take a few days for them to be visible on x-rays. To visualize the extent of ligament damage, your doctor will refer you for an MRI or CT scan.


An MRI, which uses magnetic waves to provide detailed images of structures within the body, may be needed to detect a fractured bone in the wrist, particularly broken scaphoid bones.
Hairline fractures in the wrist are very difficult to see on regular x-rays until all the inflammation fades away. As such, you may have to wait a week or so to confirm the fracture, although by that time, the injury is well on its way to healing.
Osteoporosis (brittle bones due to lack of mineralization) is a major risk factor for wrist fractures, although the condition doesn't really increase the risk of wrist sprains.

Learn what HPV genital warts look like.,
Pay attention to itching.,
Understand where genital warts usually appear.",How to Test Yourself for HPV Genital Warts1," If you want to diagnosis HPV-related genital warts, the first step is familiarizing yourself with their appearance. This can help you differentiate genital warts from other skin conditions and STDs such as herpes.HPV genital warts appear in a variety of forms. They may be flat lesions or small, cauliflower-like bumps.;
, Genital warts rarely cause pain. However, they may become quite itchy. If you notice any unusual lesions near your genitals that itch, they may be HPV related., You can identify HPV genital warts by knowing where they generally appear. HPV warts occur in specific areas on men and women.


Genital warts usually appear around the penis or scrotum in men.In women, genital warts usually appear on the vulva but may also appear near the anus, on the cervix, or inside the vagina.While these are the most common areas of appearance, HPV warts can appear anywhere on the body including non-genital areas.

"
"
See a doctor.,
Seek treatment.",How to Test Yourself for HPV Genital Warts2," If you suspect you may have HPV genital warts, you should see a doctor. There is no single test used to diagnose HPV. Most HPV tests (such as a pap smear for women) are used to check for cancer-causing subtypes — it is important to note that these are not the same as the subtypes that cause genital warts. Your doctor can diagnose HPV warts by taking your medical history and performing a physical examination.


Your doctor will ask about your history of exposure to sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, genital herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis or trichomoniasis.She may also do a biopsy or scrapping of the warts if needed to confirm their etiology.
She will check for genital discharges and other symptoms. The doctor may ask about the color and smell of the vaginal or penis discharge.Your doctor will also ask about your sex practices and sexual behavior. Do you use condoms with your partner? Do you have more than one sex partner?The doctor may also ask if you have heterosexual intercourse, homosexual intercourse, or both, as risk factors are different.
Your doctor will perform a physical assessment to determine abnormalities in the affected areas. Inform the doctor if you feel any discomfort or pain during the procedure., Once you've been diagnosed with HPV-related genital warts, talk to your doctor about treatment options. Genital warts are treated with medication and can also be removed surgically.

Over-the-counter creams like salicylic acid can be effective in treating genital warts. Your doctor may prescribe certain creams to enhance your immune system to fight off the warts.Your doctor can also remove a wart surgically or freeze it off using liquid nitrogen. Laser surgery can also be used to remove warts."

Learn how the HPV virus is contracted.,
Familiarize yourself with risk factors.,
Take action to prevent HPV.",How to Test Yourself for HPV Genital Warts3," The HPV virus can be acquired through direct contact with infected skin cells. It enters the outer skin layer through any break in the skin, such as a cut or wound. Genital HPV is usually contracted during sexual contact., Certain behaviors and pre-existing conditions increase your risk for contracting HPV. Knowing if you're at an increased risk can help you diagnose HPV warts.Having multiple sex partners and engaging in risky sexual behavior, such as unprotected sex, can increase your risk for developing HPV.If your skin is damaged, you're more likely to contract HPV during sex. If you've had sex with someone with genital warts, this also increases your risk.People with immunodeficiencies, such as people with AIDS or cancer, are also more at risk of developing this condition., Always engage in safer sex. Use condoms and ask your partner about his or her sexual history. You cannot entirely eliminate the risk of acquiring HPV through condom use, but it does cut down transmission rates."

Find out if you are eligible.,
Learn about Parts A, B, C, and D. There are several different parts to Medicare insurance.,
Contact the Social Security Office.,
Updating your plan.",How to Sign Up for Medicare1," American citizens who are 65 years of age and older are generally eligible for Medicare. You also need to have lived in the United States for at least five calendar years prior to receiving benefits. You also need to have been employed for 10 years in a workplace that was covered by Medicare. If you are not sure if that's you, you can contact your employer to ask.If you meet the above criteria, you likely will not have to do anything to receive your coverage. Typically, a Medicare card will be mailed to you prior to your birthday.
You may qualify for Medicare if you are under 65 but have specific medical ailments. If you have End Stage Renal Disease, you qualify. You are also eligible if you have received Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) for more than 24 months. If you suffer from ALS, you can receive Medicare after only one month of SSDI.;
, Part A is basic hospital coverage, and this is what adults 65 and older will automatically be enrolled in. Part B is more comprehensive medical coverage, and you may have to enroll in this plan. It is optional, and you do not have to participate.If you are a former railroad employee and are receiving benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board, you will automatically be enrolled in Parts A and B.
If you are permanently disabled or have ALS, you automatically get Parts A and B.
Part C is called the Medicare Advantage Plan and is more comprehensive than Parts A and B. This is optional, but you must be enrolled in Medicare to enroll in Part C coverage. It is available through private insurance companies.
Part D is also provided through private insurance companies. Like Part C, it is optional. Part D covers prescription medications.

, Once you have determined your eligibility, it is time to make sure that you are enrolled in Medicare. The Social Security Office handles Medicare enrollments. The easiest way to have your information processed is to use the online form provided by the Social Security Office. No documentation is required, and it should take you less than 10 minutes to apply.If the Social Security Office needs further information, they will contact you. Otherwise, you can expect to receive your Medicare card in the mail.
If you do not want to enroll online, you can visit your local Social Security Office or call them to make an appointment with a Social Security representative.

, Although most people will automatically be enrolled, some might have to sign up for Medicare. If you are not receiving Social Security benefits (for example, because you are still working), you will need to sign up for Parts A and B. Also, if you live in Puerto Rico and want Part B, you will need to enroll.To update your plan, enroll, or make any changes, you can contact your local Social Security Office or use the online forms.

"
Know what is covered.,
Follow current events.,
Consult your doctor.",How to Sign Up for Medicare2," Before you agree to any medical procedures (such as scans or lab work), check to see if your treatment will be covered by your Medicare plan. Each Part offers different coverage, so it is important that you read about what your particular plan offers.You should also check to make sure that your doctor's office accepts Medicare--most do.You can find out whether a specific treatment is covered by reading the provided material. You can get this at the Social Security Office or online when you enroll.
There should be someone at the doctor's office or hospital who is familiar with Medicare. Ask to speak to that person, and they should be able to tell you whether or not what you need done will be covered.

, Since Medicare is a program of the federal government, it is subjective to changes. Sometimes legislation can affect things like coverage and premiums. Make sure to stay current on the news relating to health care.If you think there has been legislation that may affect you, you can ask your insurance provider or the Social Security Office for more information.

, Your doctor (and his support staff) are one of the most important health care resources that you have. Talk to him about any concerns you may have. For example, if he recommends a procedure that is not covered by Medicare, find out if this is an essential medical necessity. Medicare does not dictate that you only see one doctor. You should feel free to get a second opinion if you are not comfortable with the options being provided.

Learn the history.,
Know why it is important.,
Practice civic responsibility.",How to Sign Up for Medicare3," Medicare is a pretty complex program. When you're trying to understand how it impacts you, it can be useful to learn about the history of the program. Medicare was implemented in 1965, due to a concern that the elderly had no other way to receive affordable health care.As priorities and the economy shifts, benefits have been added and taken away. This is why it is a good idea to stay current on legislation that could affect the program.

, Many people of retirement age do not have much flexibility in their income. Unfortunately, this is also the time of life when more medical problems start to occur. Millions of Americans rely on Medicare to receive basic health care. Without the programs, a large percentage of Americans would be without any type of health insurance. , Many political candidates argue that cutting Medicare is one way to help revive the economy. While this would save money, it would also prevent many Americans from receiving necessary medical treatments. If this is an issue that is important to you, take it into consideration when you vote for elected officials.


Candidates should be happy to provide you with information regarding their views on Medicare and health care in general.

Alter your diet one to two weeks in advance.,
Consume more vitamin K. Vitamin K thickens the blood and enhances its clotting abilities, so loading your diet with foods rich in this particular vitamin may help.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Keep yourself adequately hydrated.,
Avoid salicylates.,
Control your vitamin E. Vitamin E is another substance that interferes with the body's ability to absorb vitamin K, but the effects are usually less pronounced than they are with salicylates, so you don't need to avoid vitamin E completely.,
Stay away from omega-3 fatty acids.,
Limit your exercise routine.,
Consult with your doctor before making any changes.,
Take vitamin K supplements.,
Don't take over-the-counter blood thinners.,
Temporarily stop any prescription blood thinners.",How to Thicken Blood Before Surgery," It can take days or weeks for the thickness of your blood to change due to dietary and lifestyle habits alone. Start making these changes as early as possible to maximize the potential impact they have on your blood.;
, Good options to consider include dark green vegetables, dark fruits, and certain nuts.The highest concentration of vitamin K can usually be found in dark green vegetables. Kale, collard greens, spinach, green beans, soybeans, spring onions, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and cucumbers are some of your best choices.
Most fruits don't contain quite as much vitamin K as green vegetables do, but many of the darker fruits and berries at least contain some. This includes blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and plums.
Cashews and chestnuts contain more vitamin K than most other nuts, but pistachios, pine nuts, and hazelnuts contain some, as well.
You can also add vitamin K to your diet by seasoning your food with dried basil, dried sage, dried thyme, dried marjoram, dried cilantro, parsley, chili powder, curry powder, paprika, or cayenne pepper., Alcohol tends to thin the blood and cause more bleeding to occur, so you should avoid consuming alcohol as much as possible at least one week before surgery.An occasional glass of wine or some other alcoholic beverage relatively low in proof may not necessarily cause much of a problem for someone whose blood has a normal consistency, but even that can cause adverse effects for someone whose blood is thinner than average. Your safest option is to avoid alcohol completely until after the surgery is over.

, Proper hydration is an essential component of healthy blood. If you're dehydrated, the volume of blood pumping through your circulatory system can decrease, causing it to thin out have difficulty coagulating.


Excessive hydration can also cause your blood to become too thin, however. As you drink more, more fluid enters into your blood, thinning it out.
It's best to maintain standard, healthy levels of hydration prior to surgery to avoid complications. Try to consume eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of fluid each day.

, Salicylates blocks your body's ability to absorb vitamin K, thereby preventing your blood from thickening. It might be best to avoid foods high in salicylates so that your blood can more effectively benefit from the vitamin K you consume.


Many herbs and spices are naturally high in salicylates. Some of the most notable include ginger, cinnamon, dill, oregano, turmeric, licorice, and peppermint.
Certain fruits are also high in salicylates. It might be best to stay away from raisins, cherries, cranberries, grapes, tangerines, and oranges.
Other foods rich in salicylates include chewing gum, honey, peppermints, vinegar, and cider.
Some seasonings and foods high in salicylates are also high in vitamin K, and the two substances may balance each other out. Examples include curry powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, thyme, blueberries, prunes, and strawberries.

,


A better option would be to simply avoid excess vitamin E while preparing for your surgery. Don't take vitamin E supplements and don't add any new sources of vitamin E to your routine.
Some topical health and beauty products, like certain hand sanitizers, use vitamin E as a preservative. Check the ingredients and consider temporarily switching to a brand that doesn't include vitamin E.
Most foods high in vitamin E contain just as much, if not more, vitamin K. Spinach and broccoli are two examples. As such, they generally won't thin the blood and don't need to be excluded from your diet.

, Omega-3 fatty acids can thin blood and prevent clotting. Normal doses of omega-3 fatty acids will be safe to consume before surgery if you usually have healthy, adequately thick blood, but excess omega-3 should be avoided.


You may also want to avoid omega-3 fatty acids if your blood tends to be thinner than usual.
Fatty fish contains some of the largest doses of omega-3, so you might want to avoid salmon, trout, tuna, anchovies, mackerel, and herring.
Fish oil capsules should usually be skipped completely while you're preparing for surgery since they contain concentrated doses of omega-3.

, Light to moderate exercise can still be beneficial before surgery, but you should avoid intense bouts of vigorous exercise at least one week in advance.


Vigorous exercise can increase bleeding, lower vitamin K levels, and thin the blood.
On the other hand, remaining stationary can also be bad for you. People who live stationary lifestyles run the risk of thickening the blood too much and developing blood clots.
Your best option is to engage in light exercise several times throughout the week. For instance, you could try walking or jogging for 30 minutes, three to five days a week.

, When preparing for surgery, you should discuss any changes you plan to make with your physician or surgeon beforehand. This includes changes to your diet, over-the-counter medications, and prescription medications.


Bring all of your current routine medications to the surgery orientation. Your doctor should be able to tell you if any of these medications must be stopped or decreased before surgery.
Note that blood can be either too thick or too thin, and neither option is particularly safe, especially when you have surgery. Thin blood won't coagulate properly, which may cause you to bleed excessively during the operation. Thick blood can lead to blood clots that may block arteries or cause related complications., Even though vitamin K naturally obtained through your diet is typically better, you can consider temporarily supplementing your diet with vitamin K capsules as an acceptable alternative.


Begin taking the supplement one week before surgery to gradually thicken your blood.
Adult women should only take 90 micrograms daily, and adult men should only take 120 micrograms daily. Children will need to take smaller doses based on exact age., Some over-the-counter or herbal drugs can act as anti-coagulates. In other words, they cause your blood to become thinner. You should stop taking these drugs at least one week before your surgery to prevent your blood from thinning out.Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like ibuprofen and naproxen) are the biggest over-the-counter culprits.
Herbal drugs that have a similar effect include vitamin E supplements, garlic supplements, ginger supplements, and ginkgo biloba.

, If you're currently taking prescription anti-coagulants (blood thinners), your doctor may recommend stopping those medications several days before your surgery. This can be the case regardless of whether or not those medications were originally prescribed for the sake of thinning your blood.


The exact timing will vary depending on your specific circumstances, so you must consult with your doctor before stopping your prescriptions.
Prescription blood thinners include warfarin, enoxaparin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, and alendronate. Prescription dosages of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also included.

Consider the duration and type of pain.,
Be on the lookout for coughing.,
Try to locate the source of pain.,
Look closely for any bruising.,
Take your temperature.,
Make an appointment with your family physician.,
Get a chest x-ray.,
Get blood work done.",How to Tell the Difference Between a Pulled Muscle or Lung Pain," The onset of muscle pain is usually very different from lung pain. Moderate-to-severe muscle pulls tend to hurt right away, whereas mild strains can take a day or so to become sore. Muscle pain is almost always associated with overexertion or some type of trauma, so the cause tends to be obvious.Furthermore, lung pain usually can't be pinpointed to any moment in time or event and tends to be more constant.


Car accidents, slip and falls, trauma from sports (football, rugby, ice hockey) and lifting overly-heavy weights at the gym all tend to trigger sudden onset of pain.
Lung cancer, infections and inflammations gradually get worse (within days or months) and are associated with many other symptoms. Pneumothorax is a life-threatening lung condition that can happen due to trauma, strenuous activity, asthma, pneumonia, or cancer. It can come on gradually or suddenly.;
, Many lung conditions / diseases can cause chest pain, including: lung cancer, lung infections (bacterial and viral pneumonia, bronchitis), pulmonary embolism (blood clot), pleurisy (inflamed lung membranes), punctured lung and pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs).Almost all of these diseases and conditions lead to coughing and/or wheezing. In contrast, a pulled muscle in the chest or torso will not trigger coughing, although it may cause discomfort with deep breathing if the muscle is attached to a rib.


Coughing up blood is common with lung cancer, advanced pneumonia and punctures from lung trauma. Get medical attention immediately if you see blood in your sputum.
Muscle associated with ribs include the intercostals, obliques, abdominals and scalene muscles.These muscles move with respiration, so strains / pulls in them trigger pain with deep breaths, but don't cause coughing.

, Pulling a muscle in the chest or upper torso area is common from working out at the gym or playing sports. The pain from a muscle strain is often described as sore, stiff or achy. It's typically unilateral (on one side of the body) and easily located by feeling around near the source of pain.As such, feel around your chest and see if you can locate the area of discomfort. When they're injured, muscles often spasm, which feels like ropy bands. If you can locate an area of discomfort, then you're dealing with a muscle pull and not a lung issue. Most lung issues generate diffuse pain (often described as sharp) which can't be localized on the outside of the chest.


Feel carefully around your ribs, as those muscles are commonly pulled with too much rotation or side bending. If you can pinpoint severe pain near your chest bone (sternum), then you may be dealing with torn rib cartilage instead of a simple muscle pull.
Muscle pulls usually only generate pain when you move your body or breathe deeply, whereas lung issues (particularly cancer and infections) can cause constant pain.
Muscles that are directly over your lungs include the pectorals (major and minor groups). These muscle can be strained from doing push-ups, chin-ups or working the ""pec deck"" at the gym.

, With your shirt and undergarments off, look at your chest / torso very carefully for any bruising or redness. Moderate-to-severe muscle pulls involve partially tearing the muscle fibers, which bleed into surrounding tissue.The result is a dark purple / red bruise that fades over time to become yellowish. Some redness on your torso may also indicate trauma from playing sports or falling. In contrast, lung diseases / conditions don't typically involve visible bruising, unless you're dealing with a punctured lung from severely broken ribs.


Mild muscle pulls seldom leave bruises or redness as evidence, although they often cause some degree of localized swelling.
In addition to bruising, injured muscles sometimes twitch or quiver for a few hours (or even days) while they're trying to heal. These ""fasciculations"" are further evidence of a muscle pull instead of a lung issue.

, Many common causes of lung pain are caused by pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) or environmental irritants (asbestos, sharp fibers, dust, allergens). Therefore, in addition to chest pain and coughing, an increase in body temperature (fever) is very common with most lung afflictions. In contrast, muscle pulls almost never impact your core body temperature, unless they are severe enough to cause hyperventilation. As such, measure your temperature with a digital thermometer underneath your tongue. Average oral temperatures taken with a digital thermometer tend to be around 98.2 °F (36.8 °C).Mild fevers are often helpful because they represent your body trying to defend itself against infections.
However, high fevers (103°F or greater for an adult) are potentially dangerous and should be closely monitored.
Chronic, long-term lung diseases (cancer, obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis) often only increase body temperature slightly.

, The best way to tell the difference between a pulled muscle or lung pain is to visit your primary care provider. Muscle pulls invariably resolve themselves after a few days (or weeks with severe strains), so if your chest / torso pain is lingering beyond that time frame or actually getting worse, then call your doctor for an appointment. Your doctor will take a history, give you a physical exam and listen to your lungs as you breath. Noisy breathing (crackling or wheezing) is a reliable sign that something is either blocking your airways (debris or fluid) or making them too narrow (via swelling or inflammation).In addition to coughing up blood and chest pain with deep breathing, other signs of lung cancer include hoarseness, loss of appetite, relatively rapid weight loss and general lethargy.Your doctor can take a sputum sample (mucus / saliva / blood) and try to culture it, which could indicate a bacterial infection (bronchitis, pneumonia). However, your doctor will more likely use x-rays or physical exams for diagnosis.

, Once your doctor rules out a muscle pull and suspects a possible lung infection, he/she will take a chest x-ray. A chest x-ray can visualize broken ribs, fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema), lung tumors and any lung tissue damage from smoking, environmental irritants, emphysema, cystic fibrosis or previous bouts of tuberculosis.Advanced lung cancer is virtually always detected via chest x-rays, but the early stages of the disease can sometimes escape detection.
A chest x-ray may help detect signs of congestive heart disease.
Chest x-rays do not show muscle pulls or strains of the chest or upper torso. If your doctor suspects a torn muscle or tendon, he/she might send you for a diagnostic ultrasound, MRI or CT scan.
A CT scan creates a cross-sectional image of your chest, which can help the doctor diagnose your condition if a physical exam and chest x-ray are not definitive.

, Your doctor may decide it is necessary to draw blood. An acute lung infection (bronchitis, pneumonia) will trigger your white blood cell levels to spike because they are used by your immune system to kill pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.A blood test can also give you an idea of the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream, which is an indirect measure of lung function.


In contrast, blood tests cannot confirm or rule out pulled or strained muscles, even if they severe.
Blood tests will not indicate your level of oxygenation.
A test called a sedimentation rate can help determine if your body is under stress and has an existing chronic inflammatory condition.
Blood tests are not as helpful for diagnosing lung cancer — x-rays and and a tissue biopsy (sample) are more valuable.

Know when to seek additional help.",How to Talk to a Therapist," Get the tough stuff out as soon as possible. Plan out what you’re going to say and how you’re going to say it before you attend your sessions. You may have learned to stay silent as a coping mechanism or to keep yourself safe, but you don’t have to do this with your therapist.


For instance, you might practice by introducing yourself and stating the reason you came. ""Hi, I'm Matthew. I came in because I have been having trouble fitting in at school.""
Therapy is a safe place in which you are able to speak about how you feel in an open and supportive environment. Over time, you’ll likely find that opening up will become easier.;
, Talk about the problem you want to overcome, the area in your life you want to improve upon, or whatever it is that brought you to therapy, during the first or second session.


When you talk about your goals and expectations with your therapist, you can create benchmarks that you can use to measure your success along the way. For example, you might say, “I came here because I have problems socially. I would really like to have more friends and go out more.”, Don’t hold back. Talk to your therapist about everything you are feeling, even if you think it is unimportant. Not divulging everything could be detrimental to your recovery. Intentionally leaving out facts that you are embarrassed about or feel shy revealing could hinder you. If you’re not completely open with your therapist, you are essentially wasting your time.Be open by saying what you really feel--it's the only way your therapist can truly help. For example, say ""I feel like a total loser because I'm always be myself when everyone else is always hanging out with friends in a group.""

, And, remember that he or she is bound by law to protect your confidentiality. Know that you can tell your therapist anything and you won’t receive judgment or criticism. However, keep in mind that your therapist is bound by law to intervene if you express an intent to harm yourself or another person. Keep in mind that this is in your best interest.


And also know that your therapist won’t leave you unexpectedly. The therapist/patient relationship is special, and one that can be comforting and beneficial., Look for a therapist who treats people who have problems similar to yours. Experienced therapists have seen the problems you are facing again and again, and will likely have a good idea about how to help you.For instance, many specialize in areas such as depression, eating disorders, anxiety, and so on.
Finding a good therapist comes down to a mixture of factors, such as ensuring that the professional has experience with treating your issue, finding out their unique therapy style, and going for an initial session. If you find that you and the person get along well, and you feel better after your sessions, you may have found the right therapist for you.

, Talk to your therapist about the techniques and methods that will be used in your sessions. Don’t be afraid to ask questions; even if you feel they are personal.


For example, if you are concerned about your therapist’s own life experience or beliefs concerning your treatment, you might say, “Are you religious? It’s important for me to talk to someone who believes in a higher power.” Although you may not receive a direct answer, you’ll receive an explanation as to why not, which may help you understand your therapist better and learn his or her boundaries., Know that there isn’t a set time for how long you may need therapy, or that there is a method that works the best for everyone. Realize that although you may think what the therapist asks of you won’t work, you should still give it a chance. You never know, you may be pleasantly surprised.


Be willing to go along with what the therapist suggests, even if it is outside of your comfort zone. Doing so may help you finally experience the breakthrough you’ve wanted., Write down your feelings, fears, anxieties, frustrations, and whatever else is on your mind on that blank piece of paper. You’ll probably be surprised at how liberating it feels to get what is going on inside of you out into the open.


Then, bring your journal to a session. You may find that reading your entries to your therapist helps get the conversation going easier., Give your therapist a chance to understand what you are saying by going into more detail or explaining the situation in another way. If you feel like your therapist is misconstruing what you say, or isn’t “getting” you, don’t give up right away.


Tell him or her your frustrations and feelings and work together to develop a plan that helps you become understood. “No, you don’t understand. What I’m trying to say is…” is a good start to clearing up a misunderstanding., Use the tools your therapist and sessions have given you during your everyday life. Therapy works best when you are able to use it outside of the confines of the therapist’s office. Plus, by using what you’ve learned, you may be able to explore other areas of your life you were afraid to before.For example, if your therapist has challenged you to put your new social skills to the test at school, you should do it. Think about the strategies you have learned, and try to put them into practice. Go up to someone and start a conversation. Join a new club or organization.

, If you are not comfortable or making any progress, you may need to choose a different therapist. Know that it may take several different therapists until you find the one who is right for you.


You may not feel comfortable with the way the therapist speaks to you, or you just may not feel in your gut that this therapist is right for you. Don’t be afraid to leave if you aren’t happy with your experience.Make sure to talk with your therapist about the reason why you are ending your therapy with them. This will provide closure for both of you, and your therapist may even be able to recommend someone who can better meet your needs.

, Therapy may be effective on its own, but you may need to seek additional help if your symptoms are interfering with your daily life or affecting your quality of life. Talk with your primary care provider or therapist if you are having trouble coping with your symptoms using therapy alone. You may need to seek the help of a psychiatrist.

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who is trained to treat mental health disorders. After a psychiatric evaluation, they may prescribe a medication to help with your symptoms and act as a complement to your therapy.

Find ways to reduce stress.",How to Tell if Your Metabolism Is Slowing," It may seem strange, but the condition of your feet is one way to determine whether you have a low metabolism. Dry feet and cracked heels indicate slow metabolism because dry skin is one of the symptoms that your thyroid hormones are out of balance. If you've eliminated other potential causes of cracking or peeling skin on your feet, such as athlete's foot or nail fungus, your slowing metabolism may be to blame.
Dry skin elsewhere, as well as dry or thinning hair, also may indicate a slow metabolism. As with your feet, however, make sure you eliminate other causes for these conditions before you jump to the conclusion that your metabolism is slowing based on this single symptom.
Cold feet also may be an indication of slowing metabolism. While this is related to your overall body temperature, some people may have cold hands and feet constantly, despite feeling warm elsewhere. For example, you may only be comfortable if you are wearing socks, even in warm weather.;
, One sure way to tell if your metabolism is slowing is to think about whether you are always cold. If you have difficulty maintaining your body temperature even in a warm environment, you may have a slow metabolism.You can rely on behavior to figure this out. For example, if you're in a room with several people, all of whom are complaining that it's warm while you're shivering in a sweater, you probably have a lower overall body temperature.
Take your temperature first thing when you wake up in the morning. If it's below 98, this may indicate that your body has difficulty regulating its overall temperature, which can be a symptom of slower metabolism.

, Slow metabolism can cause serious sleep disruptions, including insomnia. If you have severe sleep disturbances, you probably don't have to keep track of your sleep specifically to know you have a problem.However, if you've had sleep disturbances for awhile, you may have adjusted your habits to accommodate those disturbances so that they have less of an effect on you.
Generally, you want to get between seven and nine hours of sleep a night. Keep a journal in which you record what time you go to bed and when you wake up.
You also might want to measure how long it takes you to fall asleep. This can be all but impossible to figure out for sure on your own, but you can usually come up with a good guess.
For example, if you normally read a book before bed, take note of the number of pages you read each night before you are ready to fall asleep. Figure out how long it takes you to read a page and this will give you a good idea of how long it takes you to fall asleep.

, If you have frequent mood swings, memory problems, or difficulty concentrating, you may have a slow metabolism. These may not be things you notice about yourself, but people who spend a lot of time with you can tell you more about how you act.Some things you may notice on your own. For example, if you find you feel extremely on edge if you haven't eaten in awhile, this can be an indication that you have a slower metabolism.
You also would have an idea if you have difficulty concentrating, although that could also be due to a number of other factors.
Talk to coworkers, your spouse, or even older children to see if they've noticed any changes in your behavior or mood lately. This can be particularly helpful if you think your metabolism has slowed only recently, since others around you likely would notice changes before you do yourself.

, While slow metabolism on its own isn't responsible for weight gain, if you've had a relatively sudden weight gain despite no changes in your lifestyle or habits, that may indicate that your metabolism is slowing.Essentially, you were consuming enough calories before to keep your weight steady or even lose weight – you were burning roughly the same amount of calories that you consumed.
If your metabolic rate slows, you'll burn fewer calories relative to the amount you consume, which can cause you to gain weight.
Control your activity and diet consistently for a few weeks, and weigh yourself each morning or every other day. Keep a record of your weight. If you're gaining weight when you weren't before, this could indicate your metabolism has slowed.

, Your BMI provides an estimate of your percentage of body fat based on the ratio of your weight to your height. To calculate your BMI, divide your weight in pounds by the result of your body weight multiplied by itself, then multiply that number by 703.For example, if you are a 42-year-old woman who is 5'6 (66 inches) and weighs 156 pounds, your calculation would look like this: BMI = (156 / (66 x 66)) x 703. Your BMI would be 25.17.
A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. The normal weight range for middle-aged women is between 18.5 and 24.9. In the previous example, the woman would be considered slightly overweight. A BMI over 30 indicates obesity.
These ranges differ slightly for men and women, and according to age.
You also can find online calculators that will find an accurate BMI for you if you provide your age, gender, height, and weight.
If your BMI indicates that you are overweight or obese, play around with the numbers to find the target weight where you need to be, so you can set goals for diet and exercise.

, Writing down everything you eat each day is the easiest way to determine how many calories you're consuming on a daily basis. You'll need to know this information to determine whether you're consuming more calories than you're burning, which can lead to weight gain.You can look online to find out how many calories are in many different foods. If you're eating packaged food, just look at the nutrition label.
You don't necessarily have to portion out what you eat in exact portion sizes while you're keeping your food diary, but try to estimate as close as possible.
At the end of each day, take a few minutes to add up the calories you consumed that day. You'll need this number to figure out how you should adjust your diet to reflect your metabolic rate.

, Your BMR is the amount of calories your body consumes in a day simply by existing. This is the minimum number of calories you need each day for your body to function normally.To calculate your own BMR, use the Harris-Benedict equation. For women, this equation is 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) – (4.7 x age in years) = BMR. For men, the equation is 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) – (6.8 x age in years) = BMR.
There also are calculators online that will find your BMR for you based on this equation, if you're not comfortable with your math skills.
Keep in mind that any BMR obtained from a mathematical formula is merely an estimate, although it may be a close one. You won't be able to find out your actual BMR without assistance from a medical professional.

, In terms of the number of calories you're actually burning, your BMR only tells part of the story. In reality, you do many activities throughout the day that burn additional calories.Many online BMR calculators will estimate this for you based on an overall characterization of your average daily lifestyle (sedentary, lightly active, active, or very active), the number of days per week you exercise, how long you exercise, and the type of activity you do when you exercise.
If you aren't using an online calculator, you'll have to do quite a bit of work to come up with a good estimate. Figure in the calories you burn exercising as well as the calories you burn doing everyday activities, such as cleaning the house or walking the dog.

, Your TDEE is a combination of your BMR as well as all the calories you burn through activity during the day. There are a number of online calculators that will find your TDEE for you.You may want to plug in different levels of activity to create a range. This can be particularly valuable if your rate of activity differs throughout the week.
For example, you may have a sedentary job that you work five days a week. On those days, you spend most of your time sitting, although you go for walks in the morning and evening. On weekends, however, you're much more active and like to spend a lot of your time outside.

, For this, you'll need to go back and look at your food diary. Generally, if you consume more calories than you burn in a day, you will gain weight. If you consume fewer calories than you burn in a day, you will lose weight.However, that's not the end of the story. Over time, if you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn, your metabolism will slow.
Remember that your BMR basically represents the calories your body needs to burn to exist. If you consume fewer calories than that, your metabolism will slow so that your body can continue to function.

, Some serious medical conditions such as hypothyroidism or Cushing's syndrome can cause your metabolism to slow. If you have an unusually slow metabolic rate, or if your metabolism has slowed significantly in a short period of time, you should consult a doctor.Your doctor will have to take a blood test to measure your thyroid hormone levels to determine whether your thyroid is producing decreased levels of thyroid hormones that are causing your metabolism to slow.
Keep in mind that these are relatively rare medical conditions. However, it's better to rule them out particularly if you believe they might be to blame for your slowing metabolism.
Even if you don't have a medical condition that is causing your metabolism to slow, your doctor may be able to help you get back on track by providing suggestions or advice on how to boost your metabolism.

, Your metabolism often will slow when you diet because you're consuming too few calories. To combat this slow-down, make sure you're consuming at least as many calories per day as your body requires to function normally.The difference between your BMR and the total calories you burn each day represents the range in which you can cut calories to lose weight. If you dip below your BMR, your metabolism will slow and your weight loss will plateau.
If you're dieting, be prepared to do the calculations regularly as your BMR will change when you lose weight. People who are heavier tend to have a higher metabolism than people who are lighter.
This change in BMR may be part of the reason you find it easy to lose weight in the beginning, but then plateau and find it difficult to lose weight the further along in your diet plan you get.

, While fiber may not necessarily boost your metabolism, if you eat more fiber, you'll gain less weight over time. Fiber also may increase how much fat your body burns. Cut out white bread and white rice, which lack the fiber your body needs.Switching to whole wheat bread and pasta and brown rice can up your fiber intake. You'll also increase your fiber by eating more fruits and vegetables.
Try to consume around 25 grams of fiber each day. You can get this fairly easily in three regular servings of fruits and vegetables. Just try to have a fruit or vegetable serving with each meal.

, You've probably heard that you should drink at least six glasses of water a day to keep your body optimally hydrated. Because the water you drink must be warmed to body temperature, drinking ice water burns more calories than drinking lukewarm water, boosting your metabolic rate.According to one study, drinking six glasses (or 48 ounces) of cold water each day increased the participants' metabolic rates by an average of 50 calories.
Even if you change nothing else, this trick alone could allow you to lose up to five pounds in a year.

, Protein is essential to build and strengthen your muscles. If you don't eat enough of it, you'll lose muscle tissue and strength, especially as you get older. Eating protein also increases the number of calories you burn after every meal.Lean meats such as chicken and turkey are good sources of protein. If you're a vegetarian, consume soy products, nuts, and protein-rich vegetables such as spinach.
Protein-rich foods such as lean meats and fish are also often rich in iron, which is an essential nutrient for raising your metabolism and burning fat.

, Maintaining an active lifestyle is one of the surest ways to boost your metabolism. If you consistently burn calories through exercise, your body's metabolic rate will adjust accordingly.Plan on getting at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise every day. This can be as light as a brisk morning walk, or as intense as doing interval training or taking a step-aerobics class.
Make sure you include strength training as well as aerobic exercise. Stronger muscles burn more calories, which also will increase your metabolic rate.
You don't need to strength train as often as you do cardio – 20 minutes two or three times a week is all you need.

, Stress can have a negative effect on your metabolism by elevating your cortisol levels.Your body may also end up holding on to more of the calories that you take in when you are stressed. If your stress is chronic, then this can lead to weight gain, especially around your midsection.


Make sure that you make time in your daily routine to practice stress reduction activities, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga.

If you would have trouble completing a good jog or weight-training session, you may have difficulty clearing your driveway and sidewalk. Upper body workouts like clearing snow actually put more strain on the heart than activities like running or biking.If you have any reason to doubt the adequacy of your fitness level, consult a physician before undertaking snow shoveling. In fact, you may want to check regardless just to be sure.When in doubt, pay someone else to clear your snow. It is far less expensive than a trip to the emergency room.;
, It may seem fruitless to start shoveling in the middle of a snowstorm, but every little bit of snow you clear during the storm is that much less to clear once it is over. Sweeping away one inch of snow six times is much easier on most hearts than shoveling six inches one time.Pacing your work during the snowfall can help you to pace yourself as well. Take frequent breaks while working, say every 15–20 minutes. Warm up a bit, drink some water, replace wet socks or gloves, loosen up your muscles again, and get back to work., Lifting heavy shovels of snow causes blood pressure to spike and makes the heart work particularly hard. Whenever you can, push the snow out of the way with a shovel or broom instead of scooping and lifting it.When there is simply too much snow to push, scoop up small shovel-fulls at a time instead of trying to overload the blade. Think of it as nibbling at the snow instead of taking big bites.

, You probably don’t normally eat a big, heavy meal right before going out for a run, and you certainly don’t go running without having water handy. The same principles apply when preparing to clear snow — and after shoveling as well.


When you are cold, you may not notice your thirst as much as when sweating in the heat; however, you should drink at least as much water as you would while running on a summer day. Your body is losing fluids just the same, and dehydration does your heart no favors.Skip the heavy meals right before or after shoveling. Digesting large meals causes the heart to work harder, and you don’t need to combine that with the extra effort needed for shoveling.

, No matter how cold it is outside, you will work up a sweat while clearing snow. Impermeable clothing will trap moisture and heat inside, causing (depending on weather conditions) either significant overheating or potential hypothermia as your sweat gets cold. Either of these alternatives can exacerbate heart problems.Dress in multiple layers of breathable fabrics like cotton. Shed the outermost layer as needed if you get too warm while working.
While on the topic of proper clothing, remember that your fingers, toes, and nose are the areas most susceptible to frostbite. Keep them dry and covered with breathable layers of socks, gloves, and scarves, especially when temperatures dip well below freezing., Take no chances if you experience pain or discomfort that may indicate a heart attack. This is especially important if you have risk factors for heart disease, like family history, diabetes, smoking, and so on. The cold weather may make symptoms less noticeable at first, so pay close attention to any signals from your body and act immediately.


If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, radiating pain in your arm or jaw area, nausea, or other common signs of a heart attack, call for emergency assistance immediately.

, Think of snow removal as a workout, not a chore. Shoveling snow is like a combination of an aerobic and weight-training session. Prepare your body as you would for that kind of workout before heading out into the snow.Stretch out all the major muscle groups of your body. Shoveling snow utilizes the arms, legs, shoulders, neck, core muscles, and the back. The lower back is particularly susceptible to overexertion or injury while shoveling.

, Don’t just grab whatever shovel you can get your hands on and hit the snow. If the shovel is too big, too short, too heavy, or makes you hunch over or bend down while using it, you are more likely to injure your back and other parts of your body.Find a shovel that allows you to stand up straight while the blade is scraping the ground. Curved shafts and handles may be more comfortable for you. Try out different options before buying one.
You should be able to position your hands at least one foot apart while holding the shovel in your working position. Separating your hands provides better leverage against the weight of the snow being lifted.
A bigger shovel blade is not always better. A smaller blade will force you to work with smaller amounts of snow at a time, which puts less strain on your body.

, You hear it when lifting boxes, lifting weights, and lifting snow: lift with your legs, not with your back. Don’t bend over at the waist and use your lower back to raise the shovel blade full of snow. Instead, bend your knees, keep your back as straight as you can do comfortably, and let your leg muscles to the work.The safest way to lift is not to lift at all. Push snow instead of lifting it whenever possible.
Don’t toss snow back over your head, or twist to throw it to your side or behind you. This is an easy way to strain muscles or wrench your back. Throw snow forward, away from your body, with your feet pointed in the same direction as the toss. Reposition your body as needed.Keep your wrists locked while lifting snow. Lifting with your wrists to take pressure off your back is likely just to transfer pain and/or injury from one spot to another. Use your legs to lift.

, Listen to your body. If your lower back begins to ache, you feel a burning sensation in the back of your neck, or any muscle group gets sore, stop shoveling snow and go inside. Get someone else to finish the job for you.Rest, relax, rehydrate, and see if the pain dissipates. If it doesn’t, contact your health care provider. Severe muscle or skeletal pain, or chest pains or other possible signs of a heart attack, should be addressed immediately.

, If the right shovel is the most important tool for clearing snow, a good pair of boots is a close second. In fact, when prioritizing safety, a comfortable, insulated, water-resistant pair of boots that provide excellent traction may be your best ally.If your preferred boots do not provide adequate traction, look into clip-on snow spikes. A good footing not only prevents slips and falls, it makes shoveling easier.
In icy conditions, employ what is sometimes affectionately called the “penguin walk.” This involves taking shorter steps, but that is not all. Instead of walking with your center of gravity spaced between your forward and rear legs, lean out over your front leg more, shifting the center of gravity forward. This way, you will be supporting your weight over a straight leg planted on the ground, not a leg at an angle., While clearing snow, don’t get so focused on the task that you lose awareness of where you are and what is going on around you. Pay special attention when you are near any roadway. Always be cognizant of any approaching vehicles. Remember that cars are less maneuverable and harder to stop in snowy and icy conditions.It is important to prevent frostbite to your face, but never let scarves, hats, or other clothing impede your field of vision. Your hearing ability may be reduced by earmuffs, a hat, or a snowblower (if you decide to use one), so you need to be able to rely on your eyes even more., If there is simply too much snow for you to shovel safely, or you have listened to your body and know it is time to put the shovel away, a snowblower can be a smart alternative. However, snowblowers are just as dangerous as the lawnmower you use in the summer, and you need to be just as cautious in using one.Always read all instructions and become familiar with the operation of the machine.
Never place your hand inside the mechanism unless the power or fuel supply is cut off, even if the engine is shut off.
Wear ear and eye protection, and get rid of any loose-hanging scarves, etc., that could get caught in the machine.

, Today, the simplest way to be ready in case of a fall or other injury or emergency is to have your cell phone with you while shoveling. Keep it in an accessible spot, not buried within layer upon layer of clothing.Let someone know you will be out clearing snow, and give them an idea of how long you expect to be out. This is especially important if you are working in a less-populated area or at night.

Talk to your doctor.,
Don't take Viagra if you take nitrates.,
Don't take Viagra if you take alpha-blockers.",How to Take Viagra1," You may be a good candidate for Viagra (sildenafil) if you are suffering from erectile disfunction, or the inability to hold an erection long enough to engage in sexual activity. It's important to discuss the medication with your doctor to make sure the drug is a healthy choice for you.


Inform your doctor if you're allergic to any drugs, so that he or she can determine whether you may be allergic to Viagra.Let your doctor know what other medications you're taking, including herbal supplements.;
, Nitroglycerin and other long-acting nitrates used to treat chest pain are contraindicated with Viagra, which can cause the blood pressure to drop to dangerously low levels and lead to a heart attack or stroke., These drugs, which are prescribed for blood pressure and prostate problems, can also cause the blood pressure to drop too low when they are mixed with Viagra.

Weigh yourself.,
Examine the physical pattern of your perceived weight gain.,
Consider sensible dieting if you still have questions about your weight gain.",How to Tell if You Have Water Retention1," Have you suddenly gained a significant amount of weight — like more than five pounds in one day? While overeating and lack of exercise can produce weight gain over time, gaining several pounds overnight is a sure sign of water retention.


Check your weight at various times of day, keeping a record over a period of several days. If your weight fluctuates significantly over the course of one or a few days, these fluctuations are more likely due to water retention than to actual weight gain.Remember that for women, the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle can significantly impact water retention. If your waist has swollen a few days before your period, it's highly likely this swelling will disappear within a day or two of starting your cycle. Reevaluate toward the end of your period.;
, If you are normally a slim person, do you see less muscle definition? This is an additional sign of fluid accumulation., Remember that weight loss takes time; you will need to give this process several weeks. Trimming your caloric intake and upping your activity level should produce at least some weight loss; if it doesn't, water retention is a likely culprit.

A broken foot will be overwhelmingly painful to walk on. Boots will often mask the pain of a break by providing a degree of support; removing them after a suspected fracture is the best way to diagnose the injury.;
, This will help you determine if your foot is broken, as you can compare your two feet side by side.If you cannot get your shoes and socks off, even with the assistance of someone else, you should go to the nearest emergency room or call 911. Your foot is likely broken and requires immediate medical care. Cut the boot and sock off before swelling damages the foot.

, Check if your injured foot is swollen, as well as the toes on that foot. You can also compare your injured foot with your healthy foot to see if it appears very red and inflamed, or has deep purple and green bruising all over it. You may also notice open wounds on your injured foot., You can also try to determine if the foot is sprained or broken. Sprains occur when you stretch or tear a ligament, which is the tissue that connect two bones together. Breaks are a fracture or complete break of the bone.Look for any bones sticking through the skin, or any areas of your foot that appear misshapen or at an unnatural angle. If there are any bones sticking out or your foot appears deformed, it is likely broken., If your injured foot appears to be broken, you should head to the nearest emergency room. If you are alone and no one can assist you, call 911. Do not drive yourself to the emergency room if you have a broken foot.Any broken bone can cause shock, which makes it too dangerous for you to drive yourself.


If someone is able to drive you to the emergency room, you should try to stabilize your foot so it is secure while you are in the car and does not move around. Use a pillow and slide it under your foot. Secure it with tape or tie it to your foot so it helps your foot to stay upright. Try to keep your foot elevated as you travel; sit in the back seat to elevate your foot if you can.

, The doctor will press on several areas of your foot to determine if your foot is broken. You may feel some pain as she does this, which is an indicator that the foot is broken.If your foot is broken, you may feel pain when the doctor presses on the base of your baby toe and at the mid-foot. You may also be unable to take four or less steps without assistance or without significant pain.

, If the doctor suspects you have broken bones in your foot, she will do an X-ray on your foot.However, even with an X-ray it can be difficult to determine if your foot is broken as swelling can obscure the fine bones in the foot. Using an X-ray, the doctor may be able to identify which bones in your foot are broken and how they can be treated.

, The treatment options for your broken foot will depend on what bones you have broken in your foot.If you have broken your heel or fractured your heel, you may require surgery. As well, if you have broken your talus, which is the bone that attaches your foot to your leg, you may require surgery. But if you fractured your little toe or other toes, you likely do not require surgery.

, Once your broken foot is treated by a doctor, you should focus on staying off your foot as much as you can. Use crutches to get around and make sure you put your full weight on your arms, hands, shoulders, and the crutches, not on your foot.


If you have a broken toe or toes, your broken toe may be taped to its neighboring toe to keep it from moving. You should put no weight on your broken toe and give it six to eight weeks to heal fully.

, Put your foot on a cushion in bed or on a high chair when sitting so it is higher than the rest of your body. This will help to keep the swelling down.


Icing your foot can also reduce swelling, especially if it is in bandages, not a cast. Apply the ice for 10 minutes at a time, re-applying every hour for the first 10 – 12 hours of the injury.

, Your doctor should give you pain relievers or recommend over-the-counter pain relievers you can use to help manage the pain. Only take them as prescribed by your doctor or as specified on the label.

, Most foot fractures take six to eight weeks to heal. You should schedule a follow up exam with your doctor once you are able to start walking and putting weight on your foot. Your doctor may recommend you use a rigid and flat-bottomed shoe to help your foot heal properly.

Take initiative to bring up the topic of weight.,
Ask the right questions.,
Talk to your doctor about any setbacks you might be having.,
Ask your doctor for clarification when necessary.",How to Talk to Your Doctor About Gaining Weight1," Doctors are often hesitant to bring up a patient's weight, as it's a sensitive topic and patients sometimes take offense at being confronted about weight.Even if your doctor is concerned, they may hesitate to raise the issue; therefore, do not be afraid to address it yourself.


It can be intimidating to bring up the subject of weight. If you've gained weight recently, you may feel insecure or embarrassed. Try to remember you should put your health first.
Make an appointment specifically to talk about your weight, or you mention at the end of an appointment that you would like to make a follow up specifically to talk about weight. This is a sensitive issue and should be given the time it deserves, not just tacked on at the end of your appointment.
If your doctor doesn't want to make it a priority for a visit, find a new doctor.;
, You want to leave your doctor's office having a full understanding of the impact of weight gain on health, the reasons you're gaining weight, and steps you can take to reverse the process. Make sure to ask thorough, probing questions when discussing weight gain with your doctor.Weight gain can increase your risk for a lot of health issues, so make sure your current health is okay. Ask your doctor if your blood pressure was normal and whether they recommend any tests, like checking your cholesterol levels, to assess your overall health.
You should also ask your doctor whether you need to lose weight. Ask about how to cultivate a healthier lifestyle through exercise and healthy eating.
Ask about your risk factors as well. If you've put on weight, you'll increase your risk of certain health problems. If you have a family history of things like heart disease, you may have a greater risk of developing medical complications due to weight gain. You should talk this over with your doctor.

, People who find it difficult to lose weight or challenging to maintain a healthy weight may have obstacles preventing them from losing. It is important to explain any setbacks to your physician in order for the doctor to make informed recommendations. If your weight gain is very recent, and you have not undergone any major lifestyle changes, it may be a medical issue. Let your doctor know if your weight gain is inexplicable. Say something like, ""I've gained 20 pounds in the last month and a half, but I'm not eating different or exercising less."" Make note and mention any other changes in your body, mood, or sleep, as this will help uncover other reasons for weight gain.
Your doctor may want to test for something, like a thyroid disorder, to try to determine the cause of your weight gain.
Medication can also sometimes cause weight gain. Bring up any new medications you're taking. They may be the culprit of your weight gain. Your doctor may suggest a different type of medication or adjust your dosage.
You may be struggling to maintain a lifestyle that allows for a healthy weight. If this is the case, let your doctor know. For example, ""Since my divorce, I've been struggling with self motivation and, honestly, I've been drinking a lot. I know I need to stop, but I can't seem to get back on track."" Your doctor may refer you to a therapist in this situation in order to help you manage stress in a healthier fashion.

, It's very important you and your doctor understand one another. If you're struggling to follow the conversation, do not hesitate to ask a question. Your doctor is invested in keeping you healthy, so they will be happy to clear up any confusion.Your doctor may use medical terms you do not understand, or terms you're not entirely familiar with. You can stop and ask a question when necessary. For example, ""Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt, but can you explain BMI to me? I'm not completely sure what it means.""
You also may have questions regarding some of your doctor's suggestions. If you're not sure how to make the lifestyle changes your doctor recommends, ask for more specifics. For example, ""I'm fine cutting back on sugar, but what do you mean 'watch out for hidden sugars'? How can I do that? What are sugars listed as on food labels?""
If your doctor is not receptive to your questions or isn't taking your concerns seriously, then this is not the right doctor for you. Find someone who will take the time to explain things to you and answer your questions.

Moderate side effects of Viagra include:Redness and heat in the neck and face
Headaches
Stuffy nose
Memory problems
Upset stomach or back pain

, In some rare cases, Viagra causes side effects dangerous enough to merit a trip to the doctor. If you experience one of these symptoms, stop taking Viagra immediately and call your physician:An erection that is painful or lasts 4 hours or longer

"
Examine your hands, legs, ankles, and feet for signs of swelling.,
Consider whether your rings are fitting more tightly than they used to.,
Check to see whether your socks are leaving a ring around your legs.,
Push down upon any swollen areas with your thumb and then release.,
Look in the mirror and evaluate whether your face appears swollen.,
Consider whether your joints feel achy.",How to Tell if You Have Water Retention2," The outer reaches of your blood circulation system are also the outer reaches of your lymphatic system. As a result they are the most likely regions to suffer physical signs of water retention.

, Suddenly ill-fitting rings are a sign of swollen hands. Wristwatches or bracelets may offer similar clues, though finger swelling is an especially common sign of fluid retention.

, Sometimes this is caused by the fit of the sock rather than by any physiological factor, but if your normally well-fitting socks are leaving marks, your legs or ankles may be swollen.Suddenly ill-fitting shoes present another important indication of leg and/or ankle swelling.

, If the indentation remains for a few seconds, you may have pitting edema, which is one type of water retention.


Bear in mind that there is also a non-pitting form of edema that will not produce this result. You may still be retaining water even if your flesh does not ""pit."" , Puffiness or swelling, or skin that appears stretched or shiny, can be an additional sign of water retention. Under-eye puffiness is especially common., Focus upon areas where you are experiencing swelling and/or pitting. Stiff or aching joints, especially in your extremities, are an additional sign of fluid retention."

Assess your surrounding environment.,
Evaluate your recent activity level.,
Assess your diet.,
Review your most recent menstrual cycle.,
Rule out serious medical conditions.",How to Tell if You Have Water Retention3," If it is a very hot day, your water retention may be caused by the heat. This can be especially true if you have been active in hot weather and your fluid intake has been low. While it may seem like a paradox, drinking more water will actually help you flush out excess fluids. High altitude may also cause you to retain water., Standing or sitting in the same position for too long may have caused fluid to pool in your lower limbs.Long airplane flights or sedentary work can cause your body to retain water. Get up and move around at least once every two hours, or perform exercises such as flexing your toes back and then stretching them forward if you find yourself stuck on a long flight., Excess sodium intake often leads to fluid retention. Obesity can also stress the lymphatic system and produce water retention, especially in your body's extremities.Take a close look at food labels to ensure sodium isn't ""hiding"" in foods you haven't suspected of being salty.

, Are you reaching the mid-point or end-point of your monthly cycle? If you are a woman, this may be the most common reason for retaining water.

, While your water retention is likely caused by one of the factors listed above, it can also be a sign of more serious medical problems, including poor heart or kidney function, such as congestive heart failure and renal failure.


If you are pregnant and experience a sudden change in water retention, contact your doctor immediately. Water retention can be a symptom of preeclampsia, a condition that involves serious maternal health risks."

Raise the topic yourself.,
Keep a journal with your observations about your health.,
Ask questions.,
Ask for clarification if you don't understand something.",How to Talk to Your Doctor About Gaining Weight2," Weight is a sensitive issue, and doctors often hesitate to discuss it with their patients.You may have insecurities of your own regarding your weight. If you feel you need to gain weight, do not hesitate to raise the topic. You need to put your health over your insecurities.


While you may be nervous, keep your mind on your health. Unwanted weight loss can be a symptom of a variety of medical ailments, including serious conditions like cancer.If you're unable to gain weight, you want to discuss this with your doctor as soon as possible.
Make an appointment with your doctor to specifically discuss your weight. At the appointment, you can say something like, ""I've noticed I've lost about 10 pounds this month, and I think I'm a little underweight at this point. I'm struggling to put weight back on, and I wanted to talk to you about potential reasons for that.""

, There are a lot of roadblocks that may be preventing you from putting on weight. Before the appointment, try keeping a daily journal detailing your eating habits, your moods, your sleeping habits, any medications or supplements you are taking, exercise, and any new or unusual symptoms you may be having alongside your weight loss. This information can help your doctor determine why you are unable to gain weight or point them toward certain tests to run.


You might notice, for example, that your appetite has decreased since you started a new medication. Your doctor, in this scenario, may be able to switch to a different medication or adjust your dosage.
Let your doctor any extenuating circumstances affecting your weight. For example, ""I've just been so stressed lately I feel physically sick. It gets to the point where I stress vomit after I eat."" With an issue like this, your doctor may refer you to a therapist to help you better manage your stress.
If you are having difficulty gaining weight, tell your doctor what you've been eating and about any other issues you may be having, including night sweats, rapid heartbeat, fatigue, and change in menstrual cycle if you are a woman.

, Go into the appointment with a list of questions prepared. You want to make sure you understand how to gain weight in a healthy fashion, and know any potential reasons you're struggling to gain.


Ask your doctor if they think you need to gain weight. While you may be unhappy with how you look, your doctor may think your current weight is healthy. If your doctor thinks you need to gain, ask them for suggestions on healthy ways to do so.
You should ask your doctor if your issues with weight could be caused by an underlying health condition. Your doctor may want to take a brief medical history and conduct some blood work to rule out an underlying health problem.
Ask about your current health. Make sure things like your blood pressure and cholesterol levels are healthy.

, Your doctor may use medical terminology you do not understand. They may also go over lifestyle changes too quickly for you to follow. If you're unsure of something your doctor is saying, ask. It's vital you leave the conversation knowing exactly what the game plan is from here.You may not completely understand something your doctor is saying if they use jargon. It's okay to stop and ask for clarification. For example, ""I understand your testing my thyroid levels, but I'm not sure I understand why. Can you explain what a thyroid disorder is again?""
You also want to make sure you fully understand any recommendations your doctor offers. If you're confused about something, stop your doctor and say something like, ""Sorry, but can you please explain to me how to best count calories. I've never really completely understood and I just want to make sure I follow your recommendations properly.""
If your doctor is not willing to go over this information with you, then think about switching to a doctor who is.

Speak honestly to your physician about your medical history.,
Talk over your present eating habits.,
Speak honestly about your lifestyle.,
Discuss any life stressors you may be dealing with.",How to Talk to Your Doctor About Gaining Weight3," Many patients make the mistake of not being totally honest with their doctor regarding medical history. Medical issues that cause weight gain or weight loss are often related to mental health, and patients may feel embarrassed bringing them up. In order to reach your goal of gaining or losing weight, however, you must be upfront about everything and remain truthful.If you suffer from an eating disorder, disclose this by saying, “I have been suffering from anorexia for about five years now, and I really want to get better."" Other mental health issues can make you gain weight. For example, ""I have bipolar depression, and sometimes I have trouble getting out of bed and exercising. I usually gain some weight during a depressive spell.""
It can be uncomfortable discussing mental health problems with a doctor and a not a therapist or psychiatrist, but keep in mind your health is crucial. It's important your doctor know your full medical history, including mental health. Your mental and bodily health are connected, so leaving out crucial information about your mental health may make it harder to diagnose the cause.

, Your doctor will want to discuss your eating habits to determine what your caloric intake is and what it needs to be in order to put on weight or lose weight. Make sure you talk over how often you eat, the items you consume, and any other eating habits.


Before the appointment, keep a food diary tracking the foods you eat, how much you eat, how often you eat, and the approximate number of calories you eat per day. You can do this with pen and paper or download an app onto your smartphone. Make note, too, of your moods when you eat. You may find, for instance, that you eat more when you are lonely, bored, watching TV, etc.
Discuss things such as your meals per day, snacks consumed throughout the day, allergies to particular foods, if you generally eat alone or with other people, the types of food you like and dislike, and so on.
Other things that may be important to discuss: who is doing the shopping and cooking; how often do you through drive-thru and why (work, kids, busy, etc.); are there financial barriers or considerations; who else is at home and impacted by any food change recommendations; any cultural factors that have to do with diet (such as fasting).
Do not withhold information. If you have poor eating habits, you may be embarrassed to disclose them to a doctor; however, remember that nothing is more important than your health. It's vital that you overcome embarrassment and answer your doctor's questions honestly.

, Lifestyle is a major factor when it comes to weight loss or gain. You want to be honest with your doctor about lifestyle, even if you feel embarrassed. Do not say you go running regularly if your running schedule is, at best, sporadic. Conversely, if you worry you push yourself too hard at the gym, say so. Admit you sometimes feel physically ill after a workout.


Let your doctor know how much you exercise. If you do not exercise at all, say so. If you work out two hours a day, admit to this as well.
You should be honest about other lifestyle factors your doctor may ask about. If you drink frequently, let your doctor know. If you smoke cigarettes, you should be open about this as well.
If you are gaining weight, you may need to exercise more; however, excess exercise can be unhealthy for very slender people looking to gain weight. Too much exercise can also substantially decrease muscle mass.

, Many factors can affect a person’s weight and their ability to put on or lose pounds. Strains that you face on a daily basis, or trauma you may have experienced, can directly affect how you gain weight. Speak with your doctor about life stressors to learn whether or not they will have an effect on your ability to put on or lose weight. You may not be comfortable opening up emotionally to your doctor. Keep in mind you don't have to share intimate details, but you can give vague assessments of your current stress level. For example, you can say something like, ""Things have been really rough at work lately.""
If you've made any lifestyle changes due to stress, let your doctor know. For example, ""I have been hitting the gym a lot harder lately since getting laid off. Working out is kind of my outlet.""

See if you need any medical testing.,
Report any medications you are currently taking.,
Report your family history.",How to Talk to Your Doctor About Gaining Weight4," Some conditions and diseases can have a great effect on someone’s ability to gain, lose, or maintain a healthy weight. Your doctor may want to test for certain conditions if you're struggling with unwanted weight gain, or are struggling to gain weight.Hyperthyroidism is a condition that can speed up your metabolism because it causes your thyroid gland to produce an excess amount of the hormone thyroxine. This may cause you to be unable to gain weight. If you're having weight issues, you doctor may want to do a blood test to check your thyroid level.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a relatively common condition that can cause weight loss due to excessive diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems, resulting in weight loss or the inability to maintain weight. Your doctor may want to test for IBS if you're having issues with your weight in conjunction with other symptoms of IBS.

, Be sure to tell your doctor about any regular use of medications, as this may contribute to unintentional weight loss. Certain medications may also cause you to gain weight.Migraine medications, heart medications, antidepressants, and diabetes medications can all affect weight. Let your doctor know if you're taking any of these types of meds.
Also, talk to your doctor about any non-prescription medications or supplements you take. If you're taking some kind of vitamin or over-the-counter pill, it could interact with prescription medication. This may contribute to weight issues.

, Your doctor will want to know about your family medical history to determine if any hereditary factors exist that could affect your weight. Share any and all information relative to weight. If there's a history of obesity, thyroid problems, eating disorders, or other weight-related issues in your family, inform your doctor of this.

If you are, you may not be able to take this test.Your doctor may recommend an alternate test, like a stool test.;
, You may need to stop medications up to four weeks before the test is administered. Always talk to your doctor first before stopping any prescription or over-the-counter medication.

Stop taking antibiotics and any medications containing bismuth (such as Pepto Bismol) two to four weeks before the test.
Stop taking proton-pump inhibitors, such as Prilosec or Nexium, two weeks before the test.You may be asked to stop taking histamine (H-2) blockers, such as Zantac or Pecid, six or more hours before the exam.Consult with your doctor.

, Food and liquids can affect your test results, so it is important to fast for an hour before the test. Do not eat or drink anything, including water.Your doctor may recommend fasting for a longer period of time, such as six hours or overnight.Your doctor should tell you the right amount of time to fast.

While you should not drink any fluids, it is ok for you to brush your teeth as long as you don't swallow any water, mouthwash, or toothpaste.You should also avoid smoking during this period."

Think about why you want to take CLA.,
Get the right variety of CLA.,
Buy a high-quality brand.",How to Take CLA Supplements1," There are number of claims made by people who manufacture and distribute CLA supplements. The primary reason people buy CLA is to lose weight. But CLA has also, in some studies, been linked to the prevention of heart disease, reduced likelihood for diabetes and various cancers, and stronger bones., There are several versions of CLA which vary at the molecular level. Evidence suggest that the most effective one contains the trans-10, cis-12 isomer (an arrangement of atoms). Trans-10, cis-12 CLA is sometimes stylized on supplement packaging or in medical articles as t10, c12 CLA. Use this type of CLA when possible.If you’re unsure what isomer a certain CLA supplement contains, ask the nutritionist at your local health store for assistance. They might have more information about the product.
CLA supplements are made in two basic ways. Some are manufactured through chemical processes, while others are made using animal products like beef or dairy. In some cases, the supplements will be made of a combination of both methods. But these manufacturing methods don’t affect how effective the CLA is., Only purchase a brand of CLA that is respected. Many brands of supplements are not properly labeled and include ingredients other than those on the label. Ask doctors for a recommendation. Friends interested in good health might also be able to suggest CLA supplement brands they prefer. One sought-after and reputable brand is Tonalin.Tonalin brand CLA is readily available from major nutrition stores.

Let the doctor know if you are pregnant or breast feeding., Your doctor will give you either a pill or drink that contains urea. You can drink it or swallow the pill with water. Your doctor will instruct you to wait for the substance to spread through your body. This waiting period is usually between fifteen to thirty minutes., You will blow into a special straw. Your breath will be collected into a bag or tube, where the molecules will be tested for H. pylori. Follow the doctor’s or technician’s directions for this step.Once you have finished, you are done!"
"
Wait for the test results.,

Follow your doctor’s treatment plan.,
Get retested four weeks after treatment.",How to Take the Urea Breath Test3," You will usually get your test results about two days after you take the exam.This can vary, however, based on the lab the breath samples were sent to. Continue to follow your doctor’s guidelines during this time.

If the test comes back positive, it means that there are H. pylori present in your digestive tract. Visit your doctor for follow up treatment.
If your test comes back negative, it means that H. pylori was not detected.Return to your doctor. They may give you other tests to diagnose what is causing your symptoms.

, Your doctor may want to do other tests to see if there is a H. pylori infection or to check if your symptoms could be caused by another underlying condition. Other tests that are commonly done include blood tests and stool tests.

If your doctor suspects that you have ulcers as a result of H. pylori, you may need to get an endoscopy. This is a procedure in which a tube is inserted through your esophagus to view into your upper digestive tract., If you have a H. pylori infection, your doctor may recommend that you take one or two different antibiotics. They may also prescribe a medication to reduce stomach acid. These medications might include:

A proton-pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec, Nexium, or Prevacid.
A H-2 blocker, like Tagamet or Zantec.
Bismuth subsalicylate, more commonly known as the brand name Pepto-Bismol., Once you have finished your round of treatment, your doctor may recommend being retested. This test will check to see if you have gotten rid of the H. pylori or if more treatment is needed. You can take the test again four weeks after you finish treatment."

Recognize the symptoms.,
Be familiar with the purpose of a throat culture.,
Understand possible complications.,
Ask if your patient used mouthwash or antibiotics.,
Use a tongue depressor.,
Perform a throat swab.,
Administer a rapid antigen test.,
Prepare swab for the laboratory.,
Analyze the culture.,
Prescribe antibiotics to cure strep throat.,
Encourage patients to embrace home remedies.,
Prevent further strep infection.",How to Take a Throat Culture," In general, the signs and symptoms of a throat infection include: pain, difficulty swallowing, red and swollen tonsils with patches of white pus streaks, swollen and tender lymph glands, fever, and rashes.A person could have many of these symptoms and still not have strep throat because viruses can also have the same symptoms as bacterial infections.
Be aware that it is still possible to have bacteria that cause strep without having a sore throat, which makes the person a “carrier.” Carriers have bacteria in their mouths, but it does not make them sick yet. They can unknowingly pass the bacteria to others through sharing utensils, cups, etc.;
, The primary purpose of performing a throat culture is to determine whether a throat infection is viral or bacterial. The bacteria that cause strep throat, Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A Streptococcus) is highly contagious and are easily passed between people.People are susceptible to the bacteria from airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing, shared food and drink, and even from surfaces such as door knobs and handles by transferring them from the surface to your skin, nose, mouth, or eyes.
Strep throat can occur any time but most often in the late fall and early spring. Strep is most often seen in children between the ages of five and fifteen.

, Although strep is not generally considered dangerous, some more serious complications could occur even with treatment. The spread of infection to the sinuses, tonsils, skin, blood, or middle ear is perhaps the biggest concern.Group A Streptococcus. This bacterium is responsible for many conditions, including scarlet fever, strep throat, or rheumatic fever.

Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a fungus, which can cause thrush, an infection appearing in the mouth and in the surface of the tongue. It sometimes can travel to the throat (or other locations), causing infection and can occur after treatment of strep throat.

Bacterial meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus can cause meningitis, a serious and potentially deadly disease that causes inflammation in the brain.People can reduce the chances of getting meningitis by getting vaccinated.
If bacteria are identified, you can perform a sensitivity or susceptibility test, which is a test that will show you what antibiotic will be more efficient against the pathogen.

, If you are preparing a patient for a throat swab you should ask him if he used mouthwash or antibiotics because either one could influence an inaccurate culture from removing bacteria.If the patient is confused why it is not a good idea to remove bacteria from the infected area explain to him that removal from the immediate area does not mean that the infection is cured. Indeed, he may still be a carrier and failure to detect the infection will prolong the period of infection, possibly infecting others.
Inform the patient that this is a relatively painless procedure and does not require any special instructions once the tests are concluded.
Other questions you can ask your patient are: “What symptoms have you noticed, and how severe are they?”, ""For how many days?"", ""When did it start?"", ""How has it progressed?"", “Have you experienced a fever the last couple of days?”, and “Have you been in contact with anybody who has had strep throat recently?”

, In order to check for redness, swelling, and especially for white streaks or pus on the tonsils, you must use a tongue depressor to get a good look at the tonsils and throat.You should also try to detect signs of a strep throat: fever, white or yellow spots that coat the lining of the throat, bright and dark red spots near the throat, and swollen tonsils.
A visual exam of the throat and tonsils cannot determine whether the signs and symptoms are bacterial or viral; therefore, further testing will be needed.

, Once signs and symptoms have been detected, you will have to perform a throat swab to check for the presence of bacteria, including streptococcal bacteria. A throat swab is done to collect any bacteria that exist for a throat culture to determine if the infection is caused by a virus or by bacteria. The result will determine the treatment.Using a sterile cotton swab, touch the infected area with the swab with several strokes to collect any pathogenic or bacteria for a microbiologist to analyze.
Be careful not to touch the tongue, uvula, or lips due to possible contamination.
This should not be a painful procedure but expect your patient to gag since you will touch the back of her throat.
Prepare the swab for transportation to the laboratory for analysis. Always label the sample with patient name, date of birth, and patient ID.

, This test is usually only performed in an emergency or with children because it can provide immediate feedback on the swab sample.This test detects strep bacteria within a few minutes by revealing substances (antigens) from the throat. Once located, antibiotic treatment can begin immediately.
The downside to this test is that due to its rapid analysis some strep throat infections are misdiagnosed; therefore, it is a good idea to proceed with a culture, especially if the antigen test shows a negative result.

, Inoculate the culture with the sterile swab and carefully place it into a collection container. If you need a quick strep test or a strep screen, use a red Duo-Swab in transport media. Otherwise, place the culture in a blue Amies transport media for a throat culture.


Make sure you label the transport media correctly or there could be confusion over the proper procedures for treatment, leading to serious complications.
The collection container should arrive at the laboratory within 24 hours for proper analysis.

, The culture should be placed in a candle jar and incubated at 35–37° C (95–98° F). You should leave the jar in the incubator for at least 18 hours.After 18–20 hours, take out the jar and examine the bacteria (content beta hemolytic) colonies. If you find any trace of a colony, the test is positive, and the patient suffers from a bacterial infection. It will need further examination to determine just what bacteria are present.
If nothing will grow in the container, the test is negative. If the test results are negative, the patient might suffer from a viral infection, caused by pathogens like Enterovirus, the Herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Chemical tests or microscope exams will need to be performed in order to find what type of infection is affecting the patient. Remember, viral infections are not treatable with antibiotics. Viral infections require time and rest for the body to fight infection using its own immune response.

, Antibiotics are the most common treatment for strep throat. Antibiotics will reduce the duration of the symptoms and help prevent the spread of the infection to others.Penicillin is the most common. It can be injected or taken orally.
Similar to penicillin is Amoxicillin. This drug is more often given to children because it is readily available as chewable tablet or liquid suspension.
If your patient is allergic to penicillin some alternatives are: cephalexin (Keflex), clarithromycin (Biaxin), Azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax), or Clindamycin.
The patient should feel much better and no longer be contagious between 24 and 48 hours.
Make sure the patient understands that, even if he feels better, it is essential that he complete the full course of antibiotics. He should take the pills as directed until they are all gone. This prevents a resurgence of the infection and/or developing an antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

, In most cases, antibiotics will effectively remove the bacteria causing discomfort. At the same time, lifestyle adaptations and home remedies can alleviate the symptoms.


Rest and relaxation will help fight the infection. Advise your patient not go to work or school for 24 hours after starting treatment, since strep throat is highly contagious. After 24 hours a patient being treated with antibiotics should not be contagious.
Drinking lots of water will keep a sore throat lubricated and ease swallowing. It will prevent dehydration from the antibiotics as well.
Gargling with warm salt water relieves throat pain. Make sure the patient does not swallow. She can also gargle hydrogen peroxide (dilute one capful of hydrogen peroxide in a cup of warm water).
A humidifier will add moisture to the air easing discomfort from dried out mucous membranes.

, Remember strep infections are caused by mobile bacteria from coughs, sneezes, or even touching infected surfaces. Advise your patient to do the following:Wash hands to eliminate the transfer of bacteria from surfaces to the eyes, mouth, and nose. Make sure to use warm soap and water for about fifteen to twenty seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Cover his mouth and nose with his elbow when sneezing or coughing.
Avoid touching his face, especially his nose, mouth, and eyes.
Avoid sharing drinking glasses, eating utensils, or toys with children who have strep throat.

Consult a physician before you take CLA.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Try a natural alternative.",How to Take CLA Supplements2," Pay a visit to your doctor and inform them that you intend to begin a regimen of CLA supplements. Your doctor will be able to evaluate your health and determine if you would benefit from CLA or if you are at elevated risk for certain negative side effects. Your doctor might also be able to recommend more effective and practical alternatives to taking CLA based on the health outcomes you’re interested in.


If you have diabetes, a heart condition, hypertension, or are pregnant or breastfeeding, you probably won’t be able to take CLA supplements.
Depending on your other medications, your doctor might also discourage you from taking CLA.

, CLA supplements offer few if any benefits in a weight loss program. While some CLA ads might offer overnight weight loss, or weight loss based exclusively on popping CLA, these are only messages designed to get you to buy the CLA supplement. The only effective way to lose weight is through a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet.Most of the research into CLA has been done on animals. The degree to which these results translate to humans is questionable or unknown.

, CLA has many potential side effects. Instead of taking CLA supplements, you might consider instead consuming the animal products from which CLA is often derived. Lamb has the highest concentration of CLA per gram of fat, followed by cow’s milk, butter, cottage cheese, and ground beef.It is important to consume only grass-fed meat if you want to get the benefits of natural CLA. Animal products produced by the factory farm industry will not have adequate levels of CLA because their diet does not allow them to produce it in sufficient quantities."
"
Always follow your doctor's advice and consult manufacturer directions.,
Look for side effects.,
Don’t take CLA supplements instead of medication.,
Don’t take too much.",How to Take CLA Supplements3," The manufacturer should provide directions for use and information about how to store and consume your supplement. Your supplement will probably be a small tablet or capsule that you need to take with water. The instructions label might also feature a chart that provides information about how often to take the supplement.Your doctor’s instructions and knowledge of your own health should supersede any recommended intake advice provided by the CLA manufacturer.

, There are a number of side effects associated with CLA supplements. These mostly include flu-like symptoms such as watery stools, vomiting, nausea, and general lethargy and fatigue. You might also experience headaches, dizziness, constipation, and/or hives (a kind of rash in the form of small, red bumps on the skin).Clinical symptoms include higher levels of cholesterol, an enlarged liver and/or spleen, increased risk for diabetes, and reduced nutritional value in breast milk.Most people report that the side effects subside after about two weeks of regular use., Some people believe that supplements are an acceptable alternative to medication. However, medications receive far more testing and evaluation than do unregulated supplements like CLA. Medications are prescribed by a doctor, and carefully dosed in order to provide you with the right amount. CLA supplements cannot substitute for doctor-prescribed medications.

, CLA supplements come in different concentrations. Some supplements are 500 milligram (mg) tablets, others are 1,000 mg tablets. Research suggests that the average person needs no more than 3-4 grams of CLA per day. So if your supplement is 1,000 mg, you could take it three times per day and meet your daily CLA intake goal."

They typically have searchable directories of licensed attorneys that you can use to find someone with the expertise and experience you need.If you have any friends or relatives who have recently been involved in similar lawsuits, you might ask them if they would recommend the attorney they used.
However, keep in mind that every case is different, and just because a particular attorney worked well for someone you know doesn't mean they'll work well for you.
You also can find attorneys by using a private online directory service. These services often provide profiles of attorneys as well as reviews from clients.
Focus on attorneys who have experience in medical malpractice as well. Your state's medical malpractice statute may provide a cause of action for medical privacy violations.
Once you have a list of attorneys, visit their websites to learn more about their practice areas and experience.;
, Before you speak to any attorneys, you should construct a summary and basic timeline of what happened and how you believe your medical privacy was violated. You also will need to be able to identify the individuals or entities you allege violated your medical privacy.Doctor-patient confidentiality is protected by state law. That confidentiality is breached if your private medical information is disclosed to a third party without your consent. You would use this theory to sue for a medical privacy violation if your doctor was the person who disclosed the information.
In other situations, such as if the information was disclosed by an employee of your health insurance company, you might sue for invasion of privacy. An invasion of privacy lawsuit also would be appropriate if the information was revealed publicly.
To prepare for your initial consultations, you should have as much information as possible regarding who disclosed your information, when, how, and to whom.

, Since many attorneys are willing to take cases involving invasion of privacy on contingency, you typically can get a free initial consultation. Talking to several attorneys allows you to compare and contrast to find the best attorney to handle your case.Based on your research, you should be able to come up with at least two or three attorneys near you who have experience in medical privacy law. Call their offices and schedule an initial consultation, leaving at least an hour for the meeting itself plus reasonable travel time.
If the attorney requests specific information about you or your case before the appointment, make sure you send the correct documents well in advance of the date the consultations is scheduled so the attorney has enough time to prepare for the interview.
You also should come prepared with a list of questions for the attorney. Especially with free consultations, this initial meeting may seem more like a sales pitch for the attorney than a discussion of your case.
Ask questions about the attorney's experience, practice, and work habits, focusing on what would be important to you in a close working relationship.
For example, if it's important to you that your emails or phone calls are answered promptly, you will want to ask the attorneys questions about their communication style and how promptly they respond to queries from clients.

, After you've interviewed several attorneys, assess your needs and your goals for your lawsuit. Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the attorneys to determine which of them is best able to meet your needs and fulfill your goals.While you want to use the attorney who has the most experience and knowledge of medical privacy violations, it's also important for you to be comfortable with the attorney as a person.
By nature of the lawsuit itself, you will have to talk about private matters with your attorney. The best attorney for you will be someone with whom you're comfortable and at ease, even if he or she has less experience than another attorney you've interviewed.
Once you've chosen the attorney you want, call the others and let them know you've decided to go with someone else.
Meet with your chosen attorney as soon as possible and get a retainer agreement in writing. Often attorneys will handle medical privacy lawsuits on contingency, but you need a breakdown of exactly what percentage of any award or settlement the attorney will take, and how he or she will account for court costs and other expenses.

, The complaint is the document you will file with the court to start your lawsuit. It identifies you and the people or entities you're suing and contains a list of factual allegations that constitute a violation of a law that entitles you to monetary damages.The biggest difficulty with lawsuits for medical privacy violations is proving damages. Your attorney will need documentation such as medical bills or receipts, mental health counseling bills, and lost time from work.
If the violation was such that you were compelled to purchase credit protection or identity theft insurance, those costs also can be included in your damages.
While you don't need to include any of this documentation with the complaint itself, your attorney will want to include a figure for damages that he or she can defend if challenged.
Your attorney also will work with you to figure out who you need to sue. While an individual person may have been responsible for disclosing your private information, it's likely that person was employed by your doctor, or by a hospital or health insurance company. Typically the person's employer would need to be named as a defendant as well.

, Once your complaint is finished, you and your attorney must take it to the clerk of the court you want to hear your lawsuit. The clerk will file your complaint and assign your case to a judge.The clerk will charge a filing fee of several hundred dollars for your lawsuit. If your attorney is working on contingency, they'll pay those fees and add them to the expenses that will be taken from any settlement or award.
Typically you will receive a file-stamped copy of the complaint for your records. Keep this and all other court documents related to your case in a safe place.

, After you've filed your complaint, it must be delivered to the people or entities you're suing so they have sufficient legal notice of the lawsuit against them and the opportunity to respond.Your attorney will take care of the service. Typically a sheriff's deputy hand-delivers a summons and a file-stamped copy of the complaint to the individual or the designated agent of the healthcare provider you're suing.
The summons tells the defendants how long they have to respond to the lawsuit and where they should file their response.

, After the defendants are served with your complaint, they have a limited period of time to file a written response to your lawsuit with the court – typically 20 or 30 days. They may file an answer which responds directly to the allegations in your complaint.In a medical privacy violation lawsuit, you can expect the answer to deny most, if not all, of your allegations. If the answer is coming from a business entity, such as a health insurance company or a hospital, it may state that the defendant lacks sufficient information to either admit or deny the allegations. This response is treated by the courts as a denial.
When a defendant denies the allegations in your complaint, this means you must prove that the facts contained in the allegation are more likely than not true. On the other hand, if a defendant admits an allegation, that means you don't have to prove it at all.
Don't be surprised if your defendants also file a motion to dismiss, or a motion for summary judgment. These documents ask the court to rule that even if all the facts contained in your complaint are true, they don't add up to anything for which you can sue and get money.

, Upon receipt of your complaint, the defendants may send you an offer to settle the case without going to court. If the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, they typically will wait until after that motion is heard by the judge.If you sued under your state's medical malpractice law, your doctor would be covered by his medical malpractice insurance company. Insurance companies often send a settlement offer as soon as they receive a complaint, in an effort to get rid of the case as quickly as possible.
Keep in mind the initial settlement offer probably will be very low. It might even be a fraction of the amount you've demanded in your complaint.
Your attorney will advise you on whether you should accept, decline, or counter the offer – but keep in mind the final decision is yours alone.

, Through interrogatories and requests for production, both parties have the opportunity to exchange written answers to questions and copies of documents related to the lawsuit.The defendants most likely will send interrogatories to your attorney that you will have to answer. Your attorney will go through these questions with you and discuss the responses.
Because there also are legal responses – for example, your attorney may object to certain questions as beyond the scope of the lawsuit – your attorney typically will prepare the written answers after talking to you.
Particularly if you've named a healthcare or insurance company as a defendant, any requests for production sent by your attorney may result in mountains of documents that must be sifted through to find possible evidence.

, The other aspect of the discovery process consists of live interviews which are conducted under oath in the presence of a court reporter. You (through your attorney) ask parties and witnesses about their actions and knowledge of the facts in your case.In particular, you will want to depose the individual who was directly responsible for disclosing your private information and violating your privacy. You want them on record regarding the disclosure and their knowledge and understanding of the fact that they were violating your privacy, or disclosing the information without your knowledge and consent.
The defendants also may want to depose you regarding your understanding of the disclosure and the damages you suffered as a result.

, Throughout the course of pretrial litigation, the parties may file motions to ask the judge to rule on various aspects of the case, such as to order one party to produce documents or evidence.As the plaintiff, you typically don't have to attend scheduling conferences, or hearings that relate to purely procedural motions. Your attorney will send you a letter summarizing what happened.
If a motion is filed at any time that requires your presence in court, for example to testify, your attorney will let you know.

, In mediation, a neutral third party facilities a discussion with the parties in an attempt to reach a settlement. Many courts require civil litigants to at least attempt to resolve their dispute through mediation before a trial is scheduled.Healthcare providers and insurance companies may prefer mediation because the process is confidential. A public trial can be damaging to the company from a public relations standpoint, and also can inspire other potential plaintiffs to file similar lawsuits against them.
However, you should keep in mind that mediation also is a voluntary process. Even if participation is mandated by the courts, it is not mandatory that you arrive at a settlement.
In the event you are able to settle the claim, the mediator typically will write up the terms of the settlement in a written agreement that will be signed by all parties.
Once signed, the settlement agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract.

, If you are unable to reach settlement independently or through mediation, a trial will be scheduled for you to present your case to a judge or jury. You must work with your attorney to build your case and develop a strategy.In most cases, your attorney will prefer a trial by jury. Particularly in medical malpractice and medical privacy violation lawsuits, jurors will be far more sympathetic to you than they will be to the defendants – particularly if you're suing a large insurance company.
Your attorney will meet with you several times to go over what you can expect at trial. If you will be testifying, your attorney likely will practice with you the questions you'll be asked, as well as possible questions you could be asked by the defense attorneys on cross examination.
Keep in mind that even if you were unable to settle your case in mediation, the defendants may continue to make settlement offers, especially as the trial date draws closer.

Learn about the structure of the thyroid hormone.,
Learn about the types of thyroid hormones.,
learn about the chemical characteristics of this hormone.,
Thyroid hormone is secreted by cells of the thyroid gland in response to a stimulation that it receives from the thyroid stimulating hormone.,
Learn about hyperthyroidism.,
Learn about the physiology of this hormone.,
One of the effects of the thyroid hormone is on carbohydrates metabolism in the body.,
All these effects that were mentioned earlier are probably directly related to the increased rate of enzymes synthesis by the effect of the thyroid hormone on all cells of the body.

,
In addition to its effect on carbohydrates metabolism thyroid hormone has an effect on lipids metabolism inside the body.,
The increased rate of metabolic reactions in the body by the effect of the thyroid hormone makes increased requirement for cofactors and vitamins in the body.",How to Study the Functions of the Thyroid Hormone in Humans," Thyroid hormone is a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine. It has iodine atoms attached to it. Therefore, its biosynthesis requires iodide ions that must be supplied in the diet in the form of tablets. Otherwise Goiter can result in individuals that are deprived of iodine in their diet. In the United States usually table salt is supported with a supplementary amount of iodine to ensure healthy function of the thyroid gland.;
, There are two types of thyroid hormones that are obtained from each other by biochemical conversions. These are called: thyroxine and tri-iodo-thyronine. In thyroxine there are four iodide atoms attached to the hormone while in tri-iodo-thyronine there are only three iodide atoms. Most of the thyroxine hormone in the cells is converted to tri-iodo-thyronine in a biochemical process which involves the removal of one iodine atom from thyroxine. Therefore, the most dominant form of the thyroid hormone is tri-iodo-thyronine.

, Both of these forms of the thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. Therefore, they can penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane readily. Their receptors are located inside the nucleus and they exert their effect by increasing the rate of proteins translation or the synthesis of proteins in the cell.

, Thyroid hormone secretion is under a positive feedback control from the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of the pituitary gland. Namely, high concentration of TSH stimulates high secretion of thyroid hormone and low level of thyroid stimulating hormone leads to low secretion of thyroid hormone.

, Usually in states of hyperthyroidism in which there is excessive secretion of the thyroid hormone, there is in the blood little of the thyroid stimulating hormone. Also in the case of hypothyroidism in which there is deficient secretion of the thyroid hormone to the blood circulation elevated level of TSH are observed in the blood of affected individuals. Both of these effects that are observed in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are direct result to the negative feedback control of the thyroid hormone on TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone.

, Thyroid hormone unlike other hormones in the body does not have a specific target organ to act upon. Instead it acts in a universal manner in which its effect is done on all the cells of the body. Its action increases all aspects of metabolism inside the body. In this sense, it has similarity to the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine as far as the increase in metabolic rate in the body is concerned.

, Thyroid hormone increases all aspects of sugar metabolism including the uptake of glucose by cells in the liver and it increases th rate at which glucose is synthesized by the process of gluconeogenesis. Also the thyroid hormone increases the rate at which compounds are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.

,, Lipids, under the effect of the thyroid hormone are promptly mobilized from fats tissue and are readily metabolized in the liver. The thyroid hormone decreases the level of cholesterol in the blood. In addition, it decreases the level of the phospholipids also.

, This is so due to the increased activity of enzymes in the body by the effect of the thyroid hormone. For example, the increase in glucose metabolism in the body due to the effect of thyroid hormone renders a need for more of the hormone insulin to speed up the uptake of glucose by the liver cells.

Define intracranial pressure.,
Study the causes of intracranial pressure.,
Be aware that high intracranial pressure is more clinically significant than low intracranial pressure.,
Study the types of herniations possible in the brain.,
Know how to treat intracranial pressure.",How to Study Intracranial Pressure in Humans," Intracranial pressure can be high or low. Low intracranial pressure can be caused due to low volume of the cerebrospinal fluid inside the ventricles. This can happen due to a leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles through the meningeal membrane.;
, Other causes of low intracranial pressure besides leakage include surgery, which can break the integrity of the ventricular walls. In addition, it can occur as a result of lumbar puncture of the spinal cord for withdrawing some amount of the cerebrospinal fluid for examination of a neurological disease. The clinical picture of low intracranial pressure is a headache with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.


Intracranial pressure can be due to a tumor in the choroid plexus of the ventricles which is a rare condition This tumor can obstruct the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid between the ventricles. Congenital obstruction to the foramina between the ventricles can cause also an obstruction to the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. This type of obstruction is called non-communicating hydrocephalus. It can lead to high intracranial pressure.
Remember that other causes of high intracranial pressure include hydrocephalus or dilatation of the brain ventricles. Dilatation of the brain ventricles due to excessive amount of the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles can be due to an obstruction to the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid between the ventricles.
The other cause to the dilatation of the ventricles is called communicating hydrocephalus. This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired re-absorption of the cerebrospinal fluid in the sagittal sinus of the brain. This can be so due to damage to the arachnoid villi where the re-absorption takes place by chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid.

This type of hydrocephalus is called communicating obstruction to the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid between the ventricles. It can in turn cause ventricles dilatation and subsequently lead to high intracranial pressure.



, It can happen as a result of several reasons:


One reason is intracranial tumour or mass such as glioma or it may be due to subdural hematoma.
Liver failure can predispose to intracranial swelling with accompanying intracranial pressure.
In addition, hypertensive encephalopathy can cause intracranial pressure.

, Between the two hemispheres of the brain, there is a membrane that separates them and which is called the cerebral falx. A herniation of part of the brain can occur through this membrane in the direction of the other part. This can happen in the case of intracranial pressure which has a source either as a mass or a tumour or due to hydrocephalus.


Between the cerebellum and the cerebrum there is another membrane which separates these structures from each other. This membrane is called the cerebellar tentorium. The temporal lobe of the brain can herniate through this membrane through the cerebellar falx. This can compress the other structures in the brain. The most affected parts of the brain due to this compression are cranial nerve III or the oculomotor nerve. This nerve supplies parasympathetic innervation to the several structures. One of them is the pupil of the eyes. Its dysfunction leads to abnormal dilatation of the pupils of the eyes. It compresses in addition the mid-brain leading to coma due to involvement of the reticular formation of the brain stem which is responsible for maintaining consciousness. The posterior cerebral artery is also compressed by this type of herniation leading to ischemia and infarction.
Herniation can also occur through the foramen magnum which is the passage of the spinal cord. It is a rare condition which involves compression of the respiratory center in the medulla. This can lead to pain in the cervical region in addition to abnormal breathing patterns and to coma.

, The treatment to this type of intracranial pressure is by surgery to remove the mass or tumor or by drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid in the case of hydrocephalus. High intracranial pressure is a medical emergency. It presents with headache and ataxia due to the involvement of the cerebellum. In addition it presents with coma and confusion and also papilledema.

Learn about the importance of the hormone cortisol.,
Cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex is under a negative feedback control in which its excess in the blood inhibits the secretion of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone.,
Know about the functions of cortisol.,
People who administer cortisol as an anti-inflammatory agent can develop diabetes if the administration of the hormone is for along time such as occurs with people under a constant requirement to take this hormone as a supplement due to its deficiency in the body.,
Learn about the main disorders that involve cortisol.,
The second cause of cushing syndrome is excessive secretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland itself or due to ectopic secretion of this hormone by a malignant tumour in the body.,
The other cause is ectopic secretion of this hormone which can be caused for example due to a malignant tumour of the lungs.,
In addition to these two causes which involve secretion of the ACTH in excessive amount to the blood circulation by the pituitary gland and which is called cushing disease, the adrenal cortex itself can undergo pathological condition in which a tumour of the adrenal cortex can oversecretes cortisol causing symptoms of cushing syndrome.

,
The adrenal cortex can have adenoma or carcinoma which are possible causes of oversecretion of the hormone cortisol.,
The other disorder which involves cortisol is addison's disease or hypocortisolism.,
Addison's disease is manifested by increased secretion of ACTH which is oversecreted due to the lack of the negative feedback that cortisol usually makes on the secretion of ACTH.,
This is caused due to the secretion of melanocytes stimulating factors by the pituitary gland the thing that increases the pigmentation of the skin.",How to Study and Understand the Diseases Which Are Associated With the Hormone Cortisol," Cortisol is a very important steroid hormone which has many physiological functions in the body that are related to homeostasis of body tissues. This hormone is secreted by the adrenal gland in its cortical area in response to stimulation by the adrenocorticotropic hormone which is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in response to stimulation from the hormone corticotropin releasing hormone which is secreted by the hypothalamus.;
, Cortisol has many functions in the body so that its disorders are manifested clinically by many symptoms.

, Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory compound which usually functions by suppressing cells of the immune system. It is usually prescribed by doctors to treat inflammatory reactions such as allergies. Also cortisol has an important effect on glucose level in the blood. Its excess in the blood can cause a state of hyperglycemia with the development of diabetic symptoms in the affected individuals.

, Also cortisol can have an effect on blood pressure in the sense that its excess can increase the blood pressure due to the increased metabolic rate in the body that cortisol enhances.

, There are two main disorders which involve the hormone cortisol. These are: cushing syndrome and Addison's disease. Cushing syndrome is by definition a medical condition in which cortisol is excessive in the blood. This can have several causes. One of them is the result of administration of cortisol as a supplement for various reasons such as to treat inflammatory conditions of the skin for example. This is called iatrogenic cushing syndrome.

, The first cause that is related to increased secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland can be caused for example due to an adenoma of the gland which oversecretes this hormone.

, The net result in both of these two conditions is the excessive stimulation of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete cortisol to the blood circulation with its concomitant symptoms of obesity and other symptoms.

,, This occurs in up to 20% of all patients with cushing syndrome. Adenoma is more common in females more so than in males.

, This is primarily a disorder of the adrenal cortex in which it occurs due to an autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex by circulating antibodies. Also tuberculosis is another possible cause to this disorder. The autoimmune cause is however the main culprit to this disorder.

, Also one of the signs of addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in areas where the skin creases.

, Also this condition can sometimes cause hypoglycemia and decreased blood pressure due to the usual effect that cortisol makes.

Define nephrotic syndrome.,
Study the form of the kidney.,
Study the functions of the kidney.,
Study the function of antidiuretic hormone.,
Learn about the hormone aldosterone.,
Understand the function of the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide.,
Be familiar with the causes of nephrotic syndrome.,
Study the progress of nephrotic syndrome.,
Understand which systemic diseases that can cause nephrotic syndrome.",How to Study the Medical Condition of Nephrotic Syndrome," The nephrotic syndrome is not a medical condition by itself but is rather a collection of medical symptoms associated with a kidney disease or a systemic disorder that has as one of its manifestations the nephrotic symptoms.;
, In order to understand the nephrotic syndrome, one needs to have some basic information about the structure and function of the kidney tissue. Without a properly functioning kidney, one would not be able to survive due to the importance of the kidney in maintaining homeostasis of the body.


Study the anatomy of the kidney. The kidney is comprised of a capsule and a cortex in addition to a medulla. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron which is available in thousands of units in the kidney.
Study the structure of the nephron. The nephron in turn is composed of two parts. These are: the glomerulus and the collecting tubules. The glomerulus of the nephron is the site where damage to the kidney occurs in the nephrotic syndrome. The glomerulus is composed of epithelial kidney cells which are called podocytes. In addition, there are the basement membrane and arteriolar endothelium.

, Usually the kidney functions by filtering small molecules in the glomerulus and then reabsorbs part of them in the kidney tubules such as glucose. The filtration of compounds in the glomerulus is by diffusion in the case of water but occurs in other cases by active transport.


Large molecules such as proteins are not usually filtered in the glomerulus due to the existence of a physical barrier that prevents the passage of large molecules through the kidney basement membrane.
The filtration of water in the kidney is, on the other hand, possible due to its small size. Water secretion in the urine and blood volume is governed by three important hormones. These are the antidiuretic hormone or ADH and aldosterone and atrial natriuretic hormone.

, ADH is secreted to the blood circulation from the posterior pituitary gland in response to high blood osmolality or due to hypovolemia or low blood volume as occurs in hypotension or shock. Its secretion stimulates the conservation of water in the kidney tubules.

, Aldosterone is another hormone which functions to regulate water level in the blood indirectly by stimulating the conservation of sodium ions in the tubules along with water which passes with it in a diffusional process.

, Atrial natriuretic peptide is the third hormone which also function by removing excess water from the blood. It is in this sense an antagonist to both aldosterone and ADH. Atrial natriuretic hormone is secreted by the heart cells in response to hypervolemia.


Normally the urine that is filtered in the kidney glomerulus contains water and urea in addition to waste products of the metabolism in the body.

, Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by several medical conditions that are specific to the kidney tissue but also can happen as a result of a systemic disease such as lupus erythematosus:


The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the presence of proteins in the urine a process which is called proteinurea. It happens due to the escape of proteins in the glomerular wall to the urine.
In systemic diseases such as lupus erythematosus, this happens due to autoimmune disorders which destroys the glomerular integrity. This contributes in turn to the escape of proteins by filtering it.

, After continuous protein escapes from the glomerulus, a state of hypoproteinemia occurs. This leads to low oncotic pressure in the blood which can lead to edema or accumulation of water in the extracellular compartment. Also, due to fluid and electrolytes depletion a state of hypovolemia occurs. Thus, ADH and aldosterone begin to be secreted to restore the blood volume and sodium level to its normal state.


In addition to hypoproteinemia and proteinurea, there is also accompanying hyperlipidemia or increased levels of lipids in the blood. This condition occurs probably due to increased synthesis of lipoproteins in the liver and other body tissues.
In addition to hyperlipidemia, there is also lipidurea due to the success of lipids to escape to urine through the damaged glomerulus. The damage to the glomerulus permits proteins and lipids in addition to other large molecules to be secreted in the urine.
In the nephrotic syndrome there is no escape of red blood cells in the urine. Usually, the little red blood cells escape in the urine through the glomerular basement membrane. In the nephritic syndrome, however, there are massive red blood cells escaping into the urine, which distinguishes it from the nephrotic syndrome.

, Systemic diseases and in particular those with autoimmune origin such as lupus erythematosus cause the nephrotic syndrome by damaging the glomerular integrity. This happens by depositing immune complexes in the basement membrane of the glomerulus. This contributes to its increased permeability which eventually leads to filtration of large molecules in the urine such as proteins and lipids.

Learn the basics about MS. One of the first steps to helping your partner is to learn as much as possible about the disease and its effects.,
Ask your partner’s doctor about your partner’s form of the disease.,
Prepare yourself for common physical symptoms.,
Be aware of common psychological and cognitive issues.,
Install handrails and make adjustments your home.,
Consider hiring an occupational therapist to help with cognitive problems and mobility issues.,
Create a care schedule.,
Be prepared for your relationship roles to change.,
Maintain communication with your partner.,
Focus on strengthening your relationship, physically and emotionally.,
Take time for yourself.,
Join a support group.,
Take an MS caregiver learning course.,
Consider hiring a professional caregiver.",How to Support a Partner with Multiple Sclerosis," Generally, MS occurs in adults between the ages of 20 and 40, though the first symptoms can appear as early as 15 years old. The disease affects twice as many women as men. Though MS is not hereditary, some people are genetically predisposed to the disease. Children who have parents with multiple sclerosis have a 3% to 4% chance of developing the disorder. Recent studies show MS may be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that trigger an autoimmune response in a person who is predisposed to the disease. This can then cause the person’s body to attack its own cells.Recent medical research on MS has been making great strides, and today there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease and reduce the duration, severity, and number of MS attacks. Other treatments are currently being developed and much scientific research has been put into enhancing the quality of life for people with MS and into finding a cure for the disease.;
, There are four common forms, or courses, of MS and your partner’s level of care will depend on the course of MS they have. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and progressive disease so your partner’s course may change or shift from the time they are diagnosed by their doctor. The four more common forms, or courses, of MS are:Relapsing-remitting: This is the most common form of MS. It is a cyclical form of the disease, in which the person experiences attacks (also known as relapses or flare-ups), followed by recovery periods or remission periods.
Primary-progressive: In this form, the disease progresses from no recovery periods or a few recovery periods, with only temporary or minor improvements. The progression of the disease may be fast or slow over a period of many years.
Secondary-progressive: This form is similar to the relapse-remitting form. After several years, the disease may become progressive, with very few remissions or relapses.
Progressive-relapsing: In this course, the disease progresses soon after the diagnosis and the person will experience acute attacks. It is a relatively rare form of MS.

, Once your doctor identifies your partner’s course of MS, ask them about common symptoms of the disease as a whole. The more information you have about your partner’s daily life with MS, the more you can support your partner and be a good caregiver to them.One of the major symptoms of MS is extreme fatigue. Fatigue caused by multiple sclerosis requires a longer rest period than ordinary fatigue. MS fatigue is different from common sources of fatigue, such as from hard work, depression, tension, or weak muscle tone. Other symptoms of MS — like a reduced or lost sensation in the limbs, numbness, cognitive problems (like memory loss and lack of concentration), as well as physical and mental pain —can further aggravate this fatigue.
Your partner may also experience impaired balance and dizziness. They may be at risk of falling or losing their balance when standing, which will be worsened further by fatigue.
Your partner may have bladder dysfunction, which can cause them to wake up during the night or have difficulty going out for fear of being unable to control their bladder. Bladder dysfunction can also lead to urinary tract infections, which can further limit their mobility and ability to socialize. Up to 75% of patients suffer from bladder dysfunction and some suffer from bowel dysfunction as well.
As the disease progress, your partner may have difficulty walking. They may experience muscle weakness, balance issues, coordination issues, or fatigue and pain when standing or moving. Spasticity is also a problem in patients with MS — this is the tension or stiffness of muscles that are held in the flexed position.
Eye movement abnormalities are a hallmark of the disease. This includes difficulty with gaze, nystagmus, and abnormalities in eye movements. Nystagmus is the rapid, involuntary movement of the eye. This can lead to double vision in patients with MS. Some patients even suffer from vision loss due to optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve.
If your partner is a woman, she may experience hormonal issues due to disruptions in her menstrual cycle. This could then affect her mood and lead to depression or anxiety.

, In addition to the physical symptoms of MS, your partner may experience symptoms that affect their cognitive abilities and their mood.Your partner may experience cognitive issues, like memory problems — specifically short-term memory failure. Cognitive issues can be exacerbated by fatigue or depression, so it is important to manage these issues. Depression may be more common in patients with MS than in other patients with chronic medical problems.
Many people with MS also struggle with depression, triggered by fatigue and exhaustion. Your partner may experience mood changes, anxiety, or stress due to the disease. They may also have a loss of appetite, weight loss or weight gain, and insomnia or lack of sleep.

, Depending on your partner’s form of MS, you may need to prepare your home for at home care for them. This may mean installing support systems like handrails and guardrails throughout your home, as well as wheelchair-accessible ramps and areas.You may also need to use a shower stool to help your partner bathe. Talk to your doctor about other physical adjustments you can make to your home to make it easier for your partner to get around. Your doctor can also refer you to an occupational therapist who can do a home walk through and recommend adjustments like widening doorways, installing guardrails and ramps, and making renovations to the kitchen or the bedroom., Hiring an occupational therapist (OT) to visit once a week, or for bi-monthly sessions, can provide you with strategies to help your partner adjust to cognitive issues like memory loss. The OT can also give you methods to prevent your partner’s mobility issues for getting worse and techniques for helping your partner get around.The OT may recommend that your partner adapt a consistent daily routine and use calendars or other time markers to help with memory issues.

, Daily care of your partner may require giving injections and medications, cooking for both of you, cleaning the living space, helping your partner bathe and helping your partner to get around. This amount of responsibility can be daunting and overwhelming, especially in the face of a progressive disease. Create a daily schedule for you and your partner to give your days a sense of routine and balance.This may mean eating and cleaning at the same time every day or giving injections and medications within a certain time period. As your partner’s support, a care schedule can also allow you to provide excellent care for your partner and not succumb to stress or anxiety in the process.
If there are other members in your household who can help you, delegate certain tasks to each person. Someone may be responsible for household tasks like cleaning, shopping, cooking, laundry, and transportation. Or you may share care-related tasks like dressing, bathing, eating, exercising, taking medication, and going to doctor visits. It’s important to also make time for recreational activities, like exercise, entertaining and socializing with your partner, and private time apart from your partner.

, As your partner’s caregiver, you will need to accept that the traditional roles in your relationship are going to shift. Most partners will be more than willing to be supportive and nurturing to their partners, but caregiving should never shift into self-pity or total self-sacrifice. Being a good caregiver does not mean sacrificing all your needs and desires for the sake of your partner’s illness. This can lead to an imbalanced relationship that lacks boundaries and is too interdependent.Both women and men who act as caregivers to their partners face the same daily responsibilities and challenges. But female caregivers may feel more comfortable in a supporting role than male caregivers, as caregiving is traditionally viewed as a more feminine role. Research has shown that male caregivers have difficulty discussing their own personal struggles with their partner’s disease and repress their emotions. They also are more hesitant about asking for help or using the resources available to caregivers.
Female caregivers are also more likely to neglect their own health for the sake of their ailing partner and do not take enough independent time to themselves. They can suffer from emotional and physical stress due to taking on too much of their partner’s care.

, Though you may want to shelter your partner from your own personal struggles, avoid staying silent or holding in your emotions. Be honest and practice open communication with your partner. This will show that you respect your partner and are committed to maintaining your partner-to-partner relationship. Your relationship with your partner will evolve as a result of the disease and you will both need to adapt to this reality. Rather than let the disease drive you both apart, or relegate you both into the role of caregiver and ailing patient, focus on sharing the struggles of living with this disease together.Many partners who act as a caregivers may wonder “Why doesn’t anybody ask how I am?” It can be difficult to give so much of your time and energy to your partner and you may start to feel invisible or unrecognized. Don’t be afraid to talk to your partner about your feelings of being ignored or forgotten. You may feel guilty for expressing these emotions but this guilt can lead to resentment, which can have a negative impact on your relationship with your partner.

, Research shows that at least 80% of women with MS struggle with their sex lives, from low sex drive to painful genital sensations to an inability to orgasm. Men with MS can also suffer from erectile difficulties, ejaculation issues, and a reduced libido. Start a conversation about sexual issues with your partner and approach these issues with openness and honesty. There are drugs and treatments available that can help you both with sexual issues, as well as information or advice from your partner’s doctor or from a sex therapist. Sexual dysfunction due to MS can be broken into three types:Primary sexual effects: These are related to neurological changes caused by MS. This can lead to a loss of sex drive, decrease genital sensation, and an inability to orgasm.
Secondary sexual effects: These occur as a result of other symptoms of MS, like bowel or bladder issues, fatigue, muscle spasms, tremors, or difficulty concentrating.
Tertiary sexual effects: These are related to the psychological impact of the disease, from changes in self-esteem or body image to depression and mood swings.

, A big risk for caregivers is burning out due to overwhelming responsibilities and challenges day in and day out. It’s important to set aside time for yourself to do activities or hobbies you enjoy doing. Make arrangements for someone to stay home and care for your partner at least one hour a week to allow you time to yourself. Keeping yourself happy and fulfilled through other things outside of your caregiving responsibilities will allow you to also remain fulfilled when taking care of your partner., There are many organizations that offer different levels of support for caregivers, including support groups. Look for an MS caregiver support group in your area or online. You can also ask your doctor for any known support groups in your area.


Joining a support group will help you get advice and guidance from others who understand what you are going through and who are going through it with you.
A list of care partner support organizations can be found here.

, To get more information on MS, as well as strategies to provide great care for your partner with MS, consider enrolling in a caregiver course. These courses are geared toward partners and family members who are encountering MS for the first time and are working to support someone they love who has MS., As MS is an unpredictable and progressive disease, you may find the responsibilities of taking care of your partner beyond your capabilities or expertise. Most individuals with MS require full-time care and you may not be in a position mentally, emotionally, or financially to devote yourself fully to your partner’s needs. Talk to your partner’s doctor or an occupational therapist about hiring a professional caregiver for your partner.Professional caregiving may be covered by your healthcare provider, and there may be funding available to help you pay for the cost of a caregiver. Talk to your healthcare provider or your local MS chapter for more information.

Protect your ankle.,
Make sure to get plenty of rest.,
Ice your ankle to relieve pain and swelling.,
Compress your ankle for 48 to 72 hours after injury.,
Keep your ankle elevated.,
Do not apply heat to your ankle.,
Avoid drinking alcohol for 72 hours after your injury.,
Do not run or try to do other physical activities.,
Do not massage your ankle.",How to Strengthen Your Ankle After a Sprain1," During the first 72 hours after your injury, you need to keep your ankle as protected as possible to reduce the chances of injuring it further. If you have a medical boot or a splint lying around, put it on your ankle. You can also learn how to make your own splint by clicking here. After the 72 hours have passed, you can start to rehabilitate your ankle (See Method 2).


If you have crutches from a previous injury, use them to get around rather than trying to walk on your injured leg.;
, Along with protecting your ankle, you need to let it rest. The only way that your ankle will begin to recover is if it doesn’t have any more pressure put on it. Sit on the couch or lie in bed and let your body start repairing your ankle. When you are immobile, your body can focus on fixing the injured parts of your ankle.Take a couple of days off work or school and catch up on your favorite TV show while your ankle begins to heal. If you have to go to work or school, use crutches to get around so that you don’t use your ankle to walk.

, You should ice your ankle as soon as you can after you injure it. The cold temperature of the ice reduces the amount of blood to the area so your ankle won’t hurt as much and the swelling will go down. Make sure to ice your ankle for no shorter than 10 minutes and no longer than 30 minutes. Any time under 10 minutes will have little effect, will any time over 30 minutes could actually damage your skin.Use an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel. Do not apply ice or an ice pack directly to your skin as it could burn your skin and cause frostbite.

, Wrap your ankle in a bandage to keep swelling down and to limit your ankle’s movement. You can use whatever bandage is on hand, though elastic bandages and tubular compression bandages are the most commonly used to compress a sprained ankle. To learn how to properly wrap an ankle, click here.

, Keeping your ankle elevated can also help to relieve swelling and speed up the healing process. Whenever you sit or lie down, prop you ankle up. Doing this helps because when you ankle is elevated, less blood will flow into the area and cause it to swell.To do this, you should either sit in a chair or lie down in your bed:


In a chair: Prop your ankle up so that it is above your hip.
In your bed: Prop your ankle up so that it is above your heart.

, Heat has the opposite effect as ice does in the first 72 hours after your injury; heat will actually make more blood flow to the area, causing further pain and swelling. Because of this, its important to avoid heat for the first 72 hours after you get injured. Do not soak in a bath or hot tub and do not put a hot pack on your ankle.After 72 hours have passed, you can begin to put some heat on your ankle to help it start loosening up so that you can try some strengthening exercises.

, While drinking a beer or a glass of wine to forget about the pain may be all you want to do, you need to try to avoid alcohol for the first three days after you sprain your ankle. Alcohol can actually slow down your body’s healing process and cause your ankle to swell and bruise further., While you might want to jump right back on to that playing field or go for a run to let off some steam, it is really important that you avoid physical activity for at least three days after your injury.If you try to exercise before your ankle has had time to heal, you could very well injure your ankle further and have to spend even more time recovering.

, Massaging your ankle can increase the amount of bruising and swelling in your ankle. You should wait at least 72 hours before you begin to rub your ankle. However, after those 72 hours, gently rubbing your ankle can help it to regain its movement."

Avoid the bathroom cabinet.,
Don’t keep tablets in the fridge.,
Don’t keep them near the oven or the sink.,
Consider keeping vitamins and supplements in the bedroom.,
Use an airtight container.",How to Store Vitamins and Supplements1," People often store vitamin and supplement tablets in their bathroom cabinets. Research has shown, however, that the humidity of bathrooms can lessen the effectiveness and potency of vitamin tablets over time. The degradation of vitamins in humid conditions is known as deliquescence.


This decreases the quality and shelf-life of the product, and could mean you're not getting all the nutrition you paid for.
In addition, opening and closing vitamin and supplement bottles in a humid area traps a little bit of moisture into the bottle each time.
Some vitamins might be especially prone to degrade in humid conditions, such as the water soluble vitamin B, vitamin C, thiamine, and vitamin B6.;
, Vitamins and minerals may degrade in quality if you store them in the fridge. There is a lot of moisture inside your fridge, so although it is cool and dark, it is not dry. Only store vitamins and supplements in the fridge if the label specifically tells you to., The kitchen can be a good place to keep your vitamins and supplements, but there can often be moisture and vaporized fat in the air from cooking, which can settle on your pills. The temperature and humidity in the kitchen rises and falls as you use the oven and stovetop.


The kitchen sink is another area that will produce a lot of moisture.
Look for a dry cupboard away from the stove and sink if you want to keep them in the kitchen., Your bedroom is perhaps the best place to store supplements, because there are few fluctuations in humidity, and the bedroom is usually cool and dry.Make sure to keep them away from open windows and sunlight, which will degrade their potency.
Don’t keep them near a radiator or any other source of heat.Always keep them safe and secure, and out of reach of children and pets, even if they are in a childproof container.

, To help avoid moisture, you can keep your vitamins and supplements in an airtight container. Do not take them out of their original packaging, but put the whole package in the airtight container.


An opaque container is good, but you can also use an amber or tinted one. These darker containers can also protect the supplements from light."

Learn what is hypersensitivity.,
Know the mechanisms by which hypersensitivity occurs.,
Learn about hypersensitivity type I.,
Know the disorder which arise from hypersensitivity type I.,
Know what is anaphylaxis.,
Learn about hypersensitivity type II.,
Know about hypersensitivity type III.,
Learn about hypersensitivity type IV.",How to Study and Understand How Hypersensitivity Occurs," Hypersensitivity is a disorder of the immune system. It is defined as overreaction of the immune system to a foreign antigen. This reaction results in harming the body cells. There are four types of hypersensitivity and some authorities include a fifth type but will discuss only four types here. Three of them are mediated by humorous immunity or by secretion of antibodies. The fourth type is cell mediated.;
, The mechanism of hypersensitivity in all forms involves initial exposure to a sensitizing antigen which elicits a primary response that is called sensitization. The immune system is activated approximately one week after the initial exposure. Any subsequent exposure to antigens following the first sensitization triggers hypersensitivity.

, Type I hypersensitivity causes the production of immunoglobulin E. This type of hypersensitivity occurs within minutes of the exposure to the antigen. The antigen attaches itself to the surface membrane of mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposure to the antigen causes degranulation of the mast cells and basophils. These granules contain vasoactive compounds such as histamines and serotonin which can cause vasodilatation and increased permeability of blood vessels. In addition it can cause smooth muscles contraction. Type I hypersensitivity is characterized by the secretion of immunoglobulin E and vasoactive compounds. In addition, eosinophils during this process secrete specific enzymes such as arylsulfatase and histaminase that can neutralize the action of histamine and leukotrienes. This in turn ameliorates in this way the effect of hypersensitivity reaction caused by this type of allergy.

, Disorders that can arise from type I hypersensitivity can affect the skin causing reddening and swelling of of the skin. It can also affect the nose, causing allergic rhinitis and hay fever. It can also affect the lungs causing allergic asthma. It can also affect the intestine, causing muscles contraction and diarrhea.

, Anaphylaxis is a type of hypersensitivity that is part of type I hypersensitivity. The increased secretion of vasoactive compounds causes smooth muscles contraction and vasodilatation in addition to vascular permeability. It can lead to edema and low pressure or shock. The shock can be treated with the administration of epinephrine.

, Hypersensitivity type II is typified by a reaction between an antibody and an antigen on the surface of a body cell causing its killing. Some types of this hypersensitivity can cause hemolysis due to the destruction of platelets by the immune system. It can also cause a destruction of neutrophils by the immune reaction. This leads to susceptibility to infection.

, Type III hypersensitivity occurs as a result of an interaction of an antibody with an antigen that can form an immune complex either at the site of injury or in the circulation. Examples of diseases that are triggered by this type of hypersensitivity include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in which the immune complex is deposited in the basement membrane of capillaries in the glomerulus of the kidney. Another example of a disease that is triggered by an immune complex is lupus erythematosus.

, The last type of hypersensitivity that we discuss here is type IV hypersensitivity. It is a delayed hypersensitivity that occurs after an exposure to the antigen in 3-4 days. Type IV hypersensitivity is mediated by cellular immunity rather than by humorous immunity. It is mediated by T-lymphocytes that can act directly on the host cell or through the secretion of lymphokines. An example of a disease that is caused by this type of hypersensitivity is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In this disorder there is a direct T cell action against the antigen on the host cell which is the thyroid epithelial cells in this disorder. This interaction can lead to the destruction of the thyroid tissue.

Reduce your fluid intake to 2L in the 24 hours before treatment.,
Avoid eating foods that contain a lot of sugar.,
Reduce your portions to half their normal size the day before dialysis.,
Limit your salt intake in order to control blood pressure.,
Avoid taking any medications before the treatment, unless your doctor advises it.,
Manage your stress levels to avoid increasing your blood pressure.,
Stay away from coffee and other caffeinated beverages.",How to Stop Headaches and Vomiting During Dialysis1," Reduce your fluid intake to no more than 2 liters (0.5 US gal) during the 24 hours before the dialysis treatment.


Dialysis removes excess fluids from the body, so if there is a large quantity of fluid in your system, a large quantity fluid will be removed during the treatment.
When too much liquid is removed from your system very quickly, it causes your blood pressure to drop, leading to headaches, nausea and vomiting. Therefore, having a lower level of fluid in your system will help to prevent this from happening.;
, In the day leading up to the dialysis treatment, it is recommend that you avoid eating foods or consuming drinks with a high sugar content, such as candy, chocolate, donuts, fruit juices and sodas.


Too much sugar induces nausea by triggering the vomiting center in the brain.
In addition, dialysis causes the electrolytes in your system to be out of balance. Eating sugar throws this balance off even further, making nausea and vomiting more likely.

, The day before your treatment, you should reduce your portion size at each meal by half. This prevents you from overeating.


Eating too much can cause you to feel nauseous at the best of times, but dialysis can make feelings of nausea even worse (due to electrolyte imbalances) and lead to vomiting.
Eating less than usual helps to limit feelings of nausea and prevent vomiting. Try using a smaller plate at meals - this will make your plate appear full and trick your brain into thinking you're eating more than you actually are.

, In the days before your treatment, reduce the amount of salt you use in cooking and avoid adding additional salt to pre-packaged foods. Check the labels on food products and avoid any with high sodium contents.


Salt increases the amount of fluid in your system, as it attracts water from the blood. Consuming a lot of salt also raises your blood pressure.
Dialysis, on the other hand, removes excess fluid from the system and causes your blood pressure to drop. This sudden loss of fluid and drop in blood pressure comes as a shock to the system, and increases the likelihood of headaches and vomiting.
Therefore, reducing your salt intake helps to keep your blood pressure more stable.

, Avoid taking any medications in the 24 hour period before dialysis, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. This is especially important for patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.


Most medications cause your blood pressure to decrease even further during dialysis, which makes headaches and vomiting worse.

, It's important to manage your stress levels in the days coming up to a dialysis treatment. Stress leads to high blood pressure, which is best avoided during dialysis if you want to avoid headaches and vomiting.


You can manage your stress levels by balancing your work life with relaxation and exercise. Try doing yoga or meditation and make an effort to get 30 minutes of exercise per day, even if it's just a brisk walk outdoors.
You can also reduce stress by talking about any worries or fears you have with a trusted friend or family member. Seeing a therapist can also be helpful.

, Headaches often occur as a result of caffeine withdrawal. Therefore, it is important that you wean yourself off coffee and other caffeinated beverages in the days before the dialysis treatment, so you are not experiencing withdrawal headaches at the time of treatment.

Learn about the hormone vasopressin.,
Learn how vasopressin is regulated.,
Learn about the functions of vasopressin.,
Learn about the disorders of vasopressin.,
Thus affecting the ability of the gland to secrete this hormone.,
Doctors must check if the patient is not taking medications that increase the flow of urine such as diuretics.

,
Also this condition of diabetes insipidus can occur in the case of normal functioning pituitary gland in which the level of the hormone vasopressin in the blood is within normal values physiologically.,
The treatment to this condition is to administer vasopressin agonists which can stimulate the kidney tubules to conserve more water to the circulation of the blood that otherwise would be delivered in the urine excessively.

,
The other disorder that involves this hormone is the opposite clinically to diabetes insipidus.,
The oversecretion can involve either the posterior pituitary gland itself as occurs in certain diseases of the pituitary gland pr more often due to secretion of this hormone by a different organs in the body other than the pituitary gland such as a malignant neoplasm that can involve the lungs for example which can over secretes this hormone.

,
Also some neurological tumors in the body have been shown to secrete this hormone ectopically such as occurs in tuberculosis and pneumonia.,
Learn about the clinical manifestations of vasopressin disorders.,
Also another possibility is to administer antagonists to the action of this hormone so that less water would be conserved in the kidney tubules to the blood circulation.",How to Study and Understand the Medical Disorders Which Are Associated With the Hormone Vasopressin," Vasopressin is a polypeptide or protein hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland from its posterior part. Its secretion is not regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus such as occurs for all hormones of the anterior pituitary gland. Instead, its secretion is stimulated or inhibited based on the state of osmolality of the blood.;
, Increased osmolality of the blood stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete more of this hormone. On the other hand, low osmolality of the blood inhibits its secretion by the same gland. In addition the volume of blood is also a crucial factor in the stimulation or inhibition of the secretion of this hormone. Increased blood volume or hypervolemia inhibits the secretion of this hormone while low blood volume in the arteries stimulates its secretion such as occurs in a of state of shock.

, The main function of this hormone is to stimulate the re-absorption or conservation of water in the kidney tubules. One of the clinical symptoms to this function is an increase in blood pressure with subsequent development of edema.

, The first disorder that involves this hormone and which is discussed here is the diabetes insipidus disorder. This is a disorder of the posterior pituitary gland in which it secretes the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation in deficient amount. This can occur for example after a surgery to the brain in the region near the pituitary gland which can affect this gland also.

, The net result is the lack of stimulus for the kidney to conserve water in the kidney tubules into the blood circulation with subsequent development of polyurea with very dilute urine. This condition must be distinguished clinically from other diseases that can cause polyurea also such as diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.

,, In this case the pituitary gland secretes this hormone in normal physiological quantity. The only problem arises due to kidney problems in which its cellular receptors for this hormone do not respond properly for the stimulation by the hormone. This type of the disease is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

,, This disorder is called syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion to the blood. It involves the secretion of excessive amount of the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation.

,, In addition, many diseases on the central nervous system are associated with increased secretion of this hormone to the blood circulation ectopically.

, The clinical picture of this disorder is of increased amount of water that is conserved in the kidney tubules causing elevated blood pressure or hypertension with subsequent development of edema. The treatment for this condition is to remove the source of malignancy that is causing the secretion of the hormone by surgery.

, This hormone is usually metabolized and neutralized in the liver. In the case of liver failure this metabolism is disrupted so that the half life of it becomes longer which would allow for its lingering in the blood more time. Thus it exerts more effect on the kidney to conserve more water. This would give symptoms that are associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.

Understand the role calcium plays in building strong bones.,
Eat at least 5 servings a day of fresh, organic vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables.,
Make soup stock with organic meat bones and/or seafood shells.,
Eat canned sardines and salmon.,
Cook your organic meat on the bone so that some amounts of calcium will leach into the meat.

,
Include healthy fats in your daily diet.,
Eat 2 or 3 servings a day of organic legumes, nuts and seeds.

,
Consume soy products.,
Eat foods high in Silicon to keep your bones supple.,
Let the sunshine in.,
Take calcium supplements if you are not getting enough calcium in your diet.",How to Strengthen Your Bones the Organic Way," More than anything else, calcium is essential to good bone health; if you do not get enough calcium, your body will borrow calcium from the stored supply in your body. If this happens on a regular basis, the bones in your body will become weak, porous and brittle. Once your bones weaken, you have an increased risk of fracturing your bones. When you were a child, milk was a great source of calcium, but when you reach adulthood, milk should not be the primary source of your calcium intake for these reasons:


Most dairy products are high in saturated fat, which increases your risk of developing heart disease. Consuming high fat dairy products will also add calories to your diet, which could result in obesity.
Milk, even organic milk, contains natural estrogens. Recent medical studies suggest that increased estrogen may be linked to certain forms of cancer, particularly cancer of the reproductive organs. You may think that drinking organic milk will provide the calcium you need, but not endanger your health, but what you may not realize is that there are hormones in organic milk that has been obtained from a pregnant cow. The estrogen is a result of hormones in the milk, and your body cannot distinguish between natural and artificial hormones. Stick to skim or low fat organic milk, because there are more hormones present in milk fat.
As you age, your body is less able to digest lactose, which is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance range from very mild to very severe. If lactose is a problem for you, buy dairy products that are labeled, “lactose free.”;
, The following vegetables contain very high amounts of calcium:


Collard greens
Kale
Turnip greens
Garlic
Arugula
Broccoli
Mustard greens
Sun dried tomatoes
Spinach (raw)
Okra

, (Don’t add vinegar or wine to the stock; they will deplete the bones or shells of calcium.)

, There are abundant amounts of calcium in the tiny, soft bones.

,, Flaxseed oil is particularly good, but try to include unrefined, organic olive oil and sunflower oil as well.

,, The phytoestrogens contained in soy products slow down bone loss. Look for recipes that call for tofu, miso or tamari sauce. If you already eat a lot of foods containing soy, add some sea vegetables high in iodine to your diet because the increased iodine will provide a counter-balance to the thyroid-lowering factors found in soy.

, Silicon is a natural element that increases calcium absorption. Include in your regular diet these foods that are high in Silicon:


Millet
Apples
Almonds
Oranges
Onions
Cucumbers
Honey
Pumpkin

, Sunlight contains vitamin D, which your body needs to properly absorb calcium. Sit in the sun without sunscreen on your skin for fifteen minutes a day, preferably early in the morning when the sun’s rays are weaker. Sunscreen inhibits the body’s ability to synthesize vitamin D. If you absolutely cannot tolerate the sun, take a vitamin D supplement every day. Ask your doctor for advice on what amount you should take.

, Take about 500 milligrams at a time, and space the doses throughout the day because your body can’t absorb doses larger than 500 to 600 milligrams at one time. Ask your doctor what the recommended calcium dosage is for you, and whether or not calcium supplements will interfere or interact adversely with any prescription medications you may be taking.

Practice pulling your foot towards your body.,
Do an exercise that pushes your foot away from your body.,
Practice rotating your ankle inward.,
Move your ankle away from your body.",How to Strengthen Your Ankle After a Sprain2," The term dorsiflexion refers to when your foot is pulled towards your body to help increase the motion of your ankle against resistance. It also helps to improve the strength of the muscles around your ankle.To do this exercise:


Secure a resistance band or towel around a stable fixture (like a table leg) and tie it in a loop. Assume a sitting position with your legs stretched as far as possible from the fixture.
Place the loop of the resistance band or tied towel around your foot. Stretch the resistance band or towel by pulling your toes towards your body. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds and then release.
Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times on both ankles. Its important to exercise both ankles so that they both get strong.

, Plantar flexion is the medical term for moving your foot away from your body. This exercise helps to increase your ankle’s downward range of motion. To do this exercise:


Wrap a towel or resistance band around the bottom of your foot so that it is resting on the ball of your foot. Take the ends of the towel or the band and extend your leg out in front of you.
Move your toes away from your body so that you foot points away from where you are sitting. Point your toes as far away from your body as possible but stop if you start to feel pain.
Hold this position for 10 seconds before releasing your toes. Do this 10 to 20 times on both ankles.

, Inversion is the process of turning your ankle inward towards the middle of your body. To do this, you will have to loop a resistance band or a towel around something stable like a couch or table leg. Tie the other end of the band or towel together so that the band forms a circle. To do the exercise:


Sit down with your legs extended out in front of you. Your ankle should be parallel to the table leg or couch leg that you are using to keep your resistance band in place. Place the resistance band or towel around the top of your foot.
Rotate your ankle joint and foot towards your other leg, pulling against the resistance from the band or towel.
Hold this position for 10 seconds. Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times on both ankles.

, Eversion is when you strengthen the inside of your ankle by moving your ankle away from the center of your body. It is the opposite of the inversion exercise. Place a towel or band around something stable, like the leg of a table. Tie the other end of the band or towel so that it forms a large loop.To do this exercise:


Sit with your legs stretched out in front of you. Place the looped band or towel around your foot so that the towel or band rests on the inside of your foot.
Extend your foot and toes so that they point up and then away from your body, keeping your heel on the ground. Hold this position for 10 seconds and then release.
Repeat this exercise 10 or 20 times on both ankles.

Up your intake of calcium.,
Eat more phosphorous-rich foods.,
Increase your vitamin D intake.,
Boost your vitamin C levels.",How to Strengthen Your Ankle After a Sprain3," Calcium helps to strengthen your bones and keep them from breaking down. When you have more calcium in your system, your injured ankle and rebuild itself and remain strong after you have recovered. You can take a calcium supplement each day, or you can eat calcium-rich foods. These foods include:


Dairy products like skim milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Broccoli, okra, curly kale, and kidney beans.
Almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts.
Sardines and salmon.
Apricots, figs, currants, and oranges.

, Phosphorous is an essential nutrient that works with calcium to build and maintain strong bones. It can also reduce muscle pain and is needed for the growth, maintenance, and repair of your tissues and cells. You can take a phosphorus supplement, or you can get phosphorous from the food you eat. These foods include:


Seeds like pumpkin and squash.
Cheese like Romano, Parmesan, and goat cheese.
Fish like salmon, whitefish and cod.
Nuts like Brazil nuts, almonds, and cashews.
Pork and lean beef.
Tofu and other soy products.

, Vitamin D helps your body to absorb and use both calcium and phosphorous. In turn, these two nutrients—as mentioned above—build, maintain, and repair your bones. When you sprain your ankle, your calcium and phosphorous levels can use all the help they can get so it is a good idea to increase the amount of vitamin D you get each day. The easiest way to get vitamin D is by spending some time in the sun, as your body absorbs vitamin D through sunlight. You can also eat foods like:


Fish like salmon, mackerel, and canned tuna.
Egg yolks and milk that has been fortified with vitamin D.
Mushrooms that have been exposed to UV light,

, Vitamin C helps your body to create collagen. Collagen helps to repair tendons and ligaments that get damaged when you sprain your ankle. Getting vitamin C each day also helps to strengthen your immune system, which keeps you from getting sick while your body is focused on repairing your ankle. You can take a vitamin C supplement or you can eat foods rich in vitamin C like:


Yellow and red bell peppers.
Guavas, kiwi, and strawberries.
Dark leafy veggies like kale and spinach.
Broccoli.
Citrus like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons.

Read the label first.,
Store the vitamins in a secure container.,
Separate them from foods with airtight containers.",How to Store Vitamins and Supplements2," In some instances you should store vitamins or supplements in the fridge, but only if the label instructs you to do so. Although most vitamins and supplements should be stored at room temperature, there are some vitamins and supplements that require refrigeration.These include liquid vitamins, and some essential fatty acids and probiotics.
Probiotics contain active cultures that can die if exposed to heat, light or air, so it is essential that you refrigerate them.
Still, not all essential fatty acids, liquid vitamins and probiotics are required to be kept in the refrigerator, so it’s best to check the label first.
It is more likely that you will be instructed to store liquids in the fridge than other forms of vitamins or supplements.
Some multivitamins tablets are best kept in the fridge too., Make sure you secure the lid very tightly to avoid any moisture penetration. Leaving the lid loose in the refrigerator means exposing your supplements to excess moisture, which could seriously degrade the vitamins or supplements.Keep the container well out of the reach of any children or pets.
Even if they are in a childproof container, you should make sure that they are inaccessible.

, Put your supplements in a separate airtight container from foods to prevent any potential contamination. Perishable foods in the fridge could easily spoil, so it’s best to put vitamins and supplements in a separate airtight container.


If foods spoil nearby your supplements, any mould or bacteria could spread to them if they are not properly separated.
Remember to keep your vitamins and supplements in their original containers.
Airtight containers will not completely eliminate moisture, as you will let in moisture whenever you open the container."

Some supplements are stored in unique ways that can be found listed on their labels.
The label may advise you on the recommended dosage.
The label will also give you information on the “best before” date for the vitamins or supplements.
Some vitamins and supplements will not last long after you have opened them., If you have kids in the house you should take care to ensure that any vitamins, supplements or other potentially toxic substances are kept safe. They should be kept out of the reach of children, in a high cupboard or shelf. You can also secure the cupboard you keep them in with a childproof lock.The containers may have childproof lids, but you should still take care to ensure that they are kept well out of reach.All vitamins and supplements could be hazardous if consumed by a child.
Vitamins and supplements formulated for adults will have dosages inappropriate for kids.

, If you store your vitamins and supplements effectively, you can maintain their potency for a long time. You should never, however, consume any supplements or vitamins that have passed their stated “best before” dates."

Take Tylenol to relieve headaches.,
Use Pepto-Bismol to reduce feelings of nausea.,
Make sure your weight is taken correctly on the day of the treatment.,
Ensure that your blood pressure levels remain stable.,
Lie with your feet elevated above your head during treatment.,
Ask the medical personnel about the measures they are taking to prevent disequilibrium syndrome.,
Ask your doctor for stronger medications to prevent vomiting.",How to Stop Headaches and Vomiting During Dialysis2," Over-the-counter pain medication such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) can be taken during the dialysis treatment to alleviate headaches. One tablet can be taken immediately, then another can be taken several hours later if the headache returns. No more than three tablets should be taken in a 24 hour period.

, Pepto-Bismol is an over-the-counter medication used to alleviate nausea. It contains the active ingredient bismuth subsalicylate. It is available in liquid and chewable tablet form and should taken according to the instructions on the packaging.

, The amount of fluid that is removed from the body during dialysis is determined by your body weight. The heavier the weight, the more fluids that are taken.


If your weight is measured incorrectly, the dialysis machine may be set to remove too much fluid from your system, which leads to low blood pressure, vomiting and headaches.
Make sure your weight is measured accurately be removing any heavy clothes or shoes before the weigh-in. Also ask the medical professional to ensure that the dialysis machine is set to the correct weight.

, In order to avoid nausea and vomiting, it is essential that your blood pressure remains fairly stable during the dialysis treatment.


If your blood pressure drops too low, you may be injected with a saline solution to raise your blood pressure and keep it stable.
You may be injected with up to half a liter of saline over a 4 to 6 hour period throughout the treatment.

, One simple measure you can take to avoid headaches and vomiting is to lie down with your feet elevated above your head during the dialysis treatment.


This position increases blood flow to the brain and increases your blood pressure in general, helping to keep you stable.

, Disequilibrium syndrome is a condition where the brain becomes swollen during dialysis due to increased fluid. This is one of the most common causes of headaches during dialysis.


Medical staff can prevent disequilibrium syndrome from occurring by carefully monitoring the amount urea being removed from the body and by slowing the rate of blood flow if it appears to be moving too quickly.
If disequilibrium syndrome occurs, the dialysis treatment may need to be terminated earlier than anticipates, however this depends on the condition of the patient and the amount of fluid that has already been removed.

, If the nausea and vomiting persist, you may be able to ask your doctor for an injection of a stronger medication that will stop the vomiting. The most common medications used in these circumstances include.


Meclizine hydrochloride
Dimenhydrinate
Emetrol

Patients with certain life-threatening conditions can be treated with blood transfusion using blood from the umbilical cord of a healthy baby. Many parents feel storing their own child's umbilical cord could be helpful in the event the child needs a blood transfusion later in life.Cord blood contains stem cells. Stem cells are able to form into many different types of cells which make them valuable in the treatment of certain disease like sickle cell disease, leukemia, lymphoma, immune deficiency syndromes, and metabolic diseases.;
, Storing umbilical cord blood is costly. You can donate the blood from the cord for free, but you must pay a private facility if you want the blood stored for your own child in the event of an emergency in the future.Private blood banks exist throughout the country. You can ask your doctor about private blood storage services for the nearest facility in your area.Blood needs to be stored in specific conditions at specific temperatures in order to be viable for later medical use. Therefore, you cannot store umbilical cord blood at home. This practice is also illegal in many states., While the practice has become more popular in recent years, umbilical blood storage is controversial. It is not recommended the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.However, some parents and doctors still defend the practice.


Using blood from your own child's umbilical cord does increase the likelihood of a blood transfusion being successful to a small degree. However, oftentimes children respond just as well, if not better, to donor blood.The likelihood of the blood from your child's umbilical cord ever being used for your child is slim — less than 4/100th of 1 percent.It is more than likely your child will need someone else's blood for a successful transfusion — the child's own cord may carry the same cells that caused the disease you are trying to treat.However, if you have another child with a preexisting condition that may require a blood transfusion down the line, most medical professional recommend storing a new baby's umbilical cord.Your child may benefit from a transfusion from her sibling's blood., Private blood storage is expensive. A first year processing fee of $1,400 to $2,300 is common. After that, there are annual fees of $115 to $150. Consider whether private blood storage is financially viable for you before making a decision., Certain health conditions increase the chance of your child or another family member needing a blood transfusion. This might even effect cost of storage.


Keep in mind some private banks offer discounts if you have extenuating circumstances. If you have a family history of leukemia or lymphomas, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, immune deficiency diseases, or metabolic storage disorders this will increase the likelihood a family member will need a blood donation. A bank may be willing to offer you a discount rate in this case.If you have an existing child who already has one of the above disorders, umbilical cord donation may be a good idea. This child is at an increased risk of needing a blood donation down the road. Once again, a private bank may offer you a discount in this case., There are family cord blood banks in countries throughout the world. You can ask your doctor or hospital to direct you to a private bank with a good reputation, or you can look on a directory of private blood banks and do your own research on those you find.


The Parent's Guide to Cord Blood Foundation has a worldwide directory of family cord blood banks, which you can browse for free.Note that cost is not necessarily an indication of quality. Some less expensive blood banks might be cutting corners in potentially unsafe manners, but others might have lower costs simply because they spend less on marketing. Reputation is usually a better indication than anything else. You should also check on the qualifications and experience of those running the blood bank, as well as the company's viability, stability, and storage technology.Shop around. If one blood bank can't offer you a discount, call another. It may take awhile to find the best rates for your financial situation., Once you find a private blood bank you want to work with, you should contact them and make arrangements. You should also make sure that your doctor and hospital are aware of these arrangements at least one month before your baby is born, if not sooner.


The company you've chosen to bank with should send you a collection kit. You must give this kit to the hospital or birthing center at the time of delivery. Even though the hospital will not receive the kit until delivery, you should still make them aware of your intentions beforehand.Make sure that cord blood is collected after delivery. Doctors and nurses should collect the blood from your baby's umbilical cord within a few minutes after the birth of your child., Each private blood bank has its own procedures, but when your family needs the cord blood stored at the bank, you should be able to notify the bank and have the blood delivered to your hospital for a transfusion. You may need medical authorization from a doctor to show the blood is presently needed. The cord blood will be tested to see whether or not it's a match for the patient.

Remove the tick if it still in your skin.,
Apply anti-itch creams for immediate relief from lyme disease rash.,
Take antihistamines to stop the itch.,
Try NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation caused by the lyme disease rash.,
Start taking antibiotics to treat the lyme disease.",How to Stop Itch Caused by Lyme Disease1," If you have already done this, skip to the next step. It is important to make sure that the tick has been removed or else it can continue to cause irritation, even if you use the methods for itch relief listed in this article. While it may seem surprising, tick bites are not painful and can actually go unnoticed for quite awhile.To remove the tick:


Grasp the tick’s head with your forefinger and thumb. Do not grasp the tick by its body because its head can detach from the body and continue to cause you irritation.
Gently pull the tick outwards until it detaches from the skin. Do not pull sharply as it may tear the mouth of the tick from its body.
Wash the area with soap and water after you have removed the tick.;
, Anti-itch creams, also known as topical soothing creams, can relieve itching and calm down the rash around the bite. Some topical creams can also fight inflammation, which causes the itching sensation. There are different kinds of anti-itch creams but some of the more common ones include:


Anti-allergic creams like Fenistil gel.
Steroid creams like Elocon.
Combination creams that have more than one active ingredient, like Calamine lotion.

, Antihistamines are generally used for allergic reactions. When your body notices a foreign invader, be it an allergen, virus, or a tick in your skin, it produces a chemical called histamine which causes inflammation and can make you feel itchy. Antihistamines block the production of histamine so you can feel less itchy, but only provide short term relief for lyme disease rash.You can purchase over-the-counter antihistamines at your pharmacy. Make sure to check that you get non-drowsy antihistamines if you are taking them during the day.
Non-drowsy antihistamines include brand names like Allegra, Zyrtec, Mucinex and Claritin.

, NSAIDs are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs thank can both relieve the swelling around the tick bite, and reduce the itching sensation caused by the rash. There are many different NSAIDs but some of the more common medications include:


Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.

, Taking antibiotics will help to clear up the infection caused by the bite, including the lyme rash and itching that go along with it. It can completely clear up lyme disease that was caught early on, and it can reduce your chances of having symptoms in the future.You will have to talk to your doctor about starting antibiotics, but it is important to do the antibiotic treatment to keep the lyme disease under control.


Most antibiotic prescriptions last for 14 to 28 days. Some of the more common antibiotics include Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, and Cefuroxime axetil.

Use a baking soda mix to stop the itch.,
Take an oatmeal bath.,
Pour lemon juice on the lyme disease rash.,
Use basil water.,
Try mint to find relief.,
Apply a thyme-water mixture to cool your itching skin.,
Eat more garlic.,
Drink turmeric and ginger milk or water.",How to Stop Itch Caused by Lyme Disease2," Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a natural acid neutralizer. It has anti-inflammatory properties that can calm down your swelling and itchy skin associated with lyme disease rash. You can either take a baking soda bath, or you can make a mixture that can be applied directly to your skin.Baking soda bath: Fill a bath with warm water. Add one cup of baking soda and stir the water until the baking soda has dissolved. Sit in the tub for a good 20 to 30 minutes to really vanquish that itch.
Baking soda paste: Mix one cup of baking soda with one half cup of water. Stir until thoroughly mixed. Take some of the paste and rub it onto the itchy areas of your skin. Leave it there for 30 minutes and then wash the mixture off with water.

, Oats, like baking soda, also have anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe your itchy skin. Oats also help to keep your skin hydrated, which can make your skin itch less, even when experiencing lyme rash. You can use regular oatmeal purchased at the grocery store, or you can buy oatmeal that has been ground up and pre-packaged specifically for use in a tub. To make your own oatmeal bath:


Take one cup of oatmeal and grind it in a blender or coffee grinder. You should end up with a fine powder.
Fill your bathtub with warm water. Pour a quarter cup of the oatmeal powder into the tub. Stir the water to make sure the powder is evenly distributed throughout. Soak in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes.

, Lemon juice has anti-itch properties that can soothe the area around your tick bite. It is also an antiseptic, which means that it will clear the area of bacteria, as well as an anti-inflammatory substance.To apply the lemon juice:


Cut a lemon in half and squeeze one of the halves on to the itchy area. Gently massage the juice into your skin for a few minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat as needed.

, Basil contains an active ingredient called Eugenol. Eugenol is a strong anesthetic agent, which means that it can cool and soothe your itchy skin. You can boil a cup of water and then add several fresh basil leaves to the pot. Keep it at a boil for a minute and then allow the water to cool. Rub the water on your itchy skin., Mint contains menthol and rosmarinic acid, both of which are anti-inflammatory and anesthetic agents, making it a great herb for treating itchy skin caused by lyme disease. Like what you do to basil, you should boil the mint in water, allow it to cool, and then rub the mint water on your skin.


Alternatively, you can add mint extract, rather than fresh mint leaves, to the boiling water for the same effect.

, Thyme contains thymol, which is another natural anesthetic and anti-inflammatory agent. Like with basil and mint, you can boil fresh sprigs of time in water to get a mixture that will relieve itchiness when rubbed on your skin.


Bring a cup of water to a boil, add a sprig or two of thyme, and let the sprigs boil in the water for several moments. Let the water cool down and then apply it directly to your skin.

, Garlic can help to reduce the effects of the lyme disease infection and rash because it has antimicrobial agents like allicin. When you eat more garlic, your immune system gets boosted, which helps to fight the infection that is making your skin itchy.You can take garlic supplements, or you can eat two or three cloves of raw garlic a day.

, Turmeric and ginger are both known for their antibacterial, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties—all of which can relieve your itchy symptoms associated with lyme disease rash.To make a warm drink that you can consume to help you get rid of the itchiness caused by lyme rash:


Bring a cup of milk to a boil. Add a teaspoon of ginger and a teaspoon of turmeric to the milk. You can also add a little black pepper to help the milk absorb the ginger and turmeric. Once the mixture has boiled, filter out the ingredients. You can add honey to the milk to make it sweet.

Be aware that ticks thrive in summer months.,
Wear long sleeves and pants when you go hiking or camping.,
Use insect repellants.,
Check your skin and your clothes when you get home.",How to Stop Itch Caused by Lyme Disease3," Ticks are all about the summer sunshine. They are far more numerous in the summers, specifically from May to September, than they are in the cooler months. You should be aware of this and take extra precautions when going out into nature (or even yards with tall grass in them). While not all ticks have lyme disease, all ticks can be very annoying to deal with once they bite you., When you are planning to go outside and into nature, you should always consider wearing long pants and sleeves, particularly if you are going out during peak tick season. While it might be hot to wear long sleeves and pants, these clothes will help to protect you from tick bites.To take it a step further, tuck your shirt into your pants, and your pant legs into your boots to make your outfit completely tick-proof.

, Some insect repellents work to ward off ticks, as well as mosquitoes and other bugs. If you would prefer to not wear long sleeves, you should spray insect repellent on any exposed parts of your skin. However, you should not spray insect repellent on any open wounds or cuts that you have. Common insect repellents include:


DEET, Permethrin or Picaridin.

, After coming home from an outing in the great outdoors, make sure to check every inch of your skin to make sure that you don’t have any ticks on your. Be sure to look in the folds of your skin and hard to reach places by using a mirror.


If you have a dog that you took out with you, make sure to check him for ticks too.

Add soluble fiber to your diet.,
Avoid caffeine.,
Don't drink alcohol.,
Consider a gluten-free diet.,
Stay away from fatty foods.,
Avoid foods that contain artificial sweeteners.",How to Stop Diarrhea Caused by IBS1," Diarrhea is a result of too much water in the colon. This happens when undigested, liquid food passes through the small intestine and colon too quickly, preventing the excess water from being absorbed into the bloodstream. Soluble fiber absorbs excess fluid in the bowel like a sponge, firming up loose stool. Try to include at least one portion of a fiber-rich food with every major meal.
Foods rich in soluble fiber include: apples, beans, berries, figs, kiwi, legumes, mangoes, oats, peaches, peas, plums and sweet potatoes.
Be aware that the use of fiber to treat IBS is somewhat controversial and may require some trial and error experimentation to see if it helps alleviate your diarrhea.;
, Caffeine stimulates the gastrointestinal system, leading to strong contractions and more bowel movements. Additionally, caffeine has a diuretic effect, which may worsen dehydration caused by diarrhea.Switch to decaf versions of your favorite caffeinated drinks, like coffees, teas and sodas.
Drink lots of water to compensate for the fluid loss caused by diarrhea — aim for 8 to 10 glasses per day. One of the dangers of diarrhea is it can cause dehydration.

, Alcohol consumption can affect the ability of the body to absorb water. As the intestinal cells absorb alcohol, they lose their ability to absorb water because of the toxicity. This is because alcohol depresses the digestive tract’s movement.When the intestines do not absorb enough water to mix with the food, excess water will be left in the colon, leading to diarrhea. Remove alcohol from your diet completely to see if your IBS improves.
If you you must drink, opt for a small glass of red wine instead of hard liquor or beer.

, Your doctor may recommend you do a two week trail of a gluten-free diet. The insoluble fiber found in gluten — which is in rye, wheat, and barley — may worsen IBS symptoms.By cutting out gluten, you may find that your IBS improves significantly., Some people have difficulty absorbing fat, and unabsorbed fat can cause the small intestines and the colon to secrete more water, resulting in watery stool.Normally, the colon absorbs water from undigested, liquid foods in order to firm up the stool. But if the small intestines and colon secrete more water, the colon cannot absorb all of the water from the undigested liquid foods, resulting in diarrhea.
Avoid fatty foods like fried foods, butter, cakes, junk food, cheese and other greasy foods.

, Sugar substitutes such as sorbitol can lead to diarrhea due to their laxative effects.Sorbitol exerts its laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine, thereby stimulating bowel movements.
Artificial sweeteners are widely used in processed foods such as soft drinks, baked goods, powdered drink mixes, canned goods, candy, puddings, jams, jellies and dairy products. Always check the label before consuming.

Identify a proximal humerus fracture.,
Recognize a mid area fracture.,
Determine if the break is a distal humerus fracture.,
Understand the purpose of splinting a fracture.,
Prepare your materials.,
Apply the splint and fasten it.,
Check the person's circulation.,
Make a sling.",How to Splint a Humerus Fracture," This type of injury can cause damage to the ball and socket (glenohumeral) joint where the humerus bone attaches to the shoulder girdle. A fracture in this location causes difficulty with shoulder movement, such as trying to raise the arm overhead.Palpate (touch) the upper arm and feel for any bumps, lumps or evidence of broken skin. Carefully remove or alter clothing so you can see the entire arm and look for signs of bruising, inflammation or deformity.


During the examination, have the patient and/or bystanders support the rest of the injured arm to reduce discomfort.
You can usually tell the location of the break based on where most of the pain is coming from. Broken bone pain is often described as severe, sharp and shooting.
If part of the humerus is poking through the skin of the upper arm (known as an open compound fracture) then the person will need immediate medical attention to stop the bleeding and prevent infection.Be very careful splinting this type of fracture due to risks of damaging blood vessels and nerves.;
, This type of break, called a diaphyseal fracture, occurs somewhere in the middle of the humerus bone. There is usually no shoulder joint or elbow joint damage with this type of fracture;however, movement distal from the break (at the elbow or in the forearm) may be reduced and painful. Breaks in this area are often caused by trauma from car accidents or from getting hit with a blunt object such as a baseball bat. Again, you'll need to look at the upper arm and feel around to determine where the fracture is.


Common signs and symptoms of bone fractures include: intense pain, a visibly deformed or misshapen bone or joint, swelling, near immediate bruising, nausea, reduced mobility, and numbness or tingling in the affected limb.
If the wrist and hand are weak or cannot grip anything without causing serious pain, the mid-shaft fracture may also have caused nerve damage or irritation. In this case, immediate medical attention is required

, This injury occurs closer to the elbow joint and often requires surgical repair. Distal humerus fractures are more common in young children (typically from falls or being pulled by the hand too hard), but can occur in people at any age from accidental or violent arm trauma.Distal humerus fractures obviously affect elbow function the most, but hand and wrist movements can be affected also.


This type of fracture often causes damage to the radial artery and median nerve of the lower arm, which can cause numbness and/or tingling in the hand.
If a broken bone is considered complicated — multiple fragments, the skin is penetrated by the bone and/or the pieces are grossly misaligned — then surgery is a likely outcome regardless if you splint the bone or not.

, Once you've identified where the humeral fracture is, then it's time to splint it. Before you start, make sure to understand the purpose of splinting. The main purpose is to hold still and protect the broken arm from further damage until medical help arrives.As such, it's just a temporary measure in an emergency situation.


If you are overwhelmed, scared or confused as to what to do in the face of such an emergency situation, then focus more on calming the injured person down and telling him to keep his arm still instead of trying to splint it. There's no shame in that.
Call for emergency assistance as soon as you realize a person is significantly injured, regardless of where the fracture is or what type it is. If you don't have a phone, borrow the injured person's or ask a bystander to dial 9-1-1.

, In an emergency situation, you won't likely have ideal materials to make a sturdy splint, but do your best to improvise. The important thing is to use something rigid and sturdy to support the whole arm down its entire length. Remember, the elbow and rest of arm must be supported. Long pieces of plastic, wooden sticks, tree branches, thick cardboard, rolled up newspaper and similar items all can be used to make a splint. The best options are materials that can be cambered (bent to the shape and curve of the arm), like folded newspaper or thick cardboard. You also need something to secure the splint, such as an elastic bandage, medical tape, belt, shoelaces, rope or strips of cloth.Try to ensure that the materials are relatively clean, especially if you're applying them to an arm that is bleeding.


If you are using something with sharp edges or splinters, then wrap it with cloth or plastic before applying it to the arm as a splint.
If you can trim the splint, then size it the length of the entire arm, from the shoulder joint to the mid joints of the fingers. Take two or three layers of cardboard or paper and make an ""L"" shaped splint that is curved to the shape of the arm. Measure and adjust the length of the bend/ size of forearm to fingertip area and camber on the uninjured limb. (Remember to reverse the camber, however; it is going on the opposite arm.)
Hypoallergenic medical tape is ideal to wrap a splint, but avoid applying duct tape against a person’s skin if you can due to the likelihood of irritation. If you must use duct tape, place cloth or paper towel between it and the skin.

, Under ideal conditions and with the correct materials and knowledge, you wouldn't need to secure the elbow with a proximal humeral fracture near the shoulder. However, in an emergency situation, try to splint as much of the upper arm bone as possible until medical help arrives.Place the splint gently under the injured arm. If it needs adjusting, do so off of the fracture, then replace and check. Have the patient hold the splint in place while you bandage above the site. Continue below the injury site and bandage to the hand; add a bit of rolled up cloth/roll of gauze under the hand to help keep the fingers in neutral position. This keeps the fingers’ muscles and tendons from moving the arm/fracture.


Avoid placing the tape / bandage / ties directly over the fracture site. You will need them above and below the fracture site and one to secure the lower arm to the splint. Ideally, you will want to bandage the entire splint to the arm. Otherwise, tie the bandages as firmly as you can without cutting off circulation.
Do not attempt to bandage open fractures tightly, as this can cause bone fragments to injure soft tissue. Merely cover the open wound and secure the bandage gently; if it is bleeding freely, some soft compression using a bandage or tie may be necessary to stem the bloodflow, but always be mindful of the patient’s response or any grinding sensations you feel as you bandage.

, Regardless of the kind of fracture that was sustained, you must check to make sure that the secured splint is not too tight and cutting off the person’s circulation.Observe the person's hand (on the side of the injury) for changes of color. If the skin turns a bluish color, immediately loosen the bindings of the splint. In addition, check the patient's radial (wrist) pulse after splinting to ensure it is still present.


Another way of checking for normal circulation is to pinch a fingernail on the hand of the injured arm for about two seconds and see if it quickly returns to its normal pinkish color. If it does, the circulation is fine; if it remains white and doesn't turn pink, loosen the binding.
Since the injury is swelling and possibly bleeding under the skin, continue to check for normal circulation every few minutes until medical help arrives.

, Once the arm is splinted, tie a sling around the splint. Be certain you attach another bandage/tie around the sling and torso — this second bandage (transverse bandage) keeps the arm immobile, using the torso as a support.


If you have a large, square piece of cloth (about 1 meter on all sides), this will work perfectly for a sling. If you have an old pillowcase or sheet, you can cut or even tear it to the appropriate size.
Fold the square in half, into the shape of a triangle. Slip one end of the cloth under the injured arm and the other end over the opposite shoulder.
Bring the free end of the cloth up over the person's other shoulder (the shoulder of the injured arm) and tie it to the other end behind the person's neck.

Take antimotility medicines.,
Try antispasmodic medicines.,
Use painkillers to relieve cramping.,
Get a prescription for antidepressants to relieve symptoms of IBS.",How to Stop Diarrhea Caused by IBS2," Loperamide is an antimotility medication usually recommended for IBS-related diarrhea. Loperamide works by slowing the contractions of muscles in your bowel, which slows down the speed at which food passes through your digestive system. This allows more time for your stools to harden and solidify.Some medications, including Loperamide, also increase the pressure of the anal canal, which helps with leakage.
The recommended dosage of loperamide is 4 mg initially, with an additional 2 mg after each loose stool, but you should not exceed 16 mg over a 24-hour period.

, Antispasmodics are a group of medicines that control gut spasms, reducing diarrhea as a result. The two main types of antispasmodic medicines appear to be equally effective in treatment of diarrhea caused by IBS.Antimuscarinics: Antimuscarinics or anticholingerics block the activity of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter which is stimulates the stomach muscles to contract). This allows the muscles to relax, thereby relieving symptoms of abdominal muscle cramping. The commonly used antimuscarinic drugs are hyoscyamine and dicyclomine. For adults, the ideal dose is 10 mg taken three to four times per day.

Smooth muscle relaxants: These work directly on the smooth muscle in the gut wall, allowing the muscle to relax. This relieves pain and prevents diarrhea. One of the most commonly used smooth muscle relaxants is alverine citrate. The usual dose for adults is 60-120 mg, taken between one and three times per day.
If your diarrhea doesn't improve using one form of antispasmodic, try another.

, Painkillers can be used to relieve the pain associated with abdominal muscle cramping. Painkillers work by blocking pain signals to brain. If the pain signal does not reach the brain, then pain cannot be interpreted and felt.Simple Painkillers: Simple painkillers are available over-the-counter and can be used to relieve mild to moderate pain. Examples include paracetamol and acetaminophen. Doses of simple painkillers may vary according to age, but the usual recommended dose for adults is 500 mg, every four to six hours.

Stronger Painkillers: Stronger painkillers are usually only available by prescription and are used to relive moderate to severe pain. Examples include codeine and tramadol. Only take prescription painkillers according to your doctor's recommendations, as they can be addictive.

, In some cases, antidepressant medications can be used to treat IBS. Antidepressants block pain messages between the GI tract and the brain, thereby reducing visceral hypersensitivity (increased sensitivity of the GI tract nerves).Tricyclics (TCA's) and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's) are the groups of antidepressants commonly prescribed for IBS.
Consult with your healthcare provider for dosage recommendations as the ideal dosages of these medicines vary according to the manufacturer.

Reduce your stress levels.,
Use hypnotherapy to decrease your stress.,
Schedule sessions with a therapist.,
Try Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) to address stress.,
Exercise more.",How to Stop Diarrhea Caused by IBS3," Feeling worried, anxious, overwhelmed or tense stimulates colon spasms for people with IBS. The colon contains many nerves that are directly connected to the brain. These nerves control colon contractions. Stress results in abdominal discomfort, cramps, and diarrhea.Identify the source of stress. Knowing what's causing the stress in the first place will help you to avoid it. In IBS, the colon is more sensitive to even mild stress or anxiety.
Taking on more responsibility than you can comfortably manage leads to increased stress. Know your limits and learn how to say when necessary.
Find ways to express your feelings, which helps lower stress levels. Talking to open-minded friends, families and loved ones about any issues or problems you've been having can help to eliminate built-up stress.
Learning effective time management skills helps avoid unnecessary stress.

, Hypnotherapy has shown a substantial positive effect on patients with IBS. The form of hypnotherapist done in these sessions follows a 7–12 session gut-directed hypnotherapy protocol initially developed by PJ Whorwell.In these sessions, the patient first relaxes into the hypnotic trance. The patient then receives specific suggestions regarding GI functioning. The final phase of hypnosis includes imagery that increases the patient's sense of confidence and well-being.While this procedure has been shown to have positive outcomes, note that there is little evidence to show why it works.
Hypnotherapy may work on patients unresponsive to other forms of treatment.

, Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy (PIT) offers detailed discussion of symptoms and the patient's emotional state. The therapist and patient together explore the links present between symptoms and emotional conflicts. One of the goals of PIT is to identify and resolve issues of interpersonal conflict that result in stress, and negatively impact IBS.PIT has been done most often in the UK. Field trials have shown a connection between PIT and relief from the symptoms of IBS.
Usually, PIT is a longer-term treatment option. Studies show benefits coming only after at least 10 one-hour sessions, scheduled over the course of three months.

, Research shows that people with IBS who use CBT to learn behavioral strategies to manage their stress demonstrate significantly greater improvement than people who rely on medication alone. CBT works by teaching relaxation exercises, coupled with cognitive exercises to change existing belief systems and interpersonal stressors.CBT patients are taught to recognize existing patterns of maladaptive behaviors and responses to a variety of situations. For example, someone with IBS may believe their situation ""will never change,"" thus leading to anxiety and stress. Using CBT, the patient learns to recognize the existence of this thought, and replace it with another, more positive belief.
CBT is typically administered in 10–12 individual sessions. Group formats are also used.

, Exercise lowers stress levels. In addition, new research suggests that exercise may help aid the digestive process. Exercise increases colonic motility (that is, the passage of wastes and other secretions through the colon), the length of time this passage requires, and the amount of transitive intestinal gas present in the colon.Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise five time a week or 30 minutes of vigorous exercise three times a week. Possible options include walking, bicycling, running, swimming, dance or hiking.
If you aren't currently physically active, take it slow to start. Find an exercise partner or workout group. Share your workout goals on social media, where you may find support and encouragement.
Exercise helps develop confidence, which in turn reduces stress.

Educate yourself about IBS.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of IBS.,
Rule out other possible causes of diarrhea.",How to Stop Diarrhea Caused by IBS4," Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that affects the large intestine (colon). It commonly causes abdominal pain, bloating gas, cramping, constipation and diarrhea.For IBS patients, an increase in the sensitivity of the nerves in the GI tract (visceral hypersensitivity) can occur. This can develop after a gastrointestinal infection or after an operation that causes injury or damage to the nerves in the intestine.
This results in a lower threshold for feeling intestinal sensations, therefore leading to abdominal discomfort or pain. Eating even small amounts of food may create discomfort as the stretch puts on the intestines.
Fortunately, unlike more-serious intestinal diseases, irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation or changes in bowel tissue. In many cases, a person with IBS can control the disorder by managing the diet, lifestyle and stress.

, While the most common symptom of IBS is diarrhea, there are a variety of symptoms that characterize this disorder. The symptoms vary widely from person to person. In addition, the symptoms may go away altogether for a time, before recurring with greater severity.Abdominal pain: Pain or discomfort in the abdominal region is one of the main clinical features of IBS. The intensity of the pain can be quite variable, from mild enough to be ignored, to being debilitating enough to interfere with daily activities. It is frequently episodic and can be experienced as cramping or as a persistent ache.

Altered bowel habits: This is the most consistent clinical presentation in patients with IBS. The most common pattern is constipation alternating with diarrhea.

Distention and Flatulence: Patients frequently complain of these unpleasant symptoms, which can attributed to increased gas.

Upper GI symptoms: Heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia (indigestion) are symptoms that have been reported in 25-50% of patients with IBS.

Diarrhea: Usually, diarrhea in IBS patients appears in between episodes of constipation (that may last from weeks to even a few months), but it can also be a predominant symptom. The stool may contain large amount of mucus, but never traces of blood (unless hemorrhoids are present). In addition, nocturnal diarrhea does not occur in patients suffering from this condition.

, Diarrhea can be a symptom of many conditions besides IBS. Consider alternative diagnosis before IBS is claimed to be the cause of diarrhea. Proper diagnosis is required for appropriate treatment.Most commonly, an infectious agent is responsible for diarrhea. Salmonella or shigella are forms of food poisoning that result in diarrhea; however, these infections are usually accompanied by fever.
Hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, lactose deficiency, celiac disease are other conditions which may cause chronic diarrhea.

There hormonal shifts are completely normal and after they finish, the hair growth is likely to diminish. Hair growth can also be caused by medical conditions that you may be able to resolve through treatment. Conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adrenal gland tumors and Cushing’s disease could each cause your body to produce too many male hormones., There are a number of medications that may cause unusual hair growth as a side effect. Depending on the medication and the condition you are using it to treat, you may be able to prevent further hair growth simply by changing to an alternative medication. Look your prescriptions up online to check for side effects or contact your doctor to discuss it. Some medications that may cause hair growth are:Some anti-seizure medications
Steroids like cortisone
IFG-1 (a specific form on insulin)
Some birth control pills

, Studies have shown that you can reduce the amount of androgen in your body while increasing the level of female hormones your body produces. Through consistent drinking of spearmint tea, you can produce a noticeable drop off in body and facial hair growth.Make tea using 1 heaping teaspoon or 1.5 teaspoons of chopped spearmint leaves.
Brew the spearmint leaves with one cup of boiling water for ten minutes.
Drink two cups of spearmint tea a day for a minimum of five days to begin to see results.

, Dropping unhealthy weight has been shown to significantly reduce hair growth in some women. Having excess body fat can affect the way your body produces hormones, which can lead to excess body hair growth. Losing weight can help your body to better regulate your hormone levels, thus limiting your body’s production of body hair.Women with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 have significantly higher levels of testosterone than women with a lower BMI.Make sure to pursue healthy methods of losing weight.

Losing weight and limiting hair growth are just a few of the benefits of eating healthy.


, Diets that are high in red meat can increase androgen levels in your body, resulting in more hair growth.Cutting down the amount of red meat that you eat can affect how much hair your body grows. Soy products have been known to actually increase the levels or estrogen in your body, which can combat the effects of the naturally occurring androgens in your system.Reduce the amount of red meat in your diet to help control hormone production.
Increasing the soy in your diet can help increase estrogen production to combat hair growth caused by hormones.Research has not definitively linked the ingestion of soy products with feminizing effects on men including gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) or reduction in fertility."

Search for a licensed electrologist in your area.,
Get a consultation.,
Refrain from temporary forms of hair removal for one to two weeks.,
Complete your scheduled treatments.",How to Stop Hair Growth2," Most states require people performing electrolysis to be licensed or certified. Even if your state doesn’t require it, look for a certification from an electrology school before undergoing treatment. Electrolysis is relatively non-invasive but there are some risks involved.Electrolysis involves inserting a needle into each hair follicle and emitting an electric current to damage and ultimately destroy it.
Electrolysis using a needle to kill hair follicles is the only electrolysis method that will prevent further hair growth in the future.
Look online for reviews of local electrologists, then contact them to ask about their credentials.
If the electrologist says they use electronic tweezers or photoepilators, you should choose someone else, because these methods have proven to not be permanent or last longer than normal tweezing.

, Once you find an electrologist, make an appointment for a consultation. At your appointment, the electrologist should go over the procedure with you, answer any of your questions, and discuss how many sessions will be required in order to reach your hair removal goals. Make sure you feel comfortable in the environment and discuss any concerns you may have with the electrologist.Most electrolysis clinics offer free consultations.
Ask how much each session costs, how long they last, and how long the practitioner or electrologist has been conducting these procedures.

, Prior to your first electrolysis appointment, avoid shaving, waxing or plucking the hair you intend to have removed. The electrolysis procedure requires the hair to be at the surface in order to locate and penetrate each hair follicle. Removing your hair can make that difficult.


Electrolysis is usually done in small areas at once, so you can continue to shave or wax areas that will not be treated until a later session.

, You will likely need to return for a number of treatments, depending on the amount of hair you are having removed and the area of your body. As you have the hair removed via electrolysis, it should be permanently arrested, preventing any further growth from the treated hair follicles.You will likely need to apply a cream with antiseptic to each treated area after your sessions to soothe it and prevent infection.
Electrolysis can be mildly painful, but shouldn’t be overwhelming. If you experience extreme discomfort, make sure to address it with the practitioner.

Ensure laser hair removal is right for you.,
Research licensed laser removal technicians in your area.,
Consult with the technician or physician.,
Allow normal hair growth for six weeks prior to your appointment.,
Schedule laser hair removal sessions every six weeks.",How to Stop Hair Growth3," Laser hair removal is not considered a permanent method of preventing hair growth, but it can greatly reduce the amount of hair you see growing in specific areas after a number of treatments. Laser hair removal can be rather expensive and will require repeated visits for each portion of your body you hope to treat.Laser hair removal procedures can be quick. One laser can treat multiple hair follicles at once, and requires only an instant to work.
Your skin may feel sunburned after the procedure for a few days, but there are few risks otherwise.

, In some states, this procedure can only be done by a physician. You can often find certified laser hair removal practitioners or physicians at cosmetic surgery practices. Use the internet to research local practices and look for reviews and credentials listed online.Ask questions about the physician overseeing the procedure and their credentials when looking for a laser hair removal clinic.

Look for membership in professional organizations like The American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) or the National Council on Laser Excellence (NCLE).

, Discuss how many treatments you can expect to pay for before you see long-lasting results. It may take between three and seven treatments to permanently reduce hair growth. Laser hair removal is often not a completely permanent solution, so be wary of any clinic making such promises.Keep in mind that cost varies by the size of the treatment area and, depending on the luxury of the location, a session could cost several hundred dollars., Laser hair removal requires the targeting of hair follicles, which may be removed by waxing or plucking. Allow your hair to grow naturally for six weeks in order to ensure the laser can properly target and kill hair follicles.Do not wax or pluck hairs between laser hair removal sessions either.

, Laser hair removal can remove hair for up to six weeks, but the hair will continue to grow back. After three to seven treatments in one area, hair growth can be permanently limited, but you still may experience limited hair growth in those regions.Wearing a cold compress after each procedure can soothe the affected skin and limit irritation.
Anti-inflammatory creams or lotions can also increase comfort immediately after the procedure.

Consider a rehabilitation program.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery.,
Strengthen and condition your muscles.,

Practice standing stretches.",How to Treat a Pulled Oblique Muscle," A pulled muscle can take several weeks to heal, and in the meantime can cause considerable pain. One of the best ways to alleviate that pain at home is by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Reducing inflammation is important for core muscles like obliques, which are crucial for movement.;
, Ice is helpful for muscle pain, as the cold compress slows down blood flow and reduce swelling and inflammation.If you do not have an ice pack, you can wrap ice cubes in a clean dish towel or use a cold, flexible item like frozen vegetables from the freezer.Ice should be applied for no more than 20 minutes, then removed for at least 20 minutes before being reapplied.Remove the ice pack if the skin turns red or bright pink.Do not apply ice directly to the skin, as this may cause ice burns.Ice works best for the first 48 hours after an injury. After 48 hours, switch to heat treatment or alternate between heat and ice., Icing an injury is best during the first 48 hours, as it reduces swelling and inflammation. After 48 hours, you can also use heat treatment, such as a heating pad. Heat will help to relax your muscles and re-stimulate blood flow, allowing the tissue to heal.Moist heat sources, such as a hot water bottle or hot water bath, may penetrate to the muscle better than dry heat sources.Do not apply heat for longer than 20 minutes at a time unless your doctor or physical therapist has instructed you to do so. If your skin becomes uncomfortable or hurts, remove the heat immediately.Never lie down on a heating pad, as you may fall asleep. Do not use a heat source if you will be sleeping, as the prolonged heat could cause severe burns.Do not apply heat sources directly to the skin, as the heat source may burn your skin. Always wrap heat sources in a clean dish towel before applying to the injury.Do not use heat sources if you have poor circulation or diabetes., The best thing for any injury is to let the muscles rest and recover. While the injury is healing, avoid any movements or activities that could further injure the oblique muscles.Skip your usual ab workouts until the muscles have healed and avoid movements that aggravate your oblique muscles.

, The oblique muscles can be quite painful when injured, and may take several weeks to heal. However, some injuries may take longer to heal than others, and may cause greater pain. Contact a medical professional immediately if any of the following occur:


home care does not bring any relief whatsoever after 24 hoursyou hear a ""popping"" sound during movementyou are incapable of walking or movingthe injury has significant swelling or pain, or a fever accompanies any of your symptoms, For severe injuries, your doctor may recommend a prescription-strength pain medication to help manage the pain. Always follow your doctor's instructions on taking prescription medications, and avoid driving or operating machinery while taking prescription pain medications.Common medications prescribed for injuries include prescription-strength NSAIDs, opioid analgesics, and muscle relaxers, although prescription-strength pain medication is typically reserved for severe, debilitating injuries., In cases of severe muscle injuries, some physical therapy or rehabilitation may be necessary. The oblique muscles are crucial for many types and ranges of movement, and they are often prone to repeat injuries. For some people, especially athletes who are at risk of re-injuring the obliques, rehabilitation sessions with a physical therapist will be recommended by a physician., Surgery is rarely recommended for pulled/strained muscles. However, severe muscle injuries, especially injuries in which the muscle is ruptured, may require surgery to ensure the injury heals properly., Before you can resume your previous levels of physical activity after a lengthy injury, you'll need to regain your strength.It's important to develop a strength-training regimen, either on your own or by coordinating with a physical therapist.


Always stretch before engaging in sports or any kind of physical activity.Never stretch to the point of pain, and continue rehabilitative therapy as needed.

, These stretches work the rectus abdominis, the group of muscles closest to the obliques. Strengthening the rectus abdominis should be a part of your comprehensive oblique rehab plan.While lying flat against the ground facing downward, position your hands directly beneath your shoulders. Keep your feet hip-width apart, your gluteal muscles squeezed, and your spine and neck held straight and level.While keeping your lower body flat against the ground, slowly straighten your arms to raise your upper body.Hold this pose for five seconds, then return to the floor. Complete 10 repetitions, as long as the stretch doesn't cause any pain., Standing stretches are another excellent routine to help strengthen the rectus abdominis. When practiced in conjunction with upward-facing dog and other rehabilitative techniques, standing stretches can help return your normal range of motion after an injury.Stand straight upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Keep your back straight, and raise your hands over your head.Slowly and gently lean to one side until you begin to feel some stretch through your abdomen.Hold that position for five seconds, then switch to the other side. Complete ten repetitions on each side, as long as the stretch does not cause you any pain."

Determine if you are sensitive to certain sounds.,
Interpret your reaction to these sounds.,
Determine if your reaction is misophonia or simply annoyance.,
Ensure that the sounds are real.,
Decide if you have specific trigger sounds.,
Distinguish the difference between misophonia, hyperacusis, and phonophobia.,
Know the triggers.,
Understand that logical reasoning may not help.,
Consult an informed professional.,
Consider some noise reducing options.,
Try some type of behavioral therapy.,
Live a healthy, balanced life.,
Educate other people.",How to See if You Have Misophonia," Any sound can potentially be disturbing to a person with misophonia. Usually, these are sounds that other people don’t even notice or find casually annoying. They are also often sounds that other people make, such as tapping on a table or desk, clicking a pen, chewing food, or lip smacking.If you are overly sensitive to certain sounds, then you may have misophonia.;
, The main difference between someone who suffers from misophonia and someone who has developed another kind of sound sensitivity is the person’s reaction to the sound. Typically, a person with misophonia becomes incensed and completely enraged, often screaming and crying when they encounter these sounds, or struggling with great difficulty to contain their emotions. Ask yourself the following questions:


Do you feel fear, panic, terror, anger, or like you are being caged when you hear the sound?
Do you want to yell at the source to stop or be quiet?
Does the noise cause you to think or act aggressively (fight response)?
Do you feel the need to get away from the source of the sound (flight response)?

, Reactions to trigger sounds can vary in intensity level for people with misophonia. But if you suffer from this condition, you will experience an extreme desire to avoid or eliminate the cause of the trigger sound.People who suffer from misophonia react to these sounds with a fight or flight response. There is an overwhelming need for them to eliminate the cause of the sound or to remove themselves from the source. They can even resort to violence in these instances.If you are simply annoyed by a sound but it is relatively easy for you to ignore it, you probably don’t have misophonia (or perhaps you just have a very mild case of misophonia).

, You may also want to ensure that the sound is actually occurring, such as by asking a friend if her or she can also hear it. If you are hearing a sound that is not there, then you may be having an auditory hallucination. This could indicate a more serious condition, such as schizophrenia.See your doctor right away if you think that you might be hearing sounds that are not really there.

, Trigger sounds are sounds that cause a person with misophonia to experience intense anger or rage, even if the sounds seem miniscule to others. These sounds, to a person with misophonia, are unbearable and they cannot tolerate listening to them.Caution: Some experts believe that simply reading about other trigger sounds can cause them to become trigger sounds for people with misophonia. So if you think you might have this disorder and that learning about trigger sounds could cause future problems for you, then don’t read the following list of trigger sounds.Studies have shown that about 80% of trigger sounds usually involve the mouth in some way. Some common mouth-related trigger sounds include sniffing, heavy breathing, coughing, chewing, sighing, lip smacking, slurping, and raspy voices.
Some other trigger sounds include footsteps, typing on the keyboard, pen clicking, pencil sharpeners, or dogs barking.

, There are several other disorders that can affect a person in similar ways to misophonia. Being able to differentiate between them is an important step in diagnosing misophonia.Hyperacusis is characterized by an abnormal sensitivity to certain volume ranges and frequencies of sound. These sounds can seem painfully loud to a person suffering from this condition. The main difference between hyperacusis and misophonia is that hyperacusis focuses on most sounds in a similar range, while misophonia sufferers can be disturbed by a variety of seemingly unrelated sound types.Phonophobia is a fear of a specific sound, usually loud sounds. For example, if someone feels fear every time they hear the sound of a train, they suffer from phonophobia. This is different from misophonia in that misophonic trigger sounds are not necessarily all linked to a certain object or action. It is not just one sound that can be pinpointed that causes them distress., See if you are extremely bothered by everyday sounds such as: sniffing, breathing, sighing, coughing, gum chewing, lip smacking, chewing, whispering, people's voices, footsteps, sneezing, people singing, dogs barking, metal against metal, pencil sharpeners (electric or handheld), pen clicking, certain consonants (such as P, K, T, or others), raspy voices, squeezing water bottles or cans, drinking, slurping, music, typing on keyboards, birds chirping, and so on.The people who are the closest to sufferers of misophonia are usually the ones who can most easily create these trigger sounds. For some reason, people with misophonia often develop intense reactions to the voices, habits, and sounds made by the people they interact with the most., The adverse reactions to trigger sounds experienced by sufferers of misophonia are not typically affected by reason or logic. The person logically knows that they are overreacting (and they often feel guilt about their response later), but they are often unable, without professional help over time, to alter their behavior even if they understand these things., Many doctors haven't heard of misophonia, but there are methods to help, even though there is no known cure. Doctors can, at the very least, help you navigate the frustrating waters of your disorder. They can also refer you to specialists that can help with counseling and behavioral therapies.


Your doctor will most likely refer you to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or an audiologist.

, Some people find that ear plugs, noise isolating headphones, noise canceling headphones, or ""white noise"" help. These devices can block out the trigger sounds that initiate the negative reactions. However, others find that using these kinds of aids only make their symptoms worse., Some examples of therapies that have been found useful for some who suffer from misophonia include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), neuro-feedback, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), or psycho-therapeutic hypnotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to retrain the brain’s learned negative responses so that the patient can train themselves to respond to stimuli in a more effective, neutral way.Tinnitus retraining therapy focuses on sound therapy in combination with educational counseling during which the specialist attempts to help the patient reclassify certain auditory sounds as neutral rather than distressing or negative., Many people have reported that they are less sensitive to their trigger sounds when they are taking better care of their body, both physically and emotionally. This means that you should try to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and effectively manage the stress in your life.Some good stress management strategies include yoga, meditation, therapy/counseling, and physical exercise.

, People might tell you to ""get over it"" or tell you you'll grow out of it. Misophonia generally lasts a lifetime, getting worse as you get older. Hearing this kind of negativity can cause your emotions to build up, negatively affecting your misophonia. So try your best to calmly educate those around you about the topic.


Don't give advice where it isn't needed.

Try yoga exercises to relieve stress and inflammation.",How to Treat Psoriasis Naturally1," Eating well will alleviate a variety of health problems and reduce inflammation, which is key to controlling psoriasis. There are a few specific guidelines you can follow in order to better treat and reduce the severity of psoriasis.


Avoid fatty red meat, high-fat dairy products, and processed food. All of these foods can increase inflammation throughout the body, worsening psoriasis.
Eat whole foods instead. Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, broccoli, and strawberries.;
, Your body can easily digest omega-3 fatty acids.. These fatty acids can also help the immune system to stop sending the wrong signals to your skin and reduces inflammation, which makes it an important part of any person’s diet who is dealing with psoriasis. You can find omega-3 fatty acids in foods like:


Sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash.

, Foods covered in oil are not very easy to digest. Fried and greasy foods are also generally very high in fat; fat can clog your arteries as it is not easy for your body to digest.You should also limit your intake of processed and refined foods.

, Following a gluten-free diet may help to reduce psoriasis for those with a gluten allergy or Celiac disease. Some studies have shown a reduction in psoriasis symptoms for those following a gluten-free diet. However, before eliminating gluten you should consult with a medical professional and get a blood test to assess whether or not you have an intolerance to gluten.

, To speed up your body’s elimination of toxins, you can try doing a detox. Doing this will allow your bowel to rest so that the swelling can go down and your skin can become healthy again. While you can choose different detoxes, a three day detox may work when you are dealing with psoriasis. Limit your diet to:


Lots of water, broths, soups, juices
Fresh fruits
Green vegetables
Nuts

, Drinking lots of water can help to flush out your system by eliminating toxins through your urine. It can also help to keep your skin moisturized.While everyone has a different amount of water that they should drink, women generally need 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water, while men need 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water., Avoiding cigarettes and other tobacco products will help to reduce the effects of psoriasis. Studies have indicated that people who continue smoking will have more frequent and worse plaques than non-smokers. , Yoga can help reduce inflammation throughout the body, aiding in the reduction of psoriasis symptoms. Yoga combines many types of exercise, including stretching and strengthening.


Yoga can improve your mood, flexibility, breathing and reduce stress, weakness, anxiety and depression."

Get some sun to produce vitamin D. Sun exposure is the main catalyst for vitamin D production within the body.,
Consume vitamin D-rich foods.,
Consume zinc to promote skin cell health.,
Apply aloe vera to reduce skin irritation.,
Try drinking almond milk.",How to Treat Psoriasis Naturally2," Vitamin D is crucial to healthy skin regeneration and normal cell growth. Spending some time each day in the sun can help you get the recommended daily amount of vitamin D. For best (and safest) results, follow these tips:


Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen to all areas of unaffected skin.
Wear sunglasses.
Limit time in the sun to under 20 minutes, to reduce the risk of sun damage.
If you experience redness or dryness, reduce time of exposure.

, Consuming foods rich in Vitamin D will reduce inflammation throughout the body. In combination with UV rays from light exposure, vitamin D can help to reduce or prevent psoriasis plaques. Sun exposure triggers most vitamin D production in the body. Vitamin D can also be found naturally in a few foods such as fortified milk and juice, fortified yogurt, salmon, tuna, egg yolks, and Swiss cheese.Additionally, you can take an oral vitamin D supplement to bolster your intake.
The daily recommended amount of vitamin D is:

600 IU daily for adults between 19-70.
800 IU daily for adults older than 70.



, Zinc is a vital nutrient for the proper formation and growth of skin cells. Psoriasis causes increased scaling of skin cells, reducing the amount of healthy skin cells. Zinc intake will promote healthy growth of skin cells. Zinc is high in seafood, wheat germ, cereals, spinach, nuts, beans, and mushrooms. The recommended daily intake of Zinc for adults is 11 milligrams for men and 8 milligrams for women.


Zinc can also be purchased as a dietary supplement for those whose diets do not include the recommended daily amount.

, Aloe is used for many skin conditions, including psoriasis. Aloe vera gel or cream can applied externally three times a day. Aloe vera soothes and moisturizes the skin, reducing redness, itching and burning.

, Almond milk is rich in vitamins B and E, both of which can help to return your skin to a healthy state.In addition to containing vitamins, it also contains monounsaturated fatty acids, protein, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and iron."

Use oils to reduce dryness, scaling, and itching.,
Try lemon juice to remove flakes and moisturize the skin.,
Use coal tar to reduce the size and pain of skin lesions.,
Incorporate turmeric into your diet.",How to Treat Psoriasis Naturally3," Adding a quarter cup of Epsom salt to your warm bath for ten or fifteen minutes will aid in relieving the inflammation and removing flakes. The salted water also acts as an antiseptic, reducing any secondary infections that may occur on the scaling patches of psoriasis and arresting the bacterial growth on open cuts.


Remember to reapply any moisturizers after finishing your bath to avoid skin dryness.

, Apple cider vinegar is an age old disinfectant used by many people. It can relieve itching of the scalp due to psoriasis, but it should not be applied on open wounds and cuts because it can cause intense irritation.

, Capsaicin, found in cayenne peppers, can reduce the itching and burning sensation caused by psoriasis. It can be purchased in cream form, and works by temporarily affecting nerves to block the pain sensation.


As an alternative to a topical cream, you may add cayenne peppers to your meals, which may provide enough capsaicin to keep the burning pain at bay.

, The active ingredients of paraffin can help reduce the spread of psoriasis plaques. Additionally, paraffin prevents loss of moisture from the skin and helps keep the plaques moist, reducing itching. You may apply soft white paraffin as often as you need each day.


Paraffin is also available over the counter as a cream.

, Applying oils can help to moisturize the skin and reduce the effects of scaling.


Coconut oil can reduce skin dryness and reduce the scaling and peeling of the skin. Coconut oil can also soothe the cracks and cuts caused by psoriasis. You may apply coconut oil 2-3 times per day to keep the itching under control.
Second to coconut oil, olive oil is the best oil to reduce dryness and itching. Olive oil is best used for the scabs and plaques of scaling.

, Applying lemon juice to the skin can remove flakes and moisturize skin when applied for about ten minutes, then washed away with warm water. This therapy can be repeated for about three weeks, or you can simply drink lemon juice throughout the day. Eventually, your skin flakes may become thinner and less rigid.

, Coal tar can reduce psoriasis pain and the size of skin lesions, by gentle exfoliating. It can be found in some shampoos, bath solutions and cream forms. However, coal tar has an offensive odor and can stain skin.

, Turmeric is a spice that has a powerful anti inflammatory effect.You can simply add it to your diet, using it on chicken, meat, or even rice recipes.


Turmeric can also be applied directly in a paste form, by mixing one teaspoonful of turmeric powder with about three tablespoonfuls of water, mixing until you have a thick paste. This paste can be applied to the affected areas for about 30 minutes then washed away.

Avoid picking at granulomas.,
Get a silver nitrate treatment.",How to Treat Pyogenic Granuloma1," In some cases, your doctor may suggest leaving a smaller pyogenic granuloma to heal on its own.You may also receive a prescription for a topical medication to apply to the granuloma. The two topical medications for which you may receive a prescription are:


Timolol, a gel often used on children and for granulomasImiquimod, which stimulates the immune system to release cytokinesSilver nitrate, which your doctor may apply;
, Clean the area that you plan to treat to remove any bacteria at the site or on your surrounding skin. Gently wash with a mild, unscented soap and warm water. It’s common for pyogenic granuloma to bleed easily and you shouldn’t be scared by this; however, if you are treating someone else, be sure you are wearing gloves to protect yourself from exposure to their blood.


Consider using an antiseptic solution to clean the area if you like, though soap and water disinfects just as well.
Dry off your skin around the granuloma by patting it. This can prevent excessive bleeding.

, If your doctor has prescribed you imiquimod or timolol, apply the treatment gently to the affected area. Repeat as many times per day as your doctor prescribes.


Be sure to use as little pressure as possible when dabbing the medication on your granuloma. This can minimize any bleeding that may occur.
Follow the instructions for application by your doctor, who will determine the proper dosage. Let your doctor know if you experience any reactions to the medication.

, Because skin affected by granuloma tends to bleed easily, it is important to keep it clean, dry, and protected. You can do this by keeping it covered with a non-adhesive sterile bandage until any bleeding stops, which may be one to two days or longer.Hold the bandage in place with medical tape. Apply it to the bandage on an area of your skin that is not affected by the granuloma.
Ask your doctor how long you should keep the granuloma covered.
Change your dressing at least every other day or when it is soiled. It is important to do this because a dirty bandage could lead to a secondary infection.

, It may be tempting to pick at a granuloma or crust that may form over it. You should avoid doing this because it could spread bacteria or injure healing skin. Allow the granuloma to complete it’s course of topical treatment and consult your doctor if you notice any potential problems., Your doctor may opt to apply a silver nitrate to your granuloma. This will chemically cauterize, or burn off, your granuloma.This antiseptic solution can help with bleeding and may effectively reduce your pyogenic granuloma.Watch for severe reactions to silver nitrate treatments such as black scabs and skin ulcerations. See your doctor as soon as possible to prevent infection or further injury.

Remove and prevent granulomas with curettage.,
Consider cryotherapy.,
Undergo surgical excision.,
Consider laser surgery.",How to Treat Pyogenic Granuloma2," Surgical removal is the most common treatment for granulomas, as there is a lower rate of recurrence with surgery.Many doctors remove granulomas with curettage and cauterization. This involves scraping off the granuloma with a tool called a curette and then cauterizing the surrounding blood vessels to minimize the chances of regrowth. It may also help stop bleeding.After the procedure you should:


Keep the wound dry for 48 hours
Change your dressing daily
Apply pressure by securing a bandage and tape to the site, which can prevent bleeding
Watch for signs of infection including severe redness, swelling, severe pain, fever, and discharge from the wound, Your doctor may also suggest cryotherapy, especially for smaller lesions.This treatment involves freezing off granulomas with liquid nitrogen. The low temperature of the treatment can reduce cell growth and inflammation through vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels.Observe your wound after the treatment and follow any instructions from your doctor. A granuloma wound caused by cryotherapy generally heals within seven to 14 days. Pain will generally last for three days.

, If you have large or recurrent granuloma, your doctor may suggest excising them. This treatment has the highest cure rates.This procedure involves removing the granuloma and its related blood vessels to reduce the risk of it growing back. Your doctor may also send a small sample to a lab to examine for any possible malignancy.Allow your doctor mark the excision site with a surgical marker. This won’t stain your skin. They will then anesthetize the site to minimize any discomfort you may have. After this, the doctor will remove the granuloma with a scalpel and/or sharp scissors. You may smell some burning if the doctor uses cautery to stop bleeding, but this won’t harm you. If necessary, you may get stitches at the excision incision site.

, Some doctors may suggest laser surgery to remove the lesion and burn its base or shrink smaller granulomas.Consider this procedure before getting it, as it is not necessarily better at removing or preventing pyogenic granulomas as surgical excision.Talk to your doctor about the benefits of laser surgery over surgical excision for your granuloma. Ask any questions you may have about the procedure including about healing, care, and recurrence.

Bandage the surgical site.,
Change the bandages regularly.,
Wash your hands.,
Clean the wound.,
Use pain relievers.",How to Treat Pyogenic Granuloma3," The surgeon or doctor may have you cover the area where your granuloma was removed. This helps protect the wound from infection and can absorb any blood or fluid leakage.Put on a new covering with light pressure if you experience any bleeding. If you have a lot of bleeding, contact your doctor.
Wear the bandage for at least one day after your medical professional removes the granuloma. Keep the wound as dry as you can, which helps it heal and keeps bacteria out of the site. Avoid showering for at least a day after the procedure, unless your doctor advises that it is safe., Change the bandage a day after the procedure, or sooner if necessary. The bandage keeps the site clean and dry. It can also minimize the risk of infection or serious scarring.Use bandages that let your skin breathe. Air flow can promote healing. You can get breathable bandages at most drug stores and at many grocery stores. Your doctor may also provide you with dressings for the wound.
Change the bandage until you see no open wounds or as instructed by your doctor. You may only need to keep the area bandaged for one day.

, Washing your hands is important any time you touch the site or change the bandages. This reduces the risk of infection or scarring.Wash with warm water and a soap of your choice. Lather your hands for at least twenty seconds., It’s important for healing and preventing infection to keep the surgical site clean. Wash the area daily with a mild cleanser or soap, which can get rid of any bacteria on your skin.Use the same soap and water to clean the site that you would on your hands. Stay away from scented cleansers to avoid irritation. Rinse the site thoroughly with warm water.
Dab on a bit of hydrogen peroxide if your doctor instructs you or if you see any redness that may be an infection.Pat the wound dry before putting on the covering., Any type of surgical removal may cause mild pain or tenderness at the removal site. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever to relieve discomfort and decrease any swelling. Ibuprofen, naproxen sodium or acetaminophen can reduce any discomfort. Ibuprofen may also minimize swelling.Get a prescription for pain medication if you have severe pain.

Treat the symptoms.,
Hydrate often.,
Take medication.,
Keep in mind that there is no cure.,
Be aware that the symptoms may contradict one another.,
Take steps to regulate your hormone levels.,
Recognize the difference between PMS and something more serious.",How to Treat Nausea and Diarrhea During Your Period," Chronic nausea that coincides with monthly menstruation suggests that PMS is the culprit. But there are other causes for nausea, some more serious than others. If your nausea symptoms do not go away after menstruation or become more serious, then see a doctor. Some common causes of nausea include:


Medication Inducement: People with sensitive stomachs often have to take medications or vitamins with a small meal or a glass of milk to prevent nausea. If you are currently taking a new medication, consider whether your discomfort is related to that medication.
Emotional stress: Are you experiencing a serious personal tragedy or period of intense stress? This can often cause nausea symptoms and absence of appetite.
Gastrointestinal infection, or “Stomach Flu”: These are normally short term and produce nausea, diarrhea, cramping, and vomiting as the primary symptoms. If these symptoms are intense and last for more than 24 hours, it could be a sign of something more serious.
Pregnancy: Although it is rare, sometimes women can be pregnant and still have a period. Since nausea is a common symptom of early pregnancy, you may want to ensure that you are not pregnant by taking a pregnancy test.
Heartburn: Nausea can also be caused by heartburn. If you have a burning sensation along with your nausea, then you may have heartburn.;
, There is no cure for PMS, but it is possible to treat symptoms like nausea with lifestyle accommodations.Eat only small, bland meals. You need nourishment, even while nauseous. Eating small meals ensures that you do not add to stomach discomfort. Try something like dry toast, crackers, jello, applesauce, or chicken soup.
Avoid strong odors. Perfumes, certain types of cooking, and smoke all compound the symptoms of nausea. Avoid environments where these are present.
Restrict travel. Motion sickness causes nausea and can exacerbate existing symptoms. If you must travel, ride in the driver’s or front passenger seat of the car as this decreases the chance for motion sickness.
Eat ginger. Crystalized ginger, ginger chews, and ginger tea all contain the active elements of the ginger plant that can soothe the symptoms of nausea.Try peppermint. Peppermint oil in capsule form and peppermint tea are useful for relieving symptoms of indigestion that accompany nausea.Drink chamomile tea. Chamomile has a relaxing effect on muscles and nerves and can relieve stomach cramping associated with nausea or vomiting., There are a variety of over the counter products designed to address symptoms associated with nausea. Below are some examples:


Phosphorated carbohydrate: Infused into a glucose syrup, phosphoric acid has a soothing, analgesic effect on the stomach lining, reducing discomfort associated with nerve irritation.Antacid: In chewable or liquid form, antacid can neutralize stomach acid associated with nausea or upset stomach. Note that if you are suffering from an acid reflux disorder, your doctor may prescribe medication that treats the same symptoms.
Dimenhydrinate: Found in medications for motions sickness, this blocks the brain receptors associated with vomiting., If you experience diarrhea that extends after menstruation or that becomes chronic in nature, contact a doctor immediately. Some common causes of diarrhea are:Accidentally eating spoiled food. Avoid buffet restaurants with heat trays, check all dairy-based food and condiments before use, and be sure to clean left overs out of the refrigerator on a weekly basis to avoid ingesting spoiled foods.
Food allergies. Food allergies can develop at any point in our life and cause digestive irritation. Some of the most common, like lactose-intolerance or Celiac’s Disease reveals themselves with chronic, mysterious diarrhea.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Caused by intensive, long-term stress and tension, IBS is most common in women and can be triggered by spicy foods, heavy meals, fried foods, and large amounts of fiber or vegetable matter.

, Hormonally-induced diarrhea that accompanies PMS is not curable in and of itself, but there are ways to treat the symptoms and decrease discomfort.


Eat yogurt. Yogurt contains microbial cultures that help regulate our gut fauna and aid digestion. If you are prone for episodes of indigestion or diarrhea, use yogurt as a way to regulate your symptoms.If yu are not a fan of yogurt, then you may consider taking a probiotic.
Avoid fast food and caffeine. Fast food has a tendency to cause diarrhea due to fat content, meaning it can make hormonally-induced diarrhea worse. Additionally, caffeine has a laxative effect for many people, exacerbating existing digestive troubles.Exercise. Regular exercise increases blood flow and has been shown to reduce the hormonal symptoms associated with PMS, including cramping and bloating. It is thought that hormonally-induced diarrhea can also be suppressed as a result.Exercising can also cause your body to release endorphins, which can improve your mood., Diarrhea causes considerable water loss and, without proper hydration, can actually induce complications of dehydration. Being dehydrated can also lead to more pain. When experiencing frequent diarrhea, carry a water bottle with you and try to drink as much water as your body is losing.Try to drink 8 to 13 eight ounce glasses of water daily. If you are having diarrhea, then you may need to drink more water than this.

, As long as you are not suffering from a bacterial infection, then taking an antidiarrheal medicine may help. There are over the counter treatments for diarrhea that prevent bowel expression and can help you go about normal, daily activities while coping with PMS. The two most common medications include:Lopermide: This medication acts to slow down gut function. This means that a greater amount of water has the chance to reabsorb during digestion.Bismuth subsalicylate: This medication reduces inflammation of the digestive tract, limits the growth of certain harmful bacteria, and limits digestive secretions., Researchers have concluded that PMS results of changing hormone levels due to menstruation; however, they do not fully understand why some women are more sensitive than others and manifest a different set of symptoms that other premenstrual women.You may have symptoms similar to a female relative. Try talking to your mother, older sister, or an aunt about how her periods are/were. She may also be able to offer suggestions about what worked best to manage her symptoms.

, Different bodies react to hormones and their varying amounts in different ways. For some women, PMS is a source of constipation; for others, diarrhea. Some women experience aggression, others report episodes of crying and helplessness.


Tune into your symptoms. Especially if you have a strong reaction to PMS, begin a symptom journal and keep track of your menstruation. Note when you have a new or different symptom. Part of coping with the discomfort of PMS is predicting when it will occur and taking health or mood precautions to cope.
Try keeping a journal to track your symptoms. Tracking your symptoms may help your doctor to recommend the best treatment methods for you.

, Hormonal birth control, such as the pill, the patch, a cervical ring, or an injection can help regulate fluctuating hormones and decrease the frequency and severity of PMS symptoms. See your doctor or a gynecologist to talk about what options are right for you.

, Other serious illnesses, like Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and Endometriosis share key symptoms with PMS. If you are experiencing nausea and diarrhea in combination with any of the following symptoms, see a doctor immediately.Chronic, severe abdominal pain.
Fever
Excessive bleeding.
Pain during urination or bowel movements.
Intense fatigue.
Abnormal vaginal discharge.

Look for minor causes.,
Examine your medications.,

Wait for petechiae to heal.",How to Treat Pinpoint Petechiae," One cause of petechiae is straining too much for too long. For instance, a long coughing fit or an overemotional bout of crying can lead to petechiae. You can also get petechiae from vomiting or straining while lifting weights. It's also a common symptom to have after you've given birth., Certain medications can be the cause of petechiae. For instance, anticoagulants such as warfarin and heparin can cause petechiae. Similarly, drugs in the naproxen family, such as Aleve, Anaprox, and Naprosyn can also cause petechiae.A few other drugs that can cause petechiae include quinine, penicillin, nitrofurantoin, carbamazepine, desipramine, indomethacin, and atropine.If you think one of your medications is causing petechiae, talk to your doctor. She can evaluate whether you need to be on that particular medicine or whether you can switch to something else.

, Specific infectious diseases can also lead to this problem. Anything from a bacterial infection to a fungal infection can cause petechiae, such as mononucleosis, scarlet fever, strep throat, meningococcemia, as well as a number of less common infectious organisms., Petechiae can also be a symptom of other diseases that disrupt appropriate blood clotting, such as leukemia and other bone marrow cancers.It can also be the result of a vitamin c deficiency (also known as scurvy) or a vitamin k deficiency, as both are required for proper blood clotting.It's worth noting that some treatments, such as chemotherapy, can also result in petechiae., This disease causes you to have clotting problems. It does so by taking away some of your platelets, which are found in your blood.Doctors do not know the exact mechanism by which this occurs, hence the term ""idiopathic"" (a word that indicates the cause is unknown).


This disease can lead to petechiae and purpura because platelets usually work to plug up any small tears in your blood vessels. When you don't have enough platelets, your blood can't repair vessels properly, leading to bleeding underneath the skin. That can cause small red spots, petechiae, or larger blood spots, called purpura., If you are a healthy person experiencing new onset petechiae for no reason (you haven't been vomiting, straining, or doing something else that would easily explain the condition), you should see a doctor about it.Though petechiae usually go away on their own if you don't have another disease, it's best to find out if they have an underlying cause.It's especially important to take your child to the doctor if she gets petechiae for no reason that you can see, and if it covers a large part of her body., If you have an infection or disease that causes your petechiae, the best way to treat the petechiae is to try to cure the disease. Your doctor can help you decide what medication is best for your disease., In older people who's blood clotting system is naturally less effective, even minor trauma can cause significant petechiae. One way to prevent petechia if you're older is to try to avoid trauma. Of course, sometimes you can't avoid an injury, but do not take unnecessary risks.For instance, if you have trouble balancing properly, consider using a cane or walker.

, This may cause petechiae due to trauma, injury, or straining to disappear, but it will not treat any underlying conditions which cause petechiae. Cold can help cut down on inflammation and can help reduce future petechiae, as well.To make a cold compress, wrap an ice pack in a washcloth or towel and hold it against the area with petechiae 15 to 20 minutes or less if you can't stand it that long. Do not put an ice pack directly on your skin, as it can cause damage to your skin.
You can also just use cool water on a washcloth held up to the area.

, The main way to get rid of petechiae is to wait for them to heal on their own. Once you treat the underlying cause, the petechiae should fade away."

Ask your doctor about chelation therapy.,
Begin a low-protein diet.,
Take medications to moderate the effects of kidney damage.,
Begin dialysis.,
Get a kidney transplant.",How to Treat Lead Associated Kidney Disease1," This is one of the few treatments of kidney disease that can improve kidney function, rather than merely masking the symptoms. It is specifically used for patients who have been exposed to lead.For the procedure, a synthetic chemical will be injected into your body, flushing out heavy metals, including lead.This is principally useful if you currently have lead in your system, which is negatively impacting your kidney function. If your kidney issues are the result of historic exposure to lead, chelation therapy might not be productive.;
, Protein creates waste products that your kidney can have trouble processing. For moderate kidney damage, a doctor will usually begin by limiting your consumption of foods like meat, eggs, nuts, and beans. You should talk to a professional dietician about how to manage your new diet., Doctors will focus on trying to mitigate the side-effects of kidney damage, while the kidney hopefully begins repairing itself. This will mean the implementation of a heavy drug regimen, intended to moderate the impact of kidney disease.Expect to take medications for high blood pressure, cholesterol, anemia, swelling, and bone health.

, When your kidneys are no longer able to process out toxins, you will need to begin dialysis. On average, you will spend four hours a week at the hospital, where a dialysis machine can process out toxins.Dialysis patients will also need to alter their diets. Typically, they will be asked to limit the amount of sodium, potassium, and phosphorous that they consume. Your doctor should recommend a dietician who can recommend diet changes., Generally, a new kidney is the only way to permanently fix kidney failure. Even after this procedure, you will need to remain on medication that ensures your body does not reject the kidney."

Leave any job that exposes you to lead.,
Have your house professionally tested and treated.,
Test for lead in your water.",How to Treat Lead Associated Kidney Disease2," Stained glass artists, metal smelters, battery factory workers, and home remodelers are at risk of exposure to lead. If you test positive for lead and show signs of kidney failure, you should immediately discontinue these careers.Occupational exposure is the most likely cause of lead-related nephrotoxicity. Most other types of exposure are not consistent or or long-term enough to cause kidney failure, but there are exceptions.

, Homes built in the United States before 1978 often used lead paint, which, if it is chipping, can be a dangerous source of exposure to lead. This problem is too serious for a DIY solution. Call a professional to inspect the house and clean it, if a problem is identified., Your local water authority should have a list of laboratories that are certified to test your water for lead. After getting recommendations, contact the laboratory and ask for details about testing.

Tests should cost between $20 and $100.If there is lead in your water, it might be because of plumbing in your house. In that case, you will need to have your pipes replaced.

Watch for signs of kidney failure.,
Get tested for kidney failure.,
Ask a doctor to have your blood tested for lead.",How to Treat Lead Associated Kidney Disease3," Many people notice few symptoms of kidney failure. If they do, they often pertain to changes in urinary habits, because the kidneys are essential to these functions. Symptoms include:High blood pressure (especially if it appears at a young age or doesn't respond to treatment)
Decreased urine output
Retaining fluid, resulting in swelling in legs, ankles, or feet.
Drowsiness
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Confusion
Nausea
Chest pain or pressure

, There are both urine and blood tests, known as ACR and GFR tests, which can determine if you have kidney failure. You will need to take the tests several times over a period of three months to establish with certainty that the results were not a false positive., Unfortunately, the lead test will only establish if you are currently exposed to unhealthy amounts of lead, not if you were exposed to lead in the past, which contributed to your kidney issues. However, historic exposure to lead will not influence your treatment.Conversely, if the test establishes that you are currently exposed to lead, then you will need to be proactive in identifying and eliminating the source of this lead exposure. You should also consider chelation therapy to flush out the lead currently in your body.Lead is not one of the more common causes for kidney disease, so you might need to inform your doctor if you are subject to special risk factors and need to be tested.

Take classes to learn self, couple or baby massage.",How to Use Massage for Overall Health," Massage is seen as a complimentary therapy to both medicine and sports. You can arrange the frequency, practitioner and type of massage that will most likely be helpful to your condition.


Massage is not recommended for people suffering from burns, blood clots, some cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, fractures and other joint problems.;
, It differs greatly depending upon the type of benefit you would like to receive. Begin with the more gentle types of massage and move into deeper forms if they prove to be more beneficial.


Swedish massage is perhaps the most commonly known type of massage. It is used for relaxation with long gentle strokes and circular motions. Many couples or people find that they can become adept at self or partner massage with these techniques and use them as needed in the home.

, The sports trainer usually targets the areas most affected by the sport, such as the legs and arms.

Deep tissue massages use kneading and other methods to pull deeply at the muscles and connective tissues. This is often used to break up scar tissue or help sports injuries to heal properly.






Trigger point therapy is a growing type of massage that is similar to acupressure. The therapist uses hand techniques and implements to release tight knots from overused muscles.






Ayurvedic massage is an Indian technique that focuses on developing a plan for treatment for the chakras, or energy points. This massage often includes hot oil used on the ears, face and other areas. It may also include detoxification routines and other medical treatment.






Biofeedback massage is used to help manage stress and change improper ways of moving the body. Light, guided imagery and deep breathing are used to break patterns. This is often used to treat mental as well as physical problems.






Chair massage is not a specific type of massage, but it is often used instead of a table to open up the muscles in the shoulder, neck, and back. The therapist has better access to these points on the body as you lean forward and rest your arms and neck in a specially-designed chair.






Tui Na is a popular type of Chinese massage. It is used widely in China and is gaining popularity in the Western world. Practitioners of this type of massage claim to use over 300 types of manipulation to help the body. They can include gentle strokes, cupping (percussion), pressing, shaking and waving.







, You do not need to have a specific problem to engage in regular massage for health benefits. Many types of massage are found to boost the immune system, calm anxiety, prevent stress, stop depression and more.

, Ask for a doctor's recommendation for a back or neck massage specialist. Improper manipulation of the vertebrae can hurt, rather than help.


Several studies have shown that regular massage is more beneficial to back pain relief than placebos and acupuncture for chronic neck and back pain relief. Results were noticeable soon after the treatment, so regular treatment is recommended.

, After you have found what type of massage is most beneficial to your condition, and this may take some considerate amount of trial, you should return to the same physical therapist. Like a doctor, these masseuses keep charts on your pain, required therapy and results of treatment.

, This can help you to cue in on the most beneficial treatments.

, Although a massage from time to time may be enough, many people find regular intervals of massage are good for preventative medicine, pain management and stress relief. You may need to go more often in the beginning and then make fewer appointments as your stress or pain subsides.

, Self-massage techniques can prove to be excellent stress relievers. A night course can teach you how to perform kneading, rolfing and trigger point therapy.


You can also rent videos that instruct you on how to do self-massage and baby massage. Acupressure and foot massage are especially beneficial for stress relief.

Find out if you have any other diseases that might make you more susceptible to LA.,
Contact your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about getting a Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) test.,
Confirm the results.",How to Treat Lupus Anticoagulant Antibodies1," Although there may not be any at all, some symptoms include having had one or more unexplained miscarriages,stroke, heart attack, and/or blood clots in the legs or lungs (clots may also occur in the brain, renal vein, or arteries)., If you suffer from something such as lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic infections, or tumors, you may be more likely to develop LA.Keep in mind that LA may develop at any time. Just because you didn’t have it 10 years ago, doesn’t mean you don’t have it now.

, If you experience any of the following symptoms contact your doctor immediately, as it could be an indication that a potentially life threatening blood clot has formed:Swelling and redness in your legs.
Shortness of breath.
Pain, numbness, or loss of color in an arm or leg.

, If you are having symptoms, or feel that you are susceptible to LA, a PTT test can determine whether or not you have anticoagulant antibodies present in your blood. Using a needle, blood is collected from a vein (usually the arm) and placed in a specimen container. A chemical is then added to the blood sample to measure how long it takes for the blood to clot.Certain medications may affect the test results, so you should be sure to tell your doctor about any prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking to ensure you receive accurate results.

, If you receive an abnormal result in your PTT test, your doctor will likely order further testing to confirm the results. Some examples include the Russell viper venom time test, and the thromboplastin inhibition test.These tests may be repeated more than once to monitor the development of LA, especially if you have also been diagnosed with Lupus."

Recognize your responsibility as a reviewer.Once your review is posted online, it can influence someone in their choice to be treated by that doctor.,
Evaluate your reasons for writing the review.,
Take proactive measures when appropriately angry.,
Resist bribes to write a positive review.,
Remember that your doctor is a person.,
Focus your review on your own experience.,
Refrain from writing a review when angry.,
Be specific with your review.,
Avoid attacking individuals while reviewing.,
Write your review so it is short and to the point.,
End the review with a clear conclusion.",How to Write an Online Review of Your Doctor," In some cases, people with terminal diseases may need help from that doctor, but may avoid visiting her for treatment because of your review.


It's not an exaggeration to say that your review very well could have an impact on the life-or-death decision of another person.
Before reviewing, ask yourself the question, ""Should my review be used by someone to make a choice that could affect their life or health?"" If no, you probably shouldn't write a review.;
, You should avoid writing a review if you feel pressured to do so. Sometimes, doctors may have a tablet or iPad in their office to try to corner you into giving a good review. When cornered:Claim you can't remember your password for general media platforms, like Google and Facebook, which often require you to login before writing a review.
Apologize for not being able to write the review. Then use an excuse, like an appointment you're running late for.
Remember that your time is valuable. Doctor's appointments tend to run late. You might tell staff at the doctor's office that because your appointment took too long, you don't have time to write a review.

, In some cases, you may have a very good reason for being angry. There may have been a serious breach of your trust or possibly mistreatment. These sorts of issues should not be resolved through online reviews.


Serious issues with your doctor should be resolved with direct action. This might involve speaking with the doctor personally, contacting the local medical society, or filing a complaint with the state licensing board., Doctors may offer a discount to you if your write a positive review. While this discount can be tempting, it could have just as negative an effect as writing an angry review. Remember, people's lives and health may be influenced by your online review.


If a doctor tries to bribe you in some way to write a positive review, you may want to change doctors., Although doctors tend to be looked at as wealthy, they also tend to have considerable debt from medical school. This doesn't include things like insurance and personal expenses. Your negative review, in the right context, could potentially ruin somebody's career.


Due to the fact that many people only visit the doctor when sick, you may not be feeling well, which may lead to an unfair evaluation. In these situations, wait until you're feeling better before writing a review.
Differentiate between ""nice"" and ""competent."" You may not want to give a nice doctor a bad review, but if he's a bad doctor, your review will be helpful to other users.Before writing a review, ask yourself, ""If this or a similar review was given to me at my job, would I feel it was fair?"" If your answer is no, you probably shouldn't write a review., When you're upset about something, it's common to bring up other things you've heard or read that support your experience. But even if those things are true, saying something like, ""I've heard from many people that ,"" makes it sound like you're inventing people to make your story more believable., You may have a very good reason for being angry. Even so, anger can make you say things you don't mean or exaggerate things because you're heated. To calm down enough to write your review:


Use anger management techniques to calm down.

Calm down with breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques.Do physical activity, like running, weight lifting, and so on., While doing so, try to be as objective as possible. General or vague criticisms like, ""She doesn't know what she's doing,"" or, ""She's a genius,"" won't be helpful to other users. Be accurate when describing what happened; lying could result in libel charge being brought against you.Libel is where a published false statement harms another person's reputation. In some cases, there can be serious legal ramifications for this.You can make your review seem more objective to removing adjectives that relate to your emotions., Singling out one person can make it seem like you're targeting them for revenge. This can cause other users to take your review less seriously. Also, if you write a negative review about a specific person (like a receptionist at the office), if she leaves or gets promoted, your review will be even less significant., Reviews that are too long may seem daunting to other users. This can result in them skipping over your review, which defeats the purpose of the review process. Only provide information that is relevant to your situation., This could be something specific that might be useful to someone with a similar condition, like diabetes. Saying, ""Dr. Smith helped me get my diabetes under control,"" would be very helpful for anyone who has diabetes. Other examples of specific conclusions include:


""Dr. Wilson doesn't like prescribing pain meds. If you are in need of pain relief, try somewhere else.""
""Dr. Steele is a great doctor but she consistently runs late. If you live or work on a tight schedule, try another doctor."""
"
Explain why you began the research.This section should explain in a sentence or two what inspired the research.,
State your project’s goals and expectations.,
Outline your methods.This section basically answers the question, “How did you investigate the topic or problem?” Structured medical abstracts provide a specific section where methodology can be explored in detail over five or six sentences.Be careful not to over-describe.,
Summarize your findings.State the results of the research in six to eight brief sentences.,
Conclude the abstract.The conclusion should be composed of one or two sentences that help the reader understand the results and implications of your research.",How to Write a Medical Abstract2," What problems remained unsolved by previous research? Demonstrate why the question needs to be answered, and how it has not been answered, or has been only inadequately answered in the past.


For instance, you might write, “Livingston (2009) has demonstrated the efficacy of nucleotide reparation in E. Coli UBPs.”

, After stating the background or inspiration to the research, state your own research goals and hypotheses. This emphasizes your honesty and objectivity as a researcher up front. Be direct and succinct when stating your goals and hypotheses.


For instance, you might write, “Our hypothesis was that medication X was superior in treating epilepsy than medication Y.”
Some medical abstracts do not require a background section. In an abstract without a background section, you will start the body of your abstract with information on the goals and expectations of your research., If you utilized a common procedure or technique, simply say that you used it, do not go into great depth about the technique or procedure itself.There are several areas related to your methods that you should address, including:Setting — Where did you conduct your research?
Sample size —How many individuals participated in the research? How were they selected? This includes animal populations as well.
Design — How were measurements and statistics recorded?
Variables — What were the specific variables you looked at? How did you account for them?
Interventions — How did you intervene to manipulate the variables?

, Use specific numbers and statistics when reporting your findings. For instance, you might write, “Use of the medication resulted in a 30% decline in mortality rate.” Support all of the findings with hard data and, if appropriate, brief narratives about experiences or outcomes.


Do not provide interpretation of your results in this section. Interpretation and analysis should be saved for the conclusion.
Do not include tables or charts in your abstract. These should be included in the main body of the paper.

, Connect the results of the study to the methods used to attain them, and to the original research question. This is a place to discuss whether your hypothesis was correct and whether the original purpose was achieved. You should basically be addressing the question, “Did your research and findings produce the answer you expected?” Summarize significant implications your research may have and recommend further research, if necessary.

Choose a title.Your title should express the specific topic or methodology you’re publishing about.,
List the authors.Directly following the title, you should list the author or authors.,
Edit your abstract.When the medical abstract is completed, your peers will be looking for originality, scientific merit, clinical significance, and whether it is appropriate for the audience of educated medical staff professionals for which it is intended.",How to Write a Medical Abstract3," Don’t select a title that announces results. This may bias readers against your conclusions or discoveries. Instead, select a title that is objective and describes the problem your research explores.


For instance, “New Corticosteroids Provide Asthma Relief” is a poor abstract title.
“Corticosteroid Treatment in Asthmatic Patients,” on the other hand, is a good title.
Don’t use puns or jokes in your title. This may make your work seem trivial and unimportant.

, Guidelines specific to the publication or organization will dictate how the authors’ names should be listed. Some abstracts place the first name after the last (“Smith, John”) while others place the first and last names in their natural order (“John Smith”).


Some abstracts expect you to list all authors in alphabetical order according to their last names.
Other publications might expect you to list authors of increasing seniority toward the end of the author list. In this arrangement, the study’s lead researcher or team mentor would be listed last.
You might also need to list each author’s credentials. For instance, you might need to write “John Smith MD”
The title and authors should be listed at the top of the abstract, and before the main information of the abstract.

,


Additionally, remember to proofread your work. Spelling errors, typos and grammatical mistakes will discredit your hard work and research.
It might help to read the abstract out loud to yourself to make sure it sounds right before submitting it. Ask a colleague to read over it for you to ensure it is easy to understand and makes sense.
After you’ve edited the abstract, submit it to the appropriate journal, professional society, or conference committee for approval.

Discuss a treatment plan with your doctor.,
Consider anticoagulant therapy to reduce the effect of the antibodies.,
Talk with your doctor about using steroids to lower antibody levels.,
Consider utilizing plasmapheresis as a treatment.Plasmapheresis is a process in which the liquid part of the blood, also known as plasma, which contains the lupus anticoagulant antibodies, is separated from the cells.",How to Treat Lupus Anticoagulant Antibodies2," Each person is different; therefore, you should discuss the different methods for treating LA with your doctor. He or she can help you determine what’s best for you. If you are not symptomatic, or if you have never had a blood clot in the past, you may not need any medical treatment., This therapy involves taking blood thinning medications such as warfarin, heparin, or low-dose aspirin, which help prevent blood clots. They work by inhibiting the production of vitamin K (responsible for blood clotting) in the liver. This increases the time the blood takes to clot.During this therapy, the level of anticoagulant in your blood will be monitored to determine how much, and for how long you need to continue the therapy. Some people only need to take medication for a few months, while others may have to manage the anticoagulants for their entire life.If LA is still present after the initial therapy, the therapy is usually continued for at least three additional months before the next testing is done.
If the result of the second post-therapy testing shows that the patient's blood no longer contains lupus anticoagulants, the therapy is discontinued.

, Steroids work by reducing the activity of the immune system. The immune system creates the lupus anticoagulant antibodies, and steroids can be used to suppress their production. If the activity of the immune system is suppressed or reduced, then the level of lupus anticoagulant antibodies will also decrease.Examples of steroids include cortisone, prednisone and methylprednisolone.

, A machine removes the affected plasma and replaces it with good plasma, or a plasma substitute that does not contain the antibodies.


This is also known as plasma exchange.

"
"
Ask your doctor about discontinuing certain medications.,
Quit Smoking to improve blood flow.,
Exercise regularly to bolster your cardiovascular system.,
Lose weight to promote good blood flow.,
Avoid excessive alcohol intake.,
Avoid vitamin K-rich foods to lower the chances of clotting.,
Move around.",How to Treat Lupus Anticoagulant Antibodies3," Medications such as phenothiazines, birth control pills, phenytoin, hydralazine, quinine, ACE inhibitors and amoxicillin are drugs that can induce LA. If you believe your LA is caused by a medication you are taking discontinuing the medication can help. However, you should not discontinue any medication until you have confirmed with your doctor that it will be safe to do so.

, The nicotine in cigarettes constricts the blood vessels and impedes blood flow.Smoking will only exacerbate the formation of blood clots, so it is best to abstain from it completely.

, Exercise minimizes the chance of blood clot formation by improving blood flow to different parts of the body. Exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, stair climbing, cycling, swimming and aerobics all offer good ways to get moving.


Avoid sports or exercises with a high risk of injury, especially if you are on medication which makes it more difficult for your blood to clot.

, Obesity leads to overproduction of substances in the body that come from fat cells and liver cells. These substances can inhibit clot breakdown and promote clot formation., Binge drinking makes platelets more likely to clump together into blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. According to a study by Harvard researchers in 2005, binge drinking doubled the risk of death among people who had initially survived a heart attack.Binge drinking is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) as patterns of drinking that bring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 grams per decilitre. For men, this usually means about 5 drinks over about a 2 hour period, for women this is typically 4 drinks in about a two hour period. Keep in mind, however, that BAC is affected by many other factors besides gender.

, Vitamin K is responsible for the clotting of the blood. High intake of foods rich in vitamin K can contribute to blood clotting in persons with lupus anticoagulants. Also, if you are on anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin or heparin, high vitamin K intake will counter the effect of the anticoagulant or blood thinning medications which are meant to inhibit the production of vitamin K.


Foods rich in vitamin K include the following: asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, chili powder, cucumber, lettuce, oregano, parsley, prunes, spinach, spring onions.

, If you must spend a lot of time sitting (e.g. for work or on a long flight), get up and move around for a few minutes at least once per hour. If you cannot get up, at least try to move your feet and ankles around while sitting.Doing so will make it more difficult for clots to form.

Having your essential documents together and ready to copy for each application will make the process much easier for you and demonstrate your professionalism.Most agencies will ask for:


Cover letter and resume
Their agency-specific application
Transcripts of any degrees or course work
References
Photo identification and proof of right to work in the country in which you’re applying
Accurate contact information – phone number, home address, and email address;
, Just as agencies will interview you, you should interview them. You can answer many of your questions by doing a bit of research. What you can’t answer beforehand, write down and take to your interview and when they ask if you have any questions, go through your list.Ask what company owns the agency and how long they’ve been in business.
Ask if employees are insured and bonded through the agency.
Ask how the agency monitors employees to ensure optimal patient care.

, All home health nursing agencies have to meet licensing, classification, and certification requirements. Unfortunately, some agencies are less honest about this than others and advertise that their employees meet these requirements when they don’t. Any agency that you’re interviewing with should be able to provide information about these guidelines and how they meet them., You’re a registered nurse and have completed extensive schooling. To maintain your license, you need ongoing training which will keep you up to date on new procedures, medical discoveries, treatments, and even technology.Agencies typically won’t offer the training in house; rather, they should arrange for you to train at nearby facilities.
Your agency should also be responsible for any costs associated with your ongoing training.

, The home health nursing industry, like many healthcare-related fields, has a higher than average turnover rate. Ask agencies how long RNs typically work with them as home health nurses. This will give you an indication of overall employee job satisfaction.You can simply ask, “How long, on average, does an RN work with your agency as a home health nurse?” This is a tactful way to approach your question.

, You’ll need to be a registered nurse (RN) to be a home health nurse, which requires schooling. Typically, RNs have their associate’s degree, which takes two to three years to complete. Many RNs go on to receive their bachelor’s degree in nursing, which allows for career advancement and a higher salary. No matter which you choose, you’ll need to pass your state licensing exam before you can work in your field.You may also work as a home health aide, which requires no formal education beyond a high school diploma. Home health aides assist clients with activities related to daily living, and are under the supervision of a nurse.
Home health nurses and aides are employed through the same agencies, typically.

, As a home health nurse, you’ll have quite a bit of independence. You will likely work for an agency, and need to report to them, of course, but largely you’ll be responsible for your schedule and unsupervised home visits. This means you won’t spend much time in the office, but will also have added responsibilities., As a home health nurse, you will have quite a bit of control over your schedule and need great time management skills. This means scheduling home visits, time in the office, prioritizing your tasks, time for administrative work, and ongoing training.Maintain a digital calendar that you can synchronize across multiple devices so that you always have access and never risk losing your calendar.

, You need good communication and interpersonal skills as a healthcare professional, and these are essential when working in the field as a home health nurse. You’re not only going to take care of patients’ needs, but you’ll be teaching them to take care of themselves, and being able to communicate with your patients, their loved ones, doctors, and your agency is imperative to being a home health nurse.


If you think that your communications skills could use improvement, consider purchasing a book about interpersonal skills, researching communication methods online, or even sign up for a Communications class at your local college.
If you are bilingual, you will be especially sought after, as you’ll be able to communicate with an even larger client base. For example, if you speak English as well as Spanish, Korean, or American Sign Language, make sure to let your agency know.

, Keeping organized is of the upmost importance in home health nursing, especially because you bring your office and supplies with you, rather than seeing patients in a stationary setting. The more organized you are, the less time you’ll waste in your day looking for things. Also, you’ll be less likely to make mistakes or forget to do something if you maintain good organization.Get everything you’ll need for your work day together the night before.
Don’t forget to take breaks and certainly remember to bring a lunch or some snacks and beverages.
Your schedule will change from day to day. Plan your route ahead of time for the most efficient travel plans.

, As a home health nurse, you are the liaison between your patient, their loved ones, doctors, your agency, and, at times, Medicare. Maintaining good communication among all of these entities is imperative to you being able to do your job. If there is a change in treatment plans or patient care, your open lines of communication will ensure that your job is easier and that your patient gets the exact care that they need.Consider having a work-only phone line so that when you are not on the clock you can “turn off.”
Your agency should provide a method for doctors and patients to contact you verbally and in writing.

, Your patients have the right to choose their healthcare providers, and while you are with an agency and have less input, you also have a right to advocate for yourself. If you find that you are unable to work with a client and have tried to resolve the issue, follow your agency’s protocols for requesting reassignment., As a home health nurse, you have no control over the space in which you see patients. You’ll be working with your patients in their homes, and may encounter environmental issues about which you have little input.Examples of environmental issues include smokers in the home, rodent or insect infestations, dangerous chemicals in the home, animals, or unsanitary conditions.


Of course, your agency will have protocols in place to minimize risks to you, and their contracts with patients may include verbiage that states that patients must make every effort to make the home safe for you.
If conditions are, in your professional opinion, unsafe, contact your agency, and if appropriate, local agencies that may assist you.

, Because you are attending to your patients in their homes, you may face an increased risk of violence for which you should be prepared. You may have a client that lives in a less-safe neighborhood, or perhaps in a poorly-lit area. On your initial visit, take note of anything that you deem risky and take appropriate preventative actions. Some examples of workplace violence for home health nurses include:Verbal abuse from patients or their families and friends
Threats to harm you
Physical assaults
Mugging

, As a healthcare worker, you run a much greater risk of exposure to a bloodborne pathogen or needle injury than the general population. Of course you are trained to take appropriate, universal precautions. This can be complicated in the home health nursing environment, though, as you will be teaching your patients to care for themselves, including how to do their own injections. Wear protective gloves, eye wear, and a mask to limit exposure.The most common pathogens on contaminated needles are HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.
Your agency will comply with federal regulations in establishing procedures for you and your clients to minimize risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens and needles injury.

, Home health nursing requires a lot of lifting and nurses risk injuring their backs, or spraining and straining everything from their wrists to their ankles. Fortunately, there are assistive devices available to help you properly lift your patient while reducing the impact on your body. Your agency will coordinate these devices as part of your patients’ care plans.Shower chairs allow your patient to bathe somewhat independently without standing.
Raised toilet seats allow your patients to use the toilet without coming to a fully-seated position, which means you have less lowering and lifting to do and it’s less stressful on their joints.
Hoists allow you lift a patient who is unable to stand on their own.

Take down the patient's name, age, height, weight and chief complaint or complaints.,
Gather the primary history.,
Expand with the secondary history.,
Take the tertiary history.,
Include a review of symptoms.,
Interview the patient for a past medical history.",How to Write a Good Medical History,";
,


Ask the patient to expand on the chief complaint or complaints. In particular, ask about anything that the patient was unclear about or that you don't understand.
Get specific numbers for things like how long the patient has had the symptoms or how much pain, on a scale of 0 to 10, the patient is experiencing.
Record, as accurately as you can, what the patient tells you. Don't add your interpretation to what you hear.

, This is where you ask about any symptoms the patient is experiencing that are related to the chief complaint. Associated symptoms are often the key to making a correct diagnosis.


The patient may not recognize that associated symptoms are related to the chief complaint and may not even view them as symptoms. You will have to interpret what you hear to complete this section of the medical history.

, This is anything in the patient's past medical history that may have something to do with the current chief complaint. By this point, you may already be fairly certain about the diagnosis, so you can home in on specific problems or events that support it.

, This is simply a list, by area of the body, of anything that the patient feels might not be normal. It's best to have the list of body areas in mind as you question the patient so you don't forget to ask about each one. Question the patient about these areas:


General constitution
Skin and breasts
Eyes, ears, nose, throat and mouth
Cardiovascular system
Respiratory system
Gastrointestinal system
Genitals and urinary system
Musculoskeletal system
Neurological or psychological symptoms
Immunologic, lymphatic and endocrine system

, This is background information on anything having to do with the patient's health, not just the current chief complaint. At a minimum it should include the following, but be prepared to take down any information the patient gives you that might be relevant:


Allergies and drug reactions
Current medications, including over-the-counter drugs
Current and past medical or psychiatric illnesses or conditions
Past hospitalizations
Immunization status
Use of tobacco, alcohol or recreational drugs
Reproductive status (if female), including date of last menstrual period, last gynecological exam, pregnancies and contraception method
Information on children
Family status, including whether the patient is married, who the patient lives with and other relationships. Include questions about the patient's current sexual activity and history.
Occupation, particularly if it includes exposure to hazardous materials

Facial hair like a beard, sideburns, or a moustache can prevent the mask from sealing properly. Make sure you shave or wax any facial hair before testing or wearing a gas mask to ensure the gas mask seals correctly., Jewelry like earrings and headwear like a hat or scarf can prevent the gas mask from sealing properly. Before putting on a gas mask, take off any jewelry or headwear that might get in the way of the seal., There are many different types of gas masks. How and when to secure the mask’s filter differs by manufacturer. Call or email the manufacturer and ask them about the proper way to attach the filter and when you should do it., The face piece of a gas mask is secured to the wearer’s head with straps. Place the mask over your face. Adjust the straps until the gas mask is fitted firmly over your face., A gas mask protects you from contaminants by filtering out chemicals and other dangerous agents. Once you have the gas mask on, breathe normally. The contaminants will be removed from the air as it passes through the filter., You might not be able to talk while wearing the mask. Some gas masks will have speaking capabilities, allowing you to talk while wearing the device. Other gas masks prevent you from talking while you wear the mask.

Ultimately, their goal is to find out if you are a likely candidate for a successful transplant. If they determine you are a good candidate, they will place you on the list. They will evaluate:Whether you are psychologically stable enough to handle the transplant process
Whether you have a strong support network that will be able to provide emotional support during the transplant process
Whether you are willing to take the steps to maintain your health during the process. For example, if you smoked, have you stopped for a long enough period of time?
Whether your health is overall good enough to survive the process and the transplant
Whether your condition is severe enough to warrant a transplant;
, Your standing on the list will be determined by your overall health condition and the condition of other people on the list. Ultimately, your need is based relative to the needs of others also on the list.


People who are the best possible match for a specific heart are much more likely to receive that heart.
Blood type is very important in determining where you are on the list. People with rare blood types have a tougher time getting a heart.
Overall health condition is very important. Doctors are very reluctant to transplant a heart to someone who may not survive the surgery. For example, factors such as stroke, infection, and kidney failure may disqualify you from the list. In addition, you may be removed from the list if your condition improves drastically.
In the United States, 3,000 people get on the transplant list every year. Unfortunately, only 2,000 hearts are available every year., The heart transplant waiting list is a list of people waiting for an available heart. Over the course of the year, people move up on the list, are taken off the list, or are added to the list. Consider these important facts:


As of October 2016, 4,100 people were on the list in the United States.
Many people die before suitable hearts are found for them.
People are put on the list (and their place determined) by a wide variety of medical factors.
There is no way to pay to move up on the list., You need to make sure that you don’t get complacent and that you stay active and up to date with your doctor. By missing appointments, you’ll deprive your medical professionals of the information they need to make sure you stay healthy while you wait for a new heart.


Maintain constant monitoring of your condition through diagnostics, regular physical checkups, and electronic monitoring (if appropriate).
Stay on your medications. Perhaps the most important thing you’ll need to do when managing your health is to stay on any medications that have stabilized your condition. Without your medications, it is possible that your condition could deteriorate. This could result in a life-threatening situation or you being moved off the transplant list.
Keep a medical alert wristband that lists your medications and your condition., There may be procedures you can undergo while you wait for a heart transplant that can make it more likely you make it to transfer. Procedures such as inotropic therapy, a biventricular pacemaker, and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can ease the strain on your heart and improve symptoms related to heart failure. Talk to your doctor about your options for procedures that can support your heart health while you wait., While you wait for a heart transplant, you need to take steps to maintain your level of health. Ultimately, a decreasing health condition could lower your chance of receiving a heart. In addition, it could put you at risk of serious illness or death.


Consider working less, finding different work, or filing for long-term disability or social security.
Only engage in exercise that is recommended and sanctioned by your doctors.
Abstain from tobacco products and alcohol.
Watch your nutrition. Your cardiologist may refer you to a nutritionist or recommend a specific diet to stay on while waiting for a heart., You may also need to seek the counseling of a mental health professional. Ultimately, your condition will cause you a lot of anxiety and may even put you into a depressed state. A mental health professional will help you deal through these problems in a structured manner.


If you can, locate a mental health professional who has experience dealing with people on transplant waiting lists or with terminal conditions.
Visit several counselors, psychologists, or therapists before you choose one. Make sure you pick a provider with whom you are comfortable.
You may also consider the guidance of a religious leader, such as a minister, priest, or rabbi., You should also consider taking a variety of steps to stay as relaxed as possible. This is important, as your blood pressure and stress level may have a substantial impact on your overall health. Think about:


Practicing yoga or some sort of relaxing exercise. By practicing yoga, you'll work on techniques that will help you breathe better, lower your blood pressure, and put yourself in a better overall mind frame.
Learn how to meditate. Meditation is another great way to help you foster a better frame of mind. By meditating, you'll learn to clear your mind and become more relaxed.
Avoid activities that increase your blood pressure or tension level. This could include gambling, or watching sports or movies that are very stressful or suspenseful.

, Perhaps the most important thing you need to do while waiting for a heart transplant is to spend some quality time with your loved ones. This is important for a number of reasons. Perhaps most important is that you and your loved ones will need a lot of support during this very stressful time.


Rely on your friends and family for emotional support during this period. At times you may feel hopeless and you may fall into depression. Your friends and family can offer you a lot of relief.
If you can, be strong for your family. Depending on your family structure, your spouse or children may take your condition harder than you. Offer them love. For instance, if you have small children, tell them that you will always love them and nothing can change that., You should consider making alternate living arrangements to simplify treatment and to make it easier to spend time with family.


If you live far from an area where there are specialists to treat your condition, you should consider relocating. Being far from your doctors may prove costly and stressful.
Think about relocating or arranging housing in close proximity to extended family. Family may help you feel better before the transplant and they may assist you in recover.
If possible, try to find a location where you can obtain treatment and be close to family.
Look into charities and other services that help transplant patients find suitable housing in close proximity to their doctors., Regardless of your long-term outlook, you should take some time to make a will. Having a will may save your family a lot of heartache and confusion if something happens to you. In the end, you’ll need to have a will no matter what. It won’t hurt to use take this opportunity to make one.


Contact an attorney.
Talk to your significant other about your estate.
Always consider the welfare of your children when creating your will. You may have to designate someone to oversee any funds you leave for non-adult children., You may also want to put a little thought into your medical costs and the costs of other eventualities, like a possible funeral. By doing some financial planning, you’ll potentially save yourself and your family a big headache.


Remember, just because you’re taking some steps to plan your funeral, does not mean you will pass away. Consider your final costs, such as a plot, casket, and ceremony. If you don’t prearrange anything, let your friends and family know what you’d prefer.
Try to do a little accounting to see how much money out of pocket you may have to pay for your transplant expenses. Investigate all sources, such as a second mortgage, and fundraising through crowdsourcing websites like GoFundMe or Indiegogo.
Contact charities such as the Air Charity Network that provides free transportation for transplant patients."

Choose the right type of gas mask.,
Buy the appropriate filters.,
Test the gas mask.",How to Wear a Gas Mask2," A gas mask can protect you from various contaminants in the atmosphere, depending on the type of contaminant. Some gas masks protect against biological substances, while other will protect you from chemical substances. Purchase a gas mask that has been approved by a reputable government agency to protect against specific hazards. For example, if you live in the United States, a gas mask certified by the National Institute of Safety and Health, or NIOSH, is a good choice.A gas mask will not protect you from fire-related contaminants like smoke.

, A gas mask is only effective if the proper filter is used. You will need a different filter for each type of threat you might face. There is no one-size-fits all filter. For example, if you face the threat of a chemical attack from chlorine gas, you will need a filter specifically manufactured to filter chlorine gas from the air. If you also face a threat from tear gas, you will need a filter created specifically for tear gas., In order to make sure the gas mask is working properly, you will need to test it. If you received your gas mask from your employer or other organization, they should run a test with you to ensure the mask works. If you purchased your gas mask as an individual, contact the manufacturer about how to test your gas mask at home.Since every mask is different, you will need to make sure you consult your employer or the mask’s manufacturer to determine exactly how to test it.

"
"
Store the mask according to the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Keep your filters up to date.,
Inspect the mask regularly.",How to Wear a Gas Mask3," It is important that a gas mask is stored properly. Consult the manufacturer of your gas mask and ask how the mask should be stored. Try to store the mask in a sealed box. Place the sealed box in a cool, dry, dark place like a closet., Check the expiration dates on your filters regularly. If a filter has expired, dispose of it according to manufacturer’s instructions. You should also make sure you are up to date with the types of filters you might need, depending on the potential threats in your area., You should inspect your gas mask once a month to make sure the materials have not degraded. Check the seals on the gas mask and look for cracks or signs of wear. If you notice any cracks in the gas mask materials, you should have it inspected by a professional before depending on it during a disaster."

Choose an appropriate gift.,
Find out whether there are things you can bring that the patient needs.,
Locate the patient.,
Walk quietly into the room.,
Talk quietly.",How to Visit a Hospitalized Patient," Here are some ideas:


Flowers (most common choice): However, make sure your friend is not allergic to the flowers in the bunch. You can also bring in fake flowers the favourite colour of the patient you are visiting.
'Get Well Soon' card: You can pick one up at a local department or paper media store. Write a heartfelt message of sympathy. A balloon with a hearty message on it can make a nice touch.
Food: Food in the hospital can get quite dismal, and sometimes patients want to have their favourite treats close by for comfort. Choose such food as: Chocolate bars, fruit, poptarts, granola bars, candies, cookies, etc.
Treasured items: If the patient you are visiting is a child, re-accommodate them with their favourite blankie or teddy bear that they left at home)
Stuffed bear (another great choice for children): This is another common way to express sympathy and evoke some hope for the patient and it gives them something to hold if things get tough.
Book: This is a great time killer for an older person. If the patient likes sports or hobbies (such as motorbikes or gaming), or cooking/craft, you could also buy them a magazine that will interest them, to help make the time pass by faster.


Don't overdo the presents. Keep in mind that lots of other people will also be sending gifts and flowers.





;
, Perhaps the patient left in a rush and some favorite clothes, glasses or a warm top was left at home. Or, there might be things you can buy on the way to the hospital, such as a pillow, headrest, iTunes voucher, crossword puzzle book, etc.

, Arrive at the hospital and ask one of the nurses where the person's room is. Some hospitals have volunteers at the front desk who can help you find room numbers and locate the patient you wish to visit in their ward.


Ask ahead of visiting when visitor hours are. Also find out how long you can stay with the patient. This will impact your parking choices, as well as giving you an idea of how long you can expect to spend with the patient.

, If the person is awake, say ""Hi"", and hand them the gifts.


If the person is asleep, don't wake them up. They need the rest. However, if you have time, you might like to simply sit there with the person. They might wake up while you're there.

, You can talk about whatever you want, but just be mindful of other patients who might be around, in case they are resting.

Funny stories are a good way to cheer the patient up. This can even involve other patients too; for example, tell a story about your boss at work doing something funny.

Sign in front of a notary public.",How to Write a Medical Consent Form," If you are a doctor, then you need to make sure that you get informed consent from your patients before providing health care. Accordingly, you need to document that you gave the patient all relevant information about the medical condition and the proposed treatment.Because you need to use this form over and over, with each new patient, it will be basically a template that allows you to fill in information unique to the patient you are meeting with.;
, You should make sure that the font and type is a comfortable size so that your patients can read the information on the form.


At the very top of the page, title the document “Medical Consent Form.” Put the title in bold., Move down two spaces and then put down the name of your clinic or practice. You may also want to include the address.

, A couple lines down from your clinic’s name, you should create a section where you can write or type the patient’s name. You can type “Patient Name:” and then include a blank line.You might also want to leave a line for a patient identification number, if you use those.

, The medical consent form should start off with the patient giving consent to a doctor, who is named. You could type, “I approve and direct Dr. , other doctors, or others judged qualified by the doctor to perform .”If more than one doctor practices in your office, you can leave the doctor’s name line blank and fill in the form individually for each patient.
If you provide more than one standard treatment, then you can insert a blank line where “the treatment” appears. Some doctors, however, only perform one kind of surgery, e.g., cesarean section deliveries. If that is your situation, then you might want to type in the procedure you perform regularly.
You can also create separate medical consent forms for each of your most common procedures.

, In addition to gaining consent for the medical procedure, you need to get patient consent for unforeseen or unexpected conditions. You need to have the patient consent to additional procedures because it is illegal to expand the scope of a surgery or other treatment without consent.You can type, “My doctor might need to perform other procedures while treating me. This may occur if he or she finds an unexpected condition. If my doctor believes that I need additional procedures, then I agree to them.”

, You should have a section that identifies known risks of the medical procedure. Remember, the purpose of the consent form is to get your patient’s “informed” consent. Accordingly, you need to let them know of the dangers of the proposed treatment.Title this section “Risks” in bold.
Then list the risks. You might create a separate medical consent form for each treatment you offer in your office. In that situation, you can type out the most common risks, using bullet points. If you want to use the same form for all treatments, then you will probably need to leave this section blank and then write in the most common risks.

, Most medical procedures carry some risk. You can create a section for “General Risks.” For example, if you do a form of surgery, then you should apprise your patient of the general risks inherent in all surgeries.You could type, “I understand that there are general risks with all invasive procedures. These risks include...” and then include the risks.

, You should notify all patients of alternatives to the proposed treatment. This information should also appear in the medical consent form.Title the section, “Other Options to ______” and fill in the blank with the proposed procedure. Then you can list the alternatives.
You should also explain the risks of proposed alternatives. You should leave space to do this.

, At the end of the medical consent form, you need language in which the patient explicitly grants consent to the procedure. You may need consent for multiple procedures. For example, you might need consent to perform heart surgery but also to give a blood transfusion. In this case, include a separate consent paragraph for each procedure.For example, you could type, “The purpose of this procedure has been explained to me. I know that the practice of medicine is not an exact science and that there is no guarantee about the outcome of the procedure. I have been informed of the medical risks and results related to the procedure. I have also been told about reasonable alternatives and the risks/results of these. I have also been informed of the risk of foregoing treatment.”

, There should be space, at the bottom of the document, for the patient or legal guardian to sign and date.You also should create space for a witness’s signature and for a translator’s signature.


For the witness’s signature, include this language: “I, ______, am an employee who is not the patient’s physician or the authorized health provider. I have witnessed the patient voluntarily sign this form.” Then include a signature line underneath.For the translator, include this language: “To the best of my knowledge, the patient understood what was translated and voluntarily signed the form.”, A medical consent form for a minor is a way to give someone permission to obtain medical treatment for your child. With a signed medical consent form, the adult then can get immediate medical treatment; otherwise, the doctor or hospital will have to call around and try to reach you.There are a variety of situations in which you would want to give someone this permission:


Your child plays sports.
Your child is going on a school trip and will be away from you. You will want an adult supervisor to have the ability to get medical treatment for your child.
The child is being temporarily taken care of by another person.

, You may be able to find a medical consent form template online. Also, for organized activities (like sports or field trips), the school should provide you with a blank form to fill out and sign.

, You can begin drafting your medical consent form by opening up a blank word processing document. Set the font and line spacing to a comfortable size.


Also title the document at the top. You should title the document “Medical Consent Form” in bold type. Center the words and make sure that they stand out. The form will likely be filed in a filing cabinet and you want the adult to be able to locate it quickly.

, You should get to the point and immediately identify who you are granting authority to. Type, “We, the undersigned parents, grant permission to to obtain medical treatment for the following children….”

, You should list the children to whom the medical consent form will apply. Type their legal name, home address, and date of birth.Line them up in a column so that it is easier to read.

, Upfront, you should include medical information about the children, including their doctor, health insurance plan, and allergies. You should title this section “Information for Medical Treatment.”, Title this section “Authorization and Consent of Parents.” In this section, you need state what medical treatment you authorize. You can be both specific and general.


For example, you can type, “I hereby state that I have legal custody of the aforementioned minors. I grant my authorization and consent for to administer general first aid for any minor injuries. If the injury is life-threatening, or requires emergency treatment, I grant authorization for to obtain any and all emergency professionals to transport and treat the minor children. I also authorize consent for medical procedures, such as any blood transfusion, X-rays, medication, anesthetic, or other medical diagnosis, treatment, or hospital care, provided it is rendered at the request and under the supervision of a licensed physician, surgeon, hospital, dentist, or other duly-licensed medical professional. I agree to assume financial responsibility for all expenses incurred by the medical treatment and care.”Note how the paragraph mixes specific treatments (e.g., “blood transfusions”) with general grants of authority to seek medical care (e.g., “other medical treatment”). If you want to specifically exclude a treatment, then list that exclusion separately.

, You want to end the medical consent form by stating that you are giving authorization to the designated adult in expectation that he or she uses their best judgment.


You can write, “It is understood that this authorization is given in advance of any medical treatment. However, it is given to the designated adult in the exercise of his or her best judgment upon the advice of medical or emergency personnel.”, You should have your signature witnessed. Although you do not need the witness to be a notary, it is always a good idea to use one. A professional notary is a more “official” witness and more credible.


Notaries can be found in most large banks or at your county clerk’s office. You can also find a notary by visiting the courthouse.
Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification. A driver’s license or passport should be sufficient.

This means they’ve completed extensive training in clinical work using dance therapy and can provide high quality care.You may find a dance therapist through a program at a local hospital or at a therapy clinic. You can also find one by searching for a therapist online.The dance therapist should have the title “Dance Therapist Registered (DTR)” or “Academy of Dance/Therapists Registered (ADTR).”;
, Mirroring means matching or following another person’s movements. This practice helps build empathy and connection. Mirroring can help validate a person’s experience. It can help build cooperation and understanding.For example, one person may leap and the other person will follow. If the person chooses to slow down the dance, the other person responds to the change.

, A person can use a metaphor to dance the way they feel. They can also use props as a way to extend the metaphor. Your metaphor can help you celebrate accomplishments, work through confusing emotions, or play out meaningful interactions between you and another person.For example, you might feel upset and dance with something that resembles fire or throw things in rage as you dance.

, Jumping is a way to bring emphasis to your movements. If you struggle with depression, jumping can help, as people with depression tend to have decreased vertical movements. Practice moving in all directions and getting your whole body involved.Find as many ways to jump as you can. For example, you can jump, skip, leap, and twirl.

, Dance and movement therapy can help people express their feelings through movement. Because it is set up to be a safe and non-judgmental environment, participants can feel free to express themselves through their bodies. The therapist may ask participants to re-enact their emotions and work through them through dance.Dance therapy can be a healthy alternative form of expression for people who are not attracted to traditional talk therapy.

, Using movements can help participants deal with stress in a fun way. Dance therapy is often offered in hospitals and to people who may experience physical, emotional, psychological, or cognitive problems. Dance therapy can be a type of exercise, and moving the body can be a great way to beat stress while developing a stronger body.Use dance therapy as a way to relax and unwind after a difficult experience.

, Dance therapy has shown positive effects for people suffering from depression.Movement itself can help with depressive symptoms, which is why exercise is so important to depression treatment. Dance therapy is beneficial because it also includes making meaningful movement and expression.

Dance therapy can also be used to treat anxiety disorders and eating disorders, although less research backs this treatment.

, Dance therapy can contribute to mindfulness practices. Focusing on nonverbal communication and adjustment means that dance therapy can help participants stay focused in the moment. Participants are encouraged not to judge their movements but to let them occur naturally.Dance movement therapy can become a type of mindfulness meditation by engaging in the here-and-now through movements.

, Dance is an art form that can help with self-expression. A dance therapist can help participants express their emotions through dance. For example, a therapist can play sad, angry, fast or slow music and allow participants to adjust their movements to express different emotions.Dance therapy can also improve self-confidence.

Therapists can help participants to express emotions for certain diagnoses or experiences. For example, a therapist can work with a person with depression in order to express feelings of sadness. They can also learn to dance feelings of hope and happiness.

, Dance is a form of nonverbal communication and can help people to learn to communicate in a new way. Participants can learn to take cues and respond to subtle changes through their body movements. For example, participants can give and receive invitations to touch, interact, and respond to another person’s movements. This teaches cooperation, which can then be used in other social situations.Participants can learn to strengthen their nonverbal skills and apply them to other social situations.

, Participants can learn to interact in new and beneficial ways with others and the therapist. For example, people with impulsive behavior often have problems interacting with other people, yet dance can help them learn to interact in a safe and appropriate way with others. They can contribute to a group in a productive way that enhances social connection.Therapists can help people who suffer socially engage with others in a proactive and productive ways. Participants can learn social cooperation through dance.

, Dance movement therapy can help enhance the mind-body connection and help children learn to use this connection more effectively. For example, children learn that they can express themselves and work through their feelings by using their bodies. Thoughts and feelings can directly impact and change the movements performed in dance therapy.Children can reflect on how their emotional or mental states affect their movements. This can help in understanding how thoughts, feelings, and actions impact one another.

, Dance and movement therapy can help children with autism to learn various forms of relationships. Dance therapy can start as understanding and expressing nonverbal communication in a meaningful way. People with autism can learn to create meaningful relationships without using words by instead using their bodies. For example, children who struggle to communicate with others can meet in a different way through dance in turning toward one another, accepting or rejecting invitations to touch, and so on.Moving in time with rhythm can create a sense of unity, even if it’s entirely nonverbal.

, Parents can learn to relate to their children in a new and exciting way through dance. Dance movement therapists can foster coordinated and synchronized movements between parents and children to help them connect. This can help parents and children learn to communicate in different ways.For parents who have a strained relationship with their children, dance therapy can help to open communication through a non-threatening means.

Sit on the edge of a chair with the affected knee straightened to about a 75° angle.,
Place the brace so that the hinge is above the knee.,
Fold the foam wrap over from the outside of your leg.,
Reinforce the calf and thigh straps.,
Secure the tibial strap.,
Set the hinge at the allowed degree of movement.",How to Use an ACL Brace After Surgery1," Straightening your knee fully can put a serious strain on your ACL that could lead to reinjuring it.Anything beyond a 75° angle will pull your ACL tight, which is something you want to avoid, particularly during the first few days after surgery.;
, The hinge should be placed about an inch higher than your kneecap. The hinge will keep your knee bent at a certain angle and will limit the amount of movement it can make.


While straightening out your knee can lead to reinjuring it, bending your knee too much can also put a strain on your healing ACL.

, While there are different kinds of ACL braces, most have a foam wrap that folds and wraps around your leg. First fold the foam wrap over your leg. Then take the foam wrap from the inside of your leg and fold it over, making sure that both sides of the wrap fit snuggly around your leg.

, The lower calf strap and the upper thigh strap serve as the two anchors of support for your knee and should be reinforced tightly. The anchors should act as a reminder of the importance of rehabilitating the muscles surrounding the knee joint. Eventually, as you regain your strength, the real anchors against injury will be your lower body muscles.The upper calf strap and lower thigh strap provide stability and support to the anchors of the brace.

, The tibial strap supports your knee as it begins to straighten out. It also helps your front thigh muscles to contract. When you contract your front thigh muscles while also straightening your leg a bit, the muscles take some of the tension off of your ACL.

, Dials located at the inner and outer hinges should have the same allowable degree of movement—this way, the same amount of pressure will be placed on both sides of your knee joint.Be very careful about setting each dial—even the slightest difference in the degree that the dials are turned may lead to unnecessary stress on your ACL.

"
"
Do not adjust the dial settings beyond the prescribed range of movement.,
Ice your knee every hour after surgery.,
Use crutches to support yourself after surgery.,
Plan to take some time off work and make arrangements for yourself while you recover.,
Do not take the brace off to sleep.,
Do not drive until you can bear your full weight on your foot.,
Shower with the brace on.,
Do remove the brace to dry off your leg after you have showered.,
Keep the brace on when you go for a walk.,
Take the brace off during rehabilitation sessions.,
Do not depend solely on the brace for knee stability after an operation.",How to Use an ACL Brace After Surgery2," Even a change of 10° from the prescribed range can cause damage to the repaired ACL. There are certain angles of movement that are prohibited because these might re-injure the surgically repaired knee.Your doctor will give you guidelines to follow regarding the dial settings that govern your range of movement.

, You can take your brace off to do this. Your knee will swell up after you surgery and ice can help to reduce that swelling. Ice can also help to reduce pain. Ice your knee for 20 minutes every hour.


Make sure that there is some sort of barrier, like a cloth or towel, between your skin and the ice to prevent frostbite.

, While your brace is meant to protect your knee, during the first week after surgery, your knee will need extra support. Generally, patients who undergo ACL surgery will remain on crutches for a week or more following their surgery. It is very important that you know the proper way to use crutches, otherwise you may cause more harm to your knee or other parts of your body (i.e., hips, ankles and low back).


Generally, a physical therapist will visit you to demonstrate the proper technique for using crutches and assist you while you learn. However, you can also click here to read about how to use crutches.

, No matter what your career, you will need to take at least a few days off work. The type of work you perform will influence the amount of time you will remain on medical leave. For example, if your position does not require heavy lifting or physical activities, you may be able to return to work within a week of your surgery. On the other hand, if you are a construction worker, chances are you will remain off work or working part-time at a modified, less physical position until you complete a certain number of physical therapy sessions for your knee.


While you may find it difficult to remain off work for an extended period, these stipulations are in place for your protection. You need to give your knee enough time to recover from your ACL surgery. Your surgeon will determine when you are healthy enough to resume your typical work-related duties.

, You will most likely be told to sleep with the brace on for the first two to four weeks after your surgery. Sleeping with the brace on will speed up your recovery process and will keep any injuries from happening to your ACL while you sleep. For the maximum effect:


Place a pillow under your ankle to help the brace do its job of reducing any swelling that occurs and keeping your leg straight.

Never put a pillow under your recovering knee, as this will slow down the rehabilitation process.

, You should not attempt to drive until you are able to stand fully on the foot attached to your injured knee without assistance from anyone. This could take up to six weeks after your surgery, so make arrangements if you need to get somewhere via car.

, Wrap the brace in plastic wrap and ensure that there are no spots where water could get in, as you should avoid getting your brace wet as much as possible. It may also help to place a stool that you can sit on in the shower while you wash yourself.Remove the plastic wrap as soon as you get out of the shower to avoid excess moisture from seeping into your brace.

, Moist skin that remains damp is a good breeding ground for bacteria so it is best to wipe your skin off with a towel. Replace the knee brace as soon as your skin is dry.

, During the first two weeks after surgery, your brace will most likely be set to full straight leg mode. This should not keep you from walking. In fact, one of the main purposes of the brace is to encourage you to start moving again as soon as possible after your surgery.


Before going on long walks or trips, make sure that the brace straps are tight so that your brace can give you the support it is meant for.

, During rehabilitation sessions, your physical therapist will most likely ask you to remove your brace for at least part of the session. If, however, your physical therapist does not advise you to remove your brace, do not remove it.

, Your brace should only really act as a support for the first few weeks after your surgery, so it should be thought of as a temporary aid. Surgery can disrupt your brain’s awareness of your knee, so to regain this awareness you should start rehabilitation as soon as possible.Talk to your physical therapist about a game plan for your recovery so that you can start recovering the function of your knee and depend less on your brace.

"
"
Begin exercising to restore your knee’s strength but keep your doctor’s orders in mind.,
Do heel props to help you extend your leg.,
Try passive knee extension.,
Do a passive knee bend.,
Try heel slides to help you bend your knee.,
Work on some muscle training exercises.,
Stop and seek medical help if you think you may have hurt your knee in anyway.",How to Use an ACL Brace After Surgery3," You will have to go to physical therapy after you have ACL surgery. Your physical therapist will give you exercises to do.


The exercises listed in this section are common rehabilitation exercises that are recommended for people who are recovering from ACL surgery.

, To do this exercise, roll up a hand towel and lie down with your head facing up. Place the towel directly beneath your ankles. Your heel should be propped high enough to lift your thigh off of the floor. Let your leg naturally fall into a full extension (meaning that it is straightened).Do this exercise three or four times a day for 10 to 15 minutes each time.

, Sit down in a chair with another chair facing it. Lay your ankle on the edge of the other chair (your entire foot should be supported by the chair). Relax your thigh muscles. Allow your leg to fall into its natural position at full extension.Remain in this position for 2-5 minutes. If your knee begins to hurt, take a break and repeat exercise again later.
Do this exercise three times a day.

, Sit on a stool or chair that allows your feet to dangle. Let your knee bend naturally. Remain in this position for 2-5minutes. If your knee begins to hurt, discontinue exercise and repeat later.


Do this activity three times a day.

, Lie down with your head facing up. Flex your knee by bringing your heal toward your buttocks. Hold this position for 5 seconds. Straighten your leg by gently sliding your heel downward. Hold this position for 5 seconds.Perform this exercise 10 times (one set) trying to bring your heal closer to your buttocks each time. Do one to three sets at each session, resting 30 seconds between sets.
Do this exercise three times a day.

, Once you have restored your knees range of motion, you will begin muscle-strengthening exercises. These exercises may include riding a stationary bike (10-20 minutes twice a day), swimming and low impact exercise machines. Low-impact exercise machines that you may use at your physical therapy facility include:


Elliptical cross-trainer.
Treadmill.
Leg curl machine.
Leg press machine.

, If you were doing an activity, such as a muscle training exercise or walking to the grocery store, and think you may have hurt your knee again, it is important to know when to go to the hospital. Signs that you need to seek medical treatment include:


Your knee is hurting more than it has been.
Your knee seems like it is getting worse instead of better.
Your knee is swelling more or is inflamed (soreness or redness).
Your knee is being negatively affected by the use of your knee brace.
Your knee becomes warm, is more painful and accompanied by a fever higher than 101 degrees F or 38.3 degrees C.

Prepare for the cleanse.,
Gather your materials.,
Understand how cleansing works.",How to Use a Liver Cleanse1," One of the more notorious symptoms of any cleanse diet is diarrhea.If you intend to see the cleanse all the way through, you should not take anti-diarrheal medicine, as this can affect the cleanse's effectiveness.


Epsom salt, a common ingredient in liver cleanses, acts as a laxative.If you experience diarrhea, let it run its course; however, you will need to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.
You may want to plan your liver cleanse around time off from work until you know how your body reacts to a liver cleanse, as prolonged diarrhea or frequent bowel movements is a common experience.;
, Depending on the liver cleanse plan that you choose, you may need to mix a specialized drink each day of the cleanse, or you may simply need to make dietary changes. Some cleanse plans may combine both dietary restrictions and a detox drink.


One common detox drink involves citrus, garlic, olive oil, and ginger.Another popular detox drink popularized by Dr. Clark involves epsom salt, olive oil, fresh grapefruit, ornithine, and a black walnut tincture.There are many different types of liver cleanses, though each generally makes the same claims about health and wellness. You may want to research a number of liver cleanses online and read user testimonials to find a cleanse plan that works for you.
Be aware that grapefruit can cause harmful interactions with many medications. Talk to your doctor about this possibility before doing a cleanse that involves grapefruit.

, The liver is your body's central point of waste purification and removal. All kinds of toxins are broken down and filtered out of your blood in the liver, then further processed by the kidneys before being excreted from the body through waste. Even with a healthy diet and lifestyle, you consume many toxins through air pollution, food additives, and many prescription medications.The purpose of a liver cleanse is to reduce the stress put on the liver, often while consuming antioxidants and herbs that are thought to protect the liver's cells.
Some liver cleanse ingredients like milk thistle can potentially interact with certain prescription medications. This could cause complications and may lead to an unintentional overdose. If you are currently taking any prescription medications, you should talk to your doctor about your intended liver cleanse before beginning any such cleanse."

Stay hydrated.,
Drink your detox drink.,
Modify your diet.,
Consider taking supplements.",How to Use a Liver Cleanse2," Drinking water serves a two-fold purpose in a liver cleanse. Consuming adequate amounts of water each day will naturally help flush toxins out of your body, which will aid your liver.Drinking water also becomes important if you're using a detox drink that causes you to have more frequent bowel movements.


Any time your body loses more fluids than it takes in, you run the risk of becoming dehydrated. This is particularly common during bouts of diarrhea or vomiting.Typical signs of dehydration include thirst, infrequent urination, dark-colored urine, dry skin, fatigue/dizziness, and light-headedness.
If you experience diarrhea, your body also loses electrolytes. Electrolytes are the minerals like sodium, potassium, and chloride that your body needs in order to continue functioning properly.Water is the best beverage to stay hydrated, but it will not replenish lost electrolytes. Try drinking a little fruit juice in addition to water, or adding sliced lemons, limes, or cucumbers to your water to ensure you do not lose electrolytes.Any detox drink that causes severe bouts of diarrhea or vomiting should be discontinued.

, Not all liver cleanse plans involves a detox drink, but many do. The ingredients will vary, depending on the plan you've chosen. Two common liver cleanses are the Five Day Liver Detox and the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse.


For the Five Day Liver Cleanse, mix eight ounces of fresh citrus juice, eight ounces of spring water, one lemon, one clove of garlic, one teaspoon of olive oil, and a one-inch piece of ginger in a blender. Some versions of this cleanse recommend adding an additional garlic clove and an additional teaspoon of olive oil each day of the cleanse.As the name suggests, the Five Day Liver Cleanse takes five days to complete, and this cleanse drink should be prepared and consumed for five consecutive days.
For the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse, you'll dissolve four tablespoons of epsom salt into three cups of water and measure out four 3/4 cup servings, and drink one serving every two hours. At 9:45 pm blend and drink a half cup (120 ml) of olive oil, one large or two small pink grapefruits freshly juiced, one dose of ornithine, and 10 to 20 drops of black walnut tincture.Unlike the Five Day Liver Cleanse, the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse can be completed in a single day.
If you're following the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse, you should not eat or drink anything but the detox drink and epsom salt water portions after 2:00 PM. You will also avoid eating anything that contains fat the day of the cleanse.Again, speak with a doctor of pharmacist about any current medications (including supplements) to make sure they don't interact with grapefruit.

, Many liver cleanses advise that you avoid taking unnecessary vitamins or medicines before and/or during the cleanse, though it goes without saying that you should continue to take all prescription medications as usual. The biggest change will be to your regular diet, before and/or throughout the course of the cleanse.


Some cleanse plans advise eating a no-fat breakfast and lunch, like oatmeal, fruit, fruit juice, or bread with honey. Others advise eating no fat whatsoever during the day of the cleanse, though this may not be manageable for multi-day cleanses. Depending on the plan you're following, you may also have restrictions on what times of day you can eat.Avoid processed foods, high-fat foods, and high-sugar foods, both during the cleanse and as part of your regular day-to-day diet to help keep your body healthy.Drinking lemon water is often considered a low-stress way to help cleanse your body, especially during the course of a liver cleanse.Garlic is thought to help rid the body of toxins, and can be added to your diet both during the cleanse and in the days leading up to your cleanse.The antioxidants in green tea may help flush toxins out of the body. Green tea can be consumed during the cleanse, as it shouldn't violate most cleanse guidelines. It can also be incorporated into your daily diet.
Some studies suggest that incorporating avocados into a healthy diet may protect the liver from damage, though further research is required to determine how avocados help the liver and at what dosage.However, avocados do have a relatively high fat content, and may therefore be incompatible with certain cleanse plans.
Turmeric is commonly used to alleviate liver problems. Consider incorporating turmeric into your diet, especially during the cleanse., Some herbal supplements are thought to help the liver, especially in people with pre-existing liver problems.Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements, as they could interact with other medications in dangerous ways.


B vitamins may help improve liver function in some people, though further studies are needed on how effective vitamins are in assisting the liver.Milk thistle contains silymarin, which has been shown to treat and prevent liver damage.Schisandra supplements are derived from the plant of the same name. Schisandra is often used to treat liver diseases and to protect the liver from toxins/poisons.Selenium may also help improve liver function.

Learn the biological cause of Celiac disease.,
Learn the biological cause of gluten intolerance.,
Understand the different clinical presentations of the disease.",How to Understand Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance2," Individuals with Celiac disease have a genetic predisposition to autoimmune reactions to the ingestion of gluten.


Celiac disease involves abnormally high intestinal permeability and high levels of adaptive immunity markers such as interleukin and IL-21, unlike individuals who suffer from gluten intolerance.
Individuals with other autoimmune diseases are at a greater risk of Celiac disease.

, Individuals with diagnosed gluten intolerance have increased expression of claudin and the innate immunity marker Toll-Like Receptor (TLR).


Gluten-sensitive individuals also typically have reduced expression of the immunity marker FOXP3.

, Although symptoms vary for individuals with Celiac and gluten intolerance, most individuals with Celiac disease experience more severe reactions to the ingestion of gluten than do gluten intolerant individuals.


Gastrointestinal symptoms are common with both conditions, but malnutrition is typically associated only with Celiac disease.
More nuanced symptoms of Celiac disease may also occur, such as irritability or depression, weight loss, muscle cramps, mouth sores, osteoporosis, fatigue or weakness, tingling in the legs, and joint pain.
For both conditions, symptoms typically resolve after thoroughly ridding the diet of gluten.

"
"
Get an allergy test.,
Get a blood antibody test.,
Take a sample of the small intestine.,
Perform an endoscopy or camera pill swallow.,
Check for vitamin deficiencies.",How to Understand Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance3," Many physicians and allergy specialists can offer skin and blood tests to determine which foods may be causing your symptoms.

, Celiac disease results from an immune system reaction to gluten that is caused by the development of antibodies working to attack gluten like a foreign substance in the body.

, A biopsy of the small intestine can be collected and study to confirm whether gluten intolerance is caused by Celiac disease or a simple sensitivity.


In individuals with Celiac disease, the villi (similar to small hairs lining the inner intestinal walls) are often damaged and matted under the magnification of a microscope lens.

, Visual inspection of the intestines can help identify whether the gluten sensitivity is caused by true Celiac disease or another condition.

, Because Celiac disease damages the small intestine’s villi, which absorb nutrients from food, individuals with the disease may suffer from vitamin deficiencies.


Individuals with gluten intolerance do not necessarily have difficulty absorbing nutrients from other foods, unless the intolerance is actually caused by Celiac disease.

"
"
Take vitamin supplements if needed.,
Change the diet to avoid gluten.,
Determine whether steroids are necessary.",How to Understand Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance4," Individuals with a recent diagnosis of Celiac or extensive damage to the intestinal villi may benefit from targeted or general vitamin supplementation.


If a specific deficiency has been identified, individual pills can be taken under the supervision of a health professional; in other cases, a general multivitamin may be all that is necessary until the villi heal and the deficiencies are corrected.
If the villi are extensively damaged, a vitamin injection may be required to correct particular deficiencies.

, Both gluten intolerant individuals and those with Celiac disease need to begin a dietary regimen that strictly avoids gluten and cross-contaminated food products.


Dietitians can help newly-diagnosed individuals with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease plan a healthy and balanced diet that is free of gluten.
Gluten intolerant individuals may not experience adverse reactions to products not explicitly containing gluten. Cross-contaminated grains and food products with only minimal amounts of gluten may not aggravate symptoms in the gluten intolerant, but should still be avoided by those with Celiac disease.
Some individuals with Celiac disease also have negative reactions to the topical application of products that contain gluten, such as shampoos, lotion, and make-up. If an individual diagnosed with Celiac disease does not experience a full remission of symptoms after careful dietary avoidance of gluten, avoidance of beauty products and hygiene products with gluten may resolve remaining signs of illness.

, Individuals with Celiac disease often experience symptoms caused by intestinal inflammation that may mimic full-body allergic reactions and cause skin rashes, swelling, and gastrointestinal distress.


In severe cases of Celiac disease, anti-inflammatory steroids may be prescribed to reduce symptoms of the condition until a gluten-free diet enables the body to heal.

Receive an FMLA request.,
Give the required notice to the employee.,
Download the FMLA certification form.,
Send the form to the employee's healthcare provider.,
Verify the certification form.,
Get written authorization.,
Keep medical records separate.,
Limit access to employees' medical information.,
Discourage discussion about employees' medical conditions.,
Meet with the employee.,
Implement written substance abuse policies.,
Consider requiring periodic drug tests.,
Educate employees on the dangers of substance abuse.",How to Verify Rehab Treatment for an Employee," If an employee requests time off to take place in a substance abuse treatment program, you must assess whether they are eligible for FMLA time. Generally, the employee must have worked for you for at least a year.The employee can request time off either orally or in writing. For example, the employee may call in and request time off, or may stop you in a hallway to ask you about it.
Generally, an employee would need to give you 30 days notice to take time off under FMLA. However, there is an exception for unforeseen circumstances that necessitate taking immediate leave.
While employees typically would have difficulty arguing that entering rehab was ""unforeseen,"" treat these situations with some sympathy.
Keep in mind that often once an addict makes the decision to seek treatment, it's important to get them into that program as soon as possible.
Also many treatment programs, particularly inpatient programs, have extended wait-lists that make it difficult for an employee to predict exactly when they'll need time off to take an available spot.;
, Within five days of the date the employee requests time off, you must give them a notice that specifies their eligibility for FMLA and whether they must take any accrued sick leave first.You can download an employer's guide to the FMLA from the website for the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). It provides clear information on how to evaluate employee eligibility for leave under the FMLA.
The eligibility notice lets the employee know if they are eligible for FMLA leave. If you've determined they're not eligible, you must provide at least one reason why.

, The DOL provides a certification form that includes space for all of the information you are entitled to receive about an employee's reason for requesting time off under FMLA.You can easily download the form from the DOL's website. You may want to print several copies, or save the PDF on a human resources or management computer. That way you'll always have one handy if you need it.
Federal privacy laws limit the amount and types of information you can get from an employee's doctor. The form ensures you get all the information to which you are entitled without inadvertently asking for too much.

, You have the option of either giving the form to the employee and having them return it to you, or sending it directly to the employee's healthcare provider.The easiest way to do this is to give it to the employee and have them take it to their healthcare provider. This eliminates the need to get a signed authorization form from the employee.
However, it also could open the door to questions as to whether the employee has falsified or forged the form – particularly if you consider this employee untrustworthy.
The remedy for that is to send the form directly to the healthcare provider the employee names, along with a signed authorization form from the employee that allows the doctor to release the information to you.

, If the employee was in charge of getting the form filled out and returned, you may want to contact the office of the healthcare provider to make sure the information on the form is accurate and was not fabricated.Keep in mind that health privacy laws prohibit you from speaking directly to the employee's doctor. You'll have to speak to someone at the doctor's office who works in benefits or human resources.
You can contact the doctor to confirm that the doctor did indeed sign the form. You also can clarify information contained on the form.
Generally you'll have to read the form as you understand it, and then the doctor's office will confirm whether that information is accurate as provided by the doctor.

, Under federal law, doctors cannot tell you anything about an employee's medical treatment without the employee's permission. This means if you either must have the employee take the certification form to their doctor, or have them complete and sign an authorization form.The doctor may have a legally-approved authorization form that you can use, or you may be able to download one online.
To find an approved form, search online for a HIPAA authorization form. ""HIPAA"" is the name of the federal medical privacy law that controls confidentiality and access to confidential health information.

, To maintain the confidentiality of an employee's medical information, you generally should keep any medical documents or records you receive separate from the employee's regular personnel file.These records include any medical certification forms you get in conjunction with an employee's FMLA request.
Not only should they be kept in a separate file, but you should keep them in a completely separate cabinet or drawer that is lockable. This makes it easy to ensure they can't be accessed by the wrong people.

, While many managerial employees may have access to general personnel files, you want to restrict access to confidential medical information. It generally should be available only on a ""need to know"" basis.For example, the person who does your payroll may need to access the length of time the employee is on leave, but he or she has no reason to know the reason why that leave was taken.
In most businesses, there will be very few people who will have any need to have access to this information.
Not even the employee's immediate supervisor needs to have access. They may need to know the employee is taking leave so they can adjust accordingly, but they do not need to know why.

, Gossip can be difficult to control in any workplace. However, attempting to eliminate rumors about why someone has taken leave prevents violating that employee's privacy.Instruct anyone who knows the reason the employee took leave that they should not reveal this confidential information to anyone.
If the employee reveals this information to co-workers, that's their business – but you should do everything you can to avoid this information becoming gossip in the employee's absence.
Keep in mind the sensitive nature of rehab. There may be very few people who know that the employee has a problem with drugs or alcohol, and the employee may want to keep it that way.
Keeping the reason for the employee's absence secret also helps prevent discrimination against the employee when he or she returns.

, When an employee comes back to work after substance abuse treatment, it's a good idea to meet with them before they get started and find out what, if any, accommodations they need to ensure a smooth transition back to work.This can be especially important if the employee is returning from an extensive stay in an inpatient rehabilitation facility.
They may require some time to readjust to the demands of work and daily life.
Additionally, they may have ongoing appointments that require an adjustment to the hours they work.
Keep in mind that while abusing alcohol or drugs is not considered a disability, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does offer limited treatment for recovered or recovering addicts.

, if you don't already have one, a written substance abuse policy can ultimately save your business significant money and resources. If your policy is implemented and enforced consistently, you will have a healthier and more productive workforce.It's okay if the occasion of an employee going to rehab spurs you on to finally create a substance abuse policy. However, keep in mind you can't use this policy as a hammer to punish the employee who requested leave.
The policy must have the goal of encouraging a healthy and productive workforce, and must be applied consistently and indiscriminately.
This means you can't, for example, only require drug tests from employees who have been to rehab or gotten into trouble with drugs.
Your policy should be in writing, and should be made available to all employees.

, As part of a non-discriminatory workplace substance abuse policy, you can require mandatory random or routine drug tests of your employees, including employees who have recently completed a substance abuse treatment program.Keep in mind that you can't terminate or discipline an employee because the drug test reveals the presence of a lawfully used medication.
For example, suppose you have an employee who gets inpatient substance abuse treatment for heroin addiction.
If that employee continues on methadone treatment, you cannot terminate or discipline that employee if their drug test reveals the presence of methadone.

, Employee education is a big part of keeping your workplace safe and drug-free. You can use your program to point out specific dangers of substance abuse for your particular industry.


As part of your educational program, encourage your employees to seek treatment if they believe they are getting into trouble with alcohol or drug use.
You want to encourage confidentiality and sensitivity as well. For example, employees shouldn't attack or make fun of someone who's just returned to work after completing a substance abuse treatment program.
This type of behavior can be considered discrimination under state and federal laws that prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. Recovered or recovering substance abusers are considered people with disabilities for the purposes of these laws.
Check with drug abuse or treatment organizations in your area to see if they offer seminars or lectures for workplaces.
Many of these programs have the power to educate as well as inspire your staff.

Eat sufficient fat-soluble vitamins.,
Learn about water-soluble vitamins.,
Identify different water-soluble vitamins.,
Ingest sufficient water-soluble vitamins.,
Stick with a healthy diet.,
Get enough vitamins and nutrients.,
Steer clear of unhealthy foods.,
Plan your meals.,
Allow yourself cheat days.,
Use supplements sparingly.",How to Understand the Difference Between Water Soluble and Fat Soluble Vitamins," There are many misconceptions about vitamins and supplements, in particular that they are always completely safe for anyone to take because they are natural. This, however, is not true — vitamins and supplements can have dangerous interactions with other medications, be considered unsuitable for people with certain medical conditions and, in some cases, you can ""overdose"" on vitamins. With water-soluble vitamins, your body will, for the most part, eliminate excess through your urine, so there is little chance of the vitamin reaching toxic levels in your body. Fat-soluble vitamins, however, remain in your system for a longer period of time than their water-soluble counterparts, and eating too many of them can lead to an accumulation of excess amounts that may bring on a host of medical problems ranging from headache to death.

Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins should always be overseen by a medical professional and followed up with lab work to measure levels. Follow your doctor's advice for dosage of these vitamins.;
, Your body stores vitamins considered fat-soluble in its fatty tissues and liver. It then draws upon the stores of fat-soluble vitamins to help your body function properly.Foods that contain fat-soluble vitamins are generally animal products or fatty foods. Examples of foods with fat-soluble vitamins are vegetable oils, milk and dairy foods, eggs, liver, oily fish, and butter.You do not need to eat foods containing fat-soluble vitamins every day because your body stores excess in your fatty tissues and then draws upon these reserves when you need them., There are several different vitamins that are considered fat-soluble. Recognizing these vitamins can both help you to get a sufficient amount of each and minimize your risk of consuming excess.Vitamin A assists your vision, promotes bone and tissue growth and aids in reproduction.Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in your body, which in turn helps your teeth and bones develop properly. It also helps maintain proper blood levels of both calcium and phosphorus.Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is on the rise due to a variety of factors including more time spent indoors and use of sunblock. As a result, many doctors recommend supplements to get sufficient vitamin D while limiting risk of too much sun exposure.Vitamin E protects your red blood cells and maintains immune function and the repair of DNA.It may also lower your risk for some cancers and heart disease.Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting and, in turn, healing wounds. There is also some evidence that vitamin K can maintain the health of your bones., It’s important to your health to make sure you get sufficient fat-soluble vitamins from whole food sources. Only supplement as necessary to avoid overdose.Studies suggest that while plant sources of Vitamin A are good for you, animal sources of the vitamin are better absorbed by your body.Women need approximately 2,330 international units (IU) of vitamin A per day, while men need about 3,000 IU. Get your recommended daily dose of vitamin A with foods such as cheese, eggs, oily fish, milk, and yogurt. Plant sources of vitamin A include yellow, red, and green leafy vegetables such as spinach, carrots, peppers, mangoes, apricots, and sweet potatoes.The recommended daily allowance of vitamin D is 200 IU for adults ages 19 to 15, 400 IU for adults ages 51 to 70, and 600 IU for adults over the age of 71.Get vitamin D from sources such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel; eggs; as well as fortified breakfast cereals and milk.The recommended daily allowance for vitamin E is 15 milligrams for adults. In the event that vitamin E is listed in IU, aim to get 22 IU from natural sources.Get vitamin E from foods such as plant oils including corn and olive; nuts and seeds; and wheat germ, which you can find in cereals and cereal products.You need approximately 0.001mg of vitamin K per kilogram of body weight. Thus, if you weigh 65kg, you need about 0.065mg of Vitamin K per day. Get vitamin K through foods such as broccoli, spinach, vegetable oils, and cereal grains., Unlike their fat-soluble counterparts, water-soluble vitamins do not stay in the body and are generally eliminated with urination.As a result, you need to consume water-soluble vitamins more frequently.There is a total of nine water soluble vitamins, including B vitamins (folate, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 ) and vitamin C.


There is a wide variety of water-soluble vitamins in foods such as fruit, vegetables, potatoes, grains, and dairy foods.Exposing water-soluble vitamins to heat, either through cooking or boiling, can cause them to lose some of their potency or destroy them altogether.The optimal way to retain water-soluble vitamins is to steam or grill foods and pouring cooking water into soups or stews instead of throwing it away.Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, it is generally difficult to overdose of water-soluble vitamins because you eliminate them much more quickly through urine.

, There is a wide range of vitamins that are considered water-soluble. Identifying these can help you get enough of each through whole foods.Vitamin C, which is sometimes called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes tissue health and helps your body absorb iron. In addition, it can help with wound healing.The B vitamins, which range from niacin to folic acid and B-12, are responsible for maintaining the health of several systems in your body including your circulatory system, brain health, cell metabolism and nerve function.Often times B vitamins can be added to help combat stress, help relieve nerve-related pain, and increase energy.

, In order to help maintain your overall healthy, it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough water-soluble vitamins through whole foods. Aim to eat these every day, since your body does not store them for as long as their fat-soluble counterparts.The recommended daily allowance of vitamin C is 75mg for adult women and 90mg for men.Eating foods including citrus fruits and juices, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, broccoli and spinach can help you get enough vitamin C per day.The recommended daily allowance of the B-vitamins differs according to the specific vitamin. For example, adults need 2.4mg of B-12 per day; 400micrograms of B-9 or folic acid; and 14-16 milligrams of B-3 or niacin each day.You can get all of the B vitamins through a range of foods that includes: whole and fortified or enriched grains, nuts, peas, meat, shellfish, poultry, eggs, daily, peanut butter, and bananas., Maintaining a diet of healthy and nutrient-rich foods and meals can promote your overall health. Foods that have moderate levels of fat, complex carbohydrates, and are high in vitamins and minerals, for example, are best for your general health.You should aim to eat about 2,000 calories per day to maintain optimal body function, or more if you are active and not trying to lose weight., A key part of any healthy diet is getting enough vitamins and nutrients to bolster your overall health. A part of this is getting enough fat- and water-soluble vitamins, in addition to other vitamins and nutrients. You will enough of the recommended daily allowances if you eat foods from the five food groups. There are five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.Try to eat 1-1.5 cups of fruit daily. Whole fruits including raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries are good and nutrient-rich choices. You can also get fruits from drinking 100% fruit juice.Select different fruits each time you eat that. This can help ensure you get different nutrients, including many water-soluble vitamins. For example, have blueberries and strawberries one day, and have raspberries and blackberries the next.
Aim for 2.5-3 cups of vegetables every day. Vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, spinach, or peppers can provide what you need. You can also drink 100% vegetable juice.Change up the vegetables you eat so that you get different nutrients, including many water-soluble vitamins.
Consume 5-8 ounces of grains per day. At least half of your daily intake should be from whole grains. Foods like brown rice, cereal, oatmeal, and whole wheat pasta or bread are good choices.Grains also offer Vitamin B, which is one of of the primary water-soluble vitamins.Get 5-6.5 ounces of protein per day.You can find protein in lean meats such as beef, pork, or poultry; cooked beans; eggs; peanut butter; or nuts and seeds.Protein is also a source of many fat-soluble vitamins.
Consume 2-3 cups, or 12 oz., of dairy per day.You can get dairy from sources including cheese, yogurt, milk, or even ice cream.Dairy contains many fat-and water-soluble vitamins., Avoid eat unhealthy or junk foods as much as possible. These are generally lacking in the vitamins and nutrients you need to maintain your health.


Starchy foods contain a lot of refined carbohydrates, which can spike blood sugar. Foods including bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods are all examples of starchy foods.
Avoid eating too much sodium. Every person needs a little sodium in their diet, but many foods are often too high in sodium. This is especially true of mass-processed foods. Try alternative seasonings like garlic or herbs to help you stay away excess sodium.

, Putting together a meal plan can help make sure that you’re getting sufficient nutrients, including water- and fat-soluble vitamins.It has the additional benefits of helping you avoid junk food and maybe even saving money.


For example, figure out what you’ll eat for breakfast each day of the week. This can help get your day started right. Try and pack your lunch if you don’t have a meeting. This minimizes the risk of buying unhealthy fast foods and ensuring you stay on track with getting enough nutrients. If you have a lunch meeting, select the least processed food on the menu. Salads without cheese or heavy dressings are excellent choices.

, There are times when you may just want junk food like a burger and fries. Let yourself cheat occasionally. If you are eating an otherwise healthy diet, this is unlikely to rob you of important vitamins and nutrients


Some studies have shown that an occasional cheat day may help you keep up your diet because you’re not denying yourself any foods you sometimes want.You may find that you don’t really want unhealthy foods if you’re eating a healthy and nutrient-rich diet.

, In some cases, like if you have a limited diet or are a vegan or vegetarian, it is difficult to get enough vitamins and nutrients through food choices alone. While it’s generally ok to take a multivitamin or supplements to help you get what you need to maintain your health, get as much of these as possible from foods.Some multivitamins and even single vitamin supplements have so-called “megadoses,” which can be detrimental to your health if used over a long period of time.Consult with your doctor about taking multi-vitamins and supplements."

Change your activities to prevent stress to the vaginal walls.If you have only mild vaginal prolapse, your doctor will likely recommend modifying your activities to avoid heavy lifting and/or straining.,
Consider trying a device meant to support the vaginal walls.Something called a ""vaginal pessary"" is a circular device, usually made of soft plastic or rubber, that is inserted into your vagina.,

Keep in mind that surgery is not necessary with vaginal prolapse. You can leave the prolapse untreated without any negative impact on your health.;
, The pessary will hold your vaginal structures in place, thus preventing symptoms of prolapse and/or worsening of your prolapse. You will need to see your doctor to discuss this treatment option and to have it inserted into your vagina.


A vaginal pessary must be removed and cleaned at regular intervals.
Your physician can instruct you on how to do this, as well as the frequency at which it needs to be done.
Some women find vaginal pessaries uncomfortable, or find that they fall out and have difficulty keeping them in place.
Try a pessary and to see how you feel with it in. You can evaluate from there whether you find it a helpful mode of treatment.
Vaginal pessaries are more successful in women who are not sexually active than in women who are. If you are sexually active, you or your partner can remove the pessary for intercourse., Do Kegel exercises at least 3 times per day, ultimately aiming for 10 repetitions each time. Here's how to effectively perform Kegel exercises:


To identify your pelvic muscles (the ones you will be flexing during Kegel exercises), stop urinating mid-stream. Notice which muscles you used to do this task - this feeling of muscle tightening is what you will be aiming for when you perform the exercises (which is recommended to do when you are not urinating - the urination test is simply used to allow you to identify the muscles).
When lying down or sitting comfortably, contract your pelvic muscles and hold the contraction for 5 seconds. Then, release for 5 seconds, and then repeat this 5 times. Ultimately, you will want to aim to hold the contraction for 10 seconds, to release for 10 seconds, and to repeat this 10 times.
Stay relaxed as you perform the exercise and do not hold your breath. Rather, continue to breathe deeply as you perform the exercises.
Kegel exercises are not meant to be tiring; they are more about focus, as you keep your mind focused on the contractions that will effectively strengthen these muscles.
If you have difficulty performing Kegels, then let your doctor know. You may need a referral to see a physical therapist for help.

, They are linked to the decreased estrogen that is present post-menopause, as a decreased estrogen level correlates to a weakening of the vaginal area and the surrounding muscles and ligaments.


The most common way to deliver the estrogen is to insert an estrogen cream into your vagina, but any form of estrogen will work. However, keep in mind that homeopathic remedies cannot replace this therapy.
Estrogen replacement therapy can help to prevent this natural weakening of the pelvic muscles and ligaments, and hence to reduce the risk of any further vaginal prolapse.
Note that there are some cases in which estrogen replacement therapy is not safe. These include people with certain types of cancers whose growth may be fuelled by the presence of estrogen (such as many breast cancers), as well as those who are at an increased risk of blood clots and stroke, among other things.
Your doctor will be able to go over the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy in your specific case, to help you decide whether this treatment is right for you.

, The type and extent of the surgery will vary depending upon the type and severity of your prolapse.


This is something that your surgeon will assess and discuss with you after he or she has performed a physical exam to thoroughly assess the extent of your vaginal prolapse.
As you await surgery, you may be offered treatments such as a vaginal pessary to help control your prolapse until it can be corrected surgically.
Also, keep in mind that there is no medical reason why surgery has to be done.

, Tell your doctor if you have had problems with general anesthesia in the past, or if you have a family history of problems tolerating anesthetic. Most people are completely fine with it; however, it is important to talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have.


Some women just receive a spinal or an epidural for pain control during surgery.
While general anesthesia is normally recommended, these are other options that can be considered.

, In vaginal surgery, the surgery is conducted through the vaginal opening. In laparoscopic surgery, small instruments are inserted into the abdominal cavity though tiny incision points, with the help of a small camera that allows the surgeon to see during the operation.


Unless there are complications, you will most likely need to stay in the hospital for one to two days following surgery. This will help to ensure that the initial stages of your recovery are going well.
Recurrence after having prolapse surgery can be as high as 20 to 60%. To reduce your risk, be diligent about doing Kegels, limiting lifting, and any other preventative measure that your doctor suggests after surgery.

, Ask your boss for modified duties at the workplace if you have a job that involves heavy physical labor.


Your doctor may advise that you do Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles in your pelvic area following surgery.
Be sure to follow your doctor's advice on when to begin strengthening exercises, and how many to do at a time, so that you do not put undue stress on your pelvic area following surgery.
Also avoid sexual intercourse for 6 weeks following surgery, to allow time for a full recovery., Being overweight can significantly increase your risk of recurrence of the condition following surgery, due to the continual extra pressure in the area. Therefore, to minimize your risk as much as possible, and to ensure that the benefits of surgery last for as long as possible, you may want to consider weight loss.


Strategies to reduce your weight (if you are overweight) include increasing your aerobic (fat-burning) exercise, and improving the health of your diet, among others.

Click here for more information on how to lose weight safely and effectively if this is of interest to you.
You will also want to ask your doctor to treat chronic conditions such as a persistent cough or ongoing constipation, which may put additional stress on your abdominal and pelvic floor muscles.

, You can return to normal activity fully by six to nine weeks after surgery, and your surgeon can advise you on a plan for a gradual return to activity during this time period.


Note that sexual problems may persist even after the surgery is complete.
The surgery will most likely resolve the anatomic problem (the prolapse), but it will not necessarily resolve associated sexual challenges.
If you are struggling to get your sex life back on track, you can ask your doctor for suggestions or for a referral to a physician who specializes in women's sexual health and wellbeing.
Challenges that are common include pain with intercourse and decreased libido, among other things.

Learn to recognize the other symptoms of lupus nephritis.,
Understand how lupus nephritis is diagnosed.,
Familiarize yourself with the stages of lupus nephritis.",How to Treat Swollen Ankles and Feet for Lupus Nephritis," If you have been diagnosed with lupus nephritis, it is best to limit your salt intake by avoiding foods with a high salt content. Salt (sodium chloride) attracts water molecules in the blood, as sodium molecules are positively charged and water molecules are negatively charged.As a result, having too much salt in your diet causes your body to retain more fluid, leading to swelling in the feet, ankles and legs.


Avoid sodium rich foods such as table salt, soy sauce, cured meat and fish, canned goods, junk foods, cheese, pickles, instant noodles, salted nuts and seeds, pretzels and fast foods.
The degree to which you need to restrict your salt intake will differ from one person to another, depending upon the severity of the condition and your doctor’s advice. If you follow the recommended restrictions carefully, it can help to bring down swelling and reduce blood pressure.;
, Keeping your feet and ankles elevated helps to reduce blood flow to this part of the body (due to gravitational force), keeping swelling and inflammation under control.


At night, try to keep your feet elevated above heart level by placing one or two thick pillows underneath your ankles. Ideally, your legs should be elevated at a 30 degree angle.
You should also try to keep your legs elevated as much as possible throughout the day, by propping your feet up on cushions or pillows while lying on the couch.

, Applying a mixture of epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) and glycerine to the ankle helps to reduce swelling in the ankles and feet, as the salt draws excess fluid from the body.


Mix two parts epsom salt to one part glycerine and apply the mixture to the swollen skin around your feet and ankles. Cover the mixture with a bandage and leave in place overnight. Remove the bandage in the morning and repeat the treatment every night until you notice a decrease in swelling.
Even though it is the epsom salts that draw fluid from the body (as salt attracts water molecules) the glycerine is necessary to soothe the skin, as the salt can cause irritation and skin rashes. Glycerine is also a hygroscopic substance (meaning it has the ability to attract and hold water molecules) which gives the salt more time to take effect.

, It's a good idea to do some light exercise on a regular basis, as exercise causes you to sweat, which depletes stores of water in body.


When you exercise, your body temperature increases. Your body then releases stored water through the sweat ducts in an attempt to cool you down. With regular sweating, the water stores in your body will become depleted, lessening the swelling in your feet and ankles as a result.
Some good exercises that will cause you to sweat include walking, jogging, cycling and stair-stepping.

, As explained in the steps above, sodium causes your body to retain water, making swelling in the feet and ankles worse. Consuming more potassium-rich foods helps to rid your body of excess sodium and decrease swelling. This is due to the fact that your body always tries to maintain a delicate balance between potassium and sodium levels — so when potassium levels are high, sodium levels are low, and vice versa.Try to include at least one potassium-rich food in each major meal. Foods rich in potassium include bananas, white beans, spinach, potatoes, apricots, squash, yogurt, salmon, avocados and mushrooms.

, Smoking constricts the blood vessels, causing high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more prone to lupus nephritis and will experience increased swelling in the feet and ankles. Quitting smoking can be difficult, so for some helpful information on where to begin, see this article.

, A diuretic substance is one that increases the production of urine in the body. Increased urine production allows your body to get rid of any excess water it's storing, reducing swelling in the ankles and feet. The most effective diuretic foods include parsley, dandelion extract, celery seed and watercress., A cure for lupus nephritis has not yet been found, but medications (combined with the lifestyle changes outlined in the section above) can keep the condition under control and relieve its associated symptoms, such as swollen ankles and feet. The most commonly prescribed medications to treat lupus nephritis include:



Corticosteroids: These medications work by blocking chemicals in the immune system that are responsible for causing inflammation. The prescribed dosage of these medications is usually lowered as the condition improves, as they can cause serious side effects. Hydrocortisone is the most commonly used corticosteroid used to treat lupus nephritis, as it reduces the severity of swelling in joints and tendons. It comes in the form of creams, lotions or injections.Immunosuppressive drugs: These medications work to suppress the actions of the immune system that cause damage to the kidneys. Examples are Azathioprine, Cyclophosphamide, and Mycophenolate.

ACE Inhibitors: ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors help to improve blood flow and trigger the discharge of excess salt and water from the body system. As a result, blood flow will be improved and blood pressure will be controlled.Diuretics: Diuretics (also known as water pills) help to eradicate excess water and salt in the body. They work by forcing the kidneys to excrete excess sodium in the urine. This excess sodium draws water from the blood, helping to decrease swelling., In serious cases of lupus nephritis, dialysis is required to remove toxins from the body when the kidney is no longer able to perform this function on its own.


The patient is taken to a dialysis unit where an I.V catheter is inserted into the kidneys by a specialist nurse or a doctor. This I.V is then connected to the dialysis machine. The I.V carries bad, toxic blood to the machine, then returns purified blood to the kidneys.
Depending on how severe the kidney damage, dialysis sessions may be required two to three times per week.

, If all other treatment methods fail, it may be necessary to consider a kidney transplant. This procedure replaces the malfunctioning kidney with a healthy kidney from a willing donor.


Kidneys may be donated by a living related donor (an individuals with blood relation to the patient, such as parents, children or siblings), a living unrelated donor (an individual with no blood relation to the patient, such as spouse or friend) or a deceased donor (an individuals who died recently, but consented to donate a healthy kidney before their death).
The process for kidney donation is as follows: The donated kidney (or kidneys) is preserved in cool salt water. It is then tested to determine if it matches the recipient’s blood and tissue type. The transplant needs to be completed within 48 hours following the retrieval of the healthy kidney.
Following the treatment, additional medicines are usually prescribed to ensure that the recipient's immune system does not reject the newly transplanted organ.

, Lupus nephritis is a condition in which the immune system attacks the kidneys, causing them to malfunction.


When the kidneys malfunction they become swollen, and are unable to filter waste from the blood like they are supposed to. This leads to irregularities in the amount of fluid stored within the body. When excess fluid builds up in the body, it can lead to swelling in the ankles, feet and legs.Swollen ankles and feet are often the first noticeable symptom of lupus nephritis. The swelling may be absent at the start of the day, but become progressively worse following physical activity.

, Symptoms of lupus nephritis are generally similar to those of other kidney diseases. Aside from swollen ankles and feet, this may include one or more of the following:



Hematuria: Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. Bloody urine is often caused by infections or damage in the kidneys.

Foamy, frothy urine: Inflammation of the kidneys prevents them from functioning normally, which can lead to leakage or loss of protein through the urine, making it foamy or frothy.

Excessive urination at night: Kidneys control the production of urine. If your kidneys are damaged they may overproduce urine, leading to increased episodes of urination during the night.

Weight gain: Increased body weight is caused by salt and water retention in the body, due to malfunctioning kidneys. However, weight gain can also occur after steroid treatments, as a common side effect of steroids is increased appetite.

High blood pressure: The kidneys require constant pressure for the blood to be filtered. Therefore, the kidneys help to regulate blood pressure by producing a protein called angiotensin. If the kidney is damaged, however, it cannot regulate the blood pressure anymore and blood pressure increases. , Although a combination of swollen ankles and feet and any of the symptoms described above is a good indication of lupus nephritis, it will be necessary to undergo rigorous testing to confirm the diagnoses.



Blood Tests: Waste products such as creatinine and urea are normally excreted out of the body through the kidneys. If levels of these waste products are elevated in blood test result, it strongly suggests the presence of lupus nephritis. A blood sample will be drawn out of the vein and placed in a sterile container for examination.

24-Hour Urine Collection: For this test, a urine specimen is collected and tested for levels of protein. The procedure is repeated over a 24-hour period to gauge the ability of the kidneys to filter waste products. The urine is also tested for abnormal levels of red blood cells, white blood cells and proteins.

Iothalamate Clearance Testing: This procedure involves having a radioactive contrast dye (Iothalamate) injected into the blood to measure how quickly the kidneys can filter the substance and excrete it out of the body.

Kidney Biopsy: A kidney biopsy will be necessary to accurately establish the progress of the disease. During the procedure, a long needle is inserted through the stomach and into the kidneys in order to extract a sample of the tissue. The sample is then sent to the laboratory for testing.

Ultrasound: An ultrasound is performed to determine the size and shape of the kidneys and to check for the presence of any abnormalities or signs of damage.

, Lupus nephritis can classified into five different stages, according to a system developed by the World Health Organization. Your doctor may diagnose you with a specific stage of lupus nephritis after a careful and in-depth analysis of your condition.



Stage 1:' No indication of lupus nephritis

Stage 2: Mildest form of the condition, can be treated with corticosteroids

Stage 3: Earliest stage of advanced lupus, higher dosages of corticosteroids are required in treatment.

Stage 4: Advanced stage of lupus, higher dosages of corticosteroids are combined with other immune suppression drugs. Patient may be vulnerable to kidney failure.

Stage 5: Excessive protein loss and swelling, higher amounts of corticosteroids are prescribed with or without the mixture of immune-suppressing drugs.

Consult your doctor about whether you should be hospitalized.,
Gets lots of rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take acetaminophen to reduce pain and fever.,
Prevent further mosquito bites.",How to Treat Yellow Fever1," There’s no medication that cures yellow fever, but there are ways to manage your symptoms to help prevent the condition from worsening. The virus may pass on its own, though symptoms can be unpleasant and sometimes severe.If you are diagnosed with yellow fever, talk to your doctor about whether or not you should be hospitalized. Hospitalization can increase survival rates.For some, the safest idea is to stay in the hospital for observation and supportive care, which can include:Oxygen
Rest
IV (intravenous) fluids
Pain relievers
Dialysis if you have kidney failure
Monitoring your blood pressure
Treating other infections or complications that arise;
, If you have very mild symptoms, stay home and take care of yourself. Do not go to work or school until you are well. Stay in bed, relax, and rest – give your body time to recover and let the virus pass.If your symptoms worsen at all, seek medical care.

, You can easily become dehydrated if you are vomiting or have a high fever. Be sure to replace your fluids and stay hydrated while you’re sick.On average, men should drink 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids daily, and women should drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) a day.Drink at least that when you’re ill, and more if you’re vomiting or feverish. Tea, juice, and water count towards your fluids.

, Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an over-the-counter pain reliever and fever reducer. Take it to relieve symptoms as indicated on the bottle, or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.Don’t take acetaminophen if you have severe liver disease.
Because of the risk of bleeding when you have yellow fever, do not take medications that increase your risk of bleeding: aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen., Avoid getting any more mosquito bites for at least 5 days from when you get a fever. This reduces the risk that uninfected mosquitoes will pick up the illness and spread it to others."
"
Discuss your travel history with your doctor.,
Check yourself for mosquito bites.,
Suspect yellow fever if you have flu-like symptoms.,
Visit your doctor for testing.,
Be alert for the recurrence of more serious symptoms.",How to Treat Yellow Fever2," Yellow fever is present in some tropical and subtropical parts of Central and South America and Africa. If you live in or have travelled to any of the countries listed below, be wary of symptoms of yellow fever and alert your doctor:Countries in the Americas: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela

Countries in Africa: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda

, You can only get yellow fever from mosquito bites, not from being around other people who have it. Think about your exposure to mosquitoes while in an endemic area. If you’re not sure whether you were bitten, check your body for itchy red bug bites.


Illness usually occurs 3-6 days after you’re bitten by an infected mosquito., Many people never get symptoms from yellow fever. Those who do, however, experience symptoms similar to a bad flu. Symptoms can include sudden fever, chills, severe headache, body aches, back pain, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, dizziness, and weakness.Other less common symptoms of yellow fever include sensitivity to lightor red eyes, tongue, or face.
High fever, jaundice, and bleeding are severe symptoms, and they might cause shock and multiple organ failure, which can be deadly. If you develop severe symptoms, get immediate medical attention.

, Diagnosis of yellow fever is based on your symptoms, travel history, a physical exam, and a blood test.See your doctor if you’ve travelled somewhere with yellow fever and have any symptoms of yellow fever. Accurate diagnosis is important so you know you have yellow fever and not something else, and so you can seek supportive care.

, About 15% of people infected with yellow fever will progress to more serious symptoms, including possible heart, liver, and kidney failure. This toxic stage usually occurs after your initial symptoms improve for several hours to a day. If you experience any of the following, go to the hospital to be monitored and prevent serious complications:High fever (over 103°F/39.4°C)Jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes)
Bleeding (hemorrhaging) – you may have abdominal pain and vomit blood, or you may bleed from your nose, mouth or eyesUrinating less than usual
Slow heart rate
Seizures, delirium, or coma

Get vaccinated.,
Use insect repellent.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Protect yourself throughout the day and night.",How to Treat Yellow Fever3," Get the yellow fever vaccine if you live in, or are travelling to, the parts of South America or Africa where yellow fever is present. The vaccine is approved for people over 9 months old. Get the vaccine at specific centers that provide it, which you can find through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) yellow fever clinic finder website.


Some countries require that you get the vaccine or a booster dose in order to travel there. If you’ll be travelling, check the CDC’s travel page.Ask your doctor whether it’s safe for you to get the vaccine if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, over 60 years old, or have HIV without symptoms.Do NOT get the vaccine if you’re allergic to any part of it, have symptomatic HIV or other immune system disorders, have cancer, or are taking immunosuppressant drugs or recently had a transplant.

, Avoid mosquito bites to prevent transmission of yellow fever. Any time you are outdoors in an area that has yellow fever, wear EPA-registered (Environmental Protection Agency) insect repellent on any uncovered skin.Reapply the repellent if you start to get mosquito bites. Apply it as directed on the container.


Use repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus for best protection.
Don’t put repellent over cuts or wounds, or into your eyes. Wash off repellent with soapy water when you go indoors.It’s safe to use insect repellent on children. However, do not use oil of lemon eucalyptus on children under 3 years old.

, Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and socks when outdoors. Spray insect repellent that contains permethrin over your clothes to deter mosquitoes from biting through the fabric. You can also purchase clothing that is pretreated with permethrin – a repellent you can use over clothes but not directly on your skin., Though many mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn, one type of mosquito that transmits yellow fever is also active during the day. Protect yourself around the clock by wearing repellent and appropriate clothing any time you’re outdoors. When possible, sleep in an air-conditioned room with closed or screened windows, or under a mosquito net."

Stop and rest for a few minutes.,
Try some relaxation techniques.,
Use a vagal maneuver.,
Avoid substances and habits that can trigger tachycardia.,
Ask your doctor about the cause of your tachycardia.,
Ask your doctor about medication side effects and interactions.,
Control high blood pressure and cholesterol levels.,
Talk to your doctor about anti-arrhythmic medication.,
Consider catheter ablation if appropriate.,
Think about a surgical procedure if recommended.",How to Treat Tachycardia," Most people experience short episodes of tachycardia on rare occasions due to high levels of stress, a sudden fright or an anxiety attack.If this sounds like the cause of your ""racing"" heart, then stop what you're doing and rest for five to 10 minutes. Maybe that means turning off a scary movie or removing yourself from a stressful situation (argument) or taking your mind off of a financial problem. Resting, relaxing and taking deep breaths can naturally lower your heart rate.


Normal resting heart rate can vary quite a bit amongst people, but it's defined as between 60 and 100 beats per minute.Greater than 100 beats, while at rest, is the threshold for defining tachycardia.
Tachycardia doesn't always cause symptoms, but when it does the main one is feeling a racing heart or palpitations in your chest.Other symptoms are possible and can include: shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting and chest pain.;
, Since stress and anxiety are relatively common triggers for tachycardia and hyperventilation, you can help prevent them by managing how you react or respond to stressful situations.Stress-relieving techniques like yoga, tai chi, deep breathing, visualization and meditation are all helpful for promoting relaxation and better emotional health.Ask at your local gym, community center or health clinic about joining a stress-relieving class.


Try to limit the stress in your life by making positive changes — get out of an abusive relationship, change your job, spend less time with negative people. Control anxious thoughts about your work, finances and relationships.
Excessive stress and anxiety causes the release of hormones that prepare your body for ""fight or flight"", which leads to increased heart and breathing rates.
Don't forget to get enough quality sleep — at least eight hours per night, although some people need up to 11 hours for best health. A chronic lack of sleep can lead to anxiety and heart palpitations.

, Vagal maneuvers are simple actions that you can do with your body that affect the vagus nerve, which is the main one regulating your heartbeat.Maneuvers that affect the vagus nerve include doing the Valsalva technique, triggering the diving reflex, and repeatedly coughing. These simple maneuvers should be done as soon as you realize you're experiencing an episode of tachycardia — they can slow your heart rate down within seconds if done correctly. Ask your doctor for a demonstration of these maneuvers.


The Valsalva maneuver involves holding your breath and bearing down as if you're having a bowel movement for about 10–15 seconds. It's a simple procedure, but it can change the rhythm of electrical impulses in your heart and help your heart rate return to normal.
All people have a diving reflex, which gets activated when plunged into cold water — the body automatically slows its heart rate down to reduce blood flow in an attempt to preserve itself. To trigger this reflex, put very cold water or an ice pack against your face for at least 30 seconds.
You can also try coughing forcefully., There are a number of substances that can trigger tachycardia, including alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, some illicit drugs (such as cocaine) and some over-the-counter medications (particularly cold and cough medicines);therefore, if you're having periodic heart palpitations and feel that your heart is racing, you should stop smoking as well as cut back on alcohol and caffeine-rich beverages.


Caffeine is found in coffee, black and green teas, most soda pop (particularly colas), energy drinks and chocolate. Caffeine doesn't give you energy — it stimulates brain activity and increases heart rate and blood pressure.
Consuming nicotine from cigarette smoking can increase your resting heart rate up to 15 beats/min and increase blood pressure up to 10 mm Hg.Binge drinking alcohol (like on the weekends, for example) often increases heart rate, whereas chronic alcoholism tends to cause fluctuations (from too high to too low).Tachycardia is more common in anxious young people, especially among females who drink lots of coffee/alcohol and smoke heavily., There are three types of tachycardia: atrial or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), sinus tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. They are caused by different things, and discovering which type of tachycardia you are suffering from will help your doctor decide on the appropriate treatment.

Atrial or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) begins in the upper chambers of the heart. It is the most common type of tachycardia found in children and may be caused by anxiety, fatigue, smoking, drinking alcohol, or caffeine.Sinus tachycardia may be caused by a fever, anxiety, medication or recreational drugs, fright, strenuous exercise, or severe emotional distress.Ventricular tachycardia begins in the lower chambers of the heart and can be life-threatening. Seek immediate treatment if you have another cardiac condition and experience rapid heart beat. Ventricular tachycardia may be caused by lack of oxygen in the heart, medication, sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disease), or distortion of the structure of the heart due to disease., Some medications, particularly when they are combined with others, can trigger bouts of tachycardia as a negative side effect. More specifically, anti-arrhythmic drugs (used to treat abnormal heart rhythms), digitalis, asthma medications, steroid therapy and most cold/cough remedies are well known to increase heart rate.Ask your doctor if your prescription medication(s) could trigger tachycardia as an unwanted side effect.


Due to complex chemical interactions in the human body, it's virtually impossible to predict how more than two medications (taken concurrently) may interact with each other. Read the list of side effects of your drugs carefully.
If you suspect a medication is triggering bouts of tachycardia, don't stop taking the drug ""cold turkey"" without the supervision of your doctor — it may cause worse symptoms. It's better to wean yourself off a medication and then switch to another with similar actions.

, Cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, increases blood pressure and makes your heart work harder by beating faster. High blood cholesterol is a primary risk factor for atherosclerosis, which involves clogged arteries from plaque build up. Clogged arteries trigger higher blood pressure (hypertension), which then often translates into higher than normal heart rate. Ask your doctor about lifestyle changes and medications that can keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control so you can reduce your risk of tachycardia.Normal blood cholesterol levels are less than 200 mg/dL, whereas healthy blood pressure is less than 135/80 mmHg.Reduce saturated and trans fats in your diet and eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains and nuts.
If lifestyle and dietary changes don't lower cholesterol levels significantly, then medication may be needed. Cholesterol-lowering medications include statins, niacin-based drugs, bile-acid resins, fibric acid derivatives and cholesterol absorption inhibitors.
Common medications for high blood pressure include thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and renin inhibitors.

, If no other cause of your tachycardia can be found and dietary/lifestyle changes or vagal maneuvers don't help much, then medication will likely be needed. Primary causes of tachycardia that require medicine include cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, myocarditis and heart valve disease.Anti-arrhythmic medications can quickly reduce heart rates, especially if they are given via injection. Other medications that may be prescribed (and often used in combination with anti-arrhythmic drugs) are calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapami) and beta blockers (metoprolol, esmolol).


During an emergency situation, a doctor or nurse at the hospital may inject a quick-acting anti-arrhythmic drug (lidocaine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone) into a vein to treat an acute case of tachycardia.
Patients who are at risk for tachycardia may also be given a slow-acting oral anti-arrhythmic medication (flecainide or propafenone) to take at home at the onset of tachycardia.

, Catheter ablation is an invasive procedure recommended when an extra electrical pathway (sending too many signals to the heart) is responsible for chronic tachycardia.It involves inserting a catheter into a groin, neck or arm vein and maneuvering it to the heart, where electrodes at the tip of the catheter destroy the extra electrical pathway with either heat, cold or radio frequencies.


Catheter ablation is very effective, especially for ventricular tachycardia. It can also be used to treat atrial fibrillations and flutters.
Catheter procedures carry a risk of damaging veins and dislodging emboli that can cause a heart attack or stroke. It may also damage the walls of the heart and affect the electrical system of the heart.Tests that your doctor can use to detect a ventricular tachycardia include: a continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), a regular ECG, and an intracardiac electrophysiology study.

, Surgery is a last resort for controlling tachycardia, but for some it may be the only effective option. There are a couple of different devices that can be implanted into your chest that are effective for treating tachycardia, such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.More invasive procedures involve open-heart surgery to either destroy extra electrical pathways or repair heart damage directly.


A pacemaker is a small device placed under the skin that sends electrical impulses to the heart when it senses abnormal heartbeats. It helps the heart resume normal contractions, rhythms and rates. A pacemaker is used to treat bradycardia (abnormally slow heart beat). When it is used for tachycardia, it is typically combined with a heart rate control medication, and/or RFA of the tachycardic focus.
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a cellphone-sized device implanted in the chest like a pacemaker, but it's connected to the heart with wires.An ICD delivers precisely calibrated electrical shocks when it senses an abnormal heart rate.
Ask your doctor which of these devices is most appropriate for your tachycardia.

The perceptions must occur during a state of consciousness, however, and they will seem very real.


Most hallucinations are disorienting and cause distress in those experiencing them, but some can seem pleasant or enjoyable.
Hearing voices qualifies as an auditory hallucination, while seeing lights, people, or objects that aren't really there is a common visual hallucination. The sensation of ""insects"" or other objects crawling on the skin is a common hallucination of touch.;
, High fevers have been known to cause hallucinations of all degrees, especially in children and the elderly. Even if you do not fall into either demographic, fever can still be a cause of some hallucinations, so it is worth checking for.


Hallucinations can occur with any fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius), but they are more common when dealing with fevers higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Any fever higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) warrants immediate medical attention, regardless of whether or not it is accompanied by hallucinations.
For fevers you can treat at home, begin by taking a fever-reducing medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Drink plenty of fluids and monitor your temperature regularly., Mild and moderate hallucinations can be caused by severe sleep deprivation. Severe hallucinations are generally caused by other conditions but can be aggravated by sleep deprivation, as well.


The average adult should receive between seven and nine hours of sleep every night. If you are currently suffering from severe sleep deprivation, you may need to temporarily increase this amount by several hours until your body recovers.
Sleeping during the day can disturb your usual sleep cycle and may trigger insomnia and hallucinations as a result. If your sleeping patterns are thrown off, you should try to establish a normal sleep pattern.

, Anxiety is another common cause of mild to moderate hallucinations, and it can also worsen severe hallucinations caused by other factors. As such, learning to minimize mental and physical stress can help reduce the frequency and severity of your hallucinations.Reduce physical stress by keeping yourself hydrated and well-rested. Regular light to moderate exercise can also improve your overall health and relieve your body of stress-related symptoms, including mild hallucinations.

, If you are unable to distinguish reality from hallucination, you should seek immediate emergency medical care.


You should also schedule an appointment with your doctor if you experience mild hallucinations on a frequent basis, since they are probably caused by an underlying medical condition. This is especially true if taking general home measures to improve your health have no effect.
If you experience hallucinations that are accompanied by other severe symptoms, you should also seek emergency medical care. Such symptoms include discolored lips or fingernails, chest pain, clammy skin, confusion, loss of consciousness, high fever, vomiting, abnormal pulse, breathing difficulties, injury, seizure, severe abdominal pain, or irrational behavior.

, People who experience hallucinations may not openly talk about what they sense. In these instances, you will need to know how to identify less obvious signs of hallucination.


Someone with auditory hallucinations may seem unaware of his or her surroundings and may excessively talk to himself or herself. That individual may seek isolation or obsessively listen to music in an attempt to drown out the voices.
Someone who visually fixates on something you cannot see might be experiencing a visual hallucination.
Scratching or brushing away seemingly invisible disturbances can be a sign of tactile hallucinations, while holding one's nose can indicate smell-based hallucinations. Spitting food out can be a sign of taste-based hallucinations.

, If you need to treat or help someone else suffering from hallucinations, it is important to remain calm throughout the entire process.


Hallucinations can become sources of severe anxiety, so the patient might already be in a state of panic. Adding more stress and panic to the situation will only worsen things.
When someone you know suffers from frequent hallucinations, you should also discuss what happens during a time when he or she is not actively hallucinating. Ask about what is most likely to occur and what the patient needs you to do to offer support.

, Calmly explain to the patient that you are unable to see, hear, feel, taste, or touch the sensation he or she is describing.


Explain this in a straightforward and non-accusatory manner to avoid upsetting the patient.
If the hallucinations are mild to moderate, and if the patient has had past episodes of hallucinations, you may also try to explain that the sensations he or she is experiencing are not real.
Patients who experience hallucinations for the first time or those with severe hallucinations may not be able to understand that they are hallucinating, however, and may lash out if they are questioned or doubted.

, Depending on the circumstances, it might be helpful to distract the patient by switching topics of conversation or by physically moving to a different location.


This is especially true of mild to moderate hallucinations, but you may not be able to reason with patients experiencing severe hallucinations.

, If you know someone who suffers from frequent hallucinations, you should strongly encourage that individual to seek professional medical or psychological help.


Talk with the patient when he or she is not actively experiencing a hallucination. Discuss the severity of the situation and share any knowledge you have on potential causes and solutions. Approach the situation from a position of support and love, though, and never from an accusatory standpoint.

, When hallucinations escalate in severity, they can become a safety threat to the person experiencing them or to others around that individual.


When safety is an issue, you should call for emergency medical help.
If hallucinations are accompanied by other severe physical symptoms, or if they are so severe that the patient can no longer separate fiction from reality, you should also seek emergency medical care.

, Hallucinations are typically symptomatic of certain psychiatric disorders, but some physiological medical conditions can cause hallucinations, too. The only way to fix the hallucinations long-term is to treat the underlying condition causing them.Psychological conditions known to cause hallucinations include schizophrenia, schizoid or schizotypal personality disorders, psychotic depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Physiological conditions that impact the central nervous system can cause hallucinations, as well. These can include brain tumors, delirium, dementia, epilepsy, stroke, and Parkinson's disease.
Certain infections, like bladder infections or chest infections, may also cause hallucinations. Migraines can cause hallucinations in some individuals, too.
Drug or alcohol abuse can cause hallucinations, too, especially when consumed in high quantities or during periods of withdrawal.

, Antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptic drugs, can control hallucinations in most circumstances. These drugs can be prescribed to help treat hallucinations caused by both psychological and physiological conditions, especially when other treatments are unavailable or not enough.Clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic, is normally given in doses between 6 to 50 mg per day depending on the severity of the hallucinations. The dosage must be increased slowly to prevent fatigue. Regular white blood cell tests must be taken while on this medication, however, since it can lower white blood cell counts to dangerous levels.
Quetiapine is another atypical neuroleptic that can treat hallucinations. It is generally less effective than clozapine in most circumstances, but it is also fairly safe to use for most underlying conditions.
Other common antipsychotics include risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and ziprasidone. These medications are generally well tolerated by most patients, but may not be safe for patients suffering with Parkinson's disease.

, Some medications used to treat other conditions can cause hallucinations in some individuals. This is an especially common occurrence among patients with Parkinson's disease.


Even if you suspect that medications might be causing your hallucinations, you should never stop any drug without first talking to your doctor. Suddenly stopping a medication can cause other complications.
In the case of Parkinson's patients, amantadine and other anticholinergic medications are typically stopped first. If this does not help, dopamine agonists might be lowered to a smaller dosage or stopped entirely.
When controlling these medications does not control a patient's hallucinations, doctors may still prescribe and antipsychotic drug. This is also the case when lowering the dosage of these medications causes other Parkinson's symptoms to return or worsen.

, If you're addicted to hallucination-inducing drugs or alcohol, you should check into a rehabilitation program to help you recover from your addiction.


Cocaine, LSD, amphetamines, marijuana, heroin, ketamine, PCP, and ecstasy can all cause hallucinations.
While some drugs can cause hallucinations, quitting the substance too suddenly can cause hallucinations to develop, too. Hallucinations caused by withdrawal can usually be controlled with antipsychotic medications, though.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy, in particular, can help some patients who suffer from frequent hallucinations, especially when those hallucinations are caused by psychological disorders.This type of therapy evaluates and monitors the patient's perceptions and beliefs. By identifying possible psychological triggers, a professional psychologist might be able to construct strategies that allow the patient to cope with and reduce symptoms.

, Both support groups and self-help groups can minimize severity and frequency of hallucinations, especially when those hallucinations are auditory and caused by psychological triggers.


Support groups provide patients with a way to plant themselves firmly in reality, thereby helping them to separate false hallucinations from real life.
Self-help groups encourage people to accept responsibility over their hallucinations in a manner that encourages them to control and cope with those hallucinations.

Know the basics of medical cryotherapy, cryosurgery, and/or cryoablation.,
Prepare for topical cryotherapy for skin conditions.,
Understand the use of cryotherapy for surgical procedures.,
Consult your doctor first.,
Ensure proper safety procedures.,
Make sure you are dry.,
Track your results.,
Educate yourself about cryotherapy.,
Consider all the beneficial claims.,
Compare these claims with the existing science.,
Weigh the limited risks and the unproven benefits.",How to Try Cryotherapy," You may hear your doctor use one of these terms when discussing medical treatments ranging from removing a skin tag to combatting an aggressive form of cancer. Any medical term starting with “cryo-” denotes the use of extreme cold as a treatment, and is based on the premise that a targeted tumor, lesion, etc., can be destroyed by contact with the extreme cold.Medical cryotherapy in practically every form utilizes some sort of “cryoprobe,” a needle or wand-like device that feeds a supply of super-cold liquid nitrogen or argon to a small tip that can make contact with the target area. Technically, a cotton swab dipped in liquid nitrogen to freeze off a wart is a cryoprobe, as is the delicate tool used for cryosurgery to treat cancer.;
, Simple cryotherapy treatments may occur in your physician’s office, in order to treat various skin issues. Conditions that may be suited for topical cryotherapy include warts, lesions, skin tags, moles, freckles, and nodules. Cryotherapy is rarely used to treat skin cancers, however.Little to no prior preparation is required for most topical cryotherapy treatments. The doctor may prescribe a dose of ibuprofen beforehand for pain, or possibly an antibiotic in case of infection. Minor pain and redness is possible for a few days after the procedure, but care should be taken to watch for signs of infection — such as significant redness, swelling, or fluid discharge.

, Far beyond just skin tags and freckles, modern medical cryotherapy is being used in treatments for irritated nerve clusters, chronic cervicitis or cervical dysplasia, mesothelioma, prostate cancer, and atrial fibrillation, to name a few examples. The basic concept is the same — using extreme cold to kill a particular target — but cryosurgery is a more intensive and delicate procedure.Cryosurgery is often an outpatient procedure conducted by an interventional radiologist in an operating suite. General anesthesia may be utilized, and your vital signs will be monitored. The physician will used specialized tools to guide the probe to the target area — down the throat, through an incision, etc. — and freeze it with the liquid nitrogen or argon.Most procedures take one to three hours, and may have to be repeated in order to effectively freeze and kill the targeted tissue.
Regular activities can usually be resumed after 72 hours, and full recovery from the cryosurgery itself can take 7-10 days.
Consult your physician about the specifics of your cryosurgery procedure.

, Non-medical, non-physician-guided forms of cryotherapy such as whole body cryotherapy (in which you subject your entire body to extreme cold for a few minutes) have become popular in recent years. For most people, both targeted and whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) treatments are likely to have no short-term or long-term health risks. The jolt to your system that occurs when you subject it to temperatures of -150 or even -250 degrees Fahrenheit, however, can be dangerous for some people in elevated risk categories. It is always safest to talk to your physician before trying cryotherapy.Pregnant women and people with a history of severe high blood pressure or heart problems should not try cryotherapy — especially WBC — without medical clearance. Children under age eighteen should always have parental consent.

, If you are at a low risk for adverse reactions and choose a cryotherapy facility that takes safety precautions seriously, you have very little risk of injury when undergoing the treatment. The story of a Nevada spa employee who accidentally locked herself in a cryotherapy chamber after hours and subsequently froze to death, however, highlights the fact that unsafe procedures can indeed have dire consequences.For your safety, you should never be left alone while undergoing WBC treatment. You should be able to open your WBC tube, chamber, or enclosure yourself from the inside at any time (no external locks). The device should be on an automatic timer that shuts it off after the intended treatment time (often 2-4 minutes). Do not be afraid to ask about the safety procedures in use at any cryotherapy facility your are considering.

, You might assume that exposing your bare skin to extremely cold temperatures must cause immediate frostbite, but this will not be the case if you ensure that there is no external moisture on your body. Never go into a WBC device with wet clothing on; in fact, generally speaking, the less clothing you wear (beyond dry coverings for your feet, hands, and genital area), the better.Your chosen cryotherapy facility should take extra precautions to make sure you are dry, perhaps going so far as to make sure you towel or blow-dry your armpits. A damp pair of socks can cause frostbite in seconds in a WBC chamber, so don’t take this precaution lightly.

, Current scientific evidence says that WBC and similar targeted cryotherapy treatments have little or no apparent value in excess of what an ice pack or ice bath offers, while believers in the treatment can make convincing arguments for its benefits. The only way to know if cryotherapy makes you feel better is to try it and keep track of your individual results.Right after a WBC treatment, people tend to say they feel a burst of energy, experience pain relief, and have a great night’s sleep. How much of this is only a psychological benefit, and how lasting such benefits may be, are difficult to quantify. Take note of any benefits you experience after a session and see how long they seem to last. Use this information to determine if continued cryotherapy treatments are right for you., The use of cold for both short- and long-term treatment has been a staple of medical practice for ages. Modern whole-body cryotherapy (WBC), however, was developed in Japan in the late 1970s to treat rheumatoid arthritis. During the 1980s and 1990s, elite athletes began using WBC and targeted cryotherapy to recuperate and treat injuries. In the past decade or so, cryotherapy has become available to the general public at many spas, health clubs, etc.Modern cryotherapy uses vaporized liquid nitrogen to achieve temperatures of up to -250 degrees Fahrenheit. WBC treatments tend to last for 2-4 minutes, while the subject stands in a cylinder, chamber, or enclosure., As it has increased in popularity, WBC in particular has experienced an explosion in the number of health benefits claimed for it. Some supposed benefits are at least partially grounded in medical science, while others are purely speculative and scientifically dubious at best. In the U.S., WBC and similar targeted cryotherapy treatments outside of medical settings are not regulated by the FDA, and thus cannot be legally claimed as a means to medically diagnose, treat, or cure any illness or injury.Claims that WBC can ease muscle and joint pain, increase energy and focus, and encourage better sleep seem at least reasonable in the short term, considering knowledge regarding the temporary impacts of cold temperatures on muscle soreness, adrenal response, and metabolism. Long-term impacts in these areas are more speculative, as are claims that cryotherapy can give you younger looking skin, cause weight loss, make your hair and nails grow faster, and so on.

, According to modern medical science, relying on cryotherapy for exceptional and/or lasting benefits requires a (very cold) leap of faith on your part. Research indicates some subjective improvement in recovery time and muscle soreness for athletes, but little evidence of functional (long-term) recovery. Indeed, even though athletes have been using WBC for years, the evidence is weak at best that it offers any benefits in key areas of sports recovery, namely increased antioxidant capacity and decreased inflammation.To sum up the most recent science on cryotherapy: the good news is that there are no known likely adverse effects, so long as proper safety measures are taken. The bad news is that far cheaper alternatives like ice packs and cold baths seem to offer the same benefits.

, Some people consider non-medical cryotherapy to be a godsend, while others see it as a fad that bilks people out of their money. Because the risks are so low, you may want to consider trying cryotherapy, especially if you have nagging joint or muscle pain, or want to take a chance that your appearance, sleep, or weight loss regimen may improve. Just make sure your doctor gives you a health clearance to do so and that proper safety precautions are taken at your chosen cryotherapy center.Of course, cost should be factored in when you make your decision whether or not to give cryotherapy a try. In many locales in the U.S., a single 2-4 minute WBC treatment can cost upwards of $70 or more, and it is likely that you will need several treatments per week to see any ongoing benefits. So, if you try several WBC treatments over a week or two and don’t see any results that are worth the cost, take time to consider whether you might be wasting your money."

Retain from picking scabs.,
Keep infections at bay.,
Clean it carefully.,
Visit a doctor.",How to Treat Scars1," Letting a wound scab over, and having it fall off naturally will reduce risks unnecessary scarring. Picking scabs will cause further damage to the tender skin.;
, Be conscious of what goes around or near a wound. Anything foreign that comes in to contact with a wound (especially a fresh one) runs higher risks of infection and slowing the healing process. A way to prevent this is to wear a bandage that is designed with minute punctures, to still allow air to enter., Run the wound under water, or gently wipe it with sterile cotton. If wiping, ensure to wipe from the center of the wound outward. Do this daily, especially, in the early stages of an acquired injury to speed up the scabbing process.

, To prevent scarring from being really prevalent, ask a doctor for advice. They can recommend ways to properly treat a wound that will let it heal without implications. Or, they can prescribe other methods to hasten healing."

Accelerate the process of scar reduction with an aloe vera plant in its many forms.,
Rub on an essential oil known for scar treatment.,
Apply liquid drops of Vitamin E on to scars two or three times.,
Swab a scar using a sterile cotton ball, damp with lemon juice.",How to Treat Scars2," Scarred skin will benefit from soothing and moisturizing properties of aloe vera gel, cream or even juices directly from a leaf of the plant. Applying it one or two times a day for a few months will help visibly reduce a scar's size and appearance.

, This will speed up the production of new skin cells to replace damaged ones.Most oils can be bought over the shelf, such as:


Mustard Seed OilLavender OilTea tree oil. This type of oil has regular properties of all other scar-removing oils, except that it is extremely potent. Ensure to dilute the oil with water before applying.
Helichrysum. This oil is quite expensive, but is greatly known for its scar reduction abilities.Try looking at other oils before resorting to this oil.

, The vitamin not only lightens scars, but also strengthens the skin to reduce the risk of future injuries. You can also start eating more Vitamin E rich foods:


Hazelnuts.
Fish.
Seeds.
Wheat Germ.
Peanuts.
Dark leafy greens.

, Pat it directly to the skin; let it sit for a minute or two, then wash it off with some water. The juice rejuvenates damaged skin by speeding up the production of new cells. This also gently exfoliates and bleaches the skin as well."

Reduce scar irritation with a readily available silicone gel sheets at drugstores.,
Cover a scar with a light layer of bleaching cream.,
Apply sunscreen, with an SPF of 30 or higher, to prevent over-pigmentation.",How to Treat Scars3," It’s recommended that this method is to be used for at least three months, but the results are highly promising.Stick the sheet of the silicone gel on to a scar to increase hydration, and prevent bacteria from taking residence, further traumatizing the skin and deepening the scar., A scar forms because melanin (the chemical that gives your skin its natural pigment) is sent to “color up” the area where skin was lost through scabbing. This often results in dark splotches. Bleaching creams work to reduce the amount of melanin in a specific area. Overtime, the skin will lighten and no trace of the scar can be found. , By having protection against UVA and UVB rays, the already sensitive skin around a scar won’t be irritated, and its appearance won’t be worsened."
"
Erase a scar with dermabrasion.,
Replace a scar with new skin underneath with microdermabrasion.,
Graft skin from elsewhere on the body over top a scar.,
Laser away scars to guarantee their riddance.",How to Treat Scars4," The process involved a brush rapidly spinning to buff away scarred skin, removing darkness while leveling the skin for smoothness. It’s not an invasive procedure and it is a quick fix to removing light surface scars., The procedure exfoliates the scarred skin by blasting tiny crystals at it. Then, as the brush moves across it scrapes off the scar to reveal new skin underneath. It’s very much like dermabrasion, except that it is tougher, removing a thicker layer of skin to ensure scars and other bodily marks are gone for good.Microdermabrasion can also be done at home through kits sold at drugstores or grocery stores. These usually contain a brush and cream you can manually use to scrub scars (and other blemishes) away., For scars that have thickened over time and may be too difficult to sand off or lighten with creams, you can simply cover it with un-scarred skin., By using an instrument that pulses laser light directly on to the scar, a dermatologist or surgeon performs this to break down scar tissue. Once its broken down it is naturally re-absorbed in to the body. The benefit of laser treatments is that it is ideal for almost all skin types; the intensity of the pulses are adjusted to patients’ specific skin tones."

Make an appointment with a physical therapist.",How to Treat Sciatica with Exercise," Many health professionals will recommend core strengthening exercises like the plank to help alleviate pain. Stronger core muscles help to support and relieve your back.They also help keep your pelvis in a neutral alignment, decreasing compression of the nerves.


Lie face-down on a soft surface, such as an exercise mat. Prop yourself off the ground by using your forearms and toes to support the body. The elbows should be directly under the shoulder. Make a double chin and keep the shoulder blades back and down to maintain proper spinal alignment.
Tighten the abdomen as if you are about to be punched in the gut. Tuck your hips under and squeeze your glutes, keeping your entire body in a straight, rigid line. Try to make yourself as long and as strong as you can from the crown of your head out through your heels.
Maintain this position for 10 seconds or until you begin to wobble. Breathe normally throughout the plank. Do three sets with 30 second rests in between. Work your way up until you can do 30 second holds with good form.;
, These muscles protect the spine against sudden twisting movements and provide additional support to your back.Start by laying on your left side on a soft surface like an exercise mat.
Lift your body off the surface by supporting your weight with the left elbow and outer side of the left foot. Your left shoulder should be tracking straight over your left elbow.
Maintain an erect posture as if you are standing tall. Look straight, brace your abdomen, keep the shoulders back and down, and squeeze your butt.
You should maintain this position for 10 seconds by continuously engaging your left oblique muscles (the muscles at the side of your belly).
This can be a very challenging move. If you are struggling, try staggering the feet for more support, or performing with the left knee down.
Do three sets of 10 second holds. Work your way up to 30-second holds with proper form. Switch sides and repeat.

, Leg lifts will help strengthen your lower abdominal muscles and remove the strain from your lower back and sciatic nerve.Start by lying down on the floor on your back either on an exercise mat or on the carpet. Press your lower back down to the floor and pull your bellybutton in toward the floor.
Your pelvic alignment is essential to getting this exercise right an not causing further harm. It may be necessary for you to put your hands under your lower back for support, or put a slight bend in your knees.
Keeping both legs straight (if you can), slowly raise your left leg off the floor while keeping your knee straight. Hold for five seconds, and return back to the original pose.
Then do the same with your other leg. Repeat the alternation five times or as many times as you are able.

, This exercise helps strengthen the back of your legs, buttocks, and lower back.Lay down on the floor on your back with both knees bent and the soles of your feet flat on the floor.
Then, push up using your buttocks while your back is straight. Your body should form a straight line declining from your knees to your head.
Hold for five seconds to 10, and relax. Repeat this exercise five times if able.

, This exercise is similar to a traditional crunch. It strengthens the abs and the upper rectus to help relieve pressure from the lower back.Begin by laying flat on your back on an exercise mat or carpet. Fold your arms across your chest.
Slowly roll and lift your head up off the ground followed by your shoulders. You should feel your entire core become tight and engaged.
Hold this position for two to four seconds or as long as you're able. Slowly lower your shoulders and head back down to the starting position.
Continue with this exercise until you can complete two sets of 10 curls., A standing hamstring stretch is an exercise that can help treat sciatica pain by stretching and lengthening the hamstring (back of your thigh) muscles.Stand in front of a low table or sturdy box. Place one heel on the table or box on it while standing straight and keeping your foot flexed and toes pointed to the ceiling.
Slowly bend over at the waist, making sure to keep your back straight. Try to touch your toes, as much as you can until you feel a slight stretch in your hamstrings. If you're not able to touch the toes, rest your hands on your shin or knee for a more comfortable position.
Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then return your foot to the floor. Repeat this stretch two to three times per leg., Flexing and bending your back forward can alleviate pain from sciatica. This helps to alleviate the irritation or impingement on the nerve.Start by lying on your back on the floor on an exercise mat or carpet. Bend both of your knees while raising them towards your chest.
You will be able to feel a light stretch at the lower part of your back. Hold your knees at a position that you feel a light, yet comfortable stretching sensation in your lower back.
Hold the stretch for thirty seconds, and repeat four to six times., Although a common pose to yoga, the child's pose is another exercise that can cause the comfortable, forward bending stretch that can help alleviate sciatica pain.Sit on your knees on a carpet or exercise mat. Lower your forehead to the ground and rest your head comfortably.
Stretch your arms out in front of you and over your head and just allow them to relax, palm-side down on the mat or carpet in front of you.
Hold this position for 30 seconds and repeat four to six times as you're able and feel comfortable., The piriformis stretch or ""ankle over knee"" exercise helps to loosen the piriformis muscle and increases its flexibility. Increased piriformis flexibility reduces the pressure on the sciatic nerve underneath.It is important to stretch the piriformis because, while it is very small and deep, it runs directly over the sciatic nerve. Increased tension in this muscle will cause compression of the sciatic nerve (possibly all the way down the leg).


Lie down on your back on the carpet or exercise mat. Bend both of your knees at a 90 degree angle and keep feet flat on the floor.
Place the left ankle on top of the right leg's knee. Your legs should now form a figure four pattern. The outer side of the left ankle should rest comfortably on the right leg’s front thigh.
Grab the back of your right thigh and slowly pull your thigh forward. You should feel a stretch deep in the left butt muscle. This is the piriformis being stretched.
Keep your butt on the ground the whole time and hold the position for 30 seconds. People older than 40 years old should hold the position for 60 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat two to three times per leg., Although you might feel like you want to rest or take time off from being physically active, studies have shown that being inactive or taking to bed rest might be counterproductive to managing your sciatica.The USDA typically recommends that you participate in about 150 minutes or 2 1/2 hours of physical activity or cardio exercises each week.This breaks down to 30 minutes five days a week.
If you're not currently exercising, just starting, or not currently doing 150 minutes of exercise each week, take it slow. Start with 60 minutes a week and then slowly progress until you meet your goal.
Higher intensity, high impact exercises like running might not be appropriate for your condition. However, walking or water aerobics may be more gentle and comfortable for you.

, People with sciatica and other muscles aches and pains have successfully used a combination of hot and cold compression packs to ease their pain.Start with icing your painful muscles and joints. This helps decrease inflammation which is one of the main causes of irritation to the sciatic nerve.Apply the ice pack for about 20 minutes several times a day. Make sure your ice pack is covered in a towel.
Transition to hot packs after using the cold packs. Use a few times a day for relief.
You may want to alternate between both hot and cold packs. If you exercise, stretch or do strengthening exercises, you may start with cold to prevent inflammation and then use heat to ease the pain.

, There are several options for sciatica pain management. These might help you stay active, stretch and strengthen the muscles to help reduce your pain long-term.Although the pain you may feel from your sciatica may be intense, try self-medicating with over-the-counter or OTC medications. If you can manage the pain with these, it's better than having to take narcotic or opioid medications.
Try: paracetamol and NSAIDS for relief. Make sure to read the dosage and consumption instructions. Also, always ask your doctor prior to beginning any OTC pain medications.
If your pain is not well-managed with these types of medications, talk to your doctor about possibly taking prescription medications for additional relief.

, If you are about to lift anything, consider the weight you are going to lift. Don’t lift any heavy things that could strain your back or cause more irritation and pain.


If you need to lift something heavy, use proper form: bend your knees as if you are sitting down into a chair, and using your hips, let your leg muscles lift instead of your back muscles.Don’t pull heavy things or boxes across the floor; instead, push them slowly.
Alert your work or family members of your pain. Ask for ""light duty"" or help if you need to lift heavy objects on a regular basis.

, Maintain correct posture while standing, sitting, or even sleeping. This can help ensure that you're not aggravating your condition by posture.


When standing, keep your shoulders pulled back, yet relaxed. Lift your head up tall as if there is a string attached to the middle of your head and is pulling you upwards. Pull in you stomach slightly and put equal weight on both feet.Sit with your back straight and use a pillow to support your lower back, with your feet stable on the floor. Like standing, keep shoulders pulled back and relaxed.
When sleeping, make sure that your bed mattress is firm and distributes your body weight evenly, while supporting your back in a straight position.

, Many times, sciatica pain is not well managed with at-home exercises or OTC pain medications. Try meeting with a physical therapist for a more intensive therapy program.


A physical therapist is a health professional that can assist in you in managing your sciatica pain by helping you stretch and strengthen the proper muscles.Ask your primary care doctor or look online for a local physical therapist. Many specialize in different types of injury and pain management. Sciatica is fairly common and is usually familiar to most therapists.

See a doctor.,
Expect physical examination.,
Try a physical therapist.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Headaches1," Before you attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat, you should consult a doctor or dentist, especially if the pain and/or tenderness in your jaw is persistent or if you cannot open or close your jaw completely. A medical professional can rule out potentially serious medical issues, such as an infection or nerve-related problems.
, If you commonly experience headaches connected to certain symptoms, then you are probably suffering from a TMJ-related headache. For instance, you may hear popping or clicking sounds when you open or close your mouth. You may also have pain in your face. Your jaw may be stiff, and consequently, you may have trouble opening or closing your mouth. It can also affect how you bite down and your hearing.Because TMJ headaches are related to TMJ disorders, you may be able to treat the headaches by treating the original disorder.

, You can start by visiting either your family doctor or your dentist. Both should be trained to recognize the initial symptoms of TMJ. If your case is more extreme, you may need to see a specialist, but your doctor or dentist will make this recommendation., Your doctor or dentist will examine your jaw and what range it has. She will also lightly press to find out where you have pain points. In addition, you may need an MRI, X-rays, or a CT scan to pinpoint certain issues., If you clench and grind your teeth at night due to stress, fear, or lack of control, then physical therapy may help you learn to relax. Your doctor or dentist can recommend a physical therapist for you."

Take pain relievers.,
Ask about muscle relaxants to relax your jaw muscles.,
Consider tricyclic antidepressants.,
Consider a botox injection to stop your jaw's movement.,
Take corticosteroids to reduce severe inflammation.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Headaches2," You can get over-the-counter pain relieving medications for headaches from your local drugstore. These medicines help to control pain and inflammation and relieve your headaches.You can take NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium to help relieve pain and inflammation, while acetaminophen will work on just pain.However, never give aspirin to a child under the age of 14 due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome, which is a potentially life threatening condition.
If your pain is more severe, your doctor may prescribe you a medication. Always follow the instructions on the package carefully.

, Muscle relaxants are prescription medications that can relieve tension in your muscles and reduce pain. Because they relieve the symptoms of TMJ, they can lessen the headache pain.Generally, you take these by mouth for up to a couple of weeks, though you may need them for less than a week.Your doctor may also offer an injection, such as botulinum toxin or a steroid, that she will administer at the office.Because muscle relaxants can make you very drowsy and you should avoid driving or operating equipment when taking them, they may not be a good fit for everyone. You may wish to take them only at bedtime to avoid feeling sedated throughout the day.

, While these drugs are typically used to provide relief from depression, they can also help with pain.Usually, these drugs are prescribed in small doses for pain relief.An example of this medication is amitripytline (Elavil)., This treatment is also relatively rare, because many doctors debate how much it helps. The idea is to help relax jaw muscles, which in turn can help with your headaches., Corticosteroids mimic your body's natural adrenal production, causing a reduction in inflammation and pain due to TMJ problems. However, this treatment is rarely used with TMD; you'll likely only see a doctor prescribe it if you have severe inflammation."

Manage your jaw.,
Practice stretching and relaxing your jaw.,
Manage stress to reduce facial tension.,
Exercise regularly.,
Use heat and cold.,
Get splints or bite guards to protect your jaw.,
Eat soft foods to take pressure off your jaw.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Headaches3," Certain movements will worsen your TMD symptoms. For instance, yawning can worsen symptoms. If you can avoid these movements, you lessen the possibility of triggering other types of pain. You should also try to avoid singing or chewing gum., Your doctor, dentist, or physical therapist can teach you techniques to help relax your jaw. For instance, you'll learn how to gently massage the muscles. When you have headaches, working on your jaw may lessen the headaches.Gently opening and closing your mouth helps to stretch out the jaw muscles and strengthen the inflamed muscles. Open your mouth until you feel comfortable, and wait for about 5 seconds, then slowly close your mouth again. Your eyes should be looking up, although your head should be facing squarely forward., Stress increases the tension in your facial muscles and can contribute to TMJ headaches.It can also cause you to grind your teeth, worsening TMJ, which in turn can make your headaches worse.


Yoga helps you to stretch the neck and body muscles and relax, reducing the muscle pain in your neck, face, and back. It can also help reduce stress. Try taking a yoga class at a local gym to help with stress.
Try simple breathing exercises. When you feel stressed, take a moment to focus on your breathing. Close your eyes. Breathe in deeply, counting to four. Breathe out deeply, counting to four. Keep breathing, letting your worries flow out with the air you're breathing out, until you feel more relaxed.

, Doing the exercise of your choice several times a week can help with the pain. Mainly, it helps you deal with pain better.You can try anything from swimming to walking to working out at the gym.

, When your jaw is acting up, try using either a warm compress or an ice pack on your jaw. Both of these can ease muscle pain, which can help relieve headaches.For heat, try pouring warm water over a washcloth and pressing it to your face. For cold, wrap an ice pack in a towel before holding it to your face. Don't use either for longer than 20 minutes.

, When you clench or grind your teeth for a long time, it causes jaw dislocation and teeth misalignment, which should be treated with splints and bite guards. A poor or misaligned bite increases TMJ headaches and other muscle pain around the TMJ.Splints are made of hard plastic and cover your upper/lower teeth, protecting your teeth when you grind and clench your jaws. You can wear them throughout the day, removing them when you eat. However, if a splint increases pain, avoid using it, and call your doctor.Night guards are similar to splints and are used during the nighttime to prevent teeth grinding. Using these devices will even out the pressure put on your TMJ and help to reduce headaches.

, When your TMD is particularly severe, eating hard foods can make it worse. As symptoms worsen, it can lead to headaches. Therefore, when you are having heavy symptoms, stick to soft foods.Try foods that are easy to chew, such as heavily boiled vegetables, bananas, soups, eggs, mashed potatoes, smoothies, and ice creams. Be sure to cut them into small bites."

Try using a burdock poultice.,
Try peppermint or eucalyptus oil.,
Drink marjoram tea.,
Find a certified acupuncturist.",How to Treat Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Headaches4," Burdock is anecdotally reported to help some people with muscle tension, as well as headaches, and some people use it to treat TMD.To make a poultice, start with powdered burdock, available at some health stores. Make a thick paste by adding water. Apply it near the back of the jaw (on the outside) or where you are feeling pain.


You can also make a wrap. Get a sheet of kitchen towel and put the paste on it. Fold the kitchen towel lengthwise so that it will only cover from your forehead to your temple. Make sure that the paste is in contact with those areas. Wrap the towel around your head, and let it stay there for about 5 hours.
There is no medical evidence to suggest that burdock is effective for treating any medical condition., Pick high quality essential oils. Apply a couple of drops to your temples. Some people have had luck with this process relieving headache pain.One study suggested that these oils, in combination with ethanol alcohol, can relax muscles, although it did not find much influence on pain.To apply peppermint or eucalyptus oil, use a tincture of 10% essential oil to 90% ethanol alcohol. Rub the mixture lightly on your forehead., People claim it has anti-inflammatory properties that can help with headaches. To prepare, boil a cup of water and teaspoon of dried marjoram to a pan. Let it simmer for 15 minutes before straining the tea out. You can add honey to sweeten it, if you prefer. Drink the tea to provide relief., Acupuncturist have been known to help some people with this condition.Acupuncturists use small needles inserted into parts of your body to help with certain disorders. The procedure generally is not painful because the needles are so small.When looking for an acupuncturist, make sure she's certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine."

You can increase levels of iodine in your body by including these rich sources in your diet:


Yogurt
Meat and seafood
Eggs
Radishes
Bananas
Parsley
Potatoes
Oatmeal
Iodized table salt (2300mg of salt is the daily recommendation)Some iodine supplements can be prescribed to add extra iodine to your diet plan; these most often come in the form of potassium or sodium iodide.

;
, Bladder wrack is a type of seaweed that contains high levels of natural iodine, which, as just discussed, is known to stimulate the thyroid gland.It contains substances that help in restoring the normal functioning of the thyroid gland as well as in reducing the size of thyroid goiters. Soft capsules in doses of 200 to 600 milligrams daily can be taken orally to treat hypothyroidism.


Bladder wrack is thought to play a role in stimulating an increased production of thyroid hormones that can prevent the development of thyroid diseases. Talk to your doctor about what kind of supplements would be safe and appropriate for you.

, Iodine is found in many herbs, nuts, and other foodstuffs that are not a part of the normal Western diet. Here are some lesser known sources of iodine that may alleviate the symptoms of hypothyroidism:



Black walnut. Black walnut is a good source of organic iodine which helps in strengthening and nourishing the thyroid gland. It is also rich in magnesium, which helps the thyroid function normally.

Nettle. Nettle is another iodine-rich herb which can be used to treat hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency. Nettle also has anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy and diuretic properties which can relieve some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism such as swelling and water retention.The best way to use nettle is to make an herbal tea with one tablespoon of the herb, steeped for 10 minutes, and consumed two to three times a day.

Irish moss (Chondrus crispus). Irish moss is a type of red algae that’s especially rich in iodine and other vitamins. The unique combination of iodine and antioxidants in Irish moss can make it very effective in treating mild forms of hypothyroidism. To use as an infusion take 1-1 ½ teaspoons in 1 cup of boiling water and drink 3 times a day. To use a tincture formulation, take 1-2 ml, 3 times a day.

, Flaxseeds are rich in essential fatty acids, and are especially rich in omega 3 fatty acids – the ones needed for smooth functioning of the thyroid gland. You can find ground flaxseed available in most grocery stores or obtain it whole and grind it yourself.


Omega 3 fatty acids play a very important role in regulating inflammation, which is very important in similar autoimmune conditions such as Graves’ Disease and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis., Ginger has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and also is a good source of zinc, magnesium, and potassium, all of which can help in improving functioning of the thyroid.Here's how to make ginger part of your diet:


Ginger can be eaten fresh. Ginger root slices can be added to soups and other dishes for a zesty flavor addition.
Make an herbal tea by adding some fresh ginger slices to a cup of boiling water, steep it for few minutes and then add some honey to it. Drink this herbal tea 3-4 times a day.
Dried ginger can also be eaten directly, just make sure it's not dried and then covered in sugar.

, Coconut oil is a saturated fat made up of medium chain fatty acids. These medium-chain fatty acids are known to increase metabolism and promote weight loss.Coconut oil can also raise basal body temperatures while increasing metabolism. In other words, it can counteract many of the negative effects of hypothyroidism. Add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil to your milk and have it in the morning along with your breakfast.


One of the reasons the long-chain fatty acids in vegetable oils are so damaging to the thyroid is that they oxidize quickly and become rancid. They then get deposited in cells more often as rancid and oxidized, impairing the conversion of thyroid hormone T4 to T3, which is symptomatic of hypothyroidism.Coconut oil does not require the enzyme stress that vegetable oils do and does not prevent T4 to T3 hormone conversion. This is not only because it is a stable oil, but also because it is processed differently in the body and does not need to be broken down by enzyme dependent processes as do long-chain fatty acids.

, Siberian ginseng, or eleuthero, is immune modulating; this means it can benefit those with autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Graves’ Disease and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis.Take a dose of 100 to 200 mg of Siberian ginseng extract twice daily, before breakfast and before lunch, or as your doctor recommends.


Siberian ginseng regulates the hormone levels by assisting in functioning of the adrenal and thymus glands, which can be of great help when suffering from hypothyroidism. This herb will also help to alleviate one of the most common symptoms of hypothyroidism, fatigue.

, Evening primrose oil contains essential fatty acids like gamma linolenic acid which can help fight inflammation. This fatty acid also is believed to help normalize thyroid function and stimulate thyroid hormone production. At the same, it can also remove the problems associated with hypothyroidism such as hair loss and heavy menstrual flow.Primrose oil can be found in most pharmacies and vitamin or supplement stores. Even though it is so widely available, it's still wise to talk to your doctor about what supplements – primrose oil included – are right for you.

, Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb popular in Ayurvedic medicine that has shown strong results for lowering cortisol and balancing thyroid hormones.It helps in the secretion of thyroid hormones and hence helps in the treatment of hypothyroidism. Take 200-1200 milligrams per day in a capsule or tea form to reap its benefits.


Aside from hormonal balance, ashwagandha is thought to help the body fight stress by improving the immune system and acting as an anti-inflammatory.

, This plant resin is thought to help in improving thyroid functions, increase fat-burning activity of the body, and thus spur on weight loss.It also increases thermogenesis, i.e. heat production in the body, which boosts your metabolism. A typical dosage of guggulsterone is 25mg three times a day, though you should consult your doctor for a professional opinion.


Kanchanara guggul (Commiphora mukul) is a resin derived from the medicinal plant Commiphora mukul. The active ingredient of the extract is a steroid known as guggulsterone.

, To allow your thyroid gland to function properly, it is important to expose your body for fifteen to twenty minutes of sunshine daily. This will help to maintain the vitamin D level of your body which plays a key role in maintaining healthy immune function and calcium metabolism.Get your sunshine in the morning. Go outside for a walk or jog, get in your exercise, and kill two birds with one stone. The added vitamin D and physical exercise will keep your metabolism up and running for the rest of the day.

, In addition to staving off constipation, a very common ailment associated with hypothyroidism, fiber also makes you feel full quickly which will aid in weight loss. Beans, oatmeal and wheat grains are all very rich sources of fiber, in addition to supplements that are available over the counter.


Vitamin B and iron help regulate your digestive system, too, by converting carbohydrates to sugar and transporting amino acids to your hair and skin. These nutrients are found in vegetables, shellfish, crabs, red meat, whole grains and eggs.

, Cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, turnips, sprouts, Brussels, bok choy, and kale can block the thyroid’s ability to absorb iodine, which is essential for normal functioning of the thyroid gland. However, this doesn't mean to cut out vegetables entirely. It's still important to have a healthy, balanced diet – just with the right vegetables.


Instead, include foods like avocado, beet, celery, carrots, bell peppers, cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkin, zucchini in your diet. Herbs like garlic, ginger, cilantro, chilies, peppermint, and parsley are also good.
Increase your intake of vegetables and fruits that are alkaline in nature, as they contain buffering agents that tend to neutralize your body’s acidity due to the low metabolism rate. Good examples are apples, bananas, and pineapples.

, Selenium is a very important mineral to be added in your diet as it’s needed for the conversion of the T4 hormone into the more active type T3. What's more, it's thought to have anti inflammatory effects, too, which can lessen the symptoms of hypothyroidism.


Selenium is found in nuts, salmon, tuna, lean meat, and whole grains which contain magnesium. Selenium tablets are available at most pharmacies and can also be prescribed by your doctor.

, This ancient Chinese medicine can be used to help restore the normal release of thyroid gland hormones. In addition, it may be able to relieve other symptoms such as stress, insomnia, depression and headache. This is done by identifying certain points in the body to be stimulated, activating those pressure points, and spurring them to normal function.


Some believe the spleen is a particularly potent pressure point as it’s partly responsible for changing the intake of food to nutrients for the body.

, Instead of eating two or three large meals, divide your food into five or six small meals to help your body increase and stimulate your metabolic rate. This will help you lose weight faster, especially in combination with the right diet and exercise.


It's especially difficult to control portion sizes when you're out to eat. To combat the urge to finish your likely oversized plate, box up half even before you're done eating. This will help your waistline, your wallet, and make the fight against hypothyroidism a bit easier.

, Foods containing saturated fats, fried food, and red meat containing visible fat traces can suppress the thyroid gland and prevent it from releasing thyroid hormones. In addition to their ability to destroy your cells and prevent them from producing any sort of energy, fats have a negative effect on the immune system, allowing for infection recurrences.Substitute harmful fats with healthy fats such as olive oil, coconut oil, and omega 3 fatty acids which are found in seafood, flaxseeds, and walnuts.

, It's believed that soy can weaken your thyroid gland strength and reduce its ability to produce hormones or even just to function probably, leading to weight gain. Gluten resembles thyroid tissues components, so it’s advised to avoid it as the body can still release antibodies targeting glutens by mistake.


Luckily, gluten-free and soy products are becoming more and more prevalent – just be sure to read your labels before purchase. Organic grocery stores will offer a wider selection to boot.

, Yoga can be very effective in treating hypothyroidism, amongst a number of other ailments. There are various asanas (or poses) that help in treating and improving hypothyroidism:


Sarvangasana (the shoulder stand pose) is considered to be one of the most effective yoga poses for hypothyroidism. This asana is one of the inverted poses that reverse the effects of gravity by allowing the flow of blood from the feet and legs to the neck where the thyroid gland is located. This will help stimulate and nourish the thyroid gland, which can bring about weight loss and increase the metabolic rate of the body.
Other effective yoga poses for hypothyroidism are Matsyasana (the fish pose) and Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (the bridge pose). Deep breathing exercises, or pranayama, are good, too. Consider Anulom Vilom (Alternate Nostril Breathing), and Ujjayi (Ocean Breaths) to supplement your yoga practice.

, Often with hypothyroidism comes frustrating weight issues. Instead of restricting your calorie intake to unhealthy levels, consider upping your level of exercise, though not necessarily your time spent exercising. Here are two types of time-efficient exercise you can consider:



Interval training. Interval training, or burst training, can burn up the same amount of calories as cardio training but in less time. You do short bursts (about a minute) of high intensity exercises and then rest for short periods in between. This causes you to burn carbohydrates while training and then burn fat while resting. It requires less time and therefore doesn’t put you at as much risk for bone or ankle stress.

Aerobics. To increase your metabolic rate, burn up fat, and stimulate your thyroid gland to return to normal, perform some simple aerobic exercises such as walking, jogging, riding bikes or even jumping a rope. This can help with weight, too, especially if done for about 30 minutes four or five times per week.

You'll probably need to take antibiotics for two weeks.Be sure to take the full course of treatment so the bacteria doesn't return. Even if your symptoms resolve, this doesn't mean you can stop the medication. Make sure you take every single dose of antibiotics as instructed by your doctor.;
, You'll most likely need to take proton pump inhibitors which block stomach acid. Prescription or over-the-counter medications may include: omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole.Proton pump inhibitors do have some long-term side effects which include an increased risk of pneumonia, osteoporosis, and intestinal infections.

, Your doctor may also prescribe antacids to protect and heal your stomach lining.These can prevent stomach acid buildup and relieve pain from gastric ulcers. You may experience constipation or diarrhea as side effect.


Antacids treat the symptoms of gastric ulcer, but you'll need to take other medications to treat the cause of your gastric ulcer.

, Regularly taking NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) is one of the main causes of gastric ulcers. If you often use aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or ketoprofen, consider changing pain medications.Ask your doctor about using acetaminophen for pain relief since it's not associated with ulcers. Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions and don't take more than 3000 to 4000 mg a day.


Try not to take pain medications on an empty stomach. This can be hard on your stomach. Instead, take pain medications with a meal or snack.

, Smoking can contribute to ulcers by wearing down the protective lining of the stomach. It also increases stomach acid which can cause upset stomach (dyspepsia) and pain.The good news is that stopping smoking will have an immediate effect on these symptoms.Ask your doctor to recommend smoking cessation programs. You might join a support group or take medication to help you cut back on smoking., You should feel relief within two to four weeks after starting treatment, although it may take longer if you smoke. If you're not feeling better after four weeks, talk with your doctor. You may have an underlying condition or a refractory ulcer.


Be aware that many medications will need to be taken long-term. This is why it's important to watch for side effects and talk with your doctor if you have concerns., Although symptoms of stomach ulcers can vary from person to person, pain is a common symptom. You may have pain in the area just below your rib cage near the center of your chest. In fact, you might notice pain anywhere from your belly button up towards your breastbone.Don't be surprised if the pain comes and goes. It might be worse at night, if you're hungry, or it may go away and return weeks later.

, In addition to pain, you may experience nausea, vomiting, or bloating. These can be caused by damaged stomach walls where the ulcer has formed. Then, when your stomach secretes acid it needs to digest food, the acid irritates and damages the ulcer even more.


In severe cases, you may vomit blood or notice blood in your stools., You should be able to spot ""red flags"" or warning signs of an ulcer.If you have any of these symptoms along with stomach pain, call your physician or 911 right away:


Fever
Severe pain
Diarrhea that lasts longer than two to three days
Persistent constipation (longer than two to three days)
Blood in the stools (which can appear red, black, or tarry)
Persistent nausea or vomiting
Vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds
Severe tenderness of the belly
Jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes)
Swelling or visible bloating of the abdomen

, Your doctor will probably want an EGD (EsophagoGastroDuodenoscopy). During this procedure, a small camera on a flexible tube is inserted into your stomach. This way, doctors can visualize the ulcers on your stomach and determine if any are bleeding.X-rays of the upper gastrointestinal tract can also diagnose gastric ulcers, although these aren't as widely used since they can miss small ulcers.
After your initial treatment, your doctor may wish to perform an endoscopy, a procedure during which your doctor will use a tube with a tiny camera and light to examine your digestive tract. This way your doctor can ensure that the ulcer responded to treatment and was not actually a symptom of stomach cancer., Since your stomach is already under great stress, avoid putting extra physical pressure on your stomach. You can wear clothing that doesn't constrict your stomach or abdomen. And, you might get relief by eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of a few large meals.This reduces the amount of acid in your stomach and keeps the pressure off your stomach.


Try not to eat within two to three hours before going to bed. This will keep food from putting pressure on your stomach while you sleep.

, There a number of herbal approaches you can try to treat ulcer pain.Talk to your physician before trying herbal or home remedies. In general, they're all very safe, but you should make sure that none of the herbs will interact with any medications you're taking.


Since some remedies haven't been tested for use by pregnant women, it's important to talk with your doctor about using them if you're pregnant or nursing.

, Research shows that aloe vera can help heal gastric ulcers.Aloe juice decreases inflammation and acts to neutralize the stomach acid, reducing pain. To use it, drink 1/2 cup of organic aloe vera juice. You can sip this throughout the day. But, since aloe vera can act as a laxative, limit your drinking to a total of 1 to 2 cups a day.


Make sure to buy aloe vera juice that contains a high level of aloe vera juice. Avoid juices that contain a lot of added sugars or fruit juices.

, Ginger and chamomile make great anti-inflammatory teas which can soothe an irritated stomach and reduce nausea and vomiting. Fennel helps settle the stomach and decreases the acid levels.Mustard also acts as an anti-inflammatory and as an acid neutralizer. To prepare:


Ginger tea: steep packaged tea bags. Or, cut up 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger and steep it in boiled water for 5 minutes. Drink ginger tea throughout the day, especially 20 to 30 minutes before meals.
Fennel tea: crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and steep them in a cup of boiled water for five minutes. Add honey to taste and drink 2 to 3 cups a day about 20 minutes before meals.
Mustard tea: dissolve powdered or good prepared mustard in hot water. Or, you can take 1 teaspoon of mustard by mouth.
Chamomile tea: steep packaged tea bags. You can also steep 3 to 4 tablespoons (44.4 to 59.1 ml) of chamomile in 1 cup of boiled water for five minutes.

, Licorice root (deglycyrrhizinated licorice root) is commonly used to treat peptic ulcers, canker sores, and reflux. Take the licorice root (which comes in chewable tablets) according to the manufacturer's instructions. You'll probably need to take two to three tablets every four to six hours. The taste might take some time to get used to, but licorice root can heal your stomach, control hyperacidity and relieve pain.You can also take slippery elm as a chewable tablet or drink (3 to 4 ounces). Slippery elm coats and soothes irritated tissues. It's also safe to use during pregnancy."

This dilates the blood vessels and improves local tissue perfusion for the delivery of nutrients necessary for repair. The increased blood flow also washes out any inflammatory exudates and waste products from local swelling.


Furthermore, the warm sensation diminishes the pain by acting as a counter irritant that masks the pain brought about by the inflammation.
Sebaceous cysts may be left alone if not causing the patient distress; most are non-dangerous and are only bothersome aesthetically. However, if it's infected, seeking medical treatment is wise.;
, Be sure to routinely and thoroughly wash the skin with non-irritating antimicrobial soap in running water. Pat dry the skin using a clean cloth or towel and cover with a sterile gauze – keep the gauze dry at all times.


Over the counter antiseptics (e.g. povidone-iodine) may also be applied but are not required. Repeat this once a day and every time the gauze dressing becomes wet and/or soiled until the skin forms a healing crust.
Avoid putting cosmetics and skin care products on the site of the cyst. This may cause further irritation and infection.

, This type of cyst dries up naturally; trying to pop it would put you at risk for further infection and may cause permanent scarring. Resist the temptation -- if it bothers you, get it removed by a doctor.


If a cyst burst due to healing or accidental popping causing a break in the skin; wash the area thoroughly in running water using a non-irritating antimicrobial soap.

, If signs of infection occur -- pain, swelling, redness, and warmth sensation -- notify your doctor immediately for appropriate medical intervention. It's a very routine procedure and nothing to worry about; however, if left alone, you can become septic, which is a very, very serious condition.Even if your cyst doesn't seem infected, you may wish to visit a doctor. A very simple incision will be made and the cyst can be gone in a matter of minutes. You'll end up wondering why you waited so long!

, Oil made out of tea tree is a great anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory remedy. It can kill the bacteria causing infection. However, know that there is little hard science to back up the relation between tea tree oil and cysts.


To use the remedy, simply apply one or two drops of tea tree oil on the lesion and cover it with a band aid. Use tea tree oil once a day, in the morning, and uncover the lesion at night.

, Castor oil contains ricin, a chemical very effective against bacteria. Soak a piece of cloth in castor oil and place it on the cyst. Place a hot compress on top of the castor oil soaked cloth and hold it for 30 minutes. The heat will help the oil diffuse into the skin a lot easier. The ricin will destroy the bacteria causing the infection.


Again, the science is lacking. It may fight bacteria potentially, but its efficacy on cysts is dubious. It likely will not be harmful, but it may also not be effective.

, Aloe contains phenolic compounds which have antibiotic properties. Apply aloe vera gel directly on the lesion and gently rub it until it penetrates the skin. Repeat the process each day, until the infection is cured.


Aloe vera is a treatment that has been used for centuries. It is one of mother nature's greatest curing agents. However, once more, there's no science to show that it is an end-all, be-all cure for cysts.

, Witch hazel contains tannins, which will remove the extra oils covering the skin and will increase blood flow. The extra blood flooding the area will help heal the infection faster, as more antibodies will be transported at the affected site.


Apply a small amount of witch hazel gel (a pea sized drop) directly on the lesion and gently rub it in. Repeat the procedure each day for about a week.
Again, the science in this department is lacking and only applicable in theory.

, The main compound found in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. It has antiseptic properties, killing infection causing bacteria. This, however, is very general and does not specially apply to cysts. In other words, do not rely on this remedy alone.


Apply vinegar on the affected area and cover it with a bandage. Remove he bandage after 3 or 4 days. You will notice that a hard layer is formed on top of the lesion.
When the crust is removed, pus will ooze out along with the bacteria. Clean the area and apply a new bandage, without vinegar. After 2 or 3 days, the cyst should be healed.

, Boil a bag of dandelion dried herb in four cups of water. Simmer for 45 minutes after boiling and drink the tea 3 or 4 times per day. Continue to use the treatment for about a week.


Dandelion is an herb containing taraxacin, a natural antibiotic. However, the science stops there. Medical treatment is much more effective for cyst removal than any herbal remedy.

, An effective antibiotic to fight the infection will be prescribed as soon as possible. Be sure to finish your course so the infection doesn't weaken and then return. In as little as a week your cyst will be disappearing.


Flucloxacillin is one of the most common antibiotics used in the case of an infected sebaceous cyst. Take a 500 milligram pill every 8 hours, for a week, in order to cure the infection.

, Surgical intervention is a simple operation in which the cyst is completely removed. Don't worry -- the area around the lesion is numbed with a local anesthetic. Here's what you need to know:


After the anesthesia is performed, the surgeon will either perform an oval incision on both sides of the lesion’s center, or a single incision down its center. If the cyst is small, the doctor can lance it, instead of cutting it.
The keratin around the cyst will be squeezed out. A retractor will be used to hold the edges of the incision apart while the doctor will use a forceps to remove the cyst.
If the lesion is whole when removed, the operation is a success and the cure rate will be of 100 percent.
If, however, the lesion is fragmented, curettage will be performed and the remaining tissues will be cauterized. The wound will be sealed by stitching after the procedure is complete.In the case where the cyst was infected, the same antibiotic treatment will be prescribed for a week after the intervention.

, All the recommendations in the first section hold true after surgery, too. The most important thing is to keep the area clean and not to fuss with it. As long as you take care of it, there will be zero complications.


Identify if sutures were used in wound closure. If so, it is also important to take note when would they need to be removed (1– 2 weeks at most). Note: some type of sutures readily dissolves in the body and may not need removal.

, You can use either of the following:


Guava leaves. Put whole guava leaves in a clay pot full of boiling water for 15 minutes. Let it cool until a tolerable temperature is achieved – lukewarm temperature is ideal. Use the solution to wash the wound.
Aloe vera. After thorough washing and patting dry, generously apply the sap of the plant to the break in the skin and leave it to dry. You can do this several times a day if you'd like.
As a precaution, you should always test a small amount of any of these homemade treatments for any allergic reaction. A good site to test this is in the forearms on the same side as your palms – its fair complexion and relatively thin skin makes it easier to feel and notice any itching and redness.

, The skin surface is made out of keratin, a thin layer of cells which protects the skin. The keratin layer is continuously shed and replaced with a new batch of cells. Instead of a normal exfoliation, the cells can move deeper into the skin and continue to proliferate. Keratin will be secreted towards the inside of your body, creating a cyst.


This is, in itself, not harmful or dangerous -- it's simply not aesthetically pleasing. It's only if a tumor or infection develops that this abnormal proliferation is something to worry about.

, Sounds pretty harmless, huh? Even just a hair follicle can create a sebaceous cyst. If you were worried you were suffering from some serious health problem, know that it can really just be because of a hair.


When this is the cause, a small pocket of modified skin found in the dermis, which is the second layer of the skin, is referred to as a hair follicle. Each hair grows from one of these pockets. Follicles damaged by a constant irritating factor or surgical wound will suffer damage and scarring, leading to blockage.

, During the developing process of the fetus, stem cells which are initially assigned to skin, nail, or hair formation can end up being trapped inside other cells. They will continue to form keratin inside those cells, which in time will lead to cysts.


If you have recurring cysts, talk to your doctor about your options. They're more pesky than worrisome, for the record.

, If a cyst is ruptured, bacteria can contaminate it, leading to infection. The cyst will become painful, and will start to resemble a pimple. It will ooze pus as well as moist keratin deposits. The area around it will be red and slightly swollen. If this happens, you need to seek medical treatment.


If the infection goes untreated, it will get worse and worse and can eventually affect your entire body. While a cyst itself isn't anything to be greatly concerned about, an infected cyst does require action., Even if a cyst is not infected, it can still become inflamed. If the cyst is constantly exposed to an irritating factor, such as rubbing against a rugged fabric, it will become inflamed.


Luckily, it's usually fairly easy to reduce the inflammation, either with NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) or just to remove the irritating factor.
An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove, because the area is vulnerable to infection. If a surgical procedure is necessary, it will be postponed until the inflammation goes away.

, A ruptured cyst will trigger an immune reaction if a foreign material infiltrates your skin. This will cause a collection of pus called an abscess to form. This is more likely to happen in large cysts. A ruptured cyst is better off seen by a doctor.A ruptured cyst needs to be kept as clean and hygienic as possible. Visit your doctor for advice on how to care for the cyst and what medical treatment you should seek.

Give your child simple painkillers.,
Talk to your doctor about getting stronger painkillers for your child.,
Get a splint put on your child’s heel and leg.,
Talk to your child’s doctor about getting a cast for your child’s heel.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Treat Sever's Disease1," These sorts of painkillers can be purchase over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. In general, doctors recommend ibuprofen or paracetamol. These medications work by blocking the production of prostaglandin, which is a chemical that is responsible for the sensation of pain.


For children, the dosage of a simple painkiller is generally 10 to 15 mg per kg of body weight, taken every four to six hours.Never give a child below the age of 18 Aspirin. Aspirin can cause children to develop Reye’s syndrome, a crippling condition that could potentially lead to death.;
, If your child’s pain is not controlled by the simple painkillers listed in the previous step, set up a meeting with your child’s doctor to get a prescription for stronger painkiller. The most commonly prescribed strong painkiller for this condition are codeine and tramadol.


The child’s dosage of oral tramadol is generally 1 to 2 mg per kg of weight, taken every four to six hours. This dosage is meant for children who are 4 to 16 years of age.The dosage for codeine is generally 0.5 mg per kg of weight, taken every 4 to 6 hours., Splints help to stabilize the affected area, in this case the heel, by giving the area support. Splints generally use a hard, flat object that you press up against the heel to achieve this. This hard, flat object is then secured with elastic bandages.


Your doctor will most likely apply the splint the first time, and will teach you how to apply it to your child’s heel in the future.

, Casts are generally made from a special cement called plaster of Paris, which helps to stabilize your child’s heel and leg. A cast can be left on for months, depending on the severity of your child’s condition.


Casts are generally used to avoid further injury and to correct any bone deformities caused by the disease.

, If all non-invasive measures fail, your child can undergo surgery to correct the deformity or damage done to the structure of her feet. Before the procedure, your doctor will explain to you how the procedure will be done. Your child will be put under general anesthesia. During the procedure, the surgeon will make an incision in the damaged area, and will repair the damaged area. Your child will most likely be given a cast or compression bandage to wear in order to stabilize her foot. On the day of the surgery:


Explain to your child that the doctor will need her to go to sleep for a little while, and that the surgery will be over when she wakes up.
Be honest with your child and explain that she might feel a little bit of pain after the procedure.
Bring your child’s favorite toys or blanket to the surgeon’s office.

This includes people with disabilities that show up after the service has been completed, if the problems are known to be related to circumstances they endured during service.Disability payments are designed to compensate for medical bills and loss of working time as a result of the disability.


The amount of the payment is dependent on the severity of the disability and how many dependents the service member has.The severity of disabilities is rated in terms of a percentage, from 10% (lowest) to 100% (most severe), in ten-percent increments.
If you have a disability of 30% or more, and you have dependents, you may be entitled to an additional allowance.
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is available to the spouse, children or parents of service members who died during active service or as a result of service-related disabilities.Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) is available to veterans, spouses and surviving family members who need extra compensation to pay for assistance or home care. These payments are made in special cases, such as when someone who has lost an arm or is permanently in a wheelchair and is unable to perform daily tasks.;
, Disability compensation is only awarded in certain cases. Most importantly, your disability must be connected to your service, or you must the surviving spouse or parent of someone who died in service or as a result of his or her disability.

Be patient.",How to Treat Concussion Headaches," This not only means physical rest, but mental rest as well. Try avoiding activities that take too much extra strain on the brain, such as texting and reading.;
, Triggers, such as the original injury, are things that aggravate the brain, and therefore cause a bigger headache. Some common examples are noise, light, physical activity, mental activity, driving or concentrating. Try to find these triggers and avoid them. For example, if noise causes a bigger headache, wear earplugs or find a quiet environment.

, These can be found in health food stores.

, If these medicines are taken all the time, they cause rebound headaches that are only worse. This is because the body becomes adapted and dependent on the medicine. It will be difficult, but try to only take medicines a third of the time, such as ten days per month.

, The human brain is mostly fat and water. Aim to drink at least 2-3 large water bottles a day. Keeping fluid levels up will help regulate concussions headaches.

, The brain also has lots of glucose, and these levels need to be kept up in order to heal faster and lessen concussion headaches. Even eating a granola bar or a piece of fruit every two hours will significantly help.

, The brain needs time to recharge and will do this faster with breaks. For example, work for 20 minutes and then take a 10 minute break.

, There may be a lot of pain in the neck that is restricting blood flow to the brain. Try using a hot pack on your neck to ease the tension.

, Find massage therapists, physiotherapists, osteopaths or acupuncture.

Keep your child from participating in physical activities while she recovers.,
Protect your child’s heel as best you can.,
Use ice to compress your child’s heel.,
Elevate your child’s foot.,
Get your child orthopedic shoes.",How to Treat Sever's Disease2," As mention above, Sever’s disease is self-limiting, which means that if your child rests up, she will make a full recovery. Getting rest involves keeping your child from participating in physical activities while her body heals.


Keep your child off her feet for 24 to 72 hours, or longer if more time is prescribed by a doctor.

, Any further harm to the affected area could lead to a longer healing time. To protect your child’s heel, try to help her avoid the following:


Heat: Your child should avoid soaking her feet in warm baths, applying heat packs, or sitting in a hot environment. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate, which increases the flow of blood to the area, making the area painful and swollen.
Further movement: Any excessive movement of the affected area may cause further injury.
Massage: Putting pressure on the affected area by massaging it could also lead to further injury.

, Apply an ice compress to areas where your child feels pain for the first 24 to 72 hours after she first feels pain. The cold temperature will help the blood vessels to constrict, thereby reducing blood flow (and thus pain and inflammation) in the area.


To use apply a cold compress, wrap a bag of ice or an ice pack in a hand towel. Do not apply the ice directly to your child’s skin, as it could cause skin damage. Leave the compress on the area for 15 to 20 minutes. You can apply the ice pack every two to three hours.

, Elevating the affected heel can help to reduce swelling in the area. To elevate the heel, you can sit your child down in a chair and prop her leg up in front of her on another chair with a cushion underneath it. The goal is to elevate the heel so that it is above your child’s heart, thereby restricting blood flow to the area, which helps to reduce swelling.


If your child is lying down, place several pillows under your child’s heel so that her heel is above her heart.

, Your child’s doctor may recommend getting her orthopedic shoes or heel cups. Hell cups are soft pads that get inserted under the heel bone; they help to reduce the pressure put on the Achilles tendon.Foot orthotics also act like cushions to support your child’s sole, which takes pressure off the other parts of your child’s foot.

Understand that exercises should not be done until ‘Ok’d’ by a doctor.,
Try dorsiflexion exercises.,
Show your child how to do a plantar flexion exercise.,
Try an inversion exercise.,
Give an eversion exercise a try.",How to Treat Sever's Disease3," Once your child is feeling better and her heel is not causing her any pain, she can begin to the rehabilitation process. However, before she begins doing these exercises, you should make an appointment with either her doctor or a physiotherapist who can help to lead her through some strengthening exercises.


Some of the basic exercises are listed in the following steps. All of these exercises workout the muscle in the heel. Exercises and muscle movements promote good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area, thus speeding up the repair of the damaged tissue. Good blood circulation brings more oxygen to the affected area which is vital for repairing injured tissues., Dorsiflexion exercises are maneuvers that pull the foot towards the body. To do this exercise, you will need to get a resistance band for your child. You can also use a towel to replace the resistance band. To do the exercise, instruct your child to:


Secure a resistance band around a stable fixture and tie it in a loop.
Assume a sitting position with legs stretched as far as possible from the fixture.
Check if the band fits snugly around the top of the flexed affected foot.
Stretch the resistance band by pulling the toes towards the body.
Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds.
Return to the starting position.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times on each ankle.

, This maneuver moves the affected foot away from your child’s body. Again, you will need a resistance band or a towel to do this exercise. To do the exercise:


Grasp each end of a resistance band in both hands.
In a sitting position, maintain proper alignment of the back while the legs are extended forward.
Put the resistance band around the ball of the foot as tightly as possible.
Move the toes away from the body, making the band extend more firmly.
Maintain the position for 5 to 10 seconds before returning to the original position.
Repeat the exercise for 10 to 20 cycles on each ankle.

, This exercise focuses on turning the affected foot inward in the direction of the midline of your child’s body. To do this exercise:


Loop a resistance band around a couch or other stable object.
Sit down with legs extended forward.
Place the resistance band tightly around the top of the foot.
Move the foot inward, rotating the ankle joint towards the other leg.
Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds before returning to the normal position.
Repeat the cycle 10 to 20 times on each ankle.

, This exercise focuses on moving the affected foot away from the center of your child’s body. To do this exercise, your child will need to:


Place a resistance band around a fixed object (preferably a table leg) and tie it in a loop.
Sit with legs forward while the resistance band is tightly looped around the foot coming from the inside of the leg.
Move the foot away from the table leg causing the band to stretch tighter.
Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds then return to the original position.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times per ankle.

Identify the symptoms.,
Call emergency medical responders immediately if you are having a heart attack.,
Ask your doctor about causes of innocent heart murmurs.,
Discuss causes of abnormal heart murmurs with your doctor.,
Let the doctor listen to your heart.,
Get additional tests if your doctor recommends it.,
Take medications if your doctor prescribes them.,
Repair a damaged or leaking valve.,
Replace a faulty valve.",How to Treat an Adult Heart Murmur," If you have an innocent heart murmur, chances are you won’t have any symptoms other than the sounds the doctors hear; however, an abnormal heart murmur can be a sign of a serious underlying condition. If you have any of these symptoms you should see a doctor:A bluish tinge to your skin. This may be most likely to occur on your fingers and lips.
Swelling, especially in your legs
Unexplained weight gain
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Swollen liver
Swollen veins in your neck
Loss of appetite
Sweating
Chest pain
Dizziness
Fainting;
, If you are having a heart attack, every minute counts. Some of the symptoms of an abnormal heart murmur are similar to those of a heart attack. If you are unsure, you should err on the side of caution and call emergency medical responders. Heart attack symptoms include:Pressure, pain, or a squeezing feeling in your chest
Pain and tightness that may radiate to your neck, jaw, or back
Nausea
Abdominal discomfort
Heartburn or indigestion
Shortness of breath
Cold sweat
Tiredness
Lightheadedness or dizziness

, Innocent heart murmurs may go away over time. They may also remain throughout your life, but never cause any problems. Some causes of temporary, innocent heart murmurs include:Exercise
Extra blood volume during pregnancyFever, anemia, or hyperthyroidism. In these cases, treating the underlying condition should make the heart murmur go away., Some causes are present at birth but not discovered until later, while others may first develop in adulthood. Common causes include:Holes in the heart with abnormal blood flow between the chambers. The seriousness of this defect varies based on where it is and how much blood is flowing.
Valve problems. If the valves don’t allow enough blood to flow through or leak, it may cause a murmur.
Valve calcification. The valves may become hardened or narrowed with age. This can cause murmurs.
An infection. Infections of the linings of the heart or valves can cause murmurs.
Rheumatic fever. This is a complication of untreated or incompletely treated strep throat in which the heart valves are damaged.

, Your doctor will listen to your heart with a stethoscope and consider the following aspects of the murmur:The sound. The doctor will be interested in whether it is loud or soft and whether it has a high or low pitch.
The location of the murmur
When the murmur occurs during the heartbeat. If it occurs when blood is entering your heart or during the entire heartbeat, that is more likely to be serious.
Whether you have a genetic predisposition to heart conditions

, Several tests are available which may give your doctor more information. These include:A chest X-ray. This exam uses X-rays to create an image of your heart and nearby organs. It would show if the heart is enlarged.
An electrocardiogram (ECG). During this test the doctor puts electrodes on the outside of your body to measure the electrical signals of your heartbeat. It can measure the rate and rhythm of your heartbeats, and the strength and timing of the electrical signals that control your heartbeats.
Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves that are above our hearing range to create a picture of the heart. It can help the doctor view the size and shape of the heart and determine whether there are structural problems with the valves. It can detect areas of the heart that aren’t contracting properly or receiving enough blood flow. During this test you would lie on a table while the doctor uses an ultrasound device against the skin of your chest. It lasts about 45 minutes and does not hurt.
Stress echocardiogram. During this test you would have an echocardiogram before and after exercising. This examines how your heart works when it is under stress.
Cardiac catheterization. During this test the doctor uses a tiny catheter to measure the pressure in the chambers of your heart. The catheter would be put into a vein or artery and moved through your body until it reaches your heart. This can also determine if you have any blockage in the coronary arteries.

, The medication you are prescribed may vary depending on your particular condition and medical history. Commonly used medications include:Anticoagulants. These medications reduce blood clots. They reduce the likelihood that a blood clot will form in your heart or brain causing a heart attack or stroke. Common medications include aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and clopidogrel (Plavix).
Diuretics. These medications are used to lower blood pressure, which can reduce the heart murmur. They prevent you from retaining too much water in your body.
Angiotensis-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications lower blood pressure, and by doing so, can improve your heart murmur.
Statins. These medications lower cholesterol. High cholesterol can aggravate problems with valves.
Beta blockers. Beta blockers make your heart beat slower and reduce your blood pressure. This can lessen the murmur.

, Medications can lower the physical stress on your valves, but if you have a valve that needs to be repaired, it would have to be done through surgery. There are several ways your doctor might do this:Balloon valvuloplasty. During this procedure the doctor uses a balloon on the end of a catheter to widen valves that have become too narrow. When the balloon is located at the narrow point, the balloon is expanded. The pressure makes the valve wider.
Annuloplasty. The surgeon reinforces the area around the valve by inserting a ring. This is used to repair an abnormal opening.
Surgery on the valve itself or the supporting tissues. This can repair valves that don’t close properly.

, If it is not possible to repair the valve that you have, your doctor may suggest replacing it with an artificial valve. This can be done in several ways:Open-heart surgery. Depending on your situation, your doctor may recommend replacing a valve with either a mechanical valve or a tissue valve. Mechanical valves are long lasting, but increase your risk of blood clots. If you have a mechanical valve you would need to take blood-thinning medications for the rest of your life to reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Tissue valves use material from a pig, cow, organ donor, or your own tissue. The drawback is that tissue valves may need to be replaced as they usually don’t last as long. The advantage is that these valves don’t absolutely need long term blood thinners.
A transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This procedure doesn’t require open-heart surgery. Instead the new valve is inserted with a catheter. The catheter is inserted elsewhere in your body, such as the leg, and used to bring the valve to your heart.

Thiamine deficiency leads to cardiovascular and nervous system problems. Wet beriberi, a condition caused by thiamine deficiency can result in an enlarged heart, edema and heart failure. Because of this, it is important to include vitamin B1 foods in your diet to keep your heart healthy.Foods rich in vitamin B1 include:


Beans
Cauliflower
Asparagus
Broccoli
Tomatoes
Spinach
Cereals
Brussels sprouts
Nuts
Lentils
Lean meat;
, Potassium plays a role in keeping your heart healthy. Potassium helps to regulate your heartbeat and helps with the contraction of your heart muscle. If you have high blood pressure, a condition that can lead to an enlarged heart, your should increase your potassium intake.Foods rich in potassium include:


Tomatoes
Potatoes
Bananas
Dried fruits
Spinach

, Edema, one of the major causes of heart enlargement, may occur because of excess amounts of sodium in your blood. Excess sodium can cause breathing problems and can cause your heart to work harder. Try to eat homemade foods, as it is easier to keep track of the amount of sodium you eat at home than at restaurants. Some low-sodium foods include:


Milk
Corn
Fresh meat
Eggs
Cream cheese
Dried fruits

, Your blood cholesterol level can go up when you eat a lot of fat. Moreover, excess fat is one of the major reasons for obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, all of which play a role in the enlarging of your heart. Limit your fat consumption to 5 to 8 teaspoons daily. Fatty foods to avoid include:


All fried foods, particularly deep fried foods
Fast foods
Packaged foods
Lard and butter

, Turmeric contains curcumin, which can help prevent heart failure. It also decreases your cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing your good cholesterol levels. Turmeric has yet another secret weapon to fight heart enlargement: polyphenol. Polyphenol can help to prevent and treat an enlarged heart.Take 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and crush it. Add ½ teaspoon of turmeric powder to the crushed black pepper and mix well. You can take this mixture three times a day.
You can also add a pinch of turmeric to each of your meals.

, Allicin, which is found in garlic, can help to lower blood pressure. When your blood flow runs more smoothly, you have a higher chance of reducing your heart to its normal size. Allicin also helps to prevent the production of bad cholesterol and aids in producing good cholesterol, which helps to improve heart health.Eat two raw garlic cloves a day. Include garlic regularly in your food as well.
If you don’t like raw garlic, you can take garlic supplements.

, Green tea is rich in antioxidants, which help to increase good cholesterol, prevent oxidation of bad cholesterol and aid in improving the function of arteries. Thus green tea can help to fight heart conditions.Add ¼ teaspoon of green leaves to a cup of boiling water. Switch off the stove and allow the tea to sit for 3 minutes before you filter and drink. Drink up to three cups of green tea a day.

, Asparagus is a rich source of vitamins and minerals. This natural diuretic contains neither fat nor cholesterol. It also does not contain sodium, which can lead to edema, one of the major causes of heart enlargement. It works well to strengthen heart muscles. Asparagus contains glutathione, which improves your defense system and helps to lower high blood pressure thereby aiding in the treatment of heart enlargement.You can eat asparagus or drink asparagus juice. To help the flavor of the juice, you can mix in some honey.

, Cayenne pepper is a rich source of vitamin C, which is essential for collagen synthesis. Collagen, which is a structural protein, helps to maintain the integrity of internal organs, blood vessels, skin and bones. Cayenne peppers also contain selenium, an antioxidant that can help your heart to operate smoothly.Add ¼ teaspoon of cayenne pepper to 1 cup of water and mix well. Drink two cups a day.

Quit smoking.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Talk to your doctor about getting daily exercise.,
Lose excess weight.,
Reduce your stress levels.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart Naturally2," Chemicals present in tobacco damage your blood cells and affect the functioning of your heart and blood vessels. Such damages result in atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up in your arteries. With time, the plaque hardens, narrowing your arteries and limiting blood flow to your organs., Alcohol can increase your blood pressure, which means that drinking alcohol often can increase your risk of developing heart conditions like an enlarged heart.


If you have a hard time resisting the urge to drink, talk to your doctor about programs you can enroll in.

, Talk to your doctor before changing up your exercise regimen, given your heart condition. When you get the green light to exercise, try to exercise for a short period of time each day. Getting exercise can help your body to become stronger and more healthy.Exercising is particularly important if you are overweight, as being obese can lead to heart enlargement.

, Being obese can lead to heart enlargement. Excessive weight thickens the heart muscle in your left ventricle. This condition can lead to various heart conditions. To lose weight, you will have to develop a healthy diet and an exercise regimen.For more information on how to get fit, click here.

Understand the causes of an enlarged heart.,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of an enlarged heart.,
Realize that medical treatment and medications will be necessary if symptoms persist.",How to Treat an Enlarged Heart Naturally3," Heart enlargement can occur because of any of the following causes.High blood pressure causes your heart to work harder. To help handle this extra work, the heart muscles can become stiffer and thicker, leading to enlargement.
Previous history of heart attack makes your heart susceptible to weakness.
Family history of heart enlargement.
Cardiac conditions including defective valves will naturally result in strain being placed on your heart, leading to heart enlargement.
Anemia can result in heart enlargement as an anemic person will not have sufficient red blood cells to enable oxygen flow to the tissues.
Thyroid disorders can result in various heart conditions including enlarged heart.

, The most common symptom of an enlarged heart is exercise intolerance. You may find it hard to breathe during moderate exercises and strenuous activities. This is due to increased stiffness of the left ventricular walls and diminished oxygen circulation. Other symptoms include:


Slight chest pain and fainting attacks.
Fatigue from slight exertion.
Difficulty breathing while lying down.
Swelling in the lower extremities due to fluid and electrolyte imbalance and retention of fluids.
Palpitations (rapid, irregular heartbeats). The increased workload of the heart makes the pulse compensate by beating more than 100 beats per minute.
These signs and symptoms gradually develop in most people; some people have left ventricular dilatation for months or even years before becoming symptomatic. Others develop symptoms after recovery from a viral infection.

, If the symptoms such as breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, palpitations and dizziness still persist after your efforts at treating the condition naturally, you will need to seek professional help. Medications commonly prescribed for an enlarged heart include:


Diuretics to decrease fluid volume and edema. Spironolactone 25 to 50 mg. daily is usually prescribed.
Ace inhibitors to decrease peripheral vascular resistance. Lisinopril 20 mg tab daily is prescribed.
Digitalis to increase myocardial contractility and increasing cardiac output. Digoxin 0.25 mg. tablet daily for 1 week is usually prescribed.

Try NSAIDs to relieve pain and inflammation.,
Take uricosuric drugs to block the reabsorption of uric acid.,
Get an intravenous saline solution to decrease the concentration of uric acid in your body.,
Take furosemide to dilute your urine.,
Try xanthine oxidase inhibitors to decrease uric acid production.,
Take carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",How to Treat Hyperuricemia1," This medicine works by blocking specific body chemicals that cause inflammation.This helps to reduce pain in the joints by inhibiting the production of COX in the brain.
In turn, this reduces the intensity of your pain.
Take acetaminophen (Tylenol), at a dosage of two tablets three times daily.
The maximum dose of Tylenol is 4000mg daily and this should not be exceeded because it can damage your liver.
You can also try naproxen sodium and ibuprofen.
NSAIDs are usually prescribed for about 7 to 10 days, or until inflammation has been relieved.
If you have increased acidity in your body, you should avoid taking NSAIDs.;
, Uricosuric drugs block the reabsorption of urate, thus preventing formation of uric acid crystals in the tissues and increasing the excretion of uric acid from the body.This drug type includes Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone.
The starting dose for Probenecid is 250 mg two times a day, and can be increased to a maximum dosage of 3 grams daily.

, In severe cases, you can receive intravenous fluid that contains saline to help decrease uric acid in your body.This can be given as a continuous infusion of 2L per 24 hours.

, You can take furosemide (lasix) to dilute your urine.This drug acts by increasing the elimination of uric acid through your urine.
The usual dose is 20 mg once a day but this may be adjusted depending on your condition.

, Xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease your uric acid production by inhibiting the production of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the production of purine.This class of drugs includes Allopurinol.
A maintenance dose for adults is 200 to 300 mg per day.
The use of Allopurinol can result in fatal hypersensitivity, so take it only under the direct supervision of a medical professional.

, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease the solubility of uric acid, which allows the body to eliminate uric acid more efficiently.While taking this type of drug, you must maintain adequate hydration in order to sustain high urine output.
The dosage of this medication varies, and it is best to consult with your physician for an appropriate prescription.

Avoid purine-rich foods to reduce the concentration of uric acid in your body.,
Stay away from foods rich in fructose to reduce your ATP consumption.,
Maintain adequate hydration to dilute the uric acid in your body.,
Avoid drinking alcohol to facilitate uric acid removal.,
Eat high-fiber foods to aid uric acid absorption.,
Eat foods rich in anthocyanins.",How to Treat Hyperuricemia2," Since uric acid is produced from the metabolism of purine in the body, it is best to avoid foods that contain purine.Purine-rich foods are mackerel, anchovies, organ meats, dried beans, peas, canned goods, instant noodles, wine, and beer.

, Foods rich in fructose consume a lot of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, when metabolized.This ATP is an energy-supplying molecule that the cells in your body use.
Large consumption of ATP leads to its depletion, and results in the generation of substances such as lactic acid and uric acid.
Foods to avoid are apples, bananas, grapes, pears, agave, melons, asparagus, beans, broccoli, cabbage, onion, tomato, peanuts, raisins, figs, carbonated drinks, fruit drinks, ketchup, canned goods, chocolate, pastries, and breakfast cereals.

, Increasing your daily intake of fluid helps dilute your urine, decreasing your body's acid level and eliminating toxins from your body.Increasing your intake of water increases your urine output.
The more urine output is increased, the more uric acid will be flushed out of your body through urination.
Drink at least 10 or more glasses of water daily.

, Alcohol interferes with the removal of uric acid from the body in a variety of ways, such as:When alcohol is converted to lactic acid, it minimizes the amount of uric acid that is eliminated from the body through the kidneys. This is because the lactic acid competes with the uric acid for removal from the kidneys into the urine.
Alcohol increases your body's levels of ethanol (alcohol), increasing your body's production of uric acid.

, Dietary fiber may aid your body's absorption of uric acid in your bloodstream, allowing it to be removed by your kidneys.Include at least one high-fiber food in each major meal or snack.
Some good high-fiber foods are pineapple, oats, isabgol, cucumbers, oranges, barley, carrots, and celery.

, Anthocyanins prevents crystallization of the uric acid and uric acid deposit in your joints.


Foods rich in anthocyanins are eggplant, blueberries, cranberries, plums, black currant, grapes, pomegranates, red fleshed peaches, and cherries.
You can include at least one of these foods in each major meal or snack.

Look for signs of infection.,
Seek professional medical attention as soon as possible.,
Clean the area with an antibiotic soap.,
Discuss whether your doctor will take a sample.,
Expect your doctor to drain it.,
Ask about antibiotics.,
Understand when surgery is necessary.,
Watch for this complication with other injuries.",How to Treat a Staph Infection1," A staph infection can show redness and swelling. It can also create pus. In fact, it can look much like a spider bite. The skin may also feel warm. These symptoms will generally be near where you have a cut or sore. There may also be pus or discharge draining from the wound., Staph infections can develop into a serious infection quickly. Therefore, if you think you have one, you should call your doctor. Your doctor will likely want you to come in as soon as possible, and she will give you instructions for the immediate future.If you have signs of infection as well as a fever, it is especially important you see your doctor. Your doctor may wish to see you immediately or send you to the emergency room for treatment.

, In warm water, gently wash the area with soap. You can use a washcloth if you do so gently, but you shouldn't use that washcloth again before washing it. Don't try to pop the wound if it's a blister; that will only spread infection. If your wound needs to be drained, it should be done a by doctor.Make sure to wash your hands after cleaning the area.
When you dry the wound, use a clean towel. Don't reuse it without washing it., Generally, your doctor will want to analyze a sample of tissue or a culture. The idea is he can check what strain of the infection you have; once identified, he will know which antibiotic that particular microbe is susceptible to., If you have a bad infection that creates an abscess or boil, your doctor will likely drain the pus from wound. You shouldn't feel much, as she will try to numb the area first.Draining a wound generally involves the doctor using a scalpel to make a small incision across it. After that, she'll let fluid drain out. If the wound is large, she may pack it with gauze that will need to be removed at a later time., Most of the time with staph infection, you will need to take a round of antibiotics. One reason staph is so dangerous is because some strains are becoming resistant to certain types of antibiotics.This includes Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which must be treated with IV antibiotics.


Typically, you'd take cephalosporins, nafcillin, or sulfa drugs; however, you may need to take vancomycin instead, which is less resistant. The downside to this drug is your doctor must give it to you intravenously.A side effect of vancomycin may be the development of a severe, itch rash. It usually covers the neck, face, and upper torso.You cannot simply look at an infection and know that it is a staph or MRSA

, Sometimes, staph infections can develop around a medical device implanted in your body or a prosthetic. If that happens, you may need surgery to have the device removed., Staph infections can be a problem in a number of situations, such as when you have surgery. You can also develop a serious condition called septic arthritis when staph bacteria enter a joint, which can happen sometimes when staph is in the bloodstream.If you have septic arthritis, you'll have trouble using that joint; you'll also likely notice quite a bit of pain, as well as some swelling and redness.You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you have these symptoms."

Go to physical therapy to learn movement and exercise techniques.,
Take medications to combat osteoporosis.,
Take antibiotics to treat degenerative infections.,
Talk to your doctor about using a corset belt to support your back.,
Make an appointment for a deep tissue/Swedish massage.,
Try using electrical stimulation.,
Get corticosteroid injections to relieve pain and inflammation.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery to remove a mass that is causing your spine to degenerate.",How to Treat Degenerative Changes in the Spine1," You may be referred to a physical therapist where you will be taught the proper ways to bend and lift things. This helps regulate how your muscles contract and relax.


Physical therapists are experts in addressing musculoskeletal problems, and can teach you how to better handle your condition throughout life.;
, Osteoporosis is one of the most common conditions that affects bone composition, and can lead to spinal degeneration. Osteoporosis can be managed with certain medications. However, before starting the treatment of osteoporosis, other potential diagnosis have to be excluded (such as vitamin D deficiency, parathyroid hormone levels, etc.).


Under strict instructions given by the physician, the underlying condition can be managed and treated with medication.

, Some types of infections can cause spinal degeneration, and can be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics can eliminate the bacteria causing the infection, and allow for the proper regeneration of the spine.


Proper identification of the microorganism involved, and the instructions about the antimicrobial resistance of this microorganism, given by the antibiogram, are key steps in effectively removing the pathogenic bacteria.
Strict guidelines should be followed when the bacteria is identified, in terms of which antibiotics should be given, their dosage, and how many days they should be taken.
In case a fungus is identified as a pathogen responsible for causing the symptoms, the right anti-fungal agents should be administered by the guidelines previously mentioned above.

, You may want to try using a corset (firm belt) that helps to support the back and reduce pain. The belt is worn around the back, extending to the abdomen and it should be worn during the day when the patient is undertaking the activities of daily living. The belt acts to reduce stress on the muscles and spine.

, Sometimes, a therapeutic massage for the whole body can work wonders. Massage can relieve pressure and tension on the joints in the body. Swedish massage uses tapping and kneading strokes to soothe and relieve tension in the whole body by loosening the sore joints. Therapists use five methods in this technique including strokes, petrissage, friction, tapotement, and vibration.


Petrissage is grabbing the muscles lightly and lifting them, using friction created by the fingertips and thumbs to work deep circles into the muscles.
Tapotement is the use of beating, tapping and chopping strokes to work the muscles.
Vibration is where the fingers are flattened and pressed on a muscle and that part of the body is shaken rapidly.

, A small transcutaneous device can be used to deliver electrical pulses into your affected joint. The electricity stimulates the sensory nerves and the opioid system. The opioid system contains opioid receptors that help reduce pain through communication with the central nervous system where the pain center is located.

, Steroids are usually given in form of injection into the spaces inside the spine that separate the cartilages. These drugs work by reducing the inflammation of the joint that causes discomfort and pain.


These injections can be uncomfortable and disconcerting, so make sure you are mentally prepared for the procedure.
Injections may or may have a long-term effect on your pain, depending on the actual cause of the degeneration.

, Surgery is usually considered as the last option when other modes of treatment have failed. Surgical intervention may also be recommended where numbness is extensive, or the patient is unable to walk or properly control bowel and bladder functions.


Surgery is usually done to reduce the pressure that is exerted on the nerves and the spinal cord.
Spinal surgery is quite invasive, and the recovery time can be months long.
Some types of spinal surgery are laminectomy and discectomy. If there is irreversible degeneration of the bone, which can be the case in osteomyelitis, treatment can include removing the part of the bone (or sometimes parts of the disc between the vertebrae) that has been damaged.
Drainage and debridement, the removal of contents, like abscesses, are an effective way of dealing with spinal injuries. Debridement of necrotic tissue can help the tissue regenerate, by removing dead tissue.

Wash your hands often.,
Clean and cover cuts.,
Wear gloves if you need to play doctor.,
Shower after you exercise.,
Change tampons frequently.,
Increase the temperature.",How to Treat a Staph Infection2," Staph gathers on the skin, including under your nails. By washing your hands, you are more likely to avoid introducing it to a scratch, scrape, or scab.When you wash your hands, you should scrub for 20 to 30 seconds with soap and warm water; using a throwaway towel afterwards is best. In addition, turn off the faucet with a towel so you don't touch the germy surface after washing your hands., When you get a cut or scrape, it's important to cover it with a bandage once you clean it up. Using an antibiotic ointment is also good practice. Doing so will help keep staph infection out of the wound., If you're working on someone else's cut or wound, it's best to put on clean gloves if possible. If not, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards and try not to touch the wound itself with your bare hands. You can do things like put the antibiotic ointment on the bandage before placing it over the wound to keep from touching it., You can pick up staph infection in the gym, hot tub, or steam room, so make sure to shower after you exercise to help wash it off. Always make sure the shower area is clean, and don't share shower supplies, such as razors, towels, and soap., Toxic shock syndrome is a form of staph infection, and it is often caused by leaving a tampon in for longer than eight hours. Try to change your tampon every four to eight hours, and use the lightest tampon you can get away with. If you use a tampon that is too absorbent, it can increase your risk of a staph infection.If you're worried about toxic shock syndrome, try sticking to other methods to manage your period, such as pads., When doing your laundry, wash your linens, including your towels and sheets, in hot water. Hot water can help kill off the staph bacteria so it doesn't keep infecting you."

Identify a ganglion cyst.,
Have a doctor check the cyst.,
Get imaging tests if your doctor recommends it.,
Decide whether treatment is necessary.,
Try immobilization.,
Drain the cyst with aspiration.,
Get surgery.,
Take over-the-counter pain medication.,
Modify your shoes if the cyst is on your foot or toe.,
Do not thump or drain the cyst yourself.",How to Treat a Ganglion Cyst," They are most common in women between 20 and 40 years old, in people with osteoarthritis in the finger joints, or a history of joint or tendon injuries. You might have a ganglion cyst if you have:A lump on the tendons of your wrist or hands. These cysts may also form in the joints of the wrist, hands, feet, ankles or elsewhere.
A lump that is round or oval shaped. Most are smaller than an inch across. The size may change overtime, with it getting bigger when you use the nearby joint.
Pain. Even a cyst that is too small to see may cause discomfort, numbness, weakness, or a pins-and-needles sensation if it presses on a nerve.;
, The doctor will likely do several things to confirm that it is a ganglion cyst. There are different types of cysts that have different types of treatment and emphasis need correct diagnosis. Other skin types cysts are sebaceous cysts, lipomas, infectious abscesses, enlarged lymph nodes, tumors, etc. The doctor may:Press on the cyst to see if it is sore.
Shine a light through the cyst to see if it is solid or fluid-filled.
Aspirate fluid out of the cyst using a needle and syringe. If it is a ganglion cyst, the fluid will be clear.

, Imaging tests can detect small cysts that are not visible from outside the body and rule out other diagnoses like arthritis or cancer. The doctor may suggest:An x-ray. This test does not hurt, but it is important that you tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant.
An ultrasound. This test is painless and involves using sound waves to form an image of the inside of your body.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses magnets and radio waves to create three dimensional images of the cyst. You will lie on a table that moves into the MRI tube. It is loud, but it does not hurt. Tell your doctor ahead of time if you have claustrophobia., Up to half of ganglion cysts go away by themselves. Your doctor may suggest treating the cyst if:It presses on a nerve causing you pain.
It is so large that it reduces the movement of your joint.

, The doctor may put a brace or splint around the joint near the cyst to prevent you from moving that joint. Because the cysts often get larger when you move your joint, restricting the movement sometimes enables the cysts to shrink.If you use this approach, ask your doctor how long you can wear the brace or splint before your muscles will start to lose their strength.
If the cyst is uncomfortable, your doctor may recommend that you take a painkiller, such as Ibuprofen.

, During this procedure the doctor will use a needle to suck the fluid out of the cyst. This procedure provides quick relief, but the cyst may reoccur.The doctor may suggest injecting a steroid into the area to reduce the risk of reoccurrence, but there is no evidence that this successfully reduces reoccurrences.
This is an outpatient procedure. You will be released the same day with a Band Aid over the location where the needle went through your skin.

, This is generally a last resort after the other options were unsuccessful. The surgeon cuts out the cyst and the stalk where it connects to the joint or tendon.Though surgery is the most effective treatment, some cysts do still reform after surgery.There are two equally effective surgical procedures that are used.Open surgery — During this procedure, the surgeon makes a cut about 2 inches long over the cyst and removes it.
Arthroscopic surgery —This is a type of keyhole surgery. The doctor makes a small incision and inserts a camera and other instruments through the incision. Using the camera as a guide, the surgeon removes the cyst.
Both procedures can be done using either local or general anesthesia, depending upon the recommendation of your surgeon., If your doctor decides the cyst does not need to be operated on or if you would like to try home treatment for the cyst, you should consider taking OTC pain medication. Ibuprofen or naproxen sodium can help to dull the pain of the cyst.You may also take OTC pain medication during a period of observation, during which you will leave the cyst alone and return to the doctor’s office later for periodic observation. This is often done if the ganglion cyst does not appear to be cancerous or the result of any other serious medical issues., If the cyst is located on your foot or your toe, you should avoid wearing shoes that will squeeze or constrict the cyst. You may decide to wear open-toed shoes or flip flops so the cyst is able to heal on its own.If you must wear closed-toe shoes, you should tie the laces or straps looser than usual so the cyst does not get irritated when you walk. Avoid wearing shoes with tight zippers and made of non-breathable fabric, like leather or polyester, as this can irritate the cyst.

, There is an old remedy for ganglion cysts that consists of hitting or thumping the cyst hard with a heavy object. Avoid doing this, as it will likely only damage the tissue around the cyst.You should also never try to pop or drain the cyst yourself at home by puncturing it with a needle. This will likely only make the cyst worse and could lead to an infection.

Apply hot and cold compresses for pain relief.,
Up your intake of vitamin D and calcium.,
Take painkillers to deal with pain and inflammation while you work to treat your degenerative spine.,
Apply topical ointments to your back and neck to relieve pain.,
Manage your weight to reduce stress on the back.",How to Treat Degenerative Changes in the Spine2," Try applying warm compressions on the back to help relieve pain. Cold compressions can also be applied for pain relief. The patient can alternate warm and cold compressions every 25-20 minutes.


Hot compressions help relax the muscles.

You can dip a piece of cloth (flannel) in warm water and massage the back and neck. The procedure might be painful at first but the pain decreases with time.
Heat application can be done for half an hour three times a day.


Cold compressions help numb the area and restrict the nerves that send pain signals to the brain.

The ice pack should not be applied directly on the skin; it should be wrapped in a towel or a plastic bag.
Another alternative that can be used is a bag of frozen peas.



, Eating foods that are rich in vitamin D and calcium can help strengthen the joints and bones. Fortifying the joints and bones can help to regenerate damaged portions of the spine, and help prevent further degeneration.


The daily requirement for calcium intake is 200mg, and the foods that provide the body with calcium include dairy products, soy, and fortified wheat products.
The daily requirement for vitamin D intake is 400IU, and the foods that provide the body with vitamin D are fish, eggs, cod liver oil, and fortified milk.

, Many patients will be prescribed painkillers or recommended to try over the counter medicines. These drugs act by sending a message to the pain centre in the brain, in order to reduce the pain sensation.


These drugs include over the counter drugs like paracetamol, and prescriptions like oxycontin and Vicodin.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can also be used to relieve pain.
This includes ibuprofen, which can be taken in doses of 1-2 tablets three times per day.

, Topical ointments can also be prescribed to help relieve pain. Some of these drugs are NSAIDs and act by inhibiting the pain receptors. Topical ointments may be more effective at reducing pain in localized regions of the body.


This includes voltaren gel, which can be applied to the back and neck 2-3 times daily.

, If you are overweight, try to lose weight and aim to have an optimum Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of a patient’s relative weight, based on the height and mass of the patient. Maintaining a healthy weight will reduce stress on the back, and have a positive impact on spinal health.


The ideal BMI is between 18.5-25.

Understand that exercising other parts of your body can help to strengthen and relieve pain in your back.,
Do an exercise that strengthens the abdomen.,
Bring your knee to your chest to improve flexibility.,
Perform a hamstring stretch.",How to Treat Degenerative Changes in the Spine3," It can help to exercise daily, strengthening your muscles and increasing mobility in order to reduce pain and inflammation. Try exercises that can be done to improve your overall health including walking, swimming, water aerobics.

, Strengthening the abdominal muscles can help to stabilize your entire core and spine. Regularly taking the time to tone up the core can be a great way to relieve stress on the spine.


Lie on your back on a flat surface while keeping the pelvis and spine in a neutral position.
Bend your knees and tighten the lower abdominal muscles, by pulling your belly button closer to the spine without holding the breath.
Breathe evenly while maintaining the contraction of the abdomen and hold it for ten seconds.
This should be done in 3 sets of 10 repetitions each and can be done once daily.

, This exercise can improve the flexibility of the lower hips and spine and improve mobility. Increased mobility relieves stress on the back and can reduce pain and tension in the spine.


Start by lying on your back while bending both knees.
Bring one knee to the chest until you feel a gentle stretch on the lower hip and spine.
Hold this position for 5 seconds and then lower the leg slowly.
You can perform 10 repetitions on each leg, once daily.

, Many people with a degenerative spine have tightness of the hamstring muscles (the muscles found at the back of the thigh). This tension can increase pressure on the back and further aggravate the spine and musculature of the back.


Start by lying on your back with one leg raised.
Hold the strap that around the foot of the raised leg.
Use the strap for support and to elevate the leg until a stretch is felt at the back of the thigh and knee.
Hold this position for 30 seconds and then lower the leg slowly.
You can repeat this stretch 3 times on each leg, once daily.

Assess the severity of the injury.,
Grab your supplies.,
Get the bleeding to stop.,
Rinse the area.,
Make sure the area is dry.,
Apply an antibiotic.,
Cover the wound.,
Keep the dressing fresh and clean.,
Beware of the risk of infection.",How to Treat a Bleeding Person Quickly," If the person is losing a lot of blood, they will likely need immediate medical attention. Call the emergency services and help them while you wait. If someone has a minor scrape or wound and is only bleeding a little, you can clean and dress the injury yourself using the steps in this article.


Even smaller wounds may need stitches; if the wound seems deep, the bleeding won't stop, or you're not confident that you can get the area clean and dress it safely, see a doctor.
For more severe bleeding, see How to Treat Severe Bleeding During First Aid.;
, You'll need warm water, a soft towel or paper towel, gauze, tape (or a band-aid, depending on size of wound), and possibly tweezers. All of your supplies need to be clean and sterilized.

, Usually, small wounds will stop bleeding by themselves, but if they don't, hold a clean cloth or bandage against the wound for 20 to 30 minutes and elevate the area, if possible, until the wound stops bleeding.

, Avoid using soap, which can irritate the wound, but rinse with clear, fresh water. If there are any debris in the wound itself, carefully use sterilized tweezers to remove them; if you can't remove them without creating a bigger injury or irritating the wound, see a doctor.


Clean the area around the wound with soap and a clean cloth. Dab/wipe the area to remove any blood.
If you need to repeat cleaning, use clean water and a clean cloth until the area is debris-free and germ-free.

, For good measure you can dab it all over with another clean towel before you continue.

, If you have an antibiotic cream like Neosporin or Polysporin, apply it lightly to the wound to help fight infection.

, Use a band-aid if it's small, or gauze if it's large, to prevent infection. When it comes to any wrapping/covering, be gentle but don't leave it too loose nor too tight. Seal it with the tape if needed.


Once the wound has healed enough to prevent infection, you can expose it to the air again, to speed healing.

, Change the dressing every day or when it becomes dirty or wet. Once the injury has healed enough that there are no open/raw areas, you can expose it to air to speed further healing, at least for portions of your day.

, If the wound doesn't heal, or if you notice more redness, pain, swelling, or warmth, see a doctor; there may be an infection.

Hypertension, also called high blood pressure
A distended abdomen
Pain in your back or side
The need to urinate often
Excretion of blood in your urine
Kidney stones
Urinary infections or kidney infections

, If you have a parent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, you have a 50% chance of having it too.If you have the disorder and you have children, there is a 50% chance that you will pass it on to them. You can pass it on to them even if your partner does not have the disorder. One parent having it is enough to pass it on.
If you have a grandparent with the disorder, you have a 25% chance of having inherited the disorder.
Occasionally the disorder arises due to a mutation in a family where there is no history of the disorder, but this is very rare.

, There are several tests that the doctor may do to determine whether you have cysts on your kidneys. Tell your doctor if you think you may be pregnant because this may affect the doctor’s decision of which tests to run. Possible tests include:An ultrasound. This procedure uses sound waves that are higher than we can hear to make a picture of your internal organs. The sound waves are transmitted through your body and bounce off the tissues. The machine converts the information from the reflected sound waves into a picture. This does not hurt and is not dangerous for you. The doctor may use gel on your skin to make a better connection between your body and the ultrasound device. The procedure will last a few minutes.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scanner uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of your internal organs. You may be given a contrast material to make the organs show up better on the x-ray images. This can be done by having you swallow a liquid or by injecting it into a vein. While the scan is occurring you will lie on a table that will move you into the scanner. You may hear noises coming from the machine. The doctor will communicate with you through an intercom. The procedure may last about half an hour and will not hurt.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. An MRI machine uses magnets and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of your body. Because this test uses magnets, it is important that you tell the doctor if you have any metal or electronic implants in your body. This could include heart valves, a pacemaker, a heart defibrillator, shrapnel, bullet fragments, or a prosthetic joint. Your doctor may also give you a contrast material to make your kidneys show up better on the pictures. While the scan is being performed, you will lie on a table that moves into the scanner. The scan will not hurt, but you may hear loud noises. You will be asked to lie still, but you will be able to communicate with the doctor over a microphone. If you are worried about feeling claustrophobic, ask the doctor if you can receive a sedative., Keeping your blood pressure from being too high is important for reducing the speed at which your kidneys are damaged. Talk to your doctor to make a customized health plan that fits your lifestyle and health condition. Possible ways to reduce your blood pressure include:Eating a low salt, low fat diet. You can do this by reducing the amount of salt and fat that you cook with. Avoid salting meats and instead of frying them, try grilling, roasting, or baking them instead. Choose lean meats like poultry and fish. If you eat fatty meats, trim off the fat and remove the skin. Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat. They are low in fat and high in fiber. When purchasing canned fruits and vegetables, look for foods that have been canned in water rather than salty water or sugary syrups.Quit smoking. Smoking hardens your arteries and increases your blood pressure. Smoking can help reduce your chances of developing cancer and lower your blood pressure. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about options such as joining support groups, trying nicotine replacement therapy or residential treatment.Increase the amount of exercise you get. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about what will be best for your health condition. In general, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends that people do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity, such as running, swimming, biking, or walking per week and strength training training, like weight lifting, twice per week. This will help you to lower your blood pressure, manage your weight, and relieve stress.Reduce stress. Stress causes people’s blood pressure to increase. If you have recently been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, this alone is likely to be extremely stressful. Try using relaxation techniques to help you cope. Some people find the following to be helpful: yoga, meditation, deep breathing, visualizing calming images, or Tai Ch.
Take blood pressure medications. If your doctor feels it is necessary for you to use medication to control your blood pressure, make sure you give your doctor a complete list of all other medications, both prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies that you are taking. This is important so that the doctor can make sure that they won’t interact with each other. Common medications that may be prescribed for people with polycystic kidney disease are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE inhibitors can often cause a cough-like side effect. Talk to your doctor about other treatment options if this happens to you.

, Many people with polycystic kidney disease have chronic pain in their back or their side. This can occur if the cysts are large and causing pressure.Severe pain may require surgery to remove or drain the cysts.
Milder pain is likely to be treated with medications. Depending on the severity of your pain, the doctor may suggest an over-the-counter painkiller like paracetamol or a prescription strength medication like codeine, tramadol, an antidepressant, or an anticonvulsant. The latter two are more often used for chronic pain.
Do not take over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen without first discussing it with your doctor. These medications may affect your kidneys or interact with blood pressure medications.

, Drink plenty of fluid so that you urinate frequently and flush out your urinary tract. This will help prevent stones from forming or help smaller ones pass. If they are too large, to do this the doctor may recommend one of two procedures:Extracorporal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) to break up the stones. Once the stones are smaller, you may be able to pass them naturally. You will receive painkillers during this procedure to relieve any discomfort that it causes.
Ureterorenoscopy. During this procedure the doctor inserts a small scope into your urethra, bladder, and ureter. The doctor may remove the stone or use a laser to break it up so you can pass the pieces naturally. This would be done under general anesthesia.

, Urinary tract infections are usually effectively treated with antibiotics, drinking plenty of water, and taking a painkiller, such as paracetamol, to relieve discomfort. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop a urinary tract infection. It is important that it be treated immediately to prevent it from spreading to the cysts where it is harder for the antibiotics to reach. If this happens your doctor may need to drain the cysts. Monitor yourself for the following symptoms of a urinary tract infection:Needing to urinate often
Cloudy or bloody urine
Urine that has a strange, bad smell
Pain when urinating or a constant dull pain in your pubic area
Back pain
Fever or shivering
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea

, If you develop cysts on your liver your doctor may suggest several options, depending upon their severity:Not undergoing hormone therapy
Draining the cysts
Removing cystic parts of the liver
Getting a liver transplant

, Your doctor will likely do regular blood tests to evaluate any changes in kidney function. If your kidneys start to fail, there are two major options:Dialysis. Dialysis is necessary when your kidneys can no longer filter your blood. During this procedure your blood is cleaned and waste products are removed. There are two techniques.

During haemodialysis you will need to undergo three several-hour-long treatments per week. Your blood will be passed through an external machine and then rerouted into your body.
The other option, peritoneal dialysis, can be done at home at night while you sleep. You will have a small catheter inserted permanently into the space in your abdomen. Your blood will be pumped through the blood vessels of the peritoneal cavity and waste products will be drawn into the dialysis fluid. This takes less than an hour, but must be done four times per day or while you sleep. If dialysis is necessary, your doctor will help you determine which method would be best for you.



Kidney transplant. It may be necessary for you to receive a new, functional kidney. You will need someone who is a close genetic match to you. Close relatives are often good matches.

(If you don’t have a mobile device, you can set up your Fitbit by plugging in the accompanying wireless dongle to a USB port on a computer, going to www.fitbit.com/setup, and following the onscreen instructions.), Click the “Log In” link on the top-right corner of the page and enter your account credentials to sign in. , This is where you will keep track of your daily caloric intake. Under your account dashboard, click the “Log.” Then click “Food,” followed by “Get Started” (in the Food Plan section). , Enter your current weight and the weight that you want to achieve. Pick the intensity of the Food Plan you’d like to create. Fitbit will tell you how soon you should achieve your weight goal based on your weight stats and the intensity you choose.You can choose from four different intensities: Easier, Medium, Kinda Hard, and Harder. All you need to do is to select your choice and click the “Next” button to continue.
Though it’s ultimately up to you which intensity you choose, you will get the most out of your plan if you choose one that really works for you. If you choose one that’s too difficult, you will get discouraged and possibly quit. If you choose one that’s too easy, you may not see results as quickly as you like, and you may get bored with the plan.
If you are not in the habit of exercising regularly, or if you find it particularly challenging to cut out certain foods from your diet, stick with Easier or Medium. If you exercise fairly regularly and have good self-control regarding food, go with Kinda Hard or Harder.
You can edit the intensity later if you find that the plan is too easy or too hard for you. Simply click on the gear icon on the “Calories In vs. Out” tile (spoon and fork icon). Then click the pencil icon (right next to “Plan Intensity”). You can change your weight goal on this screen as well., The last step will display the summary of your Food Plan. It includes your current and desired weight, the intensity you selected, and how many calories you will lose per day based on the intensity you chose.

Fill out the three details required for the food you ate: What did you eat? Type in the name of the food you ate on the text field and a list of foods will appear. Select the most closely related item on the list, and it will populate in the text field.

How much? Set the amount of the food you ate by typing in the serving size you had on this text field.

When? Click this drop-down list, and choose the time of the day that you had the food.

, Especially if you cook at home, you won’t want to record all of the components of your meal every single time you eat the same thing. Instead, create a “meal” in your Fitbit account and save it for later. On the page where you usually log food, look for “Favorites” on the righthand side and click “Meals.” Then click the “Create a Meal” link and name your meal. Hit “Save,” and add the individual foods that make up your meal. Hit the red “Add to Meal” button after you enter the individual foods. Then click “I’m done.”

, Develop a routine so that you don’t forget. Snacks count too, of course. Some people find it helpful to plan their meals in advance and enter all of the food they plan to eat that day early in the morning (or even early in the week). That way you can see if the meals you’re planning will help you meet your weight goals or not and adjust accordingly., Go to the Food Log section. Click the “Log” button at the top of your dashboard to go to the Log page of your dashboard. Select the “Food” tab from the Log page to view your diet records.

Consult a doctor.,
Take nattokinase.,
Use bromelain supplements.,
Try garlic.,
Get more vitamin E. Make sure you get enough vitamin E and magnesium to prevent the clumping of platelets.,
Consume onions.,
Use ginger to reduce clotting.,
Add turmeric to your recipes.,
Exercise.",How to Thin Your Blood Naturally1," Before you try thinning your blood on your own, you should consult a trained physician. There are many reasons for this. First, thinning your blood or preventing coagulation can cause excessive bleeding. Secondly, many of the products and foods that help thin your blood interact negatively with one another and other medications. Finally, any preexisting medical conditions can impact which blood thinning agents you can and cannot use.;
, Nattokinase is an enzyme which breaks down fibrin, part of a normal clot. Nattokinase comes from natto, a product of fermented soybeans. Nattokinase is known to be a good blood thinner, reducing fibrinogen, a natural substance within the coagulation system that helps the body make clots.Everyone needs some fibrinogen to prevent bleeding problems, but it can increase with age making the blood “stickier”.
Blood that is too sticky is prone to clotting.
Nattokinase should be taken on an empty stomach.
You should take 100 to 300 mg daily.Nattokinase should be avoided if you bleed very easily, or have recently had a bleeding ulcer, surgery, stroke or heart attack.You should not take nattokinase at least two weeks prior to having surgery.

, Bromelain helps to reduce platelet adhesiveness. Bromelain is an enzyme derived from pineapple that inhibits fibrinogen synthesis. Bromelain also directly degrades fibrin and fibrinogen, and acts as a blood-thinner by reducing excessive blood platelet adhesiveness.500 to 600 milligrams daily is the usual dose.Never take bromelain supplements with other blood thinners, as this can cause excessive bleeding.While bromelain is found in all parts of the pineapple, eating the fruit itself will not have any beneficial effects on blood health., Garlic is a well-known natural blood thinner, decreasing the risk of heart attack and reducing plaque and high blood pressure. Garlic contains allium, and substances believed to reduce blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels are thought to be the allicin compounds.Its antioxidant properties are helpful in preventing the harmful effects of free radicals.Dosage for garlic is one clove daily.

, Vitamin E is a strong blood thinner, preventing platelet aggregation (sticking together). It also prevents the formation of a protein that is essential to blood clot formation.Take 15 milligrams of vitamin E daily to promote blood thinning.
You can get vitamin E in foods like liver, wheat germ, eggs, dark leafy greens, peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, avocados and spinach.Magnesium also promotes relaxation of blood vessels, which can increase blood oxygenation., Add more onions to your diet to help prevent platelet aggregation. Onions contain adenosine, which acts as an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants prevent your blood from clotting.Eating raw onions is the best way to receive the benefits of onions., Gingerol is a compound that thins blood by restricting the clotting and clumping of blood cells and platelets. It also minimizes the level of cholesterol absorbed in your body.Ginger also reduces your blood pressure by relaxing the muscle around blood vessels.
Consume ginger in the form of a raw root, powder, or capsule. It is most effective when the raw root is boiled.While some researchers have shown links between blood thinning and ginger consumption, more research on this relationship is necessary., The simple addition of turmeric to food helps to manage clotting. Turmeric is used as a cooking spice and as a natural home remedy for many health conditions. The main anticoagulant agent in turmeric is curcumin, which reduces the tendency of platelets to attach to one another and cause clotting.You should use between 500 milligrams and 11 grams per day. Curcumin effects are similar to the anticoagulant drug Warfarin. To avoid problems, don’t mix turmeric and anticoagulant drugs.
Turmeric is more readily found in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine than in western dishes.

, Exercise and regular activity helps to reduce the levels of vitamin K in your body. Intense exercise is responsible for reduced levels of vitamin K in the blood, and also stimulates the plasminogen activator, a very strong anticoagulant that helps to reduce the clotting property of blood.Most athletes show a deficiency of vitamin K
Try swimming, aerobic or high-intensity strengthening exercises to reduce your cholesterol levels
Work out three to four days per week
Start with 5 to 10 minutes of warm up, before an aerobic session of 30 to 45 minutes

Schedule to have someone pick you up from the hospital on the day of your surgery.,
Familiarize yourself with what will happen during the surgery.,
Be aware that complications are rare.",How to Treat a Fungal Infection of the Sinus Cavity1," Aspergillus fungi will first infect the paranasal sinuses and airways. It may then progress down into the lung tissue, or remain in the sinuses. At this time, the fungi will form a fungus ball, or aspergilloma, which is the hallmark of this infection.


A fungus ball is a mass of fungi that form together. To treat this ball, it must be surgically removed.;
, This fungus ball can only be treated through surgical removal, followed by a draining of the sinuses. This surgical procedure is called an antrotomy.


The idea is to remove the fungus ball, and then clear the sinuses by literally ‘sucking out’ the fungi with a vacuum as part of the surgical follow up.

, This procedure is usually done under general anesthesia, but maxillary antrostomy is considered a “day surgery” , meaning that you can leave the hospital after the surgical intervention. The procedure typically lasts a couple of hours.

, Since the maxillary sinus is the most common sinus in which Aspergillomas may be found, there are two ways to approach it. One is through the gums, into the canine fossa, which gives direct connection to the maxillary sinus. The other is through the nose.


Regardless of which path is chosen, the surgeon will use a camera to find the fungus ball so that he or she can remove it.

, This surgery is minimally invasive, which means that only a small area of tissue is actually involved in the surgery.

Here, you'll change from your street clothes to your scrubs. After surgery, you'll return here to wash up and change back into your street clothes., This applies if your hair is long or medium-length. Pull it back in a topknot or bun. Don't allow any hair to hang over your face. Make sure that your hairdo will easily fit under your head covering., Hair, dandruff, and squamous cells fall from your head without your noticing. Therefore, covering your head is essential for your patients' safety. Wear a standard surgical head cover or hood provided by the hospital. Make sure the material is free of lint and is large enough to fit all of your hair. If you have sideburns and/or facial hair, you should wear a surgical hood to cover these areas.

Avoid surgeons' skull caps, which do not adequately cover your hair., This is to prevent bacteria, saliva, or mucous from contaminating your hands as you scrub. It also covers facial hair, which can carry dandruff or contaminating squamous cells. Make sure the fabric covers your nose and mouth. Tie each set of strings behind your head. The mask should be secure without cutting off your air flow., Jewelry carries microbes that could infect your patient. Take off your watch, bracelets, rings, etc and put them in your locker. Make sure nothing remains on your hands or arms., Your suit should consist of a shirt and pants. Put your shirt on first. If you're wearing an undershirt, bra, or camisole, your shirt should cover it completely. Not even the collar or straps should emerge from the neckline of the scrub shirt. After your shirt is on, put on your scrub pants. Tuck your shirt tail into the waistband to prevent billowing or skin shedding into sterile areas., Each brush is individually packaged to remain sterile. Tear the backing away from the plastic packaging. As you open it, look for an enclosed nail file. Take the file in your dominant hand. Keep the scrub brush in the packaging for now., Antimicrobial soap works most efficiently in warm water. Avoid excessively hot water, which could lead to dry and irritated skin. Cold water should also be avoided because it keeps soap from lathering properly., Make sure that no water splashes on it at any time during the scrubbing procedure. If you get your attire wet, you'll risk contamination. This means you must change clothes and start scrubbing all over again., Remove the nail file from the scrub brush packaging. Hold the file in your dominant hand. Place the other hand under the water. Allow the water to flow between your fingertip and fingernail as you remove dirt with the file. Repeat this process with each finger on both hands. Make sure you've removed all dirt and debris. Discard the file when you're finished., Hold the plastic side of the packaging in one hand. Allow the brush to fall into the other hand. Discard the packaging. Aim carefully to prevent the brush from falling on the floor or other unsanitary surface.

Keep in mind that some facilities use a brushless scrub technique because some studies have shown that the brushless technique results in a lower bacterial count., You should find at least two dispensers above the sink within easy reach. The iodine has a brownish tint. Soaps will have a pink or blue hue. Use your elbow to do pump the iodine/soap. About two pumps should do the trick. Make sure the iodine/soap falls onto the rough side of the brush., Move the scrub brush in a circular motion. Try to scrub beneath your fingernails to pick up any lingering dirt you might have missed with the file. Scrub for 30 seconds to one minute on each hand. Discard the brush when you're finished with this step.If you're counting strokes, as opposed to keeping time, scrub for 30 circular strokes on each hand., Use chlorhexidine or iodine for this step. Continue to move in a circular motion over your hands. Get in between your fingers. Scrub the front and back sides of your hands to remove bacteria. Do this for two minutes. If you take too long with this step, bacteria will have a chance to grow on your arms.If you're counting strokes, go for 20 circular strokes on each side of your hand., Move in one direction from the base of your palm toward your elbow. Wash up to 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above your elbow. Do this for one minute. Continue to keep your hands elevated to prevent contaminated soap from reaching your clean hands. Keep your hands held higher than your arms during the entire process. This prevents contaminated soap and bacteria from soiling your hands. If contaminated soap hits your hands, you'll have to repeat the process.For the counted stroke method, scrub for 20 strokes on each side of your forearm., Avoid moving them back and forth through the water. Work your way up from your fingertips to your elbows. Aim for one swift movement of your arm in one direction. This should only take about three seconds per arm. Let the excess water drip from your hands and arms. Don't shake them., You will not dry your hands until you enter the OR. When you do enter the OR, you will dry your hands and arms thoroughly using the aseptic technique. Make sure to dry your hands and arms before donning your sterile gown., A special sterile towel pack should be included at the top of the package with your surgical gown. Lean forward slightly to pick up the towel pack. Retrieve it and step away from the table to keep your gown sterile. Open the pack so that the towel is folded lengthwise as you open it. Keep the towel away from anything that might be unsterile. Return your hands to the elevated position above your forearms. Make sure your arms don't come into contact with your body., Hold one end of the towel in your dominant hand. Dry your other hand and arm by blotting in a circular motion. Start at your fingertips and end at your elbow. Make sure you dry every part of your hand and forearm. Don't go back over any areas you've already dried., Repeat the process on your dominant hand and arm, being careful not to retrace your strokes. Discard the towel when you're finished."

Incorporate fish and fish oil into your diet.,
Drink kombucha.,
Use olive oil.,
Consume small portions of red wine.,
Drink pomegranate juice.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Thin Your Blood Naturally2," Using fish products in your cooking will work to thin your blood. Fatty fish contain omega 3 fatty acids that are responsible for intense blood thinning and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disorders.Fish that contain high amounts of omega fatty acids are mackerel, anchovies, salmon, albacore tuna, lake trout, and herring.Platelets have a tendency to stick to the wall of blood vessels to form clots, and omega 3 fatty acids reduce the platelet’s sticky properties.Omega 3s also make the clotting mechanism take more time, preventing rapid onset of a stroke or heart attack.Take a low dose to prevent any complications, such as bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.
Taking more than 3g (3000mg) of fish oil per day may increase the risk of bleeding., To promote blood thinning, try drinking kombucha. Kombucha is a lightly fermented drink of sweetened black or green tea, produced by fermenting the tea using a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast.Kombucha has not been proven effective by medical science.However, a number of herbalists and home-remedy advocates cite a litany of health benefits associated with the drink.Kombucha, which is often home brewed, can do more harm than good. This is because people often get sick from contaminants found in the drink.You should reduce or stop drinking it a week before surgery.
Similarly, if you suffer from heavy periods, stop drinking kombucha a week beforehand.
Some side effects of kombucha include gas, stomach-ache, nausea, fatigue, pimples, rashes, diarrhea, or a headache., Olive oil is made from crushing and pressing olives. The polyphenols present in olive oil are responsible for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticoagulant benefits, and can help keep your blood from getting too thick.Extra virgin olive oil is the unrefined oil made from the first pressing and has the most delicate flavor and highest phyto-nutrient and antioxidant content.

, Red wine contains potent blood thinning substances such as proanthocyanadins and polyphenols. These substances are found in the dark pigment of purple grapes. They work by preventing premature blood clotting.A person should eat one small bunch of grapes or have one small glass of wine per day.
There is still an ongoing debate over the source of red wine’s health benefits. Some researchers point to the health benefits of the grapes while others point out that all alcohol seems to have these effects when consumed in moderation.Women can consume 1 alcoholic beverage a day to thin the blood, men can have 2. Women who are nursing or pregnant should never drink alcohol.
Recognize that consuming more than this amount of alcohol a day can result in negative health consequences.

, Pomegranate juice is also full of polyphenols, and it may also improve blood flow. It may also help lower systolic blood pressure.


There are concerns that pomegranate, like grapefruit, may interact with many medications (including Warfarin, ACE inhibitors, statins, and blood pressure medications). Speak with your doctor about your medications and whether or not they might interact with pomegranate.
Try drinking half a glass of pomegranate juice every day.

, Most people are dehydrated, and they don't even know it. Dehydration thickens the blood, increasing the risk of blood clots. Ensure that you have at least 8 glasses of water each day to prevent dehydration."

Work with your doctor to come up with an appropriate anti fungal therapy.,
Take Amphotericin B.,
Consider taking posaconazole.,
Get corrective surgery.,
Treat the underlying medical condition, if there is one.",How to Treat a Fungal Infection of the Sinus Cavity2," Unlike aspergillosis and the fungus ball it forms, mucormycosis can be treated with an aggressive antifungal therapy that involves taking medication. The drugs that are given to treat mucormycosis attempt to destroy the fungus by creating pores inside their cell membranes, and through these pores, the passage of water and other molecules disrupt fungal cellular processes, and eventually, lead to cell death., This medication is the first-line therapy for fighting mucormycosis fungi. It is generally prescribed at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg per kg of body weight, each day.It is important to note that Amphotericin is thought to be the only drug active against this fungus, meaning that the standard antifungal agents (voriconazole, fluconazole, and other azole derivatives) will not help in resolving this infection.However, because this medication is hard for your kidneys to process, it is often prescribed with a liposomal formulation.


This liposomal formulation is a vesicle made of fat that the amphotericin B is packed into, so that the toxic effect on your body is diminished.

, While most doctors believe that amphotericin B is the only medication to treat this fungus, some recent studies have shown that posaconazole may be effective against some species in the murcomycosis family. This drug also targets the cell membrane, but goes beyond this and targets a specific enzyme in the fungi.


The dose for this medication is generally 800 mg per day, spread out over the course of the day., This surgery focuses on the removal of dead tissue, as well as the repairing of the structures that were affected by the infection. The surgery works with the antifungal medications; by removing tissue affected by the fungus, it reduces the workload of the medication.

, If you have a lowered immune system, you may be put on an immune system-boosting regimen in order to increase your immune response and thereby fight the infection.Talk to your doctor about what might be right for you, depending on the condition affecting your immune system.

Make sure it's safe to remove your stitches.,
Choose a tool to cut your stitches.,
Sterilize your cutting tool and a pair of tweezers.,
Gather your other supplies.,
Wash and sterilize the stitch site.,
Sit in a well-lighted spot.,
Lift the first knot.,
Cut the suture.,
Pull the thread through.,
Continue removing the stitches.,
Cleanse the wound.,
See a doctor if any problems arise.,
Protect the wound from re-injury.,
Protect the wound from UV rays.,
Apply Vitamin E. It can help the healing process, but should only be used when the wound is completely closed.

",How to Remove Stitches," In some cases you absolutely shouldn't remove your own stitches. If your stitches were inserted after a surgical procedure, or if the recommended healing time (usually 10-14 days) hasn't elapsed, removing them yourself can put you at greater risk for infection and may prevent your body from healing properly.Keep in mind that when you go to the doctor, adhesive strips are often placed on the skin after stitch removal to continue to facilitate the healing process. If you do it at home, you may not be getting the care you require.
If you want to double check whether it's OK to remove your stitches, give your doctor a call. He or she will let you know whether it's safe enough to do it yourself.
If your wound looks as if it's getting red or more sore, do not remove your stitches: go to your doctor. You may have an infection.
Keep in mind that in many cases, you can get your stitches removed without going through the regular doctor's appointment process. You might be able to walk right in for a quick stitch removal. Call your doctor and ask.;
, Use a sharp pair of surgical scissors if possible. Sharp nail scissors or nail clippers also work fine. Avoid using any type of blunt edge, and don't use a knife - it's too easy for knives to slip.

, Drop them in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes, let them thoroughly dry on a clean paper towel, then swab them thoroughly with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol. This will ensure the cutting tool and tweezers don't transfer bacteria to your body.

, There are a few other things you should have on hand. Gather sterile bandages and antibiotic ointment in case you need to treat an area that starts to bleed. You shouldn't need to use these supplies, since if your skin has properly healed, no bandage is necessary, but it's important to have them on hand just in case.

, Use soapy water, and dry yourself thoroughly with a clean towel. Use a rubbing alcohol-soaked cotton ball to further clean the area around the stitches. Be sure the area is completely clean before proceeding.

, You'll need to be able to see every stitch clearly to do the job properly. Don't attempt to remove your stitches in a place that's too dark, or you could hurt yourself.

, Use the pair of tweezers to gently lift the knot of the first stitch slightly above the skin.

, Holding the knot above your skin, use your other hand to wield your scissors and snip the suture next to the knot., Use the tweezers to continue grasping the knot and gently pull the stitch through your skin and out. You might feel a bit of pressure, but it should not be painful.


If the skin starts to bleed when you remove the stitch, your stitches are not ready to come out. Stop what you're doing and see a doctor to remove the remaining stitches.

Take care not to pull the knot through your skin. It will catch on your skin and cause bleeding to occur.

, Use the tweezers to lift the knots, then snip with the scissors. Pull the thread through and discard. Continue until all the stitches have been removed.

, Make sure there's no residue left around the area of the wound. If you'd like, you can place a sterile bandage to cover the area and allow it to continue to heal.

, If the area reopens, you're going to need more stitches. It's very important to see a doctor immediately if this happens. Bandaging the wound and trying to let it heal without new stitches won't be adequate.

, Skin regains its strength slowly — when you remove the stitches, it's only at about 10% of its normal strength. Don't overuse the body part where you had stitches.

, Ultraviolet light is damaging even to healthy tissue. Use sunscreen if your wound will be exposed to the sun or when using tanning beds.

Read your Explanation of Benefits carefully.,
Discuss discrepancies with your health care provider.,
Gather as much information as possible.,
Submit your report to the OIG.,
Respond to any follow-up questions.",How to Report Medicaid Fraud2," When you receive an EOB from Medicaid, check it against your own records to make sure you received all the products and services listed and that you understand all the entries on the form.If you see any charges or entries that you don't understand, or that you believe are in error, they may be evidence of Medicaid abuse or fraud.
For example, a health care provider may bill Medicaid for services or supplies that you did not receive. If you see anything billed on your EOB that you never received, the listing may be fraud. It also may be possible that the listing was a clerical error., If you notice any suspicious charges on your Medicaid claim forms, bring them up with your health care provider before filing a fraud report.


If a simple clerical error has been made, the health care provider probably will be anxious to have the error corrected as soon as possible.
Fraud can be committed by the health care provider, the insurer, or both. Medical providers may commit fraud by sending duplicate bills, or billing for services that weren't performed. Insurers may commit fraud by, for example, overstating their cost to pay claims or denying valid claims.Health care patients also may commit Medicaid fraud, for example, by providing false information when they apply for services., To file a fraud report, you must have information about the beneficiary as well as the suspicious charges.


Get your information together before you call the hotline. You will be asked the name and Medicaid number of the beneficiary, the names and locations of all relevant health care providers, the dates of service, and the services or supplies at issue.You also should be able to provide the amount of money approved or paid by Medicaid for the services or supplies at issue., The OIG is responsible for investigating reports of Medicaid fraud, and has the authority to levy fines or suspend accounts of those committing fraud.


You may report by filling out the online form, or by calling the toll-free number at 1-800-HHS-TIPS.The OIG also accepts written tips or reports through the U.S. mail at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, ATTN: OIG HOTLINE OPERATIONS, PO Box 23489, Washington, DC 20026., When your report is investigated, you may be contacted for additional information.


If you chose to file your report anonymously, investigators at the OIG won't be able to contact you, which may result in your report being dismissed for lack of information.

Make a doctor’s appointment to test for mercury levels.,
Undergo chelation therapy if your mercury levels are dangerously high.,
Ask for vaccines without mercury.,
Avoid seafood.",How to Remove Mercury from the Body1," A regular CBC does not test for all types of mercury, but doctors can test by prescribing a medication that leeches mercury from the body and into the urine. Urine is then gathered for testing.You can get home tests for mercury, but it is recommended that you undergo professional medical testing if you have serious concerns about poisoning.;
, The most common treatment is with a synthetic amino acid injection. This can’t be done at home., Getting flu shots and other vaccines is a good idea, because it keeps the body healthier, allowing you to flush mercury naturally. However, some vaccines have mercury in them, and you can avoid them by talking to your doctor.

, Generally, the larger the seafood is, the greater the risk it will be. Whale, shark, tuna and other large fish carry elevated levels of mercury, thanks to water pollution from industrial plants.

, Buy or grow fresh cilantro. Take a large bunch of cilantro and make it into a pesto with garlic and olive oil. Toss it with pasta and eat it for lunch or dinner.


Repeat for five days to a week.

, A Korean study suggested fresh garlic juice could help the body get rid of excess mercury.

, The amino acids in protein help rid the body of mercury. Fat can also absorb heavy metals.


Avoid eating excess sugar, which can slow down the metabolism and immune response., The body is actually prepped to remove mercury from the body. The healthier you are the quicker the response will be.

, Mercury is removed slowly from the body. Trying to rid it of the metal too quickly can lead to upset stomach and other problems.

Recognize that surgical removal is possible in the early stages.,
Recognize that late-stage thymoma can be surgically shrunk but not always removed.,
Locate a thoracic surgeon.,
Check your surgeon's qualifications.,
Undergo a median sternotomy.,
Find out if you are a candidate for a robotic thymectomy.,
Ask your surgeon about the possibility for laparoscopic thoracic surgery.,
Have debulking surgery.,
Recover for three to six weeks after the thymectomy.",How to Remove a Thymoma1," If your thymoma is in its early stages and has not yet spread to the rest of your body, you are an excellent candidate for surgical removal of the tumor, the thymus gland, and some surrounding tissue. This procedure is referred to as a thymectomy.Surgery is the most likely course of treatment in Stages I and II of the disease and may be somewhat effective in Stage III.In the vast majority of cases, surgery by itself is sufficient to cure a thymoma entirely in its early stages.However, surgery can only cure about 25 – 40% of Stage III thymomas.;
, If the thymoma has spread significantly, it might not be possible to remove the thymoma entirely. Surgery can be used, however, to drastically shrink the tumor, thereby relieving symptoms.This is referred to as debulking. This surgery may involve removing a part of the lung or the lining of the lung in cases where the tumor has spread to these areas.Some patients may require radiation therapy after getting debulking surgery to kill any cancerous cells that may have been left behind after the surgery. This is called adjuvant therapy., In most cases a thymectomy is done by a thoracic surgeon, or a surgeon who works primarily on the chest.Your thoracic surgeon should be board-certified, and you should be able to confirm her certification online., If you have some choice in the matter, try to locate a surgeon who has performed many successful thymectomies in the past. Feel free to ask your surgeon questions about his or her experience, including:


The number of successful surgeries performedHospital infection ratesBoard certificationsQuality of the hospital, This is the most common surgery that is performed to remove a Stage I or II thymoma. This involves splitting the breastbone and removing the thymoma and the surrounding tissues, such as the lining of the lung and heart. This is an open surgery, which means that you are more at risk of blood loss and lengthy recovery time. However, this type of surgery does an excellent job of removing a tumor in its entirety.In some cases, you might be required to have chemotherapy or radiation prior to surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation can shrink a tumor to make it easier to remove., This procedure involves making incisions on the patient’s chest and attaching robotic arms on one side of the base unit. Several medical devices are attached on the other side, including endoscopic cameras that help to view the body, sharp instruments, sophisticated sewing tools, miniature scalpels, and lasers. The operating surgeon uses the controllers to manipulate the instruments that are inside the patient’s body. The instruments have the same capabilities as a human being’s wrist. The surgeon makes specific sewing and cutting motions using the instruments. The computer translates the surgeon's motions and performs them inside the body.This approach can cut down on recovery time and blood loss, but is not possible for every patient depending on the severity of their thymoma., This surgery involves making three small incisions on the right or the left side of the chest. Scopes and other instruments are inserted through the incisions so that the tumor can be removed. This type of surgery drastically cuts down on your recovery time, but it might not be possible for all patients., This surgery is done for thymomas that are in the later stages and have advanced throughout the body. This is done when it is not possible to remove the entire thymoma. This procedure tries to remove most of the tumor where possible, and it helps to relieve some of the symptoms. This may also involve the removal of surrounding tissues around the chest, heart, and lungs., You will not be able to return immediately to work, school, or physical activities. For most thymectomy patients, three to six weeks of recovery time is sufficient before returning to normal activity.However, the side effects of thymectomy are relatively minor: most patients are released from the hospital after just a few days, and most do not require serious pain medication.Keep in mind that the thymus gland is not necessary for adults to have a healthy immune system. Most patients do not experience ill effects after thymus gland removal."

Recognize that radiation might not work on its own.,
Research how radiation therapy works.,
Get a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan.,
Undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 5 days a week.,
Have a doctor perform Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT).,
Undergo internal radiation.",How to Remove a Thymoma2," Radiation therapy can help shrink tumors prior to surgical removal. Radiation can also help keep a tumor from returning after surgery. In conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation can help relieve thymoma symptoms in patients with late-stage tumors, such as painful breathing or chest pain. However, radiation by itself is not the most effective treatment option., Radiation involves the use of invisible high-energy rays to destroy cancerous cells. This helps stop them from increasing and multiplying. The type of radiation used depends on the amount of energy that is required to remove your thymoma as well as how far the thymoma may have spread.If you opt for radiation therapy, you will work with a doctor who is called a radiation oncologist.

, A CT scan is an effective way to create images of your body. It involves taking a number of X-rays at different angles and then combining them to visualize cross-sections of your body.A CT scan can help your oncology team determine the correct dose and position of your radiation therapy., The most common type of radiation that is used is external beam radiation therapy. It uses x-rays from a machine just like the usual x-ray procedure, only these x-rays emit a much more powerful radiation.The procedure does not hurt, but it may cause side effects later including: fatigue, skin redness, weight loss, poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting. These are all due to intense amounts of radiation, which may normal cells along with cancerous cells.Many side effects are temporary and can be relieved with medications.Another type of EBRT that is used is the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). This procedure is able to accurately target a malignant tumor while also affecting less of the surrounding tissues. This means that this procedure has less side effects than regular radiation therapy.Most radiation therapy is done for a few minutes at a time, for several days a week, continuing for several weeks., IMRT is an advanced form of 3D-CRT which can also be used to remove thymomas. The procedure relies on a computer to more accurately target the cancerous tissue. The beams and intensity of the radiation can be adjusted to prevent harming nearby healthy tissues., The source of the radiation can also be an implant that is placed directly on the tumor using needles or catheters.This form of radiation therapy is called interstitial or internal radiation. Internal radiation is usually given to outpatients for several weeks. You are not radioactive during or after the treatment.

Understand how chemotherapy works as a thymoma treatment.,
Talk to your doctor about systemic chemotherapy.,
Talk to your doctor about regional chemotherapy.,
Know what medications are given during chemotherapy.,
Undergo four to six cycles of chemotherapy.,
Be aware of the side effects of chemotherapy.,
Ask your doctor about octreotide.",How to Remove a Thymoma3," Chemotherapy is a medical procedure used to kill cancer cells using medications. These drugs are administered intravenously or orally.When chemo drugs enter your bloodstream, they spread to other organs. This is helpful when thymomas have entered neighboring tissues and organs.Chemotherapy can be used before surgery to shrink tumors that are not removable by means of surgery.Chemotherapy can also be done after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells that might have been left behind.Chemotherapy may be used along with radiation for those who are too ill to receive surgical treatment.Chemotherapy is not recommended for patients whose tumors might be easily surgically removed., The chemotherapy drugs can either be taken through the mouth or injected into the vein or muscle. The drugs are able to enter into the bloodstream and reach the cancerous cells all over the body. This treatment is called systemic chemotherapy because it involves all systems in the body., Chemotherapy may also be given directly to a more specific area of the body where a thymoma has formed. This mode of treatment is localized. Regional chemotherapy destroys the cancerous cells that are in that particular area., There are different chemotherapy drugs that can be given during treatment. They include: carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, ifosfamide, octreotide, paclitaxel and pemetrexed.The combinations that are commonly used in the treatment of a thymoma include:


Cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and doxorubicin.Paclitaxel and carboplatin.Cisplatin and etoposide., Chemotherapy is administered in several cycles, each of which lasts for about three to five weeks. Patients rest and recover in between these cycles. An initial round of chemotherapy will usually take four to six cycles to be effective., The side effects from chemo that you experience will depend on the dose and drugs given. Many of these side effects will dissipate after chemotherapy has concluded.However, the common side effects include:


Nausea
Vomiting
Infection
Diarrhea
Reduced appetite
Hair loss
Fatigue

, Octreotide is a synthetic hormone that may be able to shrink and kill thymoma cells.If you have a late-stage thymoma that cannot be surgically removed in its entirety, ask your doctor whether a hormonal option might be possible for you.

Be aware that only doctors or registered nurses remove a PICC.,
Wash your hands.,
Prepare the materials for removing the catheter.,
Explain the process of removing the PICC line to the patient.,
Get the patient into the correct position.,
Clean the skin around the catheter.,
Remove the catheter.,
Monitor the patient's condition for 24 to 48 hours.,
Inform the patient about several complications that can arise from a PICC removal.,
Advise the patient on the proper dosages for pain medications.,
Inform the patient about what sort of exercises to avoid.,
Educate the patient on proper nutrition.",How to Remove a PICC Line," Otherwise, serious complications or infections could arise.


Only proceed with these steps if you are a registered doctor or nurse who is qualified to take care of the patient.;
, Before you begin the procedure or touch any of the materials required for the removal of the PICC line, wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and put on a new pair of sterile gloves. This reduces the chances of the patient developing an infection. , Place all the materials that will be used throughout the procedure, so you will have them easily at hand.


These materials will include a pair of sterile scissors, some air-occlusive dressing, a stitch cutter, sterile dressing packages and cotton balls soaked in betadine solution..
Systematically arrange all of these materials near the patient’s bed before the procedure, so they are orderly and easy to reach.

, This is to establish trust and cooperation by the patient. Be ready to reply to any possible questions about the procedure that the patient may ask.

, Before you begin the procedure, ask the patient to get into the correct position. The patient should be lying flat on his or her back, facing upwards, with all four limbs in contact with the bed. This is known as a supine position.


Make sure the patient has a clean bed, with fresh sheets. This helps to make the patient more comfortable and avoid infection.

, Get a cotton ball soaked in betadine solution and clean the area around the PICC line, moving from the skin nearest the catheter outwards.


This is an important step, as it cleans any bacteria from the surface of the skin, reducing the chance of infection.
Once you've cleaned the skin, turn off the infusion set and prepare the dressing patch so it is ready to apply immediately following the procedure.

, Using a stitch cutter, carefully cut and remove the suture that holds the PICC line in place. Ask the patient to hold his or her breath, then, using your dominant hand, slowly pull the catheter out in the opposite direction of insertion. Do not apply any direct pressure on the insertions site.Upon removal of the catheter, immediately cover the insertion site with sterile gauze and hold it in place using light pressure.Ask the patient to continue holding their breath while you cover the area with an occlusive dressing. Once this is done, allow the patient to breathe normally and return to a comfortable position.

, After the removal of the PICC line, monitor the patient’s condition for 24 to 48 hours. Observe the patient for any signs of infection, such as fever. Also, observe the site for bleeding and assess the patient for any difficulty of breathing.


The dressing should remain in place for 24-72 hours, depending on the length of time the catheter was used for.

, It is important that the patient is made aware of these complications before the procedure takes place. Possible complications include:



Breakage of the PICC line. This is serious complication of PICC line removal. To prevent breakage, the line should be removed gently land slowly without exerting much force.

Infection. This is another potentially serious complication that a patient with PICC line can experience. An infection can arise at any time. Therefore, it is beneficial for the medical team to regularly monitor the PICC line, clean and train you to maintain its sterility as much as possible. The line would be flushed after each use and between changes of medication using a syringe of normal saline.Blood clot."" While the PICC line is in place for weeks or months it is a good practice to infuse enough heparin (an anticoagulant) to fill the line thus preventing the line or tip from forming small blood clots between uses, in the idle time until the next infusion. This is done immediately after flushing the line with a syringe of normal saline solution.Embolism caused by catheter fracture. This is a serious complication of PICC line removal that can cause the patient to lose consciousness if a blood clot reaches the brain.

Swelling and redness. These inflammatory symptoms can also occur as a complication of PICC line. The swelling and redness usually develop near the insertion of the catheter site.

, After removal of the catheter, the patient may experience pain in the upper arm. As a result, the patient's physician may prescribe pain medications or recommend over-the-counter medications so the patient can go about their daily activities.


One of the most common OTC pain medications recommended following PICC line removal is ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication that has both antipyretic (reduce fever) and and analgesic (reduce pain) properties.
The recommended dose of ibuprofen (according the the Centers for Disease Control) is 200-400mg, taken orally every 4 to 6 hours. It is recommended that ibuprofen should be taken with some food or milk to avoid stomach problems

, Be sure to inform the patient to not engage in any strenuous exercises or do any heavy lifting for a minimum of 24 hours following PICC line removal. This includes moving furniture, lifting heavy boxes or engaging in any activity that involves repetitive arm or hand movements.

, A healthy diet is essential for proper healing, therefore it's a good idea to educate the patient about the types of food to eat following the procedure.


This includes eating a lot of iron-rich foods to increase blood supply and strengthen the body. Iron-rich foods include red meat, chicken, spinach, broccoli, shellfish, pumpkin and sesame seeds, and nuts like peanuts, pecans, pistachios and almonds.If you/the patient has lost weight, you are encouraged to eat calorie-rich smoothies and shakes, which are full of nutrients, vitamins and natural sugars that will help one to gain weight in a healthy way.
Instead of eating three large meals a day, the patient should be encouraged to eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. This will help to keep their energy levels up.

Begin screening at the age of 50.For the general population (those who have not been designated to be at a heightened risk of colon cancer), screening is recommended to commence at the age of 50.,
Opt for a stool test.Both blood and/or DNA can be tested for in your stool, and a positive test indicates suspicion that you may have colon cancer.,
Get a colonoscopy.A colonoscopy is an alternative method of screening for colon cancer; it is much more invasive than a simple stool test, but also more accurate.,
Consider other modes of screening.Most people opt for either the stool testing or the colonoscopy as a means to screen for colon cancer.",How to Screen for Colon Cancer1," The options to consider are a stool test (recommended once every one to two years), a colonoscopy (a more invasive test that is recommended every 10 years), or a sigmoidoscopy or CT colonography (both of which are recommended every five years. The one you choose for your own personal screening will depend upon your preference.;
, It does not indicate that you have colon cancer - it simply means that you are at a heightened risk and should undergo more extensive medical evaluation. The advantage of stool testing is that it is an easy and non-invasive test. You can collect the stool sample(s) at home (depending upon how many are requested by your doctor) and simply send them into the lab for formal evaluation.


A stool test that is positive for blood and/or for DNA indicating possible colon cancer requires further follow-up exams. It does not mean that you have cancer, but it indicates the need for further testing.
A stool test that is negative means that you are at a very low risk of having colon cancer and do not need any further investigations at this time.
Stool testing is recommended once every one to two years, if this is your chosen form of screening for colon cancer.

, During a colonoscopy, a small tube is inserted through your rectum and passed all the way through your large intestine. There is a camera and a light at the end of the tube, allowing your doctor to see whether or not there are any lesions in your colon that are suspicious of being possible colon cancer. You normally need to take medications to induce diarrhea prior to the procedure in order to clear out any stool from your colon. You also normally receive light sedation for the duration of the exam, and you will not be able to return to work for the remainder of the day following the procedure.


The advantage of a colonoscopy is that it is very effective at picking up any suspicious lesions (more effective than a stool test). This is why you only need one once every 10 years, as opposed to once every one to two years for the stool test.
The disadvantage of a colonoscopy is that it is a more complex and invasive procedure.

, However, some less common methods that are also available include a sigmoidoscopy (where a tube is inserted through your rectum, but it is a shorter tube that only examines part of your colon), or a ""CT colonography,"" which is where you receive a CT scan looking at your colon.


The disadvantage to a sigmoidoscopy is that it does not look at your whole colon. (The advantage is that it is less invasive than a full colonoscopy.)
The disadvantage of a ""CT colonography"" is that, if a suspicious lesion is noted, you will need to subsequently undergo a colonoscopy so that your doctor can see it first-hand. (The advantage is that the procedure is not invasive.)
Both of these screening tests, if you opt for them, are recommended every five years.
A fecal occult blood test is the most common method that doctors use to screen for blood in the stool. If you have blood in your stool and you are losing weight or anemic, then you may need a colonoscopy.

"
"
Receive earlier and more frequent screening if you have an increased genetic risk.The interesting thing about colon cancer is that most cases are not related to genetics.,
Speak to your doctor if you have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.Both Chron's disease and ulcerative colitis are forms of inflammatory bowel disease.,
Be aware of other risk factors for colon cancer.People who are overweight or obese, who live a sedentary lifestyle, who consume lots of red meat or processed meats, who smoke, or who consume a large amount of alcohol are all at an increased risk of colon cancer.,
Report any suspicious symptoms to your doctor immediately.If you notice signs or symptoms that may be indicative of colon cancer, your doctor will likely advise that you proceed with investigations sooner rather than later.,
Be screened with tumor markers if you have had colon cancer in the past.If you have previously had colon cancer, you can have a tumor marker called ""CEA"" measured via a blood test and monitored in set intervals following your treatment for the cancer.",How to Screen for Colon Cancer2," In other words, even if a family member (such as one of your parents) has had colon cancer, this usually does not imply an increased risk for you. If two people in the same family get colon cancer, it is most often coincidence (and not genetics) given that colon cancer is the third most common cancer. However, there are some more rare genetic cases of colon cancer that account for about 5% of the total cases. These include FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis) and Lynch Syndrome (also known as HNPCC).


Consult your doctor if you think you may be at heightened genetic risk of colon cancer.
If it is confirmed that you do fall into this category, you will be eligible for colon cancer screening at a younger age, and more frequently.
The exact age that screening will start, as well as the frequency, will vary from case to case.
Your doctor will provide you with the relevant information if you are found to have an increased genetic risk.
Patients with FAP should begin early colon cancer screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy at around 10 to 12 years of age. This should continue on into their 30’s and 40’s because of the high risk of cancer.
For patients who have Lynch Syndrome or HNPP, screening should begin around 20 to 25 years of age, or five years younger than the earliest age of colorectal cancer diagnosis within the family.

, Depending upon how long you have had it for, as well as the severity of your disease (whether it impacts your whole colon, or just part of it), you are likely at a slightly increased risk of developing colon cancer. Again, you may be eligible for earlier and/or more frequent colon cancer screening tests. Your doctor will guide you as it varies from case to case.

, For these people, screening will be especially important. However, the good news is that all of the risk factors here are modifiable, meaning that you can minimize or eliminate them from your lifestyle, which in turn will decrease your chances of developing colon cancer down the road.

, Signs and symptoms to be aware of, and to report to your doctor, include:


A change in your stools and/or bowel habits, including diarrhea, constipation, and/or narrower stools.
Bleeding from your rectum or blood in your stool.
Unexplained weight loss and/or unusual fatigue/anemia.
Ongoing abdominal comfort (such as cramps, gas, or persistent abdominal pain).

, This helps to detect (and screen for) any possible recurrences down the road. It will likely be combined with other screening modalities in order to give you the best possible chance of catching any potential relapses as early as possible.

Check with the airline if you have any qualms about traveling. Make sure you know how you're getting from point A to point B. Smoothing out the details can help relieve your stress., Where possible, it's a good idea to travel in your own car instead of taking public transport. That way, if you have urgent need of a restroom, you can find a place to pull over., Make sure you take all of your medications with you in a plastic bag. Be sure to keep your medicines in the original bottles and carry your original prescription.You should also take water, snacks, and fiber if you need it. Remember to include a change of clothes, baby wipes or toilet wipes (to clean up), and your doctor's name and number.Your doctor can prescribe you prescription medications for IBS. If you need more than a 30-day supply for your trip, ask your doctor for help, as she can help you get enough to last the whole time. Don't forget to bring a few days extra, just in case you get stuck somewhere.Don't forget to carry over-the-counter medications, too, such as pain medications, anti-diarrhea medications, and medications for gas.Place the spare change of clothes in a plastic bag; that way, you will have a place to put your soiled clothes in case of an emergency.

, It's also good to make sure you have distractions with you. For instance, try a book or music on your smartphone. These little distractions will keep you occupied, lowering your anxiety. Since anxiety can contribute to IBS, they can make the trip easier., All you need to disclose is that you have a bowel disease. Note that you really need to go to the bathroom, and thank the person for being considerate. When you have a bathroom emergency, try handing it to the first person in line if you need to cut and don't have time to explain why., On the morning you're supposed to travel, pick a food that you know won't upset your stomach. Stick to something such as rice or applesauce. That way, you minimize your chances of having an accident., If you know things tend to loosen up in your bowels when you travel, try taking a medication before leaving to preemptively take care of the problem. For instance, you can take loperamide (Imodium) before leaving; just be sure you know how you react to these medications before you try taking them on a trip."
"
Position yourself near the restroom.,
Warn your flight attendant.,
Keep your spare change of clothes in your carry-on.",How to Travel with Symptoms of IBS2," When you're on a plane, choose an aisle seat near one of the restrooms. On a bus, call ahead to make sure your bus will have a restroom; when on the bus, pick a seat near the back, also on the aisle. Try to always be as close to the bathroom as you can to avoid accidents.You can request one of these seats on a plane when booking by phone. Additionally, many airlines let you look at the flight beforehand and switch seats.If you somehow end up away from the bathroom, you should discreetly inform a flight attendant about your health issue and ask if you can switch seats in order to be closer to the restroom.

, It can also help to tell your flight attendant about your condition. You don't need to be explicit, but you can say you have a medical condition that sometimes makes going to the bathroom urgent. That way, if you do run into a problem (such as a long line), the attendant can try to help., This advice is good for traveling, period. When packing for a plane trip, it's a good idea to always carry a spare change of clothes with you in your carry-on luggage. If your luggage is lost, you still have a change of clothes, which you may need.In addition, if you have a problem on the plane, you have something to change into. If possible, keep these with you even when you get off the plane, as you may run into trouble later."

Be the designated driver.,
Map out the route.,
Bring your own supply of toilet paper.,
Plan where you are going to eat along the way.",How to Travel with Symptoms of IBS3," If you do much of the driving, you have control over when you stop. Also, it may distract you from what's going on with your stomach, as well as take your mind off any stress you have ahead., If you look at your route, you can plan ahead of time for taking breaks. If you know a stretch of road is pretty barren, you can make sure you stop beforehand, for instance, as well as mark where rest stops and small towns are on you way., It's a common problem for public restrooms to be out of toilet paper. It's a good idea to carry your own supply of toilet paper or even a roll of toilet paper which you can use while traveling. Luckily, they have convenient travel packs now, which makes it easier to travel with your own.


You may also want to carry a bottle of antibacterial hand gel, in case the restroom doesn't have soap.
These supplies can also help if you must make an emergency stop on the side of the road.

, Before you embark on a trip, it's a good idea to do a little research into what kinds of restaurants are along the way. You can then plan for good meals that won't irritate your stomach instead of being stuck with food that can cause problems.


If you find that there are no suitable food options along the way, you should plan on packing your own meals.

All that means is you need to plan ahead and have coins on hand. Many travel sites can give you information on a country's restroom situation., While on your trip, it's probably best to avoid any foods that you know cause you problems. For instance, maybe you know caffeine is a problem; don't have coffee while you're away. Similarly, fatty foods and alcohol can also cause issues, so try to skip those, too., If you're in another country, learn the word for ""restroom"" or ""toilet."" If you're having trouble learning it, take a small flip book with you that has pictures to help others understand. You can use pictures or words in the country's language. You can also use this opportunity to provide information about your condition if you would prefer.When you need to find a restroom, you're likely going to need directions, and having something to help you communicate will get you there faster.


If certain foods upset your stomach, you should probably learn how to say those, and something simple such as ""I can't have these foods."" Alternatively, have those written on cards in the country's language if you can't memorize them yourself., If you're traveling with friends or family who don't know about your condition, you should probably let them know about your situation, so they will be willing to accommodate you. Many tour guides are also helpful if you let them know what's going on., Eating too much at once or too little throughout the day can make your bowel symptoms worse. Having snacks with you can help even out your food for the day. Smaller, consistent meals help you control your IBS symptoms.In addition, keep new foods to one per day, so that you don't upset your stomach too much, as you don't know if you will react to a new food yet., Carbonated beverages and alcohol may upset your stomach; however, Gatorade is also a safe bet, especially since it can help replenish electrolytes. Also, remember to drink bottled water in a country that doesn't have safe drinking water., Stress can make your IBS symptoms worse, so take some time to practice stress-relief. For instance, take some time out to meditate or practice yoga while you're on vacation. It'll help keep you calm and relaxed.Your meditation doesn't need to be elaborate. In fact, you can try a simple breathing meditation anywhere. Close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Breathe in deeply to the count of four, and breathe out to the count of four. Try to focus only on your breathing, releasing any worries you may have.

, This medication works by slowing your bowel movements. You can take it in tablet form, liquid form, or capsule form. It's probably easier to travel with capsule or tablet form, as they won't spill, though liquid can be handy if you don't have water nearby.Generally, you begin with a 4 milligram dose and take 2 milligrams with subsequent doses. For regular tablets, you shouldn't take more than 16 milligrams in a day, while with chewable tablets, you shouldn't take more than 8 milligrams., This drug works by increasing water in the intestine, helping to loosen stool.You can take 5 to 15 milliliters of milk of magnesia by mouth up to four times a day."

, Read warning labels (using your glasses, if you need them) before using.

, If you have a sore throat, go to a family doctor or a clinic. Emergency room charges are very high and you will want to use that service only in dire cases.

, You need to see a doctor who will find ways to treat you which do not involve overpriced medications which you may not need.

, Don’t hesitate to ask for a sample that you have a prescription for. Every little bit helps. However, keep in mind that the samples will be given mainly for expensive drugs. In many cases, cheap alternatives are available, and drug companies do not give free samples for drugs on which they don't stand to make a large profit.

, Meijer even offers some for free. Shopping online can also save up to twenty percent.

, Ask your doctor if he can prescribe your drug in a higher dosage so that you can cut your pills in half. This way you will get a double amount of dosages for the same price. However, not all pills can be split in this manner. Gel capsules and time release capsules cannot be split.

, Call hospitals and doctors offices before you show up for a procedure, and get the details of what the facility is going to charge you. This knowledge may help in negotiation of a better deal or to motivate you to search for a more affordable practitioner. At the very least, your doctor will be more price conscious if she knows that her patients are asking questions.

, Always ask the price before getting work. Once you learn the price, explain that you have no insurance and you would like to have a discount.

, Doctors are running to make a profit for their practice. Some more so than others. If a doctor is recommending extra tests or procedures, especially ones not covered by insurance, get a second opinion to see if these are necessary.

Learn the difference between fraud and abuse.,
Contact the OIG.,
Cooperate with any follow-up investigation.",How to Report Medicare Fraud2," If you find discrepancies on your claim form, check with your health care provider to make sure they aren't the result of an innocent error.


Keep your own records of the health care services and supplies you receive, and make sure your Medicare forms have the same information listed as you have in your own records.Clerical errors can be corrected and the health care provider can submit a new claim form to Medicare with updated entries., Before you report suspected fraud, make sure you have enough information for the OIG to make a full investigation.


The OIG needs names and identifying information about your health care provider, the services you question and the date those services supposedly were provided, and the payment amount approved by Medicare.You also must be prepared to provide your name and Medicare number along with the reasons you believe the amount was in error and should not have been paid., Having a basic understanding of what constitutes fraud can help you avoid making false accusations.


Abuse includes acts such as over-charging for services, or unbundling services, which happens when a health care provider charges separately for individual components of one service rather than the single charge for the service as a whole.Bending the rules constitutes abuse, whereas intentional deception may be fraud. The difference between the two is largely a matter of intent.You can report both abuse and fraud to the OIG; however, if you have no evidence of intentional deception, you should refrain from saying the acts were fraudulent.For example, a physician may deliberately submit claims to Medicare for a higher level of service than he actually provided, in an attempt to get more money from Medicare. This act constitutes fraud under the federal False Claims Act. Civil penalties for such a violation include fines from $5,000 to $10,000 per false claim. He also could face criminal penalties.Another type of fraud involves health care providers receiving money in exchange for making referrals to another health care providers. This violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it a crime for health care providers to willfully pay or receive kickbacks for items or services reimbursable by Medicare., The OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and organizations who engage in Medicare fraud and abuse, as well as impose civil penalties for certain violations.You can call the national fraud hotline at 1-800-MEDICARE to report fraud to the OIG.The OIG also has an online form you can fill out to report Medicare fraud. This form is available at https://forms.oig.hhs.gov/hotlineoperations/report-fraud-form.aspx.
When you report to the OIG, any identifying information you provide about yourself will remain confidential. The OIG won't tell your health care providers that you reported them. However, you also may enter your complaint anonymously.You can report to the OIG regardless of who you are. You don't have to be a Medicare beneficiary or a health care provider to file a fraud complaint.You also can report fraud by sending a written account through the mail to the HHS Office of the Inspector General at HHS Tips Hotline, PO Box 23489, Washington, DC 20026-3489 or to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at Medicare Beneficiary Contact Center, PO Box 39, Lawrence, KS 66044., Provided you didn't file your report anonymously, investigators may contact you with additional questions about your report.


While you make the decision whether to file your report anonymously, keep in mind that not including contact information may keep the OIG from completing a more comprehensive investigation since investigators cannot contact you if they hit a dead-end while reviewing your report and require further information.Your contact information is only shared within the federal Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of investigating your report. Public disclosure of your information is prohibited by federal law.Under certain conditions, you may be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000 if you make a specific report of Medicare fraud that leads to the recovery of $100 or more of Medicare money."

Be aware of symptoms that mean you have too much sodium in your body.,
Monitor any potassium deficiency you might have.,
Pay attention to muscle weakness as a sign of too much potassium.,
Look out for signs that your calcium levels may be low.,
Watch for symptoms that mean you have too much calcium in your body.,
Monitor low magnesium levels if you are in the hospital.,
Know that high magnesium levels are rarely seen in people outside of the hospital.",How to Remember Signs and Symptoms of Electrolyte Imbalances1," Sodium is one of the most common electrolytes in the body. When your electrolytes are balanced, you generally have 135-145 mmol/L of sodium in your blood. You get most of your sodium through salty foods that you eat. It makes sense then that when your sodium levels are too low, which is known as hyponatremia, you crave salty foods.Symptoms: You will crave salty foods. Other common symptoms include feeling really tired accompanied by muscle weakness, and increased urination.
When your sodium levels get extremely low, seizures may occur, as well as coma and an inability to breathe. These only happen in very extreme circumstances.;
, As stated above, you normally have 135-145 mmol/L of sodium in your blood. When your levels get above 145 mmol/L, it is known as hypernatremia. Losing water through vomiting, diarrhea and burns can cause this condition. You can also get too much sodium when you don’t drink enough water or you eat too much salty food.Symptoms: You will begin craving water and your mouth will feel very dry. You may notice that your muscles start twitching, you feel irritable, and you have difficulty breathing.
When you have severely high amounts of sodium in your blood, you may have convulsions or decreased levels of consciousness.

, 98% of your body’s potassium is found inside cells and your blood normally contains 3.5-5 mmol/L of potassium. Potassium promotes healthy skeletal and muscle movement, as well as healthy contractions of the heart. Hypokalemia is when you don’t have enough potassium in your body and your levels drop below 3.5 mmol/L. This can happen when you sweat too much while exercising, or if you are taking diuretics or laxatives.Symptoms: You will feel really fatigued and weak. You may also experience constipation, leg cramps, and decreased tendon reflexes.
When your potassium levels drop to a severe level, you may experience an irregular heartbeat, which is also known as arrhythmia.

, You will generally only develop high levels of potassium if you have an underlying disease like renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus.



Symptoms: You will feel really weak because low potassium levels cause muscle weakness. You might also feel tingling and numbness in your muscles. In some cases, you might also develop mental confusion.
Severely high levels of potassium can cause irregular heartbeats that could, if extreme enough, lead to a heart attack.

, Calcium may be the most widely advertised electrolyte (got milk, anyone?) It is found in most dairy products and strengthens your bones and teeth. Normally, you have between 2.25-2.5 mmol/L of calcium in your blood. When your levels drop below this, you develop hypocalcemia.



Symptoms: Hypocalcemia can cause muscle cramps and tremors. Your bones can become brittle and weak.
You may start feeling irregular heartbeats or develop seizures if your calcium levels stay low for a long period of time.

, When your calcium levels spike above 2.5 mmol/L, you develop hypercalcemia. Your parathyroid hormone in your body helps to create calcium in your body. When your parathyroid becomes overactive (a condition called hyperparathyroidism), you have too much calcium in your body. This can also be brought on by immobilization.Symptoms: Hypercalcemia that is not to far about the normal levels of calcium generally doesn’t have any symptoms. However, as your calcium levels increase, you might develop weakness, bone pain, and constipation.
In severe cases, you might develop renal stones if your high levels of calcium go untreated.

, Magnesium is the fourth most abundant electrolyte in your body. The average human body contains 24 grams of magnesium, 53% of which is located in your bones. Hypomagnesemia generally only occurs in people who are in the hospital and is rarely found in nonhospitalized people.



Symptoms: Symptoms include slight tremors, disorientation, and difficulty swallowing.
Severe symptoms include difficulty breathing, anorexia, and convulsions.

, Hypermagnesemia is when you have too much magnesium in your body. This is very rarely seen and is mostly found in people who are in the hospital. Dehydration, bone carcinoma, hormone imbalances, or renal failure are some of the most common causes of hypermagnesemia.



Symptoms: Your skin might become flushed and warm. You might also experience decreased reflexes, weakness, and vomiting.
Severe symptoms include coma, paralysis, and respiratory depression. The slowing of your heartbeat may also occur.

You most likely just need to get some salty foods into your system so sit down and eat something. Mild symptoms are almost always caused by the fact that you haven’t eaten any salty foods recently. You can also drink electrolyte-rich drinks like Gatorade.



Sodium-rich foods: Table salt, baking soda, soups, powdered broths, soy sauce, salami, bacon, caviar, and cheese.However, if you are having difficulty breathing, call an ambulance.

, Sit down and drink a glass of water. Most symptoms associated by high sodium levels are caused by eating too many salty foods. Drink lots of water until you feel hydrated again. Vomiting can also cause hypernatremia, so treat the reason behind your vomiting and be careful with what you eat.


If you start having convulsions, you should call an ambulance.

, If your potassium shortage is caused by sweating too much or vomiting, drink fluids that will rehydrate you. If you are exercising when you begin to feel symptoms, stop, sit down, and drink some electrolyte-rich drink like Powerade. If you are experiencing cramping, stretch the cramp out. You can also replace potassium by eating potassium-rich foods.



Potassium-rich foods: White beans, spinach, baked potatoes, dried apricots, acorn squash, yogurt, salmon, white mushrooms, and bananas.If you are experiencing severe irregular heartbeats, go to the hospital.

, If you are only experiencing the less severe symptoms, drink lots of water and stop eating foods rich in potassium for a couple of days. However, high potassium levels are almost always caused by a kidney disease. You will need to treat the disease to bring your potassium levels down. Talk to your doctor right away about what you can do to treat your condition.If you have a history of heart diseases and are experiencing irregular heartbeats, call for medical assistance.

, Mild to moderate symptoms can generally be treated by eating foods that have high amounts of calcium. You can also increase your vitamin D, a vitamin that enhances how your body uses calcium, by standing out in the sun for 30 minutes before 8 am. Standing in the sun after 8 am without protection can create its own health problems. You can also take vitamin D supplements. If you are experiencing cramps, stretch the muscle out and massage your muscle.



Calcium-rich foods: milk, yogurt, cheese, broccoli, okra, red kidney beans, chick peas, hazelnuts, salmon, and white rice.If you are experiencing irregular heartbeats and other severe symptoms, call an ambulance.

, If you are just experiencing the mild symptoms, you should drink plenty of water and eat fiber-rich foods to help with any constipation you may be going through. You should avoid eating foods that have high calcium content. Increased levels of calcium are generally caused by hyperparathyroidism, which will need to be treated before you can decrease your calcium levels. Talk to your doctor about options.If your calcium levels are due to immobilization, encourage yourself to move or ask someone to help you get some exercise.

, Because low magnesium levels pretty much only happen to people in the hospital, most hospitals will give you magnesium supplements. If you happen to be experiencing low levels of magnesium outside of the hospital, buy antacids that contain magnesium and take them by following the directions on the box. You can also eat foods with high magnesium contents.Magnesium-rich foods: leafy greens, sesame seeds, brazil nuts, almonds, mackerel, soy beans, quinoa, brown rice, avocados, bananas, and dried figs., The first step is to rehydrate yourself. You should also limit the amount of magnesium-rich foods that you eat. If you are experiencing flushed or warm skin, move yourself to a cool area or hold an ice pack to any areas that are especially hot.

Check out drawing and puzzle exercises.,
Do eye exercises.,
Have an eye massage or hot/cold compress.,
Rehab lost vision through balloon tossing.,
Try using computer exercises.,
Attempt the benchmark exercise.",How to Rehab Vision Post Stroke1," Some partial vision loss due to stroke may be reversed by retraining the brain through vigorous eye exercises. These exercises are now becoming a routine part of physical therapy. The following exercise may be helpful in improving vision after stroke.


Hold a pencil or anything similar in front of the patient’s eyes at a distance of 18 inches (45.7 cm).
Then, move the pencil up and down and side to side, and ask the patient not to move his head while tracking the pencil by moving only the eyes.
Place a pencil in front of the patient’s face and move it towards and away from the nose and ask the patient to watch it carefully. The patients eyes should move inward.
Hold pencils in each hand, one in the left hand and the other in the right hand. Move the hands so that one hand is closer to the eyes and the other hand is further from eyes. Let the patients guess which pen is closer to the eyes and which is not.;
, Try drawing some common objects and shapes and ask the patient to complete the shapes. Also, the patient should play word finding or word completing games and also puzzle games. These games will improve vision by retraining the brain to identify objects using vision.

, Strengthening your eye muscles will improve muscle memory and aid in the tracking of objects. This will improve muscle tone that may have been lost due to your stroke.


Try keeping three of your fingers on your upper eyelid, and try to close your eye. This exercise will make your ocular muscle stronger.
This exercise will improve your vision, prevent eye strain, and provide relief from stress.
However, the permanent structural damage in the vision area of brain is not getting any recovery during these exercises.

, Massage your eyes with a cold and hot compress. This will promote relaxation and have a soothing effect because warmth promotes relaxation and improves blood circulation.


Soak one towel in cold water and one in warm water. Alternate them for a minute a piece, for 5 to 10 minutes.
Massaging the eyelids can also be useful.

, Try tossing a balloon back and forth with the assistance of a partner, making sure that the balloon moves to and from the affected side of the body. This exercise facilitates the retraining of the brain, to synchronize movement with vision. It can also help to stimulate the eye and body movement of the affected side to remedy visual problems.

, A special type of computerized eye exercise can be utilized by stroke victims to help regain vision. Each day, the patient is instructed to stare at a black square on a computer screen. During specified intervals, a cluster of 100 small dots are flashed on the side of the screen corresponding to the affected eye. These exercises help retrain the brain in order to help stroke patients see again.


The procedure may last 15 to 30 minutes per day over several months.

, The benchmark exercise is used to verify the scope of visual focus damage caused by a stroke. Performing the exercise will allow a medical professional to better determine the extent of therapy needed.


The procedure starts by asking the patient to close their eyes.
They are then instructed to look toward the side of the body affected by stroke.
Once the patient deems that his eyes are pointed toward the proper direction, they are advised to open their eyes.
The specialist will then determine how close the patient's stare is to the proper direction.
The gathered information is used to develop an accurate visual therapy exercise for the stroke patient.

Check out compensatory vision therapy.,
Try restorative vision therapy.,
Look into the use of prisms.,
Invest in a low vision aid.,
Consider eye muscle surgery.",How to Rehab Vision Post Stroke2," Compensatory vision therapy focuses on stimulating the brain area involved in vision. It includes training with prisms, scanning, and visual field awareness systems. The movement of images from a non-seeing site to a seeing-site helps adapt the visual field and the associated brain area, improving vision.

, The goal of restorative vision therapy is to stimulate the various neural connections involved in vision within brain. It includes many specific components for each type of vision impairment that occurs after stroke. It focuses particularly on the point of the eye which has the highest amount of neuronal connections.


This therapy has the highest level of recovery potential.

, Prisms are used to correct different types of visual problems. The kind of prism and their placement may vary, depending upon the presenting signs and symptoms. For example:


In the case of double vision, the prism is placed on a glass lens to realign the abnormal positioning of the eye's gaze.
In the case of visual neglect, an individual with visual neglect on the left side of his visual field would use a prism that can mirror items on his left side, to the right side of his visual field.

, Low vision aids are designed to help the partially sighted population. They are divided into three categories, including optical aids (hand held magnifiers, stand magnifiers, telescopes), non optical aids (enlarged prints, high intensity lamps, high contrast objects, microfiche readers), and electronic low vision aids (closed circuit TV, opaque projectors, slide projection). All of these things can greatly help your vision.


Some other aids are tactile visual aids, auditory vision, spelled speech, and direct stimulation of visual cortex.

, Surgery is usually not an option to solve post stroke related visual problems, since the cause is not a physical trauma to the eye. However, in some instances. surgery can be recommended to correct double vision. Eye muscle surgery is usually helpful for cases of double vision caused by the narrowing of the eyes.


The procedure can help in re-positioning of the eyes.
The decision to undergo surgery should be done with an extensive assessment of the benefits and the possible risks.

Change the floor covering.,
Make the staircase more accessible.,
Ensure the safety of furniture.,
Install laser detection units.",How to Rehab Vision Post Stroke3," Changing the floor covering, such as from tile to carpet, can help stroke sufferers. Using different materials to distinguish different areas alters the sound produced by foot steps and announces the arrival of other person.


Additionally, the change in sound can help a stroke sufferer identify the room they are in.

, Changes to the design of the staircase can enable a stroke sufferer to move up and down the stairs with ease. Visual aids that help differentiate steps are important to allow the stroke sufferer to climb safely.


The visibility of individual stairs can be enhanced by alternating black and white steps.
Additional assistance can be given with the installation of handrails.

, Place furniture in unobtrusive places, such as along walls. This will allow the stroke sufferer to avoid the furniture without having to memorize complex patterns of placement.


Furniture edges should be curved rather than sharp.
Keep sticks along the walls for guidance.
Room furniture should be colorful to attract attention.

, Nowadays, you can install laser detection units that connect to auditory and tactile signaling devices. These devices serve to warn a patient about obstacles and hazards. Three laser beams come out from the handle of device, in three different directions: upward, downward, and parallel to the surface, respectively.


The device vibrates on your index finger to give you an idea about different obstacles in your path.

Keep a journal of your medical problems and treatments.Bring it with you when you visit a doctor. You shouldn't put off seeing a doctor for something that might be serious to work on the journal, but the journal will help you remember the details of what to tell the doctor about all of your problems and help you keep track of them for more effective follow-up. In one section, or, if you prefer, a section for each problem, keep a diary of each of your problems. Describe the problem and any changes you notice, being as detailed and precise as possible. For pain, write down how severe it was on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being the worst possible pain you have ever experienced) and how long it lasted. For problems you can see, like a mark or lump, measure and draw or take a picture. If you try a remedy, write down what you did and how it worked. Date every entry. In another section, list your medications, the dates you began and finished taking them, the doses and frequencies, and any side-effects you may have experienced. Include anything that seems at all like a drug, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter drugs, supplements, vitamins, and special diets. Review your journal before any doctor's appointment.

As an example, here's how to keep a ""headache diary"".
You could keep the journal on a computer, and even have it automatically transcribed from dictation into your phone.If you're at all unsure about how to describe a drug, bring the doctor the bottle (keep the pills in it to avoid dangerous confusion).


Document your discussion. The next time you see your doctor, for whatever reason, discuss the problems in your journal. Mention the drugs, too, so the doctor can tell if any of them are inappropriate or could cause problems for a particular course of treatment. Write down the diagnosis and treatment plan in your journal. Go over these with your doctor to make sure you understand them. A separate section for doctors' advice, with each entry dated, would help you make sure to keep up with this important information.

Make a file to save any papers your doctor or other healthcare providers such as pharmacies give you, too.


Ask for more time. When making the appointment with the doctor, let the office know if you have lots to discuss with the doctor and to give you a longer time-slot. This shouldn’t require bigger co-pay, but does give them a heads-up for scheduling, so you can be sure to get all of the issues at hand discussed.

With so much to discuss, your doctor will surely appreciate your being on time. Try to arrive early.

;
, During your time with the doctor, tell him if any medications you take may need refilling soon, and ask if they have samples. Sometimes the doctor will have free promotional samples for you.

, Often a drug is available in generic form (the same drug, from a different maker) at low cost, or there is a less expensive substitute available (which could be less expensive for reasons having nothing to do with its effectiveness, or not relevant to your particular problem). These generally don't come with slick promotional materials or samples, but with the savings you won't mind.

, When scheduling a well check-up that requires labs, have the doctor’s office send you the lab slip so you can go in the week before (or when they advise) to have the lab samples taken. By the time you see the doctor the results should be ready to consider at that visit.

, Health insurance provides peace of mind by covering most medical expenses that may come up. But adverse selectionand moral hazard, can make individual health insurance, in particular, very expensive. Perhaps as importantly - or more importantly for routine care - health insurance companies compensate for individuals' lack of bargaining powerwith healthcare providers by negotiating large discounts from often-high list prices.Though an inexpensive policy won't pay as much of your expenses as a costly one, it may reduce the amount to be paid just as well.
There are also ""medical discount plans""that provide discounts only, and religious associations that share medical costs on an ongoing basis without any guarantees. These arrangements are not regulated like insurance, so if you're considering one, do your research to make sure that it is what it claims to be and that it is what you want.


You can try negotiating discounts from health care providers yourself, too, upfrontor when you find you can't pay them.
Governments sometimes subsidize health care for the poor. Find out if you're eligible.

Understand how acupressure may be used to relieve pain.,
Know that acupressure is not a proven technique for relieving pain.,
Learn the correct technique for applying pressure.,
Take certain safety precautions before trying acupressure.,
Consider seeing a professional acupressurist.,
Apply pressure to the forehead to relieve eye strain and headaches.,
Relieve neck pain by stimulating a point on your hand.,
Ease stomach pain and abdominal cramps by stimulating points on the palm.,
Find pressure points on your legs and feet to target leg pain, back pain and migraines.",How to Relieve Pain Using Pressure Points," Pressure points are located along certain pathways in the body, called meridians. Those who practice acupressure believe that your body’s energy flows through these meridians and a balance is maintained between positive energy and negative energy.When this balance is disturbed, you become ill or feel pain. The aim of acupressure and acupuncture is to restore the energy balance in these meridians by manipulating specific points.;
, These techniques have been practiced for thousands of years but many experts question the existence of such energies and meridians. The thought that these positive and negative energies exist is still debated, but many people firmly believe in the ability of acupressure to relieve pain., It is important to apply deep probing pressure to stimulate an acupressure point. You can use your finger tip, knuckle or even a pencil eraser. Apply pressure for 15 to 30 seconds at your desired point. Repeat using the same point on the other side of your body. You should feel immediate relief once you have stopped applying the pressure.Sometimes points on opposite sides of the body will have different effects. If symptoms increase by pressing the opposite point, then do not press that side or point.
You should ideally find a quiet place, sit or lie down, and relax. Avoid loud music, exercise, food, drugs or alcohol while stimulating your acupressure points.

, Acupressure cannot replace standard emergency procedures or licensed medical treatment. If you are seriously injured or have persistent symptoms, seek urgent medical treatment. To ensure safety, make sure that you:


Do not use acupressure as the only treatment for illness. Consult your physician too if you are sick.
Do not do acupressure just before or within 20 minutes after heavy exercise, a large meal, or bathing.
Do not apply physical pressure on a point if it is under a mole, wart, varicose vein, abrasion, bruise, cut, or any other break in the skin.

, Although you can do acupressure yourself, acupressure practitioners do exist. An acupressure session is typically performed with the patient lying on a massage table. A typical session may take 45 to 90 minutes.


During the session acupressure points may be manipulated with various rhythms and pressures, using the fingers, hands, arms, elbows, and even legs and feet.
You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing, and breath slowly, fully and deeply as the practitioner presses upon specific pressure points.

, This can be done by pressing the point between your eyes. This pressure point is found between the eyebrows at the dip of the area where the nasal bone connects to the forehead.Place the tip of your thumb into this point and gently stroke upward for thirty seconds to one minute.
You may have to repeat this process three to four times to get full relief.

, This point is found between the index and middle finger of each hand, just below the knuckle on the back of the hand.


Place your thumb on top of this point and the index finger below the point. Then squeeze and press upward on the palm side for a minute or two. You should feel some relief from neck strain and pain.

, A number of pressure points found on the palm can relieve different kinds of pains. Stomach pain can be relieved by pressing a pressure point in the middle of the palm along the crease.


Abdominal cramps can be relieved by pressing a pressure point found at the base of the thumb, directly below the middle finger. These points should be pressed for a minute or two to get proper relief.

, Knee pain can be relieved by pressing firmly behind the knee. Press into the meat of the top of the calf muscle to help relieve stiffness in the legs.Pain in the lower back can be relieved by pressing a point just beneath the ankle joint.
Migraine pain can be relieved by pressing into the skin at the base of the joint of the big toe and second toe.

Bring someone along who can be your advocate.,
Carry your identification and health insurance info with you.,
Don't be overbearing to medical staff.,
See if you can book online.",How to Reduce Wait Time in the Emergency Room1," If you are seriously injured and decide to go to the ER department, consider bringing a friend or family member who understands your situation and can clearly communicate to the staff. This is particularly important if English is not your native language and/or there is a good chance of losing consciousness. Clear, precise, polite communication will save precious time when dealing with hospital registration and ER medical personnel.


Head injuries often lead to confusion, loss of consciousness, dizziness and severe headaches — all of which hamper your ability to think and communicate clearly.Hospitals often employ people who are multilingual, but don't rely on the ER department being able to accommodate your native language or understand your cultural customs.;
, The vast majority of ER departments insist on inputting your personal information and registering you before you can see a nurse or doctor for medical attention. This approach is often an inefficient method for people with life-threatening injuries, but you can make the process smoother and quicker by having your identification, relevant medical history and health insurance information (if applicable) ready or handy to show.


Be prepared to fill out some forms and write legibly. If your writing hand is injured, then you may have to rely on a friend or family member for assistance.
To save time, bring your own pen.
Interestingly, it's not uninsured Americans who are the greatest ER users — it’s Medicaid recipients who show up five times more often than adults with private insurance (2007 data)., Despite being in pain, stressed and/or potentially frustrated with waiting times, refrain from being rude, verbally abusive or overbearing to the ER staff. Hospital staff is trained in how to deal with people who are injured or sick, but they only have so much patience. If you turn the ER staff against you with your negative behavior, that might trigger an increase in your waiting time or reduce the quality and/or quantity of medical attention you receive. Use respect and be courteous at all times.


ER departments can't turn any life-threatening situation away by law, but sometimes human nature isn't always empathetic or sympathetic.Remember, ER personnel see a high volume of extremely graphic human injuries. They are here to treat you efficiently — this does not always include sympathy.
Make sure to sit as close to the registration desk as you can while you wait (without being annoying) so you don't miss your name being called. Have your advocate stay on the alert for you if you are too injured to do so.

, Due to the increase in computer/cellphone usage, digital communication and wireless networks these days, online scheduling for various business appointments is gaining popularity and it has the potential to significantly reduce ER waiting times also.As such, research if your local ER department is set up to take online booking, and then consider making an appointment when an emergency arises. For the truly life-threatening conditions (such as heart attack or stroke), don't bother with this and call 911 or go straight to the emergency room.


Online scheduling may be most practical for people who need to travel long distances to an ER department.
If and when ""ER booking apps"" become widespread, then that will likely greatly increase online scheduling.
Technologies can be deployed in hospitals that monitor and report on ER room waiting times, which could be accessed by patients online. That way, you could view wait times before deciding to go to the ER.
If your local ER department isn't set up for online booking, then try to simply call ahead. The hospital may make an appointment over the phone much like a restaurant takes a reservation for dinner.
In the case of life-threatening emergencies, ask a level-headed advocate call the ER to alert them of the incoming situation. The ER can prepare for your arrival and make sure you get immediate attention. Be sure this person gives the staff an estimated time of arrival.

Redirect non-emergency patients to other caregivers.,
Change patient flow within the ER.,
Stop the practice of boarding ER patients.,
Schedule more staff during peak times.",How to Reduce Wait Time in the Emergency Room2," Studies show that a large percentage of ER patients (in some hospitals it approaches 50%) arrive with a non-urgent care need — in other words, their injury or problem is not a life-threatening emergency.These patients take up time and hospital personnel to triage (diagnose and prioritize treatment), which makes ER waits dangerously long for those with really serious injuries. As such, once ER personnel diagnose a condition as non-urgent, they should quickly educate the patient on appropriate use of ER services and then re-route them to caregivers in other hospitals and clinics.


Some patients prefer going to the ER regardless of their injury because they're open 24-hours, contain board-certified emergency practitioners, move people through relatively quickly (usually within a few hour) and they can't turn anyone away by law.
Consider an urgent care clinic if your issues aren't life-threatening.
It's estimated that between 14% and 27% of all ER visits in the U.S. could be handled at non-emergency clinics and health centers., Greeting, registering, examining and then prioritizing a patient and their injury (triaging) can be time consuming, especially if an ER department is under-staffed and/or run inefficiently. Changing patient flow by having a nurse or physician examining a patient in triage shortly after their arrival to the ER can dramatically speed up encounters, weed out the non-urgent cases and reduce throughput times for patients who have life-threatening injuries.According to 2009 data, patients who needed to be seen in less than 14 minutes to have the best chance of survival were being seen in twice that amount of time (37 minutes) — ER waits are estimated to be even longer in more recent years.Registering patients at their bedsides can reduce ER wait times also. Names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. don't necessarily need to be collected before caregivers assess a patient's injury and triage them.

, One of the biggest causes of crowding and wait times in ER departments is ""boarding"" — a term used to describe holding patients in waiting rooms until an ER bed becomes available.Instead of making patients sit in the waiting area until an ER bed opens up, place them in empty beds in other departments within the hospital or wheel extra beds into nearby hallways. This strategy helps ease overcrowding by dispersing the concentration of emergency patients throughout the hospital.


Some hospitals hold admitted ER patients for hours while waiting for beds to become free. This creates logjams, makes waiting uncomfortable and can endanger lives.
The problem is sometimes exacerbated by financial incentive — hospitals can often charge health insurance companies more if the patient spends time in certain wards or units of the hospital (ICU and ER beds are typically the most expensive to stay in).

, It's not too difficult to use basic predictive programming (such as time of year, day of week, time of day, local weather conditions) to estimate how busy it might be at any given time. During shifts that have a high probability of being busier than normal, hospitals should schedule more staff to accommodate the anticipated patients in order to keep ER wait times reasonable and safe. At the very least, more specialists can be put on-call ""just in case."" Unfortunately, reduced funding and cut-backs often lead to under-staffing and even entire ER closures. For example, over the last 15 years, the number of ER departments in the U.S. has declined by 10%.Triaging doesn't need to be done exclusively by ER physicians (who are often in short supply). Physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners can readily be trained to triage ER patients and reduce the likelihood of bottlenecks developing.
In addition to medical personnel who triage and treat ER patients, various support staff and lab technicians are needed to take x-rays, run blood tests and conduct other diagnostic tests.

Bring along a trusted friend.,
Spend some time educating yourself.,
Pack supplies to take notes.,
Come prepared with a list of questions and medications.,
Know your medical history.,
Take notes.,
Ask your doctor to confirm what you’ve been told.,
Ask questions.,
Ask the doctor to write down key information.,
Write down what your doctor told you.,
Review the notes you took.,
Call your doctor’s office for clarification.",How to Remember What Your Doctor Tells You After an Appointment," It can be helpful and comforting to bring a trusted friend or relative with you to your doctor’s appointment, especially if you are very ill or if you are worried that you might get some bad news.Additionally, that friend can listen to and/or take notes during your appointment. A friend acts as a second set of eyes and ears. This reduces patient-provider miscommunication.;
, If you have been newly diagnosed with a disease, disorder, or other health condition, it can be helpful to spend some time educating yourself about the diagnosis. Though you shouldn’t believe everything you read on the internet, having a bit of background knowledge can make it easier to understand anything your doctor tells you. You could also go to a local library to see if there are any books on the subject, or search the internet for local support groups that might be able to provide information.If you are looking for a local support group (or even an online one, which can also be useful) try searching for “online support groups” and the name of your health condition or “support group” plus the name of your town or city and the name of your condition.
If you look for your information on the internet, try to use websites that are associated with a well-known hospital. For example, the MayoClinic website offers a lot of useful (and credible) information on various health conditions. Additionally, you can also look for websites that are created by supporting organizations. For example, if you have been diagnosed with a disease such as cancer, you can use the American Cancer Society’s website (www.cancer.org) to search for credible information.

, Don’t assume that your doctor will have a spare pen and piece of paper to take notes with. Bring along a pen or pencil and a notepad to write down what your doctor tells you. You might also consider taking notes on your smartphone, but for most people, it is quicker and easier to simply write down the key points on paper.


It is not necessary, but to be polite, you might begin your appointment by asking your doctor if it is alright if you take notes so that you can remember everything later. It is highly unlikely that any respectable doctor would have a problem with this, but it is courteous to confirm that it is ok with them.

, It is a great idea to bring in a list of all the medications, herbal supplements, and vitamins you are taking. It is very important that your doctor is aware of everything you are taking, and it can be easy to forget about one or two medications when asked to list them from memory. Be sure to write down how often you take the medication, the dosage, and how long you have been taking the medication.It is important to know why you have been prescribed the medication. Prescription medications are often prescribed for more than what the Food and Drug Administration has approved.Alternatively, many doctors recommend simply bringing all of your medications with you in a bag. The labels on medications often contain important information that you might not think to write down.You should also write down any allergies that you have, or any past reactions you have had to medications.
Bring a separate list for yourself that contains any questions or concerns that you want to discuss with the doctor. You may think that you’ll remember all of your questions, but chances are, you’ll forget one or two of them, especially if you’re also trying to remember everything the doctor is telling you.
Today’s managed care environment limits the time you have to spend face-to-face with your physician. Good organization and preparation can also help decrease stress and help you make the most of your time.

, If you have copies of medical records available from outside facilities, bring those with you to your appointment. It is also important to know about any serious health conditions that run in your family. A history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and so on can be helpful so your doctor knows what to look out for and if you are at increased risk.

, You don’t need to write down what your doctor is saying word-for-word. Instead, just jot down the things that sound important to you. For example, write down the name of any health conditions that your doctor mentions. Write down medications you need to take, and how long you should take them for. Write down questions that come into your head.Ask your doctor to spell out or write down any words that are important, but that you aren’t familiar with.
You can take your notes on your pre-made list of questions and concerns that you’ve brought in. If your doctor answers a question you had on your list (whether or not you’ve asked it yet), write down the relevant information underneath the question.

, When your doctor has explained something to you, try to summarize what they have said and repeat it back to them. In some cases, you may think you understand perfectly what your doctor is telling you, but after repeating it back to them, you might find that you missed an important bit of information. Even a small misunderstanding could potentially make a huge difference.For example, let's say that your doctor has instructed you on how to take a new medication being prescribed to you. From what the doctor has told you, you understand that you are to take your medicine two times a day for three weeks; however, when you repeat what you think you have heard back to your doctor, it turns out you are supposed to take the medication three times a day for two weeks.

, In your appointment, your doctor will likely want to explain everything that is going on as clearly as they can. While this is good, it can make it difficult to remember everything, especially if you come across things you don’t understand. This is why it is important to ask questions and clarify new information during the appointment instead of trying to remember to look it up later.For example, if your doctor explains that you have hyperthyroidism, but you have no idea what that means, then simply say that. For example, “Doctor, I haven’t heard of hyperthyroidism before. Could you explain what that means?” You should also ask them to spell it out for you if you’re not sure how to spell it. This way, you can also look the word up on your own later, if you like.
Always ask for copies of diagnostic records such as lab work or x-ray results. Many medical offices offer lab diagnostics online through a secure website. Ask if that option is available.

, If for some reason, you are unable to take notes yourself, and you were not able to bring along a trusted friend or family member, politely ask your doctor if they can make a list of key points. If it is not obvious why you can’t do this yourself, politely explain.


For example, if you are unable to write because of severe arthritis, you could say, “I’m sorry doctor, but it’s very painful for me to write because of my arthritis. Would you mind making a simple list of important points that I can go through on my own after the appointment?” If the doctor agrees, make sure you thank them for going out of their way for you. Alternatively, the doctor may be able to send you their own notes from the appointment to help you.

, If you weren’t able to take notes during the appointment, try to jot down what you remember as soon as possible. It doesn’t have to be perfectly written to start off with. The idea is simply to get the information out of your head and onto a piece of paper. You can then go back through what you’ve written to pick out what is important, and perhaps reorganize the information so that it is clearer.


This can also be helpful if you are very worried or anxious about the things your doctor has said. This practice of writing down what your doctor has said not only serves to help you remember what the doctor told you, but it can also serve as a way to get your thoughts in order. Thus, you shouldn’t be afraid to also write down any emotions or thoughts you are experiencing at the moment.

, If you took notes, if a friend took notes, or if the doctor wrote down everything for you, be sure to go over these notes as soon as you get home. This way, you can see if there is anything that doesn’t make sense. If the notes were taken by someone else, try to go over the notes with them there. If necessary, rewrite the notes in your own words to make them easier to understand later on.


It may also be a good idea to make a to-do list of things that you need to take care of. For example, if your doctor has diagnosed you with a medical condition, you might want to do some internet research on your own to better understand your diagnosis.On your to-do list, you could write down, “Learn about my diagnosis.” If your doctor has prescribed you many medications, you could write something like, “sort medications into a pill box.”
If your appointment resulted in stressful or shocking information, going through your notes and writing down things you need to do can help give you a perspective on where to begin learning to manage your condition.

, After going over what you’ve been told, if you find that there is something that you feel you’ve forgotten or something you don’t understand completely, don’t hesitate to call your doctor for clarification.


It’s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to medical advice. Don’t feel like you’re being a nuisance by calling. Simply explain that you want to double check what you’ve written down to make sure that you understand correctly. Be polite with the person you speak with, and they’ll likely be happy to help you.

Recognize signs and symptoms that may be suspicious of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).HL is a cancer of a certain type of immune cell or white blood cell that resides in the lymph nodes (hence the term lymp-oma, meaning lymph node cancer).,
Watch for reddish bumps on the skin.,
Observe for a large red lesion on your skin.,
Take note of any generalized cancer symptoms.Things to look for include unexpected weight loss (of 10% or more over the past six months), drenching night sweats (requiring you to change your bed sheets), and/or an unexplained fever of over 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit).",How to Reduce Lymphoma Risk with Psoriasis1," HL typically presents as one or more enlarged lymph nodes. These may occur anywhere in the body, such as in the neck, above the collarbone, in the armpit, or in the groin.


Enlarged lymph nodes may also occur for other reasons, such as an infection, so it does not necessarily mean that there is cancer present.
However, if the enlarged lymph node persists, or you notice it continuing to grow, especially if it is hard, fixed, and immobile, seek professional medical evaluation immediately.;
, It is key to look out for for signs and symptoms that may be suspicious of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) – MF type.The MF (Mycosis fungoides) subtype of CTCL typically presents as reddish bumps on the skin. These may have a variety of appearances, from flat, to patch-like, to scaly (resembling psoriasis), to nodular.

, It is also important to watch for signs and symptoms that may be worrisome for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) – Sezary type.The Sezary type of CTCL is the more severe version (a step up from the Mycosis fungoides type). It is also known as the ""red man syndrome,"" because the entire skin becomes like one great big red lesion. It is very severe and warrants immediate medical attention.

, If you are experiencing any of the above (called ""B-symptoms""), they are ""red flag"" symptoms for a possible cancer and warrant immediate medical attention.

"
"
See your physician if you have any reason to suspect a possible lymphoma.If you notice a suspicious lymph node, a concerning lesion on your skin, or generalized ""red flags"" signs of possible cancer, you will want to book an immediate appointment with your doctor.,
Proceed with your regular psoriasis medications.It is key to note that there is no current evidence to alter your psoriasis medications as a means to reduce your risk of developing lymphoma.,
Opt for regular skin screening by a physician.",How to Reduce Lymphoma Risk with Psoriasis2," You may even be sent to see a skin specialist (a dermatologist) to more carefully examine the area of concern and to perform diagnostic tests as needed.


To diagnose CTCL, a skin biopsy will suffice. A skin biopsy can differentiate between psoriasis lesions and lesions that are a possible cutaneous lymphoma (CTCL).
A lymph node biopsy will be needed to rule in or rule out the presence of cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma) in a suspicious lymph node.
Note that you may need to receive multiple evaluations (skin biopsies, and/or lymph node biopsies) if the initial biopsies are inconclusive.
Sometimes the diagnosis of cancer (lymphoma) becomes more obvious on biopsies over time, so follow your physician's recommendations and receive appropriate follow-up tests as needed.

, The heightened risk of lymphoma is thought to be more likely related to the underlying disease process of psoriasis, rather than to the medical treatments.It is possible that some of the immunosuppressive therapies of psoriasis may heighten your risk of lymphoma;however, at this point, the evidence is insufficient to recommend changes to your psoriasis medication regime.

, If you are concerned about your risk for lymphoma, you can ask your doctor about coming in for periodic ""cancer screening"" exams. This may include a complete evaluation of your skin lesions, to ensure that all of them are related to psoriasis and not to a possible cancer, as well as an examination of your lymph nodes. This would not necessarily find a lymphoma if it was in a more deep lymph node that was not right under the skin, however, such as lymph nodes near the lungs or in the abdomen.

"
"
Receive appropriate treatment if you are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).The mainstay of treatment for most cases of HL is chemotherapy.,
Discuss the treatment options for CTCL with your doctor.In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), there are a variety of treatment strategies that may be tried.,
Continue with your psoriasis treatments unless otherwise recommended by your doctor.",How to Reduce Lymphoma Risk with Psoriasis3," In some cases, radiation is given as a treatment for localized cases of HL that have not spread systemically throughout the body (i.e. where only one or a few lymph nodes appear to be affected, but the cancer is not widespread). Radiation may be given alone, or in combination with chemotherapy.


A stem cell transplant may be considered as a form of treatment in severe cases of HL, or in recurrent cases that are unresponsive to initial treatment.

, These range from topical treatments applied directly to the skin lesion(s), to phototherapy for the affected area, to localized radiation, to full-body chemotherapy, among other things.


The best treatment for you, if you are in fact diagnosed with CTCL, will depend upon the extent of the cancer (and whether it is localized to a single skin lesion, or whether it has begun to spread throughout your body).

, Depending upon the type of cancer treatment you receive for your lymphoma, you may need to temporarily stop (or reduce) your psoriasis treatments; however, if they are stopped (for instance, during an intense period of chemotherapy), you will most likely be able to resume them following completion of the treatment.

Recognize your risk for throat cancer.,
Determine possible symptoms.,
Examine your throat for lumps and irregularities.,
Watch for pain or bleeding.,
Talk to your partner or spouse.,
Visit your doctor.,
Undergo tests for a definitive diagnosis.,
Receive treatment.,
Avoid tobacco and alcohol.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Throat Cancer," Doctors know that throat cancer is caused by a genetic mutation in the cells of the throat, though they are not sure what spurs this mutation.Being aware of your potential risk for throat cancer may help you recognize the symptoms and get a timely diagnosis and treatment.Men are more likely to contract throat cancer than women.Your risk for developing throat cancer increases with age.People who smoke and use chewing tobacco are at a higher risk of developing throat cancer.Excessive alcohol consumption increases your risk.In fact, alcohol and tobacco consumption are the primary risk factors for developing throat cancer.Having HPV (human papilloma virus) can make you more prone to throat cancer.Not eating sufficient fruits and vegetables can raise your risk for contracting throat cancer.Having gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, may also increase your risk.;
, Most symptoms of throat cancer aren’t specific to cancer, so you’ll need to be extra vigilant about watching your oral cavity.Identifying possible symptoms of throat cancer may help you get a relatively expeditious diagnosis and treatment.Symptoms of throat cancer include:


Coughing.
Changes in the voice, which may include hoarseness or inability to speak clearly.
Problems swallowing.
Ear pain.
Sores or lumps that don’t heal on their own or with over the counter treatments.
A sore throat.
Weight loss.Frequent headaches., Irregular growths and lumps can be a sign of throat cancer. Examining your throat may help you recognize unusual growths.Stick out your tongue and see if you can identify any lesions or growths on it.It may be slightly more difficult to examine the inside of your mouth or your throat, but open your mouth as wide as you can and look inside. Shining a light inside your mouth may also help you recognize any irregularities.
Check your mouth and throat regularly so that you know how the area looks usually.Look for changes in the appearance of your throat including differences in color or skin texture. Growths that appear wart or ulcer-like may indicate throat cancer.Schedule an appointment with your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms.Having regular dental checkups can also help with monitoring for any mouth or throat changes or concerns.

, Pay attention to your mouth and throat for any extended pain or bleeding in your mouth or throat. These symptoms might indicate a more serious condition such as throat cancer, in particular if they don’t heal.Observe lingering pain in throat, especially when you swallow.
Look for any bleeding from lesions, growths, or lumps.

, Ask your partner or spouse to look in your throat or ask if they’ve noticed symptoms of throat cancer. He or she may recognize symptoms or differences in your oral cavity more quickly than you do., If you find any of the signs or symptoms of throat cancer and/or are someone who is at risk for the disease, schedule an appointment to see you doctor as soon as possible. If diagnosed early enough, throat cancer is very treatable, with a rate between 50 to 90% depending on the stage at which your doctor diagnoses the disease.You can see your regular doctor or an otolaryngologist, or ear-nose-throat doctor. If necessary, your doctor can send you to other doctors or specialists.
Your doctor will most likely conduct an exam of your oral cavity and throat. She may also health history, which can include factors like your health habits and any past illnesses.Your exam may include having your doctor examine your throat with a lighted scope called an endoscope., If your doctor suspects that you have developed throat cancer, she will probably order additional testing. Tests such as a biopsy or scoping can confirm a diagnosis of throat cancer.The most common test for throat cancer is scoping. Your doctor will insert a small lighted scope, called an endoscope, into your throat or voice box and examine them through a video that the scope transmits.Your doctor may also perform a biopsy, where she removes cells or tissue from your throat and then sends them to a laboratory for furthering testing.In some cases, doctors will also prescribe imaging tests such as CAT scans or MRIs. Imaging tests can help your doctor determine how much throat cancer has spread.In the event that tests confirm throat cancer, you may require additional tests which can determine if the cancer has spread to other areas of your body.Additional testing may include a lymph node biopsy or more in-depth imagining tests., If your doctor discovers throat cancer, she will prescribe a course of treatment based on the extent to which the disease has spread. There are several treatment options and they can be successful if your throat cancer is diagnosed early.Your doctor will prescribe a treatment based the stage at which your cancer is diagnosed. You should also talk to your doctor about your options and what makes you comfortable.
The four main treatments used to combat throat cancer are: radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy.Radiation therapy is often the only treatment necessary in the early stages of throat cancer.It uses high-energy beams from sources like X-rays to kill cancer cells.Surgery can be as simple as scraping cancerous cells off of your throat and voice box to much more extensive surgeries that remove part of the throat and lymph nodes.Chemotherapy employs drugs that kill cancer cells. In some cases, chemotherapy is used in conjunction with radiation therapy.Targeted drug therapy, which uses medications such as cetuximab, that attack certain defects in cancer cells. These drugs help slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.Consider taking part in a clinical trial of medication, which may give you the chance to try a new treatment method.

, Both alcohol and tobacco consumption are closely linked with throat cancer. Avoiding them as much as possible may make treatments more effective, but can also prevent recurrences of throat cancer once you’re healed.Smoking has several effects for throat cancer patients. It can: make treatment less effective, decrease your ability to heal, and increase your risk of getting throat cancer again.
Stopping your consumption of alcohol is also important. Not only can it increase the efficacy of your treatments, but may also minimize your risk for recurrences.If you are having a hard time quitting either tobacco or alcohol, which is especially difficult in stressful times, speak with your doctor about getting help to avoid these substances."

Check if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.,
Look for any behavioural changes.,
Note if you have difficulty breathing.,
Notice if you are nauseous or in pain.,
Spit out any substances that are toxic.,
Remove any contaminated clothing or items.,
Move out of the area if there are poisonous fumes.,
Call for help.,
Provide as much information as you can to medical staff.,
Get examined by a doctor.,
Discuss your treatment options.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Toxic Poisoning," One of the most common symptoms of toxic poisoning is lightheadedness or feeling dizzy. You may feel lightheaded soon after you ingest or come in contact with the poisonous substance or fumes., You may also feel confused or unsettled due to dizziness. You may have difficulty with staying upright and moving around on your own, as you may feel too lightheaded to stand or sit up., You may also struggle to breath or have chest pains that make it difficult to breath in and out. If the poisoning is severe, your body may react by going into shock, which could make it difficult to breathe properly.Depending on the severity of the poisoning, you may also have seizures. You may shake uncontrollably due to the seizure and have difficulty breathing.

, You may vomit as a result of feeling nauseous or ill. Your skin may also become very pale as a result of the poisoning and you may feel unwell or sick to your stomach.Depending on the source of the poisoning, you may experience pain in the area where your body was exposed to the poison. For example, you may feel pain in your mouth, throat, and stomach if you ingest something poisonous or you may feel pain on the surface of your skin if it has been exposed to a poisonous substance.

, Perhaps you have ingested a toxic substance, such as a piece of contaminated food or a chemical liquid. Spit it out as soon as you can or spit out what is left of it. You may also try to throw up the toxic substance in your stomach by forcing yourself to vomit, though this may only lead to more dizziness and nausea.You should wipe off any of the substance on your face or mouth with a cold cloth so you do not risk swallowing any more of it. You may also wash your hands if you have touched your mouth so you do not risk ingesting more of it.

, You should also take off any clothing or items that may have been contaminated with the poison or a harmful substance. For example, you may have spilled toxic chemicals on your clothing or gotten a toxic substance on your shoes. You should shed these items and wash the affected area with warm or cool water.If you are helping someone who may have been poisoned, make sure you do not come in direct contact with any of their contaminated clothing or items. You do not want to put yourself in contact with the harmful substance.

, If you have inhaled fumes that may be poisonous or harmful, you should try to get out of the contaminated area immediately. For example, you may be in a building that contains poisonous fumes. You should move into fresh air as soon as you can.If a person has passed out in an area with poisonous fumes, you should call 911 and wait for them to arrive. Do not enter the contaminated area to remove the person yourself, as you will be putting yourself in danger.

, You should call the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) or 911 for help. If you are not able to make the call, have someone else do it for you. You should then try to sit upright, if you can manage it, and stay still.If you cannot sit upright, you may try lying on your side with a cushion behind your back and your upper leg pulled slightly forward. This is a recovery position and will ensure you do not fall on your face or roll backwards while you wait for help. You can also move a person who has been poisoned into this position if they are unconscious.
Do not have anything to eat or drink. Try to simply stay still and stay calm while help is on its way.

, Once the paramedics arrive or you get into the emergency room, you should provide key information so they can better assess your condition. You may bring along a friend or family member who witnessed the poisoning and have them provide the necessary information if you are too ill.You should note any substances you may have swallowed, inhaled, or come in contact with. You should also explain if the substance was taken accidentally or deliberately and how long ago it was taken. You should note how much of the substance was taken, if you can provide this information.
You may also need to provide your age, estimated weight, and note any existing medical conditions you may have. You should tell the staff if you are taking any medications.

, You should allow a doctor to examine you and treat you for toxic poisoning. Your doctor may do a blood test to determine the cause of the poisoning. The blood test will allow the doctor to screen for any toxic substances or issues with your vital organs due to poisoning.The doctor may also run an electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor your heart and ensure it is functioning properly.

, Once you have been examined, your doctor may suggest several possible treatments, including:Activated charcoal: This is used to treat poisoning as the charcoal will bind to the poison and stop it from being absorbed into your blood.
Antidotes: These substances can reverse the effects of a poisonous substance.
A ventilator: This may be used if you stop breathing or have severe difficulties breathing.
Sedatives: This medication may be given if you are agitated or restless due to the poisoning.
Anti-epileptic medicine: This medication may be given if you experience seizures due to the poisoning.

Look for a color change in the skin that is at the skin level.,
Check for a relatively small elevation of the skin above its normal level (usually is less than 5 mm in diameter).,
Identify nodules.,
Look for any skin change which is a relatively small blister which is usually less than 5 mm in diameter.,
Identify a collection of pus in a blister as a pustule.,
Identify cysts.,
Check for a compressible papule or plaque of dermal edema.,
Check for a flat elevation of the skin which bigger that 2 centimeter (0.8 in) in diameter.,
Recognize an accumulation of keratin layer in the skin.,
Identify any ulcers.",How to Recognize the General Symptoms of Skin Disease," This is a macule. It can adopt several colors such as the blue nevus and black nevus which occur in typical moles. It can also occur in the condition which is called vitiligo which is a hypopigmentation of the skin due to the lack of the pigment melanin in the skin. It can also be pigmented as occurs in freckles. In addition it can be red as occurs in the skin condition of hemangioma. Macule are only a skin change in color and there are no elevations or depressions in the skin surface such as occurs in papules.;
, This is a papule. These papules or skin elevations can adopt several forms. They can be flat topped as occurs in the skin condition of lichen planus. It can also adopt a dome shaped structure such as occurs in xanthoma which is a skin condition that is often triggered by increased lipids in the blood or hyperlipidemia.

, A skin nodule has similarity to a papule except its being larger than papules. They are usually larger than 5 mm in diameter. It can involve any one layer of the skin whether it is the epidermis or the dermis. It can also be edematous or solid. Examples of skin nodules include dermatofibroma which is a benign skin neoplasm. Another example is dermal nevus and nodular melanoma.

, This is a vesicle. It contains fluid that is accumulated or below the epidermis. Vesicles can occur in groups such as occurs in dermatitis herpetiformis which is a subepidermal disease of the skin.

, They can be caused by infection such as occurs in bacterial skin disease of furuncle. It can also be caused due to non-infectious cause such as occurs in psoriasis of the skin.

, A given cyst is a nodule which contains fluid and is lined by epithelial cavity that is filled with fluid that is semisolid in its form. A cyst is a benign tumor that can be drained by a needle.

, This is a wheal. It can be white or red in color. It occurs for example in the allergic skin condition of urticaria.

, This is a plaque. It can be considered as a type of papule which is extended. Examples of diseases which are manifested clinically by plaques are the malignant skin condition of mycosis fungoides in addition one type of psoriasis which is the plaque psoriasis.

, This is a scale. It usually indicates an inflammation and thickening of the epidermis.

, A skin ulcer is defined as a depression of the skin lesion below the normal skin surface due to loss of skin tissue which can result from impairment of the vascular supply to the affected area including lack of nutrients supply.

Use specific, descriptive, and detailed vocabulary.,
Be honest about your symptoms.,
Show and tell your symptoms.,
Discuss the occurrence of your symptoms.,
Explain what factors affect your symptoms.,
Rate how bad your symptoms are.,
Inform your doctor if others have similar symptoms.,
Repeat your symptoms.",How to Reduce the Risk of Misdiagnosis As a Patient1," Every individual explains medical symptoms differently. Because of this, it’s important to describe your symptoms and other related information as specifically, detailed, and descriptively as you can. This can not only help your doctor better diagnose and prevent misdiagnosis, but may also get you proper and prompt treatment.Describe your symptoms using easily understood adjectives. For example, if you are in pain, use words such as dull, intense, throbbing, or piercing. Say, “I have throbbing pain in my big toe.”If there is a language barrier between you and the doctor, try bringing someone you trust who can accurately relay your symptoms to the doctor.;
, Your doctor is trained to deal with all kinds of medical issues. Always be honest when discussing your symptoms and medical history without feeling any shame or embarrassment. Not being honest or withholding information from your doctor can increase the risk of a misdiagnosis.For instance, you may be tempted to lie to your doctor about having unprotected sex because you are embarrassed or are afraid they will judge you, but withholding this very important information means your doctor may not test you for STDs, which could be the source of your problem.
Keep in mind that anything you say to your doctor is confidential by law,and that they should not judge or shame you. They may have some advice about how to be safer in the future, but your doctor is concerned with your health, first and foremost.

, Let your doctor know the specific symptoms you have from a prepared list. As you describe the symptoms, show the doctor the exact spot on your body where you are experiencing them, if you are able. This can help your doctor better diagnose any conditions. It can also help ensure proper treatment.Use the most specific and descriptive words as possible. For example, if you have wrist pain, show your doctor exactly where it is while you say, “I have dull pain in my left wrist.”

, Let your doctor know when your symptoms started. You should also tell the doctor when and how often symptoms happen. This may minimize the risk of a misdiagnosis and help you get prompt and proper treatment.Include when you first noticed symptoms. Let the doctor know if they have ever happened before, if they go away, and how they occur. For example, “I started noticing the blurred vision about a week ago, but this happened to me last winter, too. It’s not painful and gets worse over the course of the day. I find that taking a shower makes it better.”
Let the doctor know if symptoms affect your ability to function. Say, “As the day progresses, my vision is so blurred that I can’t see well enough to drive. I’ve been taking public transportation instead.”
Mention any parallel symptoms or other conditions you have.

, Tell your doctor what makes any symptoms better or worse. This can also prevent a potential misdiagnosis.Note anything that makes you feel better or worse in specific words. For example, if you have toe pain, let the doctor know any movement that makes it sharper. You can describe this by saying ""My toe feels fine when I’m standing, but as soon as I walk or run, I feel a sharp pain.""
Describe triggers for your symptoms that you have noticed. This might include foods, drinks, activities, or medications.

, Describe the severity of your symptoms by putting them on a scale of one to ten. This can help your doctor more accurately diagnose you and get you prompt and appropriate treatment.Avoid minimizing or exaggerating your symptoms. Place then on scale ranging from one to ten. One means your symptoms have little effect on you and ten correlates to the worst possible impact on you.

, You may not be the only person experiencing your symptoms. If anyone else you know has them, make sure to let your doctor know. This can not only minimize the risk of a misdiagnosis, but also alert your doctor to a potential public health issue.This is especially important for any respiratory- or gastrointestinal-related symptoms.

, You may find a doctor doesn’t seem to grasp what you’re trying to say. If this happens, repeat your symptoms until both of you are on the same page. This can ensure that your doctor makes the right diagnosis and develops the proper treatment plan."

Recognize your risk of getting hypothyroidism.,
Watch for constipation.,
Measure your sensitivity to cold.,
Notice if you feel fatigued.,
Look for irregular periods (if you’re a girl).,
Look out for sex-related problems (if you're a man).,
Watch for brittle fingernails.,
Notice if you feel weak.,
Watch for a pale or dry complexion.,
Pay attention to weight gain.,
Stay vigilant about joint or muscle pain.,
Be aware of feelings of sadness.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Hypothyroidism1," If you know you’re at risk for a disease, you are much more likely to pay attention to its symptoms. This is especially important with hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland affects the entire body, making symptomatic identification alone difficult—blood tests are required to confirm it. Women are more likely to develop it, as are people over age 60. You are also more likely to develop hypothyroidism if you have one of the following conditions:Have delivered a baby (or been pregnant) in the last six months
Have previously experienced problems with the thyroid gland
Have another autoimmune disease (lupus, type 1 diabetes, anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.)
Have had the thyroid gland removed
Have received radiation to the thyroid, chest, or neck
Have the female genetic disorder Turner syndrome
Thyroid diseases runs in your family
Have received surgery to correct a thyroid problem;
, Hard stools or trouble pushing stools out (constipation) can indicate hypothyroidism because when your body doesn’t get enough thyroid hormone, its processes start slowing down, including digestion., As hypothyroidism progresses, you may notice an increased sensitivity to cold temperatures wherever you are located.This is due to the body’s processes slowing down from lack of thyroid hormone., You may also continue to feel tired and lethargic as hypothyroidism progresses because the lack of thyroid hormone causes your metabolism to slow down.Hypothyroidism can also cause sleep apnea and anemia, both of which cause fatigue.

, In females, the decrease in thyroid hormone causes irregular periods and can lead to a reduction or impairment of fertility, the ability to get pregnant.It can also cause periods with really heavy flow.

, Many men with untreated hypothyroidism experience decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and delayed ejaculation. If you're suffering from a combination of these problems, you should go to your doctor to get tested for hypothyroidism., Hypothyroidism can cause brittle nails, or cause fingernails to split from the nail bed through the nail plate.Brittle nails are an irritating, discouraging result of body systems slowing down as hypothyroidism begins to affect the body.


Hypothyroidism can also cause dry, brittle hair and hair loss.

, Feeling weak goes hand-in-hand with feeling fatigued and lethargic, which are a result of the body’s systems slowing down as it gets low (or no) levels of the thyroid hormone. Feeling weak means that you experience reduced strength in various muscle groups., Although a pallid complexion alone does not indicate that you have hypothyroidism, paleness combined with general dry skin is a symptom of hypothyroidism.If you have to repeatedly apply moisturizing creams, be aware that this can be a result of a bigger problem within your body.


You may also sweat less if you have hypothyroidism.

, Abnormal or rapid weight gain can indicate hypothyroidism because hormone fluctuation or a decrease of hormones—e.g., lack of thyroid hormone—causes unintentional or unexplained weight gain., You can start to experience pain in your joints and muscles as the body is affected by reduction in thyroid hormone. This pain often translates as stiffness and tenderness in the muscles and stiffness and swelling, or general pain, in your joints., Women suffering from hypothyroidism after delivering a baby can be misdiagnosed as having baby blues or postpartum depression because some of the symptoms are the same—moodiness and depression.A woman within 6 months of being pregnant or having a baby should see a doctor about hypothyroidism if they suspect they are developing post partum depression, or if fatigue and lethargy don’t disappear within a few months.


Hypothyroidism can also cause a ""mental fogginess.""

Learn what urine analysis (urinalysis) screens for.,
Understand the lab results that suggest a metabolic/kidney problem.,
Learn how to correlate symptoms of a UTI to the lab results.,
Recognize other important lab results.",How to Read and Understand Medical Laboratory Results," One of the most common blood test analyzed in a medical lab is a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC measures the most common types of cells and elements in your blood, such as red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets.RBCs contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to all your cells, whereas WBCs are part of your immune system and help to destroy microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and fungi platelets help your body form blood clots.A low hemoglobin count (hemoglobin is part of red blood cells suggests anemia, which can cause hypoxia (not enough oxygen getting to tissues), although too many RBCs (called erythrocytosis) may indicate bone marrow disease.A low WBC count (called leukopenia) may also suggest a bone marrow problem or a potential side effect from taking medications — common problem while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. On the other hand, a high WBC count (called leukocytosis) usually indicates that you're fighting an infection.
Normal RBC ranges are different between the genders. Men have 20 – 25% more RBCs because they tend to be larger and have more muscle tissue, which requires more oxygen.;
, Another common blood test is a cholesterol panel (also called a lipid panel). Cholesterol panels are helpful for determining your risk of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke.A cholesterol/lipid profile includes measurements of your total blood cholesterol (includes all the lipoproteins in your blood), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and your triglycerides, which are fats that are usually stored in fat cells.


Ideally, your total cholesterol should be less than 200 mg/dL and you should have a favorable ratio of HDL (the ""good"" kind) to LDL (the ""bad"" kind) that is less than 3.5:1 in order to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.HDL removes excess cholesterol from the blood and transports it to your liver for recycling. Healthy levels are greater than 50 mg/dL (ideally above 60 mg/dL).
LDL shuttles cholesterol from your liver to cells that need it, as well as to blood vessels in response to injury and inflammation — this can trigger clogged arteries (called atherosclerosis). Healthy levels are lower than 130 mg/dL (ideally less than 100 mg/dL).
Doctors look at the results of a cholesterol / lipid profile before determining if you need or could benefit from cholesterol-lowing medication.

, A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures other components in your blood, such as electrolytes (charged mineral salts needed for nerve conductance and muscle contraction), organic minerals, protein, creatinine, liver enzymes and glucose.A CMP is typically ordered to determine your overall health, but also to check the function of your kidneys and liver, as well as electrolyte levels and acid/base balance. CMPs are often ordered along with CBCs as part of standard medical exams and annual physicals.


Sodium is needed for regulating fluid levels and allowing nerves and muscles to function, but too much in the blood causes hypertension (high blood pressure) and increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. Too little can also be dangerous, causing neurological problems. Normal sodium levels are between 136 - 144 mEq/L.
Liver enzymes (ALT and AST) become elevated when your liver is injured or inflamed — caused by alcoholism, acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, gallstones, hepatitis, or autoimmune disorders.
If your blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, that likely means your kidneys have problems. BUN should be between 7 – 29 mg/dL, whereas your creatinine levels should be between 0.8 – 1.4 mg/dL.

, Another potential component of a CMP is a blood sugar (glucose) test. Blood sugar tests measure the amount of glucose circulating in your bloodstream, usually after fasting for at least eight hours.Glucose tests are usually ordered if your doctor suspects you may have a type of diabetes (types 1 or 2, or gestational). Type 1 diabetes develops when your pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin hormone (which functions to grab glucose from the blood and deliver it to cells) or the cells of your body ""ignore"" the effects of insulin. Type 2 diabetes develops when your tissues are resistant to the action of insulin, usually because of obesity. Thus, diabetics have chronically high blood glucose levels (called hyperglycemia), which is greater than 125 mg/dL.


People at high risk for diabetes have blood sugar levels between 100 – 125 mg/dL — if you're in this range, you might be referred to as ""pre-diabetic.""
Persistently high glucose levels can cause damage to organs in the long-term and result in the complications of diabetes like heart disease, kidney disease, eye disease, and neuropathy.
Keep in mind there are other causes of high blood sugar, such as chronic stress, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism and a cancerous or inflamed pancreas gland.
Very low levels of glucose (less than 70 mg/dL) is called hypoglycemia and can be caused by taking too much insulin medication, alcoholism and failure of various organs (liver, kidneys and/or heart).

, A urinalysis detects the byproducts of normal/abnormal metabolism, cells, protein and bacteria in urine.Healthy urine is typically clear looking, without a bad odor and sterile, which means without significant numbers of bacteria. Many metabolic and kidney disorders can be caught in their early stages by screening for abnormalities via urinalysis. These abnormalities can include higher-than-normal concentrations of glucose, protein, bilirubin, RBCs, WBCs, uric acid crystals and bacteria.


Your doctor may recommend urinalysis if she suspects a metabolic condition (like diabetes), kidney disease or a urinary tract infection (UTI).For urinalysis, you'll need to collect 1 – 2 ounces of mid-stream urine (not the initial portion out of your urethra) into a sterile plastic cup. Collecting the sample first thing in the morning is usually recommended. Don't forget to clean your genitals thoroughly before collecting a urine sample, particularly if you're menstruating.
The reason it needs to be midstream: there will be bacteria on the skin near the opening if your urethra normally. The initial flow of urine will contain some of these bacteria.
Your urine sample is analyzed three ways in the lab: via visual exam, dipstick test and microscopic exam., Most metabolic and kidney problems don't create obvious symptoms, at least in their initial stages. General feelings of tiredness and lack of energy are common, but are difficult to relate to kidney or glandular dysfunction. An analysis of your urine can suggest that a problem exists, although it's not definitive by itself — blood tests, physical exam and other tests (ultrasound, MRI) are often required also.Normally, there isn't significant amounts of protein (albumin) in urine; however, when urine protein levels are high (called proteinuria), it can be an early sign of kidney disease.Proteinuria is also common with multiple myeloma and various types of cancer.
Kidney disease can also cause blood (RBCs) to be in urine, as well as high acidity and specific gravity (the concentration of the urine). Crystals in your urine may be a sign of kidney stones or gout.
The presence of sugar (glucose) and ketones in your urine may be indicative of diabetes.Thus, diabetics have too much glucose in both their blood and urine.You may have just high ketones but not glucose in your urine if you haven't been eating much lately.

, Another common reason for getting your urine analyzed is if a urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected.A UTI usually involves just the urethra (urethritis), but can also involve the bladder (cystitis) and kidneys (pyelonephritis) in more severe cases. UTIs are much more common in women compared to men — about 40% of American women have at least one in their lifetime.Symptoms of a UTI are much more obvious than the early stages of kidney or metabolic disorders. Frequent and/or painful (burning) urination, dark colored urine, urine in the blood, feeling like you need to go again right after urinating, lower abdominal pain, back pain and a mild fever are the most common signs of a UTI.


The main evidence of a UTI from the dipstick portion of urinalysis is the presence of nitrites or leukocyte esterase (a product of WBCs).Under the microscope, WBCs (a sure sign of infection/inflammation), bacteria and possibly RBCs will be seen if you have a UTI.
Although numerous bacteria can cause a UTI, most are due to E. coli, which are commonly found in stool.

, Other conditions and diseases can be identified from urinalysis also, such as liver disease or inflammation, kidney and bladder cancer, chronic inflammation somewhere in the body and pregnancy.These parameters aren't always looked at routinely in the medical blood lab, so your doctor might have to request them specifically.


Bilirubin is a byproduct of RBC breakdown and normally not found in urine. Any bilirubin in your urine can indicate liver damage or disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis. It may also indicate gallbladder disease.
The presence of abnormal looking cells, as well as WBCs and RBCs in the urine, can be indicative of cancer somewhere in the genitourinary system.If cancer is suspected, blood tests and cell cultures are usually performed too.
If you suspect you're pregnant because you missed your period, urinalysis can be helpful for confirming it. The medical lab will look for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine sample, which is a hormone made by the placenta of pregnant women.The hormone can also be detected in the blood, although pregnancy test kits sold at pharmacies measure hCG in urine.

Take a comprehensive patient profile to your appointment.,
Write a list of questions for your doctor.,
Summarize the reason for your visit.,
Avoid telling your doctor your self-diagnosis.",How to Reduce the Risk of Misdiagnosis As a Patient2," A comprehensive patient profile includes information on medical conditions, hospitalizations, or surgeries you have had. It also contains any medications you have taken or currently take. This ensures that your doctor has a complete picture of your health and minimizes the risk that you forget to tell them something important. The profile can also help prevent a misdiagnosis.Compile copies of medical records or write your own patient profile by summarizing your medical history on a piece of paper.
Show the doctor any current medication bottles. These should list the name of the medication and dosing information. Make sure to include any herbal supplements you take as well.

, Most people have questions about symptoms or conditions when they see their doctor. Writing down a list of questions before you go to your doctor can prevent you from forgetting them. It can also maximize your visit and help your doctor diagnose you correctly.Mention any concerns or worries you have as a part of your questions. For example, “I’ve had ovarian cysts in the past. Do you think this could be one?”

, Many doctors start an appointment with questions such as, ""What brings you here today?"" Writing a one or two sentence summary of your symptoms can give your doctor an initial idea of your concerns, help maximize your visit, and prevent a possible misdiagnosis.Use common symptoms in your summary. This might include dealing with pain, weakness, vomiting, bowel issues, fever, breathing problems, or headache. For example, say, “I’ve had stomach pain and constipation for a week.”

, People often like to research their symptoms before seeing a doctor. This can easily lead to a misdiagnosis by yourself, but also by your doctor because you may “experience” symptoms you found in your research. Make sure to describe only symptoms you have to your doctor. Avoid saying what condition you think you have.Describing potential diagnoses you’ve made takes away important time from your doctor’s ability to properly diagnose you.

Contact your insurance company.,
Gather relevant information.,
See another physician.,
Discuss your options.",How to Reduce the Risk of Misdiagnosis As a Patient3," If you have reason to doubt or question a doctor’s diagnosis, you may want to get a second opinion. This can ensure that you get prompt and proper treatment. However, your insurance company may have restrictions on getting a second opinion. Let your insurance company know you want to get a second opinion. This can ensure you know what is covered as well as prevent confusion or denial of the bill.Tell your insurance representative why you’d like a second opinion. This could be because you are not sure your doctor understood you or your physician suggested a second opinion from a specialist.
See what your insurance will cover and if you need to see certain specialists within your plan. This visit may need to be approved first.

, Before you go for a second opinion, make sure to have any information relevant to your case ready for the appointment. This can help the doctor better evaluate your case. It can also ensure a prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment. Take the following to your appointment:Previous medical records
Contact information for the first physician
Insurance card
List of prescription medications and allergies
Diagnostic test results

, There is nothing wrong with getting a second opinion. In fact, it may help ease your mind and/or get you the most optimal treatment. Many doctors will welcome and even suggest getting a second opinion. Choose to see another general doctor or a specialist, depending on what your condition is.Let your first doctor know you’re seeking a second opinion. It is within your rights as a patient to ask another physician for their assessment of your condition. Recognize that the doctors may work well together to ensure you get the best treatment possible.
Tell your second doctor that you’ve sought a first opinion and what those results are. You can say, “I saw another doctor about this and I’m really reluctant to undergo such a radical procedure before exploring all of my options.”

, The new doctor should offer a diagnosis and treatment plan. This could be the same or differ from the first opinion. Ask the doctor to explain the benefits and drawbacks of each option to help you make the right choice for your needs.Recognize that you could get a third opinion if the first two don’t agree.

Discern if you have a decreased sense of taste.,
Watch for puffiness in the hands and feet.,
Pay attention to difficulty speaking.,
Notice if your skin gets thicker while your eyebrows get thinner.,
Pay attention to a slower heart rate.,
Watch for a hoarse voice.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Hypothyroidism2," If hypothyroidism goes untreated, the lack of thyroid hormone in the body starts to affect more systems. If you have a decreased sense of smell and taste, this is an indication that you aren’t getting enough thyroid hormone., If hypothyroidism goes untreated, lack of thyroid hormone can progress to a point of affecting your face, hands, and feet by making them puffy.If you notice puffiness in all three of these areas, by this point you are probably experiencing a host of other symptoms and you should get to a doctor as soon as possible.


When you have hypothyroidism, your sweating generally does not ""pit,"" meaning that when pressure is applied to the swollen area, an indention is not typically left.

, Hoarseness is a symptom of untreated hypothyroidism.This happens as a result of the body’s processes slowing due to lack of thyroid hormone.

, Thinning hair in general is a symptom of hypothyroidism, and by the time it reaches your eyebrows, you know you’ve got some thyroid issues. Also, as your body suffers from lack of thyroid hormone, your skin can start to become thicker., Again, as the body suffers from lack of thyroid hormone, its systems are affected. The heart, the most important system in the body, will begin to slow, a noticeable system in untreated hypothyroidism.You can tell your resting heart rate is slowing down by taking note of your heartbeat when you wake up every morning. This might be a smart thing to start chronicling if you suspect your body of not producing enough thyroid hormone.

, Changes in the way you talk can also be a symptom of untreated hypothyroidism. One result of a slow metabolism is a decreased ability to speak clearly.If you notice a hoarse quality to the way you talk, this can be an indication that hypothyroidism is advanced.


Since the thyroid gland is located at the base of the throat, it is not surprising that hoarseness is a symptom."
"
See a doctor if symptoms accumulate.,
Expect to be examined thoroughly.,
Anticipate having blood tests.,
Be prepared to start taking thyroid medicine.,
Follow up to see if you need medicine changes.,
Stay alert about possible medication complications.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Hypothyroidism3," If you start to notice that you’re having more than one or two of these symptoms, it is probably time to make a doctor appointment. It is especially important to be seen if you start to see signs of late stage hypothyroidism, such as a slower heart rate and decreased senses of smell and taste.


At the onset of hypothyroidism, you may not notice it because it just looks like a bit of weight gain and fatigue, symptoms that also come with aging. You will develop further symptoms, however, as your metabolism slows down., A doctor will ask very specific and thorough questions about your symptoms before moving to the next stage of diagnosing hypothyroidism, which is blood tests. Be prepared for these questions by taking detailed notes of your symptoms before arriving at the doctor’s office.


You may consider typing your symptoms as you notice them into the Notes feature in your phone, or downloading a symptom tracker app.
You should also give the doctor a detailed medical history, such as past issues with your thyroid gland (including any surgeries or other symptoms and treatments), family history with the thyroid gland, and any general medications you have taken recently., Since hypothyroidism cannot be determined by symptoms alone, the doctor must take blood tests to measure your thyroid hormone levels. Hypothyroidism symptoms also tend to be similar to symptoms of other diseases, so blood tests are truly the best way to determine hypothyroidism.One test is the TSH test. The TSH is a very sensitive test that measures thyroid activity. A reading of “above normal” indicates hypothyroidism, and a reading of “below normal” indicates hyperthyroidism.
Another is the T4 test. The T4 test measures the level of thyroid hormone in the blood. A reading lower than normal indicates hypothyroidism.
A common test is the thyroid autoantibody test. Thyroid autoantibodies are only present in the blood if a person’s hypothyroidism is cause by Hashimoto’s disease, so while this test unequivocally proves that someone has hypothyroidism, if autoantibodies are not present, a person may still have hypothyroidism caused by something else.

, Once you have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, most doctors will put you on medication. Hypothyroidism is a condition that cannot be cured, so hormone replacement is the only way to help the body regulate TSH and T4. Your medication will be pills containing T4, also known as thyroxine.You must be careful to take the exact dosage prescribed. Taking too little of the medication will make your hypothyroidism persist, and taking too much can make you develop the opposite condition, hyperthyroidism.
Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include rapid heartbeat, inability to sleep, nervousness, increased appetite, and feeling shaky.

, At first, you may need to increase your dosage of T4 based on symptoms. Every time your doctor increases your dosage of T4, you need a blood test 6 to 10 weeks afterward in order to ensure that your T4 levels are normal.Eventually you and your doctor will feel comfortable about the dosage you’re taking, and you can get your T4 levels checked only once a year.
Babies and young children must strictly maintain their medication regimes or risk mental retardation and stunted growth.

, Everyone is different, so you must pay attention to your body. You may have to return to the doctor if complications arise, or if you start to take other medications that interfere with your T4 medicine.Pay attention to a return or worsening of symptoms. This may mean that you aren’t taking enough medicine.
Other issues that may arise with taking T4 can include taking medicines that prevent your body from absorbing T4 like calcium-based antacids, iron tablets, or medications that contain estrogen.
If you notice a weight gain or loss of 10 or more pounds when you aren’t trying to, it may indicate an issue with your thyroid medication.

Look for symptoms of a stye (sty).,
Look for symptoms of chalazion.,
Determine if you have a dermoid cyst.Non-cancerous growths called dermoids can grow all over the body, including the eyelids.,
Leave the stye alone.,
Take antibiotics for a stye that won’t go away.If your stye does not go away on its own within a week (or if the pain worsens or spreads to the eye itself), contact your doctor.She may suggest using antibiotics to treat it.,
Have surgery, in rare cases.,
Use a compress to treat a chalazion.,
Contact your doctor if a chalazion does not drain and heal on its own within a month.,
Ask your doctor about how to treat a dermoid.,
Understand that chronic conditions can lead to styes.,
Know the risk factors association with chalazia.,
Practice good eyelid hygiene.",How to Recognize an Eyelid Cyst," A stye occurs as a result of an infection of oil glands in the eyelid caused by the staphylococcus bacteria.Most eyelid cysts are styes. A stye:


Usually forms on the outside of the eyelid, sometimes on the inside.
Looks like a boil or pimple.
May show a whitish, round, raised pus point on the inner side of the swelling.
Can cause tearing.
Can cause pain and swelling of the entire eyelid.;
, A chalazion (Greek for “hail stone”) is a type of cyst that occurs when an oil gland at the edge of the eye becomes blocked.A chalazion grows in size. It may start off very small and hard to see, but then grow to the size of a pea.


A chalazion may cause some redness and tenderness at first, but as it grows it will become painless.
Usually, a chalazion forms on the inside of the upper eyelid, but you may notice swelling on the outside of the eyelid, or on your lower eyelid.
A chalazion may also cause tearing or blurred vision if it presses against the eyeball.
Persistent or recurrent chalazion has be be checked to make sure it is not malignant.

, Dermoid cysts are themselves benign, but in some cases they can lead to loss of vision, or rupture, causing inflammation. For this reason, your doctor may recommend removing the dermoid.






An orbital dermoid looks like a smooth, firm egg-shaped mass found near the bone of the eye socket.
A posterior epibulbar dermoid (also known as a dermolipoma) is usually found under the upper eyelid where it meets the eye. It is soft and yellow, and can form to the shape of the eye. There may be some hair sticking out of the mass.
A limbal dermoid is a small spot or mass found not on the eyelid, but on the surface of the eye, usually on the cornea (around the iris), or at the border of the cornea and sclera (white of the eye). These are removed in many cases, since they may cause vision problems.

, Styes usually go away on their own within a few days.In most cases, you can just treat the symptoms and leave the stye alone to heal.


Don’t try to pop or squeeze the stye, as this can worsen the infection.Use mild soap and water to clean your eyelid.
Avoid wearing eye makeup until the stye has cleared.
Avoid wearing contact lenses until the stye has cleared, if possible.
You can apply a warm, wet washcloth to your eyelid for 5-10 min several times a day to clean the stye and relieve some of the discomfort.
Contact your doctor if it doesn’t start to improve within 48, or if the redness, swelling, or pain extends to other parts of your face.

, Usually, these are ointments rather than oral antibiotics. Some treatments require a prescription, while others are available over-the-counter.Use the antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes, and for as long as you are told to (even if the stye seems to improve or go away).

, If your stye does not improve by other methods, your doctor can cut it open to drain the pus.This can make the stye heal faster, and relieves some of the pressure and pain.


Never attempt to drain a stye on your own, as serious injury or complications can result.

, Usually, a chalazion will go away on its own.You can apply a warm, wet washcloth to your eyelid for five to 10 min four times a day to clean it and relieve some of the discomfort caused by the chalazion.


Softly massaging the area affected by the chalazion for a few minutes each day may also help make it go away. You should not squeeze or pop a chalazion.

, A chalazion that does not heal on its own can be removed with a minor surgery.A small incision is made at the site of the chalazion (usually the underside of the eyelid), and the inflamed tissue is removed. The incision is then stitched back with dissolvable sutures.

, Some dermoids may cause no discomfort or vision problems, while others will need to be surgically removed. Your doctor can examine a dermoid and recommend the best course of action.


Be sure to describe your symptoms fully to your doctor, including any pain or vision problems you may be experiencing.

, The risk of developing a stye is higher in patients with underlying conditions such as blepharitis and rosacea.These conditions cause inflammation, which may be connected to the formation of styes.

, A chalazion is not an infection, unlike a stye. However, a chalazion may develop as an after-effect of a stye. The risk of developing a chalazion is also higher in patients with underlying conditions such as:Blepharitis
Rosacea
Seborrhea
Tuberculosis
Viral infections

, Styes usually result from an infection by staphylococcal bacteria, which is usually found on our skin. As a result, all of the following increase your risk of getting a sty:Touching your eye with unwashed hands
Using dirty contact lenses or inserting them with unwashed hands
Leaving eye makeup on overnight
Using old or shared makeup (mascara, liquid eyeliner, and eyeshadow should be thrown out within three months of first using them)"

Know how all blood tests are formatted and presented.,
Distinguish between blood cells and what abnormal results may indicate.,
Realize the functions of other basic elements in the blood.,
Understand what lipid profiles are.,
Recognize the implications of a blood sugar test.,
Learn what the CMP is.",How to Read Blood Test Results," All blood tests, including the CBC and other panels and tests, must include certain basic elements including: your name and health ID, date the test was completed and printed, names of the test(s), lab and doctor who ordered the test, actual test results, normal range for results, flagged abnormal results and, of course, lots of abbreviations and units of measurement.For people not in the healthcare field, any blood test can look intimidating and confusing, but take your time and identify all these basic elements and how they're arranged among headings and within vertical columns.


Once you're familiar with how blood tests are presented, you can quickly scan the page for the flagged abnormal results (if there are any), which will be labelled as either ""L"" for too low, or ""H"" for too high.
You don't need to memorize the normal ranges of any measured component because they will always be printed alongside your test results as a handy reference.;
, As noted above, the main cells of your blood are red and white blood cells. RBCs contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to all the tissues of the body. WBCs are part of the immune system and help to destroy pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and parasites.A low RBC count may suggest anemia (resulting in not enough oxygen getting to tissues), although too many RBCs (termed erythrocytosis) may indicate bone marrow disease.A low WBC count (termed leukopenia) may also suggest a bone marrow problem or side effect of taking medications, chemotherapy especially. On the other hand, a high WBC count (termed leukocytosis) usually signifies that your body is fighting an infection. Some drugs, especially steroids, can also increase the WBC count.


Normal RBC ranges are different between men and women. Men typically have 20-25% more RBCs because they tend to be larger and have more muscle tissue, which requires more oxygen.
Hematocrit (the percentage of your blood made up by RBCs) and mean corpuscular volume (average volume of RBCs) are two ways of measuring RBCs and both values are normally higher in men because of their higher oxygen needs.

, Two other components in the blood mentioned in a CBC are platelets and hemoglobin. As noted above, hemoglobin is an iron-based molecule that grabs onto oxygen as blood circulates through the lungs, whereas platelets are a part of the body's blood clotting system and help prevent excessive bleeding from injuries.Not enough hemoglobin (due to iron deficiency or bone marrow disease) leads to anemia, whereas a low platelet count (termed thrombocytopenia) may be the result of prolonged external or internal bleeding from a traumatic injury or other medical conditions. On the other hand, a high platelet count (termed thrombocytosis) suggests a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation.


Levels of both RBCs and hemoglobin are connected because hemoglobin is carried inside RBCs, although it's possible to have malformed RBCs without hemoglobin (termed sickle cell anemia).
Many compounds ""thin"" the blood, which means that they inhibit platelet stickiness and prevent blood clotting. Common blood thinners include: alcohol, many types of drugs (ibuprofen, aspirin, heparin), garlic and parsley.
A CBC also includes levels of eosinophil (Eos), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

, Lipid profiles are more specific blood tests that are helpful for determining your risk of cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke.Doctors assess the results of a lipid profile before determining if cholesterol-lowing medications are necessary. A lipid profile typically includes total cholesterol (includes all the lipoproteins in your blood), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (the ""good"" kind), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (the ""bad"" kind) and triglycerides, which are fats usually stored in fat cells. Essentially you want your total cholesterol to be less than 200 mg/dL and a favorable HDL to LDL ratio (approaching 1:2) in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.


HDL removes excess cholesterol from the blood and carries it to the liver for recycling. Desirable levels are above 50 mg/dL (ideally above 60 mg/dL).Your HDL level is the only one that you want to be high on this type of blood test.
LDL deposits excess cholesterol in blood vessel in response to injury and inflammation, which can trigger atherosclerosis (clogged arteries). Desirable levels are less than 130 mg/dL (ideally less than 100 mg/dL).

, A blood sugar test measures the amount of glucose circulating in your blood, usually after fasting for at least 8 hours.This test is usually ordered if there is suspicion of diabetes (types 1 or 2, or gestational). Diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin hormone (which grabs glucose from the blood) and/or the cells of the body don't allow insulin to deposit the glucose normally. As such, people with diabetes have chronically high blood glucose (termed hyperglycemia), which is considered greater than 125 mg/dL.People at serious risk for diabetes (often classified as ""prediabetic"") typically have blood glucose levels between 100-125 mg/dL.
Other causes of high blood glucose include: severe stress, chronic kidney disease, hyperthyroidism and an inflamed or cancerous pancreas.
Not enough blood glucose (less than 70 mg/dL) is called hypoglycemia and characteristic of taking too much insulin medication, alcoholism and organ failure (liver, kidneys, heart).

, A CMP is a comprehensive metabolic panel, which measures lots of other constituents in your blood, such as electrolytes (charged elements, typically mineral salts), other minerals, protein, creatinine, liver enzymes and glucose.It's ordered to determine a person's overall health, but also to specifically check the status of their kidneys, liver, pancreas, electrolyte levels (needed for normal nerve conductance and muscle contraction) and acid/base balance. The CMP is typically ordered along with a CBC as part of a blood work-up for a medical exam or annual physical.


Sodium is an electrolyte required for regulating fluid levels in the body and allowing nerves and muscles to work properly, but too much can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure) and increase your risk of heart attack. Normal levels are between 136-144 mEq/L. Other electrolytes, such as potassium, can be included in this section.
Liver enzymes (ALT and AST) become elevated in the blood due to liver injury or inflammation — often the result of consuming too much alcohol and/or drugs (prescription, over-the-counter and illicit), or from an infection such as hepatitis. Bilirubin, albumin and total protein can be included in this section.
If your blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are too high, that likely indicates problems with your kidneys. BUN should be between 7-29 mg/dL, whereas creatinine should be between 0.8-1.4 mg/dL.
Other elements in a CMP include albumin, chloride, potassium, calcium, total protein, and bilirubin. Low or high levels of these elements can indicate the presence of disease.

Be extra wary of treatments for certain conditions.,
Recognize red flags.,
Beware of advertisements.,
Know that even scientific research is not necessarily legitimate.,
Stay alert at the doctor’s office.,
Don’t accept medical advice unquestioningly.,
Look at your medical bills in detail.,
Keep a healthcare journal.,
Guard your health insurance information.,
Report suspected fraud to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).,
Know your legal rights.",How to Recognize Medical Frauds and Scams," Healthcare fraud tends to fall into several recognizable categories. Often, scammers aim for the especially sick and/or vulnerable. Be particularly skeptical of the following kinds of products:Cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS treatments. These are diseases that can only be treated through personal, individualized care. Everyone’s case is different, so if you see a product promising to cure all kinds of cancer, it is a fraud.
Supplements. Many supplements are safe, and some may even be effective. However, they are unlikely to aid in weight loss, increase muscle mass, or enhance sexual performance.
Products that promise to help you lose weight without diet or exercise.
Pills or other treatments that promise to stop or reverse aging.
Medical tests that are not FDA-approved.
Cold and flu remedies. While over-the-counter medications can certainly alleviate some of the symptoms of colds and influenza, products that promise you can avoid these afflictions are scams.
Treatment for STDs. Effective treatments for STDs can only be attained with a doctor’s prescription. If you rely on products you find elsewhere, you are delaying your own treatment and possibly infecting other people.;
, If it seems like everything on the market is a potential scam, you’re right. But that doesn’t mean you should avoid all healthcare treatments. Luckily, products themselves will often issue clues that they are fraudulent. Avoid products that claim to be miracle cures, cure-alls, quick fixes, etc., Healthcare fraud is a massive industry that works hard to scam you out of your hard-earned money. You’ll find advertisements for fraudulent products on television, in magazines, and more. Learn how to recognize this kind of advertising.Pay attention to the balance of scientific information and testimonials. Does the advertisement focus on the research that backs up its claims, or does it feature individuals testifying to their positive experiences with the product? An abundance of the latter can be indicative that there is a dearth of the former.
This can be true of both consumers and doctors offering testimony. Both groups are probably played by actors.
When in doubt, consult your doctor about the product you have seen advertised.

, A lot of fraudulent products will talk about clinical trials that supposedly validate their claims. However, many of these trials are conducted by manufacturers, and they do not adhere to appropriate scientific rigor.Up to 40% of researchers admit to knowledge of misconduct in clinical trials.These behaviors can range from intentionally falsifying results to make products seem more effective (fraud) to failing to adhere to double-blind testing practices, random participant selection, etc. (misconduct).This means that, in addition to being ineffective, a lot of the products on the market may even be dangerous.Search the National Library of Medicine, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Better Business Bureau to see if anyone has lodged complaints about (or can testify to the validity of) clinical trials.

, When in doubt, most of us turn to our doctors. However, though it is rare, healthcare providers can sometimes be the ones who are perpetrating fraud. Fraud of this kind can take many forms:Being charged for a service you did not receive.
Being charged for a service that is more expensive than the one you received (upcoding).
Being charged for the same thing twice.
Performing, and then charging you for, a treatment you did not need.
Accepting payment from pharmaceutical companies or medical device producers to push their products.
Charging you separately for parts of the same treatment (unbundling).

, When they engage in fraud, doctors may try to persuade you to get tests or treatments you don’t need. While the vast majority of healthcare professionals are trustworthy, you also need to be your own best advocate.

, Most people like to think about medical bills as little as possible, but perusing these documents can be your best weapon in the fight against fraudulent healthcare practices. Being a victim of healthcare fraud can be a lot more frustrating than spending a few minutes going over charges.As you do so, be on the lookout for common kinds of healthcare fraud.
Talk to your doctor if there is anything on the bill that you do not understand, if you think you were charged improperly, or if you think you did not need one of the services you have been charged for.

, Every time you go to the doctor, make a note of the treatments, tests, etc. you received. This way, when your bill comes, you can check it against your records.

, Since healthcare identity fraud is a very real problem, make sure you do not share your insurance card with other people. Be especially wary of requests for policy numbers and other pieces of information that come through phone calls or emails. Your ID card and policy number are like a credit card and bank account, If you spot a product that falls under its jurisdiction, contact its local office. The FDA regulates many categories of products where scams can take place, including the following:Prescription and over-the-counter drugs
Vaccines
Medical equipment
Radiation-emitting electronics
Beauty products

, You are protected from healthcare fraud by both civil and criminal law. If you think you have been scammed, do not just alert the FDA and your insurance company—seek legal counsel as well.The False Claims Act allows both patients and the government to file civil suits charging medical fraud, potentially recovering lost funds.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made healthcare fraud itself a criminal offense punishable with both fines and up to ten years in prison.
Those accused of healthcare fraud have also faced other criminal charges, such as conspiracy, which can carry up to to twenty years in prison.

See your doctor to have an EKG performed.,
Understand the grids of an EKG paper printout.,
Measure the time between your heartbeats.",How to Read an EKG1," It's one of the simplest and oldest cardiac investigations available, yet it can provide a wealth of useful information and remains an essential part of the assessment of cardiac patients.The paper printout is usually available right after the test. Sometimes you might not get the printout for a few days.


When you go in your first time, the process can be a bit unnerving. Sticky stuff will get rubbed over different parts of your body and leads will be attached at different angles to view your heart. These are tracking the electrical activity of your heart; if the activity is moving toward the tracker, the lines will go up (this is called ""positive deflection""); if the activity is moving away from the tracker, the lines will go down (this is called ""negative deflection""). You'll see the movements on the graph paper when it's finished.;
, Voltage is measured along the vertical axis; time is measured along the horizontal axis in squares. There are large squares that are divided into smaller squares.


Small squares are 1 mm across and represent 0.04 seconds. The large squares measure 5 mm across and represent 0.2 seconds.
10 mm in height is equal to 1mV in voltage.

, This is known as the P wave, which is the straight line between the dips and spikes. Normal duration is between 0.12 to 2.0 seconds which is 3 to 4 small horizontal boxes.


This amount of time should be pretty consistent across the entire strip. If there is a varied amount of time (boxes) between beats, it can indicate an irregular heartbeat. This is only something to worry about if your doctor says so--it can be completely harmless.
That little bump afterward is known as the ""T wave""--it finishes off the heartbeat, repolarizing the ventricles.

"
"
Locate 2 identical peaks on your EKG readout.,
Use the following formula to calculate your heart rate: 300 divided by the number of boxes between the 2 peaks.,
Ask your doctor about any irregularities between heartbeats.",How to Read an EKG2," Count how many big boxes are between the peaks. The top of the peak is ""R"", but the whole spike is known as the QRS complex (the second contraction through the ventricles).


This pattern is called normal sinus rhythm. It is the basic EKG of any normal healthy heart. Naturally, there are variations of normal within the healthy population and every person's may look different, but still be totally healthy.

, In this diagram, it's 3 boxes, so 300 divided by 3 = 100 BPM.


For example, if you counted 4 big boxes between peaks you have a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (300/4)= 75.
If you cannot find identical points on your readout, count the number of spikes that are in a 6-second readout and multiply the number by 10 to get an approximate rate. For example, if there are 7 R waves in a 6 second strip, the heart rate is 70 (7x10=70).

, You may notice that you have one and they haven't said anything. This isn't because they're negligent or not educated; they simply didn't want to worry you with something that is a non-issue.

If the interval between the P and the R is too long, this is called a ""first degree block."" A ""bundle branch block"" is when the QRS interval takes longer than .12 seconds. Atrial fibrillation is present when, combined with an irregular heartbeat, the P waves are straight up non-existent and instead get replaced by a boring, squiggly line."

Go to your doctor for the tuberculosis skin test.,
Leave your arm uncovered.,
Return to your doctor.,
Find and mark the induration.,
Measure the induration.,
Determine if the individual is in the high-risk group.,
Determine if the individual is in the moderate-risk group.,
Look for a large induration for everyone else.,
Look for a negative result.",How to Read a Tuberculosis Skin Test," You will be given an injection of a purified protein derivative into the inner forearm that will result in a 6-10 mm welt that will disappear within a few hours., Do not place a bandage over the site of the test for the required 48 to 72 hours. You can wash and dry your arm carefully.You also should not scratch or rub the test area on your arm. This can cause redness or swelling that may cause the results to be misread. You can apply a cold washcloth on your arm if it is itchy., The test must be read within 48-72 hours. If you do not come back within 72 hours, the test is considered invalid and will have to be repeated., Use your fingertips to find the induration. This is a hard, dense, raised formation with definite borders. If there is a firm bump, use a pen to mark the widest edges of the induration on the forearm.The only part that is important for your test results is the hard bump. The reddened area or any slight swelling does not count towards the size of the induration.


You cannot always see the induration. You must find the induration with your fingertips., The test site may be red, but that does not mean you have TB. You have to measure the induration. This induration is measured across your forearm in millimeters.Use a ruler with millimeter measurements. Place the edge of the ruler with ""0"" on the left edge of the raised bump where you marked it with a pen. Look where the mark made on the right side of the bump falls on the ruler.If the mark is between two different lines, use the lower measurement.

, An induration of 5mm or more is categorized as positive in individuals in the high-risk group. This group includes people who have:


HIV
received organ transplants
been immunosuppressed for various reasons
recent contact with a TB positive person
chest x-ray consistent with old healed TB
end stages of renal (kidney) disease, An induration of 10mm or more is categorized as positive in people in the moderate-risk group. This includes people who:


immigrated recently from a country with widespread TB
use injection drugs
work in healthcare settings, prisons, nursing homes, or other similar areas
have clinical conditions that put them at risk, like diabetes, leukemia, low body weight
are children under age 4
are children and adolescents exposed to high-risk adults, For those not in the high or moderate-risk group, an induration of 15mm or more is considered positive. This includes all individuals, regardless of any risk factors they might have. The test is also considered positive if there are blisters present, even if there is little swelling., If there is no firm bump, the result is negative.If there is soft swelling or redness, but no noticeable hardened bump that can be felt at the site, it is a negative.Even if you believe your skin test is negative, you must return to the doctor to have it professionally read.

Eat a healthy, fresh, diverse diet.,
Target some key nutrients.,
Cut down on problem foods.,
Exercise regularly but carefully.,
Get adequate rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stay positive.,
Understand platelets.,
Know your condition.,
Work with your medical team.,
Accept medical treatments as needed.,
Try to separate science from speculation.",How to Raise Blood Platelet Level Naturally," As noted, the specifics of a purported platelet-increasing diet can vary greatly from source to source. One broadly shared characteristic, however, is the notion that generally healthier eating is a key component.


You’ve probably heard it before: more fresh fruits and vegetables; more lean proteins and whole grains; less refined starches and sugars; less saturated and trans fats; less processed foods.
You want to get the most “bang for your buck” from what you eat by choosing nutrient-dense foods like fresh vegetables, not nutrient-light foods like a bag of cookies, for instance.Give your body every advantage in drawing as much nutrition as possible from the food you eat.
Eat Kiwi fruits. They increase platelet level faster.;
, Again, the key nutrients promoted for those with low platelet levels varies by source. Work with your medical team to determine your best course of action. Some common nutrients that seem particularly valuable, and that are beneficial to practically anyone, regardless of platelet count, include:


Vitamin K, which aids in blood clotting and has anti-inflammatory properties (inflammation can be a cause of platelet destruction). Vitamin K is found in leafy greens like kale, collards, spinach, broccoli, and edible seaweed. Cook these vegetables lightly if at all to retain nutrients. Eggs and liver are also food sources of Vitamin K.
Folate (Vitamin B9), which is important in the cell division process (remember that platelets are cells); low folate counts can also contribute to low platelet counts. Folate-rich foods like asparagus, oranges, spinach, and fortified (whole grain, low sugar) cereals should be a part of your diet anyway. Vitamin supplements may also be a consideration, so talk to your doctor.
Watch your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which are an immune-system booster with anti-inflammatory properties found in fish, edible seaweed, walnuts, flaxseed oil, and fortified eggs. People with cardiovascular disease risks can benefit from consuming more omega-3. However, omega 3 fatty acids inhibit platelet-activating factor and reduce platelet activation, so in the case of thrombocytopenia, omega-3 fa are contraindicated.

, Low-nutrient, high calorie foods, such as foods with refined grains (white bread, for example) and sugars (cakes, cookies, etc.) provide little benefit to the body and are considered by some to increase inflammation.Heavy alcohol consumption can damage bone marrow and decrease platelet production,so it is probably wise to severely restrict or even eliminate alcohol consumption if you are trying to increase platelet levels.
Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease (essentially a gluten allergy) are autoimmune disorders that may negatively impact platelet counts. Consider being tested for these disorders and, if so, eliminate gluten from your diet., Cardiovascular workouts, like walking or swimming, and strength training exercises promote blood flow within the body and can help boost your immune system, both of which can be beneficial if you have a low platelet count.


You need to be smart and take precautions, however. If you have thrombocytopenia, you may fatigue more easily. Fatigue and overexertion can make you more susceptible to injury.
Take special care not to engage in bleeding risk activities — not just external but internal bleeding (bruising).Remember that with a low platelet count, your blood will clot more slowly.
Sports and impact activities — pickup basketball and skating, to name some examples — need to be done with extra caution or not at all. Protect yourself from scrapes, cuts, and bruises even while walking by wearing good fitting shoes with traction, layering loose-fitting clothing, and generally paying attention.
On a side note regarding bleeding risks, talk to your doctor about over-the counter medications that may increase this risk, such as aspirin and other pain relievers., Seven to nine hours of sleep is recommended for adults regardless of platelet count, but those seeking to boost their count can only benefit from allowing their body time to rest and recharge.


You may feel tired more often if you have a low platelet count, so you need to balance your need for rest with the benefits of remaining (carefully) active. Consult your physician.

, Everybody needs water, and few of us consume enough. A properly hydrated body is a better functioning body, one that may be more conducive to platelet formation.


The average adult should consume between two-to-three liters of liquids daily, so the old adage of drinking eight (8 oz.) glasses of water today is fairly accurate.Some espouse drinking warm or even hot water to boost platelet levels because colder water slows the digestive process and therefore can hinder nutrient absorption.At the very least, drinking water at any palatable temperature can’t hurt, so give this a try if you wish.

, Always good advice, especially when facing a medical problem such as thrombocytopenia.It may be hard to quantify the benefits of a positive attitude, but this is another piece of advice that certainly can’t hurt your chances of improvement.

, When that shaving nick or cut on your finger or nosebleed stops bleeding, platelets are at work. They are cells in the bloodstream that tend to clump together and thus work to plug up avenues of escape for your circulating blood.Individual platelets exist for only about 10 days in your bloodstream, so they are in constant need of replenishment. An average healthy person has somewhere between 150,000 and 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.
If you are told your platelet count is 150, then, it means you have 150,000 platelets per microliter of blood.

, A wide range of factors can cause your platelet count to be low. The condition is known as thrombocytopenia when your count is under 150.


These include immune system disorders (in which platelets are mistakenly attacked), leukemia (because platelets are created in bone marrow), chemotherapy (when platelets are destroyed as collateral damage), pregnancy (the strain placed on the body’s systems may harm platelet counts), and several other possible causes.Symptoms of thrombocytopenia can include fatigue, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, bleeding from gums or nose, blood in urine or stool, and pin-sized purple-red rashes on the lower legs and feet.If you have these symptoms, talk to your doctor about possibly testing to determine your platelet count.

, If you do have a low platelet count and the reason why is not already clear, more testing may be done. (For instance, a malfunctioning spleen may be incorrectly filtering platelets out of the bloodstream.)


Usually the cause of thrombocytopenia can be determined, and sometimes the best treatment can be to just wait it out (as is often the case during pregnancy), but discuss treatment options with your doctor.Talk to the medical professionals treating your thrombocytopenia regarding more natural options for increasing, or at least stabilizing, your platelet levels. The particulars of your condition can have a significant impact on what options may be right for you.
To repeat, do not try to raise your platelet levels without the guidance of your medical team.

, While it is nice to believe you'll be able to raise your platelet levels naturally, and it usually won't hurt to try, the specifics of your condition and severity of your thrombocytopenia may necessitate medical treatments. These often include:Treatments for the underlying cause of the condition; for instance, replacing heparin with another blood thinner if that is causing your thrombocytopenia. It is important to not just stop taking a blood thinner your are prescribed, especially if you take it to combat a cardiovascular condition.
Transfusions of packed red blood cells or platelets, to directly increase the platelet count in your blood.
Medication such as a corticosteroid or other immune system suppressant, if that is determined to be the problem. Your doctor will discuss precautions you will need to take, as you may be more susceptible to infection.
Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) if that organ is malfunctioning and improperly filtering out healthy platelets.
Plasma exchange, which is usually only used in severe cases that cause emergency situations.

, There are countless websites with countless opinions about how low platelet counts can be increased naturally. Making sense of the wide-ranging and often contradictory information available can be a challenge, and is part of the reason why your physician should be involved.


Sample diets from reputable organizations that focus on platelet disorders can differ on the value of consuming milk, for instance, demonstrating the challenge in determining the proper course to follow.There is, in truth, little scientifically-supported evidence that a particular diet can increase platelet levels, for example.What seems closer to scientific fact is the idea that changes in diet can help defend against platelet decreases.
Does this mean you have no options? No. It just means you need to do your homework, manage your expectations, and rely on your medical team for advice and assistance.

Look at the Western hand reflexology chart.,
Learn about the Indian, or Ayurvedic, hand chart.,
Look at the Korean hand chart.,
Consider doing spot massages for specific ailments.",How to Read a Hand Reflexology Chart1," This chart shows a connection between the fingertips and the upper part of the head, such as the sinuses, eyes, brain, ears. The palm of the hand contains the larger inner organs.Reproductive organs such as the testes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are found connecting to the inner wrist just beneath the hand.
The thumb and the first 2 fingers contain more complex connections to the inner organs than do the outer 2 fingers.;
, The Indian reflexology chart (or acupressure chart) contains several key differences from the Western hand reflexology chart. The pressure points on the Indian chart are primarily located in the palm of the hand, while the fingertips are shown connected to the sinus region. The thumb contains connection to the brain and the pituitary gland.The Ayurvedic chart connects the inner world with the radial (thumb side), and the outer world with with the ulnar (little finger side).
In keeping with the inner/outer distinction, the connection with the eyes is found on the radial side of the palm, beneath the first 2 fingers (index and middle). The connection with the ears is found beneath the last 2 fingers (ring finger and pinky).

, This hand reflexology chart is unusual in that it doesn't include any areas of the wrist. Reproductive organs are shown connected to the area within the palm of the hand. The Korean, or Koryo Hand Therapy (KHT systems), chart is shown with hand supine and prone, and makes no distinction between left and right hands.The spine, in the Korean system, is shown to be connected to the central axis of the hand, along the line of the middle finger and extending down along the exterior of the hand.
Each finger is shown connecting to a different region of the body in this chart.

, For example, pinching the area between the middle finger and the ring finger may help with eye conditions such as conjunctivitis or eyestrain. If you have allergies, they might be helped by pressing gently on the adrenal gland area, which is found on the area sometimes known as the ""Mound of Venus"".You can also hold a golf ball and roll it with both hands over the areas of your hand to apply pressure.
If you suffer from tension or anxiety, try pinching the skin area between your thumb and your first finger.

Slowly let the air out.,

Note when the sound stops.,
Record the measurements.,
Take the pressure again if it's high.,
Understand the dial.,
Know how to write blood pressure.,
Know what constitutes high blood pressure.",How to Read an Aneroid Manometer," When you look at the dial, make sure it is at the zero baseline before starting. If it isn't, you need to calibrate it using a mercury manometer. Connect it with a Y connector, and once you move the dial over, check the pressure at several readings on both meters to make sure the aneroid manometer matches the mercury manometer., Larger patients will need larger cuffs; otherwise, their blood pressure will read higher than it actually is. Similarly, smaller patients will need smaller cuffs; otherwise, their blood pressure will read lower than it actually is.To pick the right size cuff, measure the bladder of the cuff against your patient's arm. The bladder is the part of the cuff where the air enters it. The bladder should go at least 80 percent of the way around the patient's arm., You should perform this step even if you think the patient can't hear you due to unconsciousness. Tell the patient that you are going to use a cuff to take his blood pressure, and that he will feel some pressure from the cuff.Remind the patient that he should not talk while you are taking his blood pressure.Try to calm down an anxious patient by asking about his day or something he enjoys. You can also ask him to take a few deep breaths to relax him. If you take the reading while he is still anxious, it can give a falsely high reading.Nonetheless, some patients will always be nervous in a doctor's office.
If the patient is very anxious, try giving him five minutes to relax and calm down.

, Ask if the patient has had an alcoholic beverage or smoked a cigarette in the 15 minutes prior to the test. Those two actions can affect the reading.Also ask the patient if she is on any medications that may affect blood pressure readings., The patient can be standing, sitting, or lying down. If the patient is sitting, the arm should be bent at the elbow and his feet should be flat on the floor. Ensure that the arm is resting at the same level at the heart.If the patient supports his own arm, it can lead to a false reading.The patient's arm should be bare of restrictive clothing with the sleeves of any clothing comfortably rolled up. However, ensure that the rolled-up clothing isn't cutting off the blood supply.The arm should be slightly flexed at the elbow, and supported throughout the reading on a flat, stable surface.
Make sure the patient is comfortable in this position. If he's not, it can give a falsely high reading., Find the middle of the bladder by folding it in half.Make sure it doesn't have air in it already.Palpate the brachial artery (the large artery on the inside of the elbow) with your fingers. Place the center of the bladder directly over the brachial artery., Wrap the cuff of the manometer snugly around the patient's exposed upper arm. The bottom edge of the cuff should be approximately one inch above the bend of the elbow.The cuff should be fairly tight to get an accurate reading. It should be tight enough that it should be hard for you to get two fingers under the edge of the cuff., Put your fingers over the brachial artery. Hold them there until you can feel a pulse, called the radial pulse., This step should be done quickly. You should let the cuff reach a point where you can't feel the radial pulse anymore. Note the pressure in mmHg.That pressure is a general guide for the systolic pressure., Release the air from the cuff. Add 30 mmHg to your previous reading. That is, if you lost the pulse at 120 mmHg, add 30 to reach 150 mmHg.If you don't want to take it twice, a standard recommendation is to inflate to 180 mmHg., You should hold the bell of the stethoscope on the patient's skin just below the edge of the cuff. It should center on the brachial artery so that you can hear the blood flow.Never use your thumb to hold the head of the stethoscope in place. The thumb has a pulse of its own which can interfere with your ability to hear the patient's pulse. Hold the stethoscope in place with your index and middle fingers instead.

, Add air into the cuff rapidly, until it reaches the number you found by adding 30 mmHg. Once you've hit that number, stop adding air., Let the air deflate from the cuff at a rate of 2 to 3 mmHg a second. While it is deflating, make sure you are listening in the stethoscope., You should hear a knocking or beating sound, called ""Korotkoff"" sounds. When that sound begins, note the reading on the dial. That reading is the systolic pressure.The systolic number represents the pressure that blood exerts against the walls of an artery following a heart beat or contraction., After the beating starts, at some point you'll hear a rushing or ""whooshing"" noise. Once you can't hear that sound anymore, that reading is the diastolic pressure. Note that number, too. Release the rest of the air.The diastolic number represents the pressure that blood exerts on the walls of an artery when the heart relaxes between contractions., Write down the high and low numbers, as well as what size cuff you used. Also, write what arm was used and the position the patient was in., You should take the blood pressure an additional two times if it's high; wait a couple of minutes between readings. Take the average of the last two readings as the final reading. If the final reading is high, you will want the patient to monitor her blood pressure to determine if she may have hypertension.Keep in mind that two to three tests are not enough to determine hypertension.


The patient should record her blood pressure for two to three weeks and record the results and bring this information to her physician for a proper diagnosis.

, The dial runs from 0 mmHg up to about 300 mmHg. You shouldn't need numbers much past 200, as even systolic pressures over 180 constitute an emergency., Blood pressure is written with the systolic pressure first. Generally, it's followed by a slash and the diastolic pressure.For instance, a normal blood pressure would read 115/75., Stage 1 high blood pressure (also called hypertension) is 140 to 159 in systolic pressure and 90 to 99 in diastolic pressure. Stage 2 high blood pressure is 160 or above in systolic pressure and 100 or above in diastolic pressure. If you're taking your own blood pressure, go to the emergency room if your systolic pressure is over 180 or your diastolic pressure is over 110.Prehypertension runs from 120 to 139 in systolic pressure and 80 to 89 in diastolic pressure. A normal blood pressure range is anything under that, though your blood pressure can be too low.Doctors do not have an exact range for low blood pressure. Generally, low blood pressure is only a problem if you're having symptoms. Symptoms include dizziness, an inability to concentrate, thirstiness, tiredness, nausea, fast breathing, and blurry vision."

Think about body's division into 10 zones.,
Consider body's meridians.,
Understand the automatic reflex arc.,
Know the difference between reflexology and massage.",How to Read a Hand Reflexology Chart2," A reflexologist named William H. Fitzgerald first divided the body into 10 zones, 5 on each side. These zones extend from fingertips to toes, and front to back, so that all areas of the body are included. Each zone has a corresponding area on a person's hands or feet.Reflexology allows specific relationship between the internal organ and the application of pressure on the hand.
A hand reflexology chart reveals the connection between the area of the hand and the inner organs of the body.
There may be a good deal of variation between hand reflexology charts, compared to the more consistent reflexology charts of the foot., The body's division into 12 meridians is an ancient Chinese practice which closely parallel's Fitzgerald's division of the body into zones. In this system of understanding, the body's energy (or chi) runs through these meridians and nourishes the body and spirit. If the pathways become clogged or weakened, health issues will result.Reading a hand reflexology chart can help you understand the relationship between the area on the hand and the affected body area.
Applying pressure to the reflex areas may help relieve stress and tension, help balance the body and allow all organs work together.

, There are two types of reflex arcs in the human body: somatic reflex arcs, which affect the muscles, and automatic reflex arcs, which affect the inner organs. Hand reflexology is based in the automatic reflex arc. The automatic reflex arc allows the body to respond to conditions without utilizing the brain. Instead, it is a function of the central nervous system.One way to understand the automatic reflex arc is to imagine the body's response to touching a hot stove. If your hand touches a hot stove, it moves away more quickly than your brain can process the pain. Your hand reacts via automatic reflex.Hand reflexology functions on this reflex principle, addressing problems of the inner organs.

, Massage addresses physically challenges directly. That is, when the body is injured, massage may be applied to the injured area as a healing method. Reflexology works on the principle that relies on the nervous system to relay the healing touch to the injured area.


For areas that are unable to be touched, such as the inner organs, glands, and organs of digestion and elimination, use reflexology to help treatment.
For muscle pains, spasms, or tension, use massage.

Rinse your wound.,
Stop the bleeding.,
Handle excessive blood flow.,
Make a tourniquet.,
Inspect the wound.,
Be wary of puncture wounds and animal bites.,
Rinse the wound again.,
Clean the wound.,
Bandage the wound.,
Look for signs of infection.",How to Quickly Treat a Cut or Bleeding Scrape," As soon as you injure yourself, wash out the wound with water. Find the nearest source of running water and stick the wound underneath it to wash away the blood. This will also help remove any foreign objects that might have gotten into a cut when you injured it or ground into an abrasion when you scraped it, such as dirt. It will also help wash away any microscopic bacteria that might have gotten into the wound when you broke the skin.


Rinse your wound for a while, making sure at least two liters of flowing water have passed over your wound.
If you don't have running water, cleanse the wound with antibacterial wash or gel.;
, Immediately following your injury and once any debris or matter is removed, apply pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding. Use a clean towel, cloth, or garment on the wound. Ball a portion of the garment to lie directly over the wound and apply pressure. Continue to apply pressure for seven to ten minutes, which is the normal rate of blood flow on superficial wounds. Resist the temptation to check on the wound because that will remove the clot and blood flow will begin again.If you have a first aid kit, use sterile gauze from the kit to put pressure on the wound instead of cloth.

, If the blood is pulsing or squirting from the wound or if the dressing where you are applying pressure becomes soaked with blood, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. With these symptoms, you may need stitches or staples to close the wound and stop the bleeding. You may also have a small bleeding arteriole that needs to be tied off individually with sutures to stop the bleeding.


If you know the person is taking blood thinners, take them to an emergency room right away, especially if the wound is on their head.
If the wound is greater than 1 centimeter (0.39 in) deep, it will require sutures or stitches. , There are some cases that need extra preparation before you seek medical care. If your wound is 4cm to 5cm deep, you need to make a tourniquet to stop the bleeding before you seek medical care. Keep the cloth over the wound while you apply pressure. Use another piece of cloth or towel and place it above the wound. Wrap it around the injured area and tie it tightly above the wound, cutting off the circulation to the wound.


The tourniquet is considered above the wound if it is between the wound and the area of your body closest to the heart. For example, if you have a bad cut on your lower leg, you need to tie the tourniquet closer to your knee than near your foot.
Certain body parts are highly vascular and will bleed profusely when cut, such as the scalp. If you have sustained a large cut on the scalp, go directly to the emergency room, as they bleed readily. , You need to inspect the wound once it stops bleeding. Get to the cleanest, safest area that you can. You don't want to risk infection from environmental contaminants. Examine the wound to figure out how deep it is. If it is less than 1cm, you do not need to seek outside medical help and you can continue to clean the wound on your own.


If it looks deeper than 1cm, you will need stitches, even if the blood stopped flowing. Reapply the pressure dressing and seek medical attention as soon as possible.
If you have a large area of abrasion, which is greater than 12 cm by 12 cm, with a significant amount of particulate matter, seek medical attention as well so the area can be appropriately cleansed. That much debris will cause infection if not removed. This can be done by a doctor under local anesthesia. If the wound is dirty or caused by something rusty and it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus shot, you will need a tetanus shot right away.

, Wounds can be misleading. Small wounds, such as puncture wounds, may seem small but they can be quite deep and are often full of bacteria. They also often become infected. This is particularly true of animal or human bites, so always seek medical attention for this kind of wound. Bacteria that live in the mouths of humans, cats, dogs, and other animals contain pasteurella and other virulent bacteria that can lead you from a small bite to the operating room within 24 hours.This is also true of fight bites, which are incurred during a fist fight. When one individual hits another in the mouth and gets accidentally bitten by the others teeth, the wounds are also particularly prone to infection.
A bite may need to be treated with prescription antibiotics to prevent infection. Make sure you go to the doctor or emergency room to deal with bites.

, If your wound does not need medical care, you can take care of it at home. Rinse the wound with warm water to remove the excess blood. This may disrupt clotted blood and the wound may ooze or begin bleeding again.


This is normal and shows that there is no significant vascular damage to contend with and the bleeding will stop again after cleansing.

, Once you rinse your wound of the initial blood, you can clean the wound. First, wash your hands with soap and hot water. This will help prevent contamination of the wound and help stop infection. Next, soak a gauze or clean cloth in a providone-Iodine solution such as Betadine. This will kill any bacteria that you will have encountered when your skin broke. Once you clean the wound with the solution, pat it dry with sterile gauze or a clean cloth.


If irrigation of the wound did not get out all of the debris in the wound, such as twigs, thorns, or pebbles, use tweezers to very carefully pull out the remaining debris. Do not probe the wound because you could injure yourself further.
If you don't have any providone-Iodine solution, you can use any antiseptic wash that is used on open wounds. If you don't have any solution at all, you can rinse the wound out for an additional amount of time to ensure it is cleaned as well as possible.

, Once your wound has been adequately rinsed and cleaned, you need to bandage it to keep it protected. First, apply antibacterial ointment such as Neosporin to the wound with gauze, a cotton ball, or a Q-tip. Next, if your wound is small and superficial, use a band-aid to cover the wound. If it is larger, grab a fresh set of gauze and medical tape from your first aid kit. Place the gauze over the wound and secure the edges of the bandage with tape. This will keep debris out.


If you do not have gauze and medical tape, you need to purchase wound supplies at the drug store or pharmacy. The wound needs to be bandaged properly with sterile supplies in order to prevent infection.
If the wound is over a flexible joint, buy rolled gauze to make it more easily managed and the bandage more secure.

, After your initial dressing, perform the cleansing and dressing ritual daily. When you are cleaning the wound, you need to look for signs of infection. These include redness at the wound edges, especially if the wound area expands from one day to the next, drainage or pus on the wound, and a fever. As long as no signs of infection present themselves, your wound should heal within a two to three week time frame.


Lower extremity wounds or wounds on those who are obese may take on the longer to heal.

Remove the belt when it is no longer needed.",How to Put on a Gait Belt," Before handling the equipment or the patient, you should wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.;
, Let the patient know that you intend to put the gait belt on. Describe how it goes on, what it will be used for, and when it will be removed. Answer any questions that the patient might have, as well.

, Make sure that the patient is wearing loose, comfortable clothes and shoes with a sturdy rubber sole.


You will need to place the belt over the patient's clothing. Never put a gait belt on directly over bare skin.
Shoes with rubber soles are ideal since they will give the patient the greatest amount of grip when his or her feet hit the floor. This will make it easier for the patient to stand (if necessary) and can help prevent accidental falls during the transfer.

, If your patient needs any additional equipment, make sure that it is ready and waiting before you put the gait belt on.If you are transferring the patient to a wheelchair, the wheels of the device should be locked.
Make sure that the wheelchair, walker, or cane you intend to transfer the patient to is directly next to you and within sight of both you and the patient.

, For patients lying in bed, adjust the level of the bed so that it is as low to the ground as possible.


Doing so reduces the risk of possible injury and makes the application and use of the gait belt much easier.
You should also make sure that the wheels of the bed are locked in place. If the bed were to shift during the transfer, you and/or the patient could be injured.

, The gait belt is easiest to put on when the patient is sitting up straight in a bed or chair. As long as the patient is physically capable of sitting up, you should ease him or her into that upright position.


Help direct and move the patient so that his or her legs can hang over the side of the bed.
Pause after this part of the process to make sure that the patient does not become dizzy. Do not continue with the patient in an upright position if he or she complains of dizziness or claims to feel faint after this.
If the patient cannot maintain a sense of balance while sitting or must otherwise remain flat, you can put the gait belt on while he or she is lying in bed. The procedure is essentially the same but does require more strength on the part of the person who will lift the patient.

, Center the belt horizontally around the patient's waist. Do not wrap it around the chest or hips.


If the patient is very frail or sensitive, you may need to place a soft towel in between the belt and the patient's body to prevent the belt from digging into his or her skin., Snap the buckle together, centering it over the front or back of the patient.


The buckle should actually be positioned just a little off-center. Right-handed caregivers should position the buckle to the right of the spine, but left-handed caregivers should position the buckle to the left of the spine.
Listen for an audible ""click"" when you snap the buckle halves together. Regardless of whether you hear the noise or not, you should also make sure that the buckle is secure by tugging outward on the belt in opposite directions on either side of the buckle.

, As a general rule, you should be able to slip two fingers in between the patient and the belt without any excess room.


The belt must be tight enough to prevent it from moving up or down the patient's torso as you work.
On the other hand, it must also be loose enough to be comfortable and easy to grab. At no point should the belt squeeze or constrict the patient.

, Gently turn the patient until that individual can see the spot he or she is being transferred to, regardless of whether that spot is a wheelchair, walker, or other option.


If the patient has a weak side, his or her strong side should face the intended transfer destination.

, Move in toward the patient, positioning yourself as close to him or her as possible. Keep your feet apart, your back straight, and your knees bent and flexible.


You should face the front of the patient. Do not attempt to lift from the back.

, Wrap your arms around the patient from the front. Slide your hands under the belt and hook your thumbs over the other side to help anchor your grip.


Make sure that you hold the patient at the waist and not around the arms or shoulders.
Bring both of your hands up from the bottom of the belt with your palms away from the patient's back. Dig firmly into the web of the belt with your hands when you grab onto the gait belt.
When held correctly, your elbow should be behind the patient's back in a way that would allow you to use it to help steady the patient if he or she began to fall.

, Lift the patient using leverage provided by your knees. Move your body in the direction of the transfer as you lift.


If the patient is capable of doing so, encourage him or her to push on the mattress with his or her hands as you lift. Ask the patient to place his or her feet on the floor, too.
If it is possible for him or her to do so, instruct the patient to stand briefly while leaning toward you as you adjust your grip.Note that patients who cannot use their legs will not be able to do this, however.
As you lift, you may need to remove your non-dominant hand from the gait belt to support the patient's back. Always keep your dominant hand hooked into the gait belt, though.
Move your entire body as you move the patient. Do not twist your back since doing so can cause an injury to you., Gently lower the patient into the wheelchair or seat, or help the patient stand in an upright position as a walker or cane is readied.


If you are lowering the patient into a chair, encourage him or her to reach toward the destination as you lower that individual into it.
Similarly, you should encourage the patient to grab his or her walker or cane before you release your grasp on the individual. When using a cane, note that the patient should hold the cane with the hand located on his or her strong side.
If you are using the gait belt to assist the patient as he or she walks, position yourself diagonally and slightly to the rear of the patient on that individual's weak side. Hold the belt using an underhanded grip near the small of the patient's back as you help him or her take each step.

, Once the entire transfer is complete, unsnap the buckle and slide the gait belt off of the patient.


To remove the belt, simply unsnap the buckle and unwrap the belt from around the patient's waist.
Help the patient ease back down into a lying position in the bed when necessary.
Wash your hands again with hot water and soap when the entire process is finished.

Provide evidence that you hired the doctor.,
Demonstrate that the doctor agreed to be hired.,
Find related medical records.,
Research the medical standard of care.,
Line up expert witnesses.,
Compare your doctor's care to the medical standard.,

Get copies of any medical bills or additional expenses.,
Gather witnesses who will testify to your pain and suffering.,
Collect documents to support any missed work.,
Collect evidence that your doctor's negligence worsened your condition.,
Distinguish your harm from any underlying medical condition.,
Line up expert witnesses to testify on your behalf.,
Use the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.",How to Prove Medical Malpractice," You must have receipts or other evidence that proves you hired the doctor to perform medical services for you.


Generally this isn't a difficult element to prove. The existence of a doctor-patient relationship typically goes unchallenged in most medical malpractice cases.;
, To establish the existence of a doctor-patient relationship, you must also prove that the doctor agreed to perform the medical services you requested.


Evidence that you hired the doctor, and that the doctor agreed to be hired, together constitute a doctor-patient relationship. Where this relationship exists, the doctor has certain duties towards you as a patient.Part of this duty includes the duty to use the applicable professional standard of care when providing medical treatment to you.Showing the existence of a doctor-patient relationship is crucial for proving medical malpractice. Medical malpractice is negligence, and no one is liable for damages due to negligence absent a legal duty of care to the victim of that negligence. In a medical malpractice case, that legal duty of care arises out of the doctor-patient relationship., Records such as bills or other correspondence can provide additional evidence of a continuing doctor-patient relationship.


Although existence of a doctor-patient relationship is an element of medical malpractice that is seldom challenged, this evidence ensures the doctor doesn't have an opportunity to claim there was no relationship.You often can prove a doctor-patient relationship even absent an explicit agreement, if the care actually happened. For example, if a doctor provided treatment to you in a public park during a medical emergency, that would be considered a doctor-patient relationship regardless of the absence of any explicit agreement.Questions about or challenges to the existence of a doctor-patient relationship most often arise when another physician was consulted about your case and offered advice but did not treat you directly., The medical standard of care for a given procedure generally would be what a doctor exercising ordinary care would do in that situation.


Just because you are unhappy with the treatment or dislike the result of a procedure does not mean that your doctor committed malpractice. He must have breached a particular standard of care.The medical standard of care is what the doctor should have done. You generally must prove that the doctor didn't do what a similarly-trained doctor would have done if working under similar circumstances., Most states require doctors testify as expert witnesses regarding the medical standard of care.


These experts must be willing and able to provide meticulous details about what a reasonably skilled doctor in your doctor's situation would be expected to do.To establish a generally accepted standard of medical care, other doctors qualified in the same area of medical practice as the doctor you're suing must be willing to testify as to what level of care is recognized in the profession as that used by someone competent and qualified to practice.Geographical area also has some bearing on similarly situated doctors for the purposes of establishing a standard of medical care. For example, you would not hold a doctor in Buford, Wyoming (the smallest town in the U.S.) to the same standard you would hold a doctor practicing in New York City.
Your experts will first establish what a competent and reasonably skilled doctor would have done in the same situation as your doctor. Then they will apply that standard to your case to demonstrate what your doctor did wrong.In some situations, general clinical practice standards also may be used to demonstrate the accepted standard of medical care, but these published standards are typically considered supplemental and would not replace expert testimony.Some states require some sort of expert testimony to be included when you file your initial complaint., To prove your doctor was negligent, you must show that your doctor's care failed to live up to the medical standard.


Generally your experts must be able not only to identify the appropriate standard, but to testify that the actions of your doctor did not meet that standard.There may be different types of standards for different aspects of practice. For example, your doctor may have negligently prescribed medications if he ignored the manufacturer's instructions or provided an incorrect medication or dosage. In these cases, you may need a representative from the pharmaceutical manufacturer to testify as to the information typically provided to doctors.In some cases, it also may be negligence if your doctor failed to get your informed consent before she performed a specific procedure., You may lose the ability to file a medical malpractice suit if you delay too long.


Missing the statute of limitations means you can no longer recover for any damages you suffered.
In many states, you must file your claim fairly quickly after the negligent act occurred. Others start the clock ticking from the point you should have discovered the injury. Regardless, you typically have between six months and two years to file your claim.If you think you may have a medical malpractice case, check the statute of limitations in your state or consult an attorney as quickly as possible to avoid losing your ability to file suit.

, You must show all money you spent that you allege were a result of your doctor's negligence.


All of your medical bills will serve as evidence of the costs you incurred treating the additional injury you suffered as a result of your doctor's malpractice.

, If you have any friends or family members that have seen your suffering as a result of your doctor's negligence, ask if they are willing to testify on your behalf.


In addition to monetary losses such as additional medical costs, medical malpractice plaintiffs also are able to collect money for physical and mental pain and suffering.Solid testimony from witnesses is crucial to establishing any extensive pain and suffering.
Keep in mind that many states limit or ""cap"" the amount of money you can win in a medical malpractice case. Often these caps apply more stringently to damages awarded for pain and suffering., Any time you missed from work as a result of the doctor's negligence also should be included in your damages.


Your damages include any income you lost or will lose as a result of being unable to work.You also can claim damages for lost earning capacity.For example, you may have lost so much time from work that you were passed up for a promotion you otherwise would have gotten.

, It's not enough to prove that your doctor was negligent and that you suffered harm, you must also prove that your harm occurred as a direct result of your doctor's negligence.


For example, one common type of medical malpractice is a doctor's failure to diagnose. If you can prove that a competent doctor would have discovered your illness or made a different diagnosis in time to provide you with a better outcome, your doctor may be liable for damages due to medical malpractice.Part of showing your injury was caused directly by your doctor's error is showing that your injury was reasonably foreseeable as a result of your doctor's error.For example, suppose it's well known among doctors that infections are common following a certain procedure. However, there's a medication that can be prescribed that all but eliminates the risk of infection. A doctor exercising reasonable care would prescribe this medication to his patients after performing that procedure. However, your doctor did not prescribe the medication to you. As a result, you got an infection. That infection was reasonably foreseeable.

, Your doctor may argue that your harm would have occurred regardless of his negligence, so you must be prepared to prove that the harm you suffered was different from the harm you would have suffered otherwise.


The key is to prove that your injuries were directly attributable to the substandard care you received from your doctor – in other words, that if you had received care that met the general medical standard, you would not have suffered the injuries that you did.This may be one of the most difficult parts of your medical malpractice case. Medicine is not an exact science, and both doctor and patient assume all sorts of risks in undertaking any course of treatment. The injuries caused directly by your doctor's negligence may be hidden by the course of injury or disease as a whole., Although expert witnesses may not be required, other doctors often are the best way to prove that your harm occurred as a direct result of your doctor's negligence.


Many plaintiffs find it beneficial in proving medical malpractice to have additional expert witnesses on record as stating that the injuries that are the subject matter of the lawsuit were directly caused by the doctor's substandard care of his patient., The doctrine ""res ipsa loquitur"" means ""the thing speaks for itself,"" and if you can use it, you can shift the burden of proof from yourself to the doctor.


This means that rather than having to prove that the doctor's acts were negligent, you put the doctor in the position of having to prove that his acts were not negligent.
To use the doctrine, you must ultimately show that your injury could not have been caused by anything other than instruments or actions over which your doctor had sole control.A classic example of res ipsa loquitur in the medical malpractice context is if a surgeon closes up the patient's body after surgery and leaves a surgical tool inside, which later injures the patient in some way."

Choose the type of trust.,
Decide on trustees.,
Calculate the look-back period.,
Draft the trust documents.,
Execute the trust documents.,
Transfer assets into the trust.",How to Protect Estate Assets of Someone on Medical Assistance1," To protect the estate assets of someone on medical assistance using a trust, the trust created generally must be irrevocable. Creating a revocable trust would mean the person still had control over the assets in the trust.With an irrevocable trust, however, the person no longer owns the assets. Rather, the assets belong to the trust.
Since the assets in the trust don't belong to the person on medical assistance, they can't be seized by the government to recoup the costs of the person's medical care after their death.
Rather, the assets are held by the trust for the benefit of the heirs named by the person who creates the trust.
If the person on medical assistance is married, they may want to create a joint trust rather than an individual trust. A joint trust includes all marital assets.;
, The trust must name a trustee. Typically it's best if the person on medical assistance is not the trustee. Otherwise, the state may determine they still maintain control over the assets in the trust. Similarly, the person's spouse shouldn't be the trustee. When looking at assets of a married person, the assets in control of both spouses are considered for the purposes of qualifying for medical assistance.
To ensure the trust is properly managed, many people name an attorney or financial advisor as trustee.
Also name a successor trustee. This person will take over in case the trustee becomes unavailable. It may be another attorney or financial advisor, or another family member.

, When someone applies for medical assistance, the state looks back at their income and assets for the five years before the application was filed. Any transfers made to protect estate assets can result in penalties.State and federal law requires people on medical assistance to spend down any assets they have that exceed the legal limit before they can qualify for the government service.
If someone on medical assistance transfers all or most of their assets to a trust during this period, the state presumes this was done to exclude those assets for the purposes of qualification.
As a result, the state will deem the person ineligible for a period of time, based on the value of the assets that were transferred.
The period of time is measured based on the cost of medical assistance for nursing home care each month.
For example, if that cost is $3,000 and the person transferred assets worth $27,000 to a trust, that person would be ineligible for medical assistance for nine months.
To avoid this penalty, the trust must be created more than five years before the person applies for medical assistance. However, even if the penalty applies, the assets still are not subject to liens or seizure by the state to cover the costs of the person's medical assistance.

, It can be relatively simple to find forms or templates online that you can use to create a simple trust. However, if the goal is to protect the estate assets of someone on medical assistance, you may want to consult an attorney.The trust begins by naming the trust and identifying the trustees and successor trustees.
The property in the trust is listed, along with the names of the beneficiaries of the trust. Typically beneficiaries are children or grandchildren of the person on medical assistance, but they may include others as well.
If the person on medical assistance (or who will potentially be on medical assistance in the near future) already has a will, that document can serve as a guide to designating the beneficiaries of the trust.
Keep in mind that if the person already has estate planning documents, they will need to be updated to reflect the trust that has been created. You may want to consult an estate planning attorney to help.

, The finalized trust documents must be signed by the person on medical assistance before the trust goes into effect. Typically the signatures must be notarized. Some states may require additional witnesses.Some states also require more than one original signed copy. Check your state law or contact an estate planning attorney to find out.
Make copies of the signed, notarized documents. Each trustee or successor trustee should have one, as well as the person who created the trust and their spouse.
You also may want to make copies for beneficiaries, particularly those who will be receiving real property.

, After the trust has been executed, all assets listed can be transferred into the name of the trust. This may require opening bank accounts in the name of the trust, or executing other transfer documents such as deeds.Before you set up bank accounts or transfer real property to the trust, you'll need to get an employer identification number (EIN) for the trust from the IRS.
Despite the name, an EIN isn't just for employers. You also must get one for a trust that will hold assets, particularly income-generating assets. You'll also need an EIN to open up bank accounts in the name of the trust.
Once you have an EIN for the trust, you transfer assets into the name of the trust just as you'd transfer assets to any other individual or business entity.

Gather information about the person's debts.,
Identify exempt assets.,
Make advance payments.,
Document payments to family members.",How to Protect Estate Assets of Someone on Medical Assistance2," Using someone's assets to pay off debts may not directly protect estate assets from the government. However, since debts would be paid out of the estate, fewer debts mean more estate assets.For example, assets can be used to pay off credit cards or personal loans. Since available credit is not considered an asset, these payments do not affect the person's eligibility for medical assistance.
Paying off existing debts and obligations also doesn't qualify as a transfer that could result in a penalty if done within five years before the person applies for medical assistance.
In addition to paying debts, it's also possible to use assets to purchase exempt items. For example, the person could buy a new HVAC unit or new roof for their primary residence.

, Certain assets, such as a personal residence, a car, and other personal items such as furniture and clothing, are exempt from seizure by the government to recoup medical assistance.The homestead exemption covers the primary residence of the person on medical assistance if their spouse still lives in the home, or if the person is reasonably expected to return home after long-term stay in a nursing home.
For example, the homestead exemption would apply to the primary residence of an unmarried individual who was staying in a nursing home for several months to recover after hip surgery, but was expected to return home.
Keep in mind that people are expected to use the equity in their home to cover their long-term care expenses. The government will put a lien on the property if it is owned by the person on medical assistance.
For this reason, transferring the home to a trust may protect it for future generations.
Another way to protect the home is to transfer the deed to the person who would get it under a will or other estate plan, and then grant the person on medical assistance a life estate in the property.
However, the government can reach life estate properties as well in some circumstances. Contact an attorney if you're thinking about using this option to protect the estate assets of someone on medical assistance.

, If the person on medical assistance has regular bills that are due each month, you may be able to make advance payments on those bills using the person's liquid assets.Keep in mind that this doesn't preserve assets for the estate in a direct sense. However, advance payments for regular bills decrease that person's expenses while they remain in a nursing home.
Fewer expenses means more assets for the person's estate. It also means the person's spouse, children, or grandchildren aren't forced to pay these expenses on their behalf while they're in a nursing home.
Property taxes are a good regular expense on which you can make advance payments.
One benefit of making advance payments is that this sort of transfer can be made at any time. Even if made during the look-back period (in other words, less than five years before the person starts medical assistance), these payments are considered totally valid and won't affect the person's eligibility for medical assistance.

, A person on medical assistance can pay a family member for services. However, those services must be provided under a written contract. The family member's payment cannot exceed the usual payment for similar services. These payments can be used to transfer assets to a family member that would have been passed on using a will, trust, or other estate planning document.
For example, suppose Sally wants to leave her son $10,000. She has to spend down her assets before entering the nursing home so she will qualify for medical assistance.
Sally drafts a contract with her son under which she pays him $1,000 a month to serve as caretaker and landscaper at her home while she is in the nursing home.
Provided the payment Sally has agreed to make are similar to what other full-time caretakers and landscapers would earn, this payment would not be considered an unlawful transfer that would affect Sally's eligibility for medical assistance.

Consult an attorney.,
Buy life insurance policies that are exempted.,
Purchase an annuity.",How to Protect Estate Assets of Someone on Medical Assistance3," Medical assistance regulations are complex, and change frequently. Before attempting to convert assets, speak with an attorney who has experience in elder law and estate planning.Look for an attorney who specializes in elder law and has significant experience with Medicaid planning.
The law in this area changes rapidly, but an experienced attorney will be up-to-date on the most recent changes and how they affect planning strategies.
Provide the attorney with detailed information about the income and assets of the person on medical assistance whose estate assets you would like to protect.
Try to talk to more than one attorney so you can potentially explore a variety of different strategies to find the one that best meets your goals.

, State laws on qualifying for medical assistance exempt life insurance policies below a specific amount. Burial plans also may be exempted, provided the maximum benefit is less than $10,000.When evaluating a life insurance policy, it's generally better to get your advice from an attorney than from an insurance agent.
Keep in mind that any insurance agent with whom you speak about life insurance is trying to sell you a policy. While they may tell you the truth, they also may skew the truth to favor their policy.
They also may not be as up to date on changes in Medicaid law, or the application of the law in your particular state. Something that was true last year, or in another state, may not be true for you.

, An annuity is a contractual agreement. The person on medical assistance makes a large, lump-sum payment to a financial institution in exchange for a promise to make a series of monthly payments later on.An experienced elder law attorney can help you choose an annuity that meets the specific requirements of medical assistance regulations.
If the purpose of the annuity is to benefit the spouse of the person on medical assistance, the structured payments all must be made within the spouse's lifetime for the plan to qualify.
Purchasing an annuity may result in a significant drop in immediately available savings. However, particularly if the person is expected to return home and resume caring for themselves after several months, it can help that person retain those assets and provide more security for the future.

Have surgery, if necessary.",How to Prevent Sepsis," One of the most important means to control sepsis is regular hand washing. If you wash your hands throughout the day, especially after handling food or going to the bathroom, you can greatly reduce your risk of infection. Avoiding infection in the first place means you can avoid sepsis.To start, you should wet your hands under warm, clean, running water. Then, add some antibacterial soap.
Lather your hands thoroughly, making sure to get under your fingernails, between your fingers, and the backs of your hands. You should spend at least 20 seconds scrubbing. To help keep track of time, try humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice.
Rinse your hands completely under running water and dry them off with a clean towel.;
, Sepsis starts with an infection that eventually gets into your bloodstream, so clean all wounds thoroughly. This can prevent an infection from occurring. Even minor cuts should be cleaned as this reduces your risk of sepsis.Wash your hands before cleaning the wound, then clean the wound under running water. You can also use an alcohol-free wipe. Make sure not to use an antiseptic, as this can irritate the skin.
When you're done cleaning the wound, pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. You should apply an adhesive bandage or sterile gauze to the wound. Change your dressing regularly as the wound heals.
If your wound has a foreign object embedded in it, seek medical care. A foreign object can cause an infection and should be removed by a medical professional.

, If you are elderly or immunosuppressed, you are more prone to sepsis. It may be a good idea to talk to a medical professional about potential immunizations against certain diseases. Potential vaccinations include vaccines against the flu, pneumonia, and varicella-zoster virus. If you're at an increased risk for sepsis, contact your doctor and discuss which vaccinations would be right for you., You are at an increased risk for infections and sepsis in a hospital setting. If you're going to be in a hospital for a long time, take measures to protect yourself from infection.Talk to your doctor about how to prevent infections, and let them know if you have any health conditions that may make infections more likely.
Wash your hands regularly while at the hospital, especially after using the bathroom. Visitors, doctors, and nurses should all wash their hands when entering the room.
If you use a catheter or drainage tube, make sure it does not become dislodged. If it does, let a nurse or doctor know right away.
Discourage people who are sick from visiting you in the hospital.

, Sepsis starts as a simple infection. A good way to avoid sepsis is to avoid infections altogether. In your daily life, try to avoid infections.Be safe when preparing your food. Keep kitchen counters clean, and always wash them thoroughly after handling raw foods such as eggs, fish, chicken, beef, and pork — don't forget to wash your hands, too. Always cook meat to a safe temperature. Ground meats should be at least 160 °F (71.1 °C), and poultry should be 165 °F (73.9 °C), and all other meat should be 145 °F (62.8 °C)
Avoid sharing personal items, like toothbrushes, razors, and combs.
If you travel, ask your doctor about any special vaccinations you may need.
If you're sick, stay home until your symptoms pass.

, Children are more prone to sepsis than the larger population. One of the best means to prevent sepsis in children is to get them vaccinated. Talk to your healthcare provider about what vaccinations your children need, and make sure to get your kids a full round of vaccines against common childhood diseases.Common childhood vaccines include vaccinations against things like meningitis and whooping cough.
If your child has an underlying problem and cannot be vaccinated, make sure everyone around the child is properly vaccinated. This creates what is called herd immunity, meaning your child will be less likely to contract a disease as those around them are immune.

, Sepsis can occur in infants when an infection from a mother is passed on to the baby. Throughout your pregnancy, take steps to prevent infection.Do not share cups, plates, or utensils with young children.
Always cook your meat until it's well done. Eating rare meat during pregnancy can be dangerous. You should also stay away from unpasteurized milk and cheese.
Do not touch the droppings of wild animals, like mice. If you have a cat, do not clean your cat's litter box. Dirty cat litter can sometimes contain a harmful parasite called toxoplasmosis.

, You should clean children's wounds, even small ones, to prevent an infection. Infections are what cause sepsis. Children often get wounds while playing outside. If your child is wounded, even if it's a small wound like a cut or a scrape, clean and dress the wound right away.Clean the wound under running water with some antibacterial soap.
Pat the wound dry with a clean towel.
Dress the wound in a sterile piece of gauze or an adhesive bandage. Make sure to change the dressing regularly.

, Proper hygiene is vital to preventing infections that cause sepsis. Make sure your child bathes on a regular basis and washes their hands regularly, especially after playing outside, using the bathroom, and before eating. The better a child's hygiene, the lower that child's risk of developing an infection., Sepsis can be life-threatening, so the earlier it's treated, the better. If you notice symptoms of sepsis, seek immediate medical care. Watch out for any of the following symptoms:Shivering, fever, shaking, or a cold
Intense pain and discomfort
Pale skin
Drowsy and/or confused
Short of breath

, When you are at the hospital, you will have to undergo a series of tests to diagnose sepsis. Your doctor will determine which tests are right for you.A blood test is often done to look for evidence of infection, as well as abnormal kidney or liver functioning.
You may have urine tested, as well as secretions from wounds. If you're coughing up mucus, that may be tested as well.
If the site of your infection cannot be determined, image scanning, such an x-ray or ultrasound, may be necessary.

, Usually, a round of antibiotics are used immediately to treat sepsis. They are usually administered through an IV. If you're having difficulty breathing, you may be put on oxygen. You will also be given intravenous fluids via IV for the duration of the infection., In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to treat sepsis. The source of the infection, usually an abscess, may need to be removed.Talk to your doctor about how to best prepare for surgery. Do not be afraid to ask questions, as it's important you make sure you're safe during the surgical procedure.
Follow all advice your doctor gives regarding recovery. It's important you make sure you beat the infection so you can recover from sepsis.

This creates friction and prevents your flip flops from sliding so much., If you find there are specific areas on your flip flop that cause you pain, you can use products like moleskin or gel dots to reduce the irritation. Apply those products right to the problem areas to your flip flops more comfortable., You might be tempted to wear a new pair of flip flops all day right after you get them. Instead, break them in by wearing them around the house first. This way your feet get used to the flip flops before you have no choice but to wear them all day."

If your chronic kidney disease has reached the final stage (a condition known as end stage renal failure, or ESRF, when you require dialysis or a transplant to survive) or if you have other major health concerns, you may need more specific dietary guidelines. Follow your doctor’s instructions.;
, Too much sodium can elevate your blood pressure, causing hypertension, and you need a healthy blood pressure to preserve your kidney function. Bypass the salt shaker whenever possible, and, in addition:


Choose fresh or frozen vegetables rather than canned. Canned foods are high in sodium. If you do use canned vegetables, rinse them under running water to remove as much of the salt as possible.
Avoid salty snacks, frozen meals, and processed lunch meats.
Replace salt with a salt substitute and/or lemon or other seasonings, but check with your nephrologist first: some salt substitutes are too high in potassium.

, Keeping your fat consumption in check will improve your cholesterol levels, helping your arteries stay clear so that more blood can reach your kidneys. Choose lean meats, trim excess fat, and remove any skin; bake, roast, stew, grill or broil these meats rather than frying them. Additionally:


Use egg whites rather than using whole eggs.
Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products whenever possible.
Buy low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise and salad dressings.
Replace fats like butter and vegetable oil with healthier fats like olive oil and canola oil, or use non-stick cooking spray instead.

, Excess protein can strain your kidneys unnecessarily, but you do need some protein – ideally about 1 gram (0.04 oz) of protein per kilogram of your body weight. In general, aim for moderate portions of protein rich foods like fish and meat.

, Some patients need to avoid foods high in potassium: talk to your nephrologist to see if you fall into this category. If so, avoid bananas, apricots, white beans, spinach, yogurt, salmon, mushrooms, and other potassium-rich foods. Excess potassium in your body can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death.

, Excess phosphorus in the body can cause calcium reabsorption from bone, leading to fractures. In patients with kidney dysfunction, phosphorus levels are already elevated, so avoid eating too many phosphorus-rich foods, like milk, cheese, nuts, and sodas.

, Patients with chronic kidney disease often experience calcium loss and low vitamin D production. Calcium and vitamin D are crucial to bone formation, so ask your doctor whether you should take them in supplement form.


Calcium supplementation can be especially critical, since you need calcium but, at the same time, need to avoid consuming too much of some of the best calcium sources – milk and cheese – because they are also high in phosphorus.

, Even when eating healthy foods, patients with kidney disease need to practice portion control and limit their daily calorie consumption. Read nutrition labels carefully, and stick to the suggested serving size. And don’t eat mindlessly: eat slowly, pay attention to how much you are consuming, and stop as soon as you no longer feel hungry.


Keep in mind that it can take 20 minutes or more for your brain to register that you feel full. Eating slowly and listening to your body can prevent you from consuming excess food.

, Talk to your doctor to be sure what’s safest for you, but in general, patients with chronic kidney disease need to limit water intake to about a liter per day, depending on how much swelling they experience.

, Staying active will help you control your blood pressure and your body weight; if you have diabetes, exercise will also help you manage it. You don’t need to join a gym or do anything fancy: even just walking can be excellent, low-impact exercise. Talk to your doctor about the right exercise plan for you, and consider asking for a referral to a physical therapist, especially if exercise is new for you: this person can help you create an exercise program with your particular health needs in mind.


Start slowly. To begin, try exercising for 15-20 minutes three days a week; once you can do that, work up to 30 minutes five days a week.
Stretch before and after exercise. Careful stretching warms your muscles, increases blood flow, and minimizes cramping.

, Smoking is unhealthy for everyone, but for people trying to preserve residual renal function, quitting is crucial to slowing the progression of kidney damage and maintaining a healthy blood pressure.

, Being overweight or obese places increased strain on your kidneys. Work with your doctor to determine your ideal weight, and strive to stay at or near it. The diet and exercise suggestions offered here will help you do that.

, Nephrotoxicity happens when your kidneys are exposed to a medication that may be toxic to the kidney cells, resulting in serious health consequences. Talk to your doctor about all medications you may be taking, and discuss alternatives. Some drugs known to be nephrotoxic include:


Cyclosporines (immunosuppressant drugs used to prevent organ rejection and treat severe rheumatoid arthritis and severe psoriasis). Brand names include Gengraf, Neoral, and SandImmune.
Aminoglycosides (antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections). Brand names include Gentamicin, Streptomycin, and Tobramycin.
Chemotherapy medications (drugs used to treat cancerous tumors). Brand names include Cisplatin and Ifosfamide.
NSAIDs (drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, used to treat inflammation, pain, and fever). Brand names include Advil, Motrin, Ibuprofen, and Nuprin.
Some herbal preparations, including Chinese herbal preparations with wild ginger and aristolochic acids.
Contrast dyes (dyes containing iodine, which are used in diagnostic procedures like CT scans).

, If diet and exercise are not sufficient to keep you from developing hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications.


The most effective drugs are Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Aside from reducing blood pressure, ACEIs and ARBs prevent protein loss in urine and consequently swelling of the body. These drugs can also be prescribed for diabetes-induced renal disease.

, Most patients with kidney failure (except those with polycystic kidney disease) will develop anemia. This is due to a lack of erythropoietin (a hormone synthesized in the kidneys, which stimulates red blood cells). If you have anemia, your doctor pay prescribe iron supplements and/or erythropoietin injections. These will help with fatigue and weakness, common symptoms of anemia.


Note that overcorrection (getting too much iron) can lead to hypertension and thrombosis (blood clotting in vessels). The ideal hemoglobin level in patients with renal disease is between 9-12 gm/dL. Follow your doctor’s instructions with care.

Remember to thank your doctor.",How to Prepare for Surgery," Discuss the surgery with your family and friends and begin putting the necessary support group in place. Tell them how you are feeling and your emotional state of mind. Are you hopeful about the predicted outcomes of the surgery, or is the idea of being admitted bugging you? Whatever it is, often sharing these feelings with someone, can help you liberate any trapped anxiety or frustration about your situation or future.;
, Be sure to review all the steps that will be taking place before, during and after the operation. Confirm the surgery date and time and make sure schedules do not conflict.

, Try to get your home in order by doing some cleaning, paying bills, and running errands. Remember you may be incapacitated for some time (depending on your surgery- up to six weeks) and having your home in some order will help eliminate some of the emotional stress and help you to feel emotionally and physically prepared. Organise for a responsible adult, whom you trust, to be around for 24 hours after you've had a general anaesthetic- if you're only in hospital for the day.

, If you're having surgery which will effect your range of movement, mobility or stability, make your home patient safe by removing obstacles or furniture that may block the entrance-way to the bathroom or kitchen. You don't want wires or rugs lying around that may trip you and cause you to fall and further injure yourself. If bending over or standing for long periods of time may be a problem, them set things in places which you will be able to reach them, and make sure you have plenty of easy-to- prepare food in stock. If an overnight stay is expected after the surgery, then pack your bag. The hospital should give you some guidelines about what to bring.

, Speak to other surgical patients you may know and ask how they dealt with the preparations and recovery. You could also ask about the ward, hospital procedures or how they felt afterwards. The more information you have on your procedure, the more empowered or prepared you may feel. Many nurses really go the extra mile to make sure that you know what you're doing, so address any unanswered questions to them if appropriate. Ringing the hospital/ ward to ask a question is also a very reasonable thing to do. Make sure you get the answers you need.

, Go on the web and research your procedure and the sort of anesthetic or treatment you'll be having. Find out what is being said by the professionals and what, if any, are their recommendations for dealing with the recovery process.You could also look at what the short term effects of the surgery and anesthetic are; for example it is common for a general anesthetic to cause a sore throat afterwards due to a plastic tube being placed down throat to help you breathe whilst unconscious.

, This is because you may not, depending on where you're having surgery, be able to walk around for a few days. Try contacting your neighbors or a professional pet sitter to take care of your favorite animal. Equally, if you're the sole carer of small children, you'll need to consider what you'll be able to manage after the surgery and put help you'll need to carry on. Make sure your childcare is organized and your kids know what's going to happen, at least vaguely and what the plan is for them. If they're reliant on you, then they're automatically involved to some extent.

, Make arrangements with a friend who will be able to drive you to any physical therapy, the doctor's office, the hospital and to collect any medication. There may be a retired citizen that can do this for you. Be sure to pay them a fair price. Be aware that if you're having day surgery, it is recommended that you do not take public transport alone (except taxis) within 24 hours of a general anesthetic.

, Go to your favorite beauty salon and get a haircut, manicure, facial and pedicure. Depending upon your type of surgery, you may not be able to do this for a few weeks after the operation. Do not apply nail polish/ fake nails to your toes or fingers, as this may interfere with the machine that monitors the oxygen in your blood and you'll only have to be asked to remove it or go home. Also, take extra care of any parts of you, which may suffer temporarily due to the surgery, for example if you're going to have a cannula put into the back of your hand, then make sure that the skin there isn't chapped, as this can cause additional soreness, especially if there's a lot of activity in that area.Take a shower the night before going into hospital and avoid applying lotions, as they can interfere with the having heart-monitor pads stuck to you, as they can make the skin a bit oily.

, Sometimes after surgery, taking a shower has to be done very carefully. Things often must be kept at a higher level, if you're going to have difficulty leaning over to reach things. An example of this is, a piece of soap on a rope could be hung over the shower. Think about buying novelties which could make your life easier, or changing how you do things for a time.

, Keep a pen and notebook or voice activated tape recorder at your bedside for reminders, or store questions for if/ when the surgeon or anaesthetist visits. It can also be useful for reminding you or your nurse/caregiver of something which is important to you.

, Meditation, hypnosis or just deep breathing exercises will allow your mind and your body to cope better with the surgery and heal faster. Find things which calm you down and which you can do, for example- listening to music, drawing, knitting. It's your choice about what you occupy your free time with. Often hospitals lack entertainment, so feel free to bring your own, which you think won't be obstructive to the nurses and other patients. Bear ward restrictions in mind, for example. some day-wards to not recommend you bring your mobile phone or other electrical equipment, as the increased foot-traffic means there's a higher chance of them walking off.

, They will appreciate it, and may be more inclined to respond thoughtfully and courteously to your questions and needs.

Understand your country's health information privacy act.,
Read all privacy documents carefully before you are asked to sign them.,
Make sure the place you are being treated abides by the national privacy act.,
Ask how your information will be released if you are involved in a health research project.,
Ask if you can withhold your social security number on questionnaires and other documents.,
Shred your insurance documents, prescription forms and physician forms after they are no longer needed.,
Limit the amount of health information you keep on your computer.,
Do not email prescription numbers, health information or other private health information.,
Limit the health information that you give to your employer.,
Control who of your family and friends has access to your health information.",How to Protect Health Information," Most western countries have developed privacy acts by which health providers must comply. The following are ways that some hospitals may still release your personal health information:


Your private health information may be communicated between your health care providers. This is required to ensure you have comprehensive health care.
Your health care information is communicated to the insurance company and the company that bills for the insurance company. Get in contact with your insurance company to make sure they are keeping your personal health information private.
Your health care information may be communicated to the government for public health concerns or in cases of neglect or domestic abuse. It may be released for judicial judgments, to law enforcement officials or for national security.
Ensure the health care provider does not have clauses for marketing and fundraising efforts that could contain your personal health care information.
Most hospitals will communicate information about appointments and test results. You can decide whether they can give you the information on your voicemail or if they must ask you to return the call.;
, Other than the national act, most offices and hospitals provide their own health privacy policies that you are asked to read and sign. They tell you exactly how they plan to use your health information.


In some cases, the hospital may detail how they plan to use any samples for research and that tissue samples belong to the hospital after they are taken. These samples may also be distributed with basic health information. Ask the medical facility about these clauses before you sign, in case you can opt out.

, Some facilities, such as alternative treatment facilities and private clinics, may provide treatment that is not required under this act. Ask about the office's privacy policy before signing.

, In some cases, you may be asked to release information that would be otherwise protected. Read carefully into your research project's privacy agreement.

, Some offices use social security numbers for bookkeeping purposes, a purpose for which it was not designed. Ask to remove your social security number from paperwork if possible.


The social security number accounting system was meant only for social security tax collection purposes. Throughout the years, it has been used for other things, such as driver's license numbers and bookkeeping. By distributing your social security number, third parties can learn more about your life and health information, and you may be subject to identity theft.

, Most of these forms contain social security numbers, insurance numbers, address and other information that could lead to identity theft.

, For example, some x-rays are available on discs and they should remain on discs rather than the computer. Also, any communication documents or faxes should be stored offline and on either portable hard drives or flash drives.

, Successful phishing scams can provide companies with information on your health.

, Unless you are involved in a physically laborious job or you have a worker's compensation claim, employer documents are not protected by national privacy acts.

, Most offices will ask you to supply information for emergency contacts. You can also specify whether they can hear information about your health, or if they can simply relay messages to call the health care provider.

Remove any items that may contain metal.,
Fill out an MRI screening form.,
Follow the instructions you are given during the MRI.",How to Prepare for an MRI," During an MRI, you will be enclosed in a tube-like machine for up to an hour. If you are claustrophobic, this experience can cause a great deal of anxiety, and you may need a sedative before the test if you are anxious. Talk to your doctor about your claustrophobia before the exam to see if he or she may be able to prescribe you a sedative for the procedure., Certain metallic implants may effect the MRI scans. Talk to your doctor about any metal implants you have prior to the exam.


Cochlear (ear) implants, clips used for brain aneurysms, metal coils placed within blood vessels, any kind of cardiac defibrillator or pacemaker generally means you cannot be placed in an MRI machine.Some metallic implants pose a some risk to health and safety and the accuracy of the exam. However, depending on how long the devices have been in place before the exam it might be safe to undergo the exam with some of the following in place: artificial heart valves, implanted drug infusion ports, artificial limbs or metallic joint prosthetics, implanted nerve simulators, metal pins, screws, plates, stents, and surgical staples., Certain health concerns should be taken into consideration before you have an MRI. Talk to your doctor about safety if you have any of the following conditions:


Pregnancy
History of kidney problems
Allergy to iodine or gadolinium
History of diabetes, Before your MRI, you should take your medication as normal leading up to the exam unless otherwise instructed. You should strive to maintain as normal a schedule as possible leading up to the MRI exam., Reading up on what happens during an MRI exam can help ease the anxiety of the procedure. Learn what to expect in the days leading up to the exam.


An MRI is a large tube with holes on either end. You'll be placed on a moveable table that slides into the tube while a technologist monitors you from another room.Magnetic fields and radio waves provide an internal reading of your body, used to detect things like brain tumors, chronic conditions, and other abnormalities. The procedure, however, is painless as you do not feel the magnetic fields.The MRI machine makes a lot of noise while the procedure is taking place. Many patients opt to bring earplugs and listen to music or books on tape during the process.Exams vary in length, but some can be quite long. It occasionally takes up to an hour for an exam to be completed., In most cases, you'll continue on your regular schedule without making any changes. However, if you have specific medical concerns your doctor may recommend altering medications, diet, or sleeping habits leading up to the exam. Follow any guidelines your doctor reviewed with you and call and ask if you have any questions., If you're going to be sedated due to claustrophobia, you'll need someone to drive you to and from the hospital or make sure you get home safe via public transportation or a taxi. Even if you will be fully conscious for the procedure, it's a good idea to have a friend or family member come with you. The procedure is lengthy and can be quite stressful., You should arrive to the exam 30 minutes early. There will be paperwork you'll need to fill out and a doctor or nurse may want to talk to you about the procedure beforehand., Before your MRI exam, you need to remove the following items as they may contain metal:


All jewelry
Eyeglasses
Hairpins/Barrettes containing metal
Dentures
Watches
Hearing aids
Wigs
Underwire bras, Before you undergo the exam, you'll be asked to fill out an MRI screening form. This is a 3 to 5 page document that asks for basic information about your name, age, birth date, as well as questions about your medical history. Take time to read the form closely and answer all questions to the best of your ability. Ask the doctor or nurse if you have any questions regarding the paperwork.This form will also ask questions about allergies and any past reactions you have had to contrast materials used in imaging procedures. Some MRIs require an intravenous injection of a contrast material called gadolinium, which can cause an allergic reaction in rare instances., Once you've filled out the paperwork, you'll enter the MRI room. The doctor will have you change into a hospital gown. From there, follow the doctor's instructions regarding the test.


During the MRI, you will be able to hear and speak with your doctor or MRI technician. In some cases, you may be asked to perform some simple tasks, such as tapping your fingers or answering some easy questions.Stay as still as possible during the procedure. You will be instructed to stay still to ensure that the images will be clear. Just try to breath normally and stay still.

"
"
Pack your bag beforehand.,
Report to the ward or part of the hospital where you're having your procedure or surgery.,
If your hospital room has no menu cards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ask for them or to speak to a nutritionist.,
Bring your cell phone, battery-operated cell phone charger, books, magazines, puzzle games, and even a Bible.",How to Prepare for a Hospital Stay After Surgery," Have your toothbrush and toothpaste, face soap, deodorant, comb and brush, body soap, shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer, and extra underwear ready.


For surgery, although most hospitals want you to wear a gown, you can often bring slippers and a dressing gown to wear as you walk up to the surgery. Many gowns don't actually have a back, so it's worth asking a nurse if you can have two and wear one facing forwards and one facing backwards, to reduce the risk of mooning someone in the corridors. However, if you've been admitted in an emergency, ask a family member or friend to bring your bag to you at the hospital.;
, Bring any pre-surgery hospital paperwork, your health insurance card, your driver's license, and your list of medications, both prescription and over the counter. You'll be given an ID Bracelet, and you'll need to sign consent forms. At this point, nurses will usually take your vital information, such as blood pressure, blood oxygen levels and so on. Usually, you'll be asked to wait on your bed on the ward.


You might be given a hospital bag for your personal belongings, the hospital gown, and socks for your feet.
The hospital staff will ask you questions about your health and your surgery, and you might have an IV or cannula placed in your arm or on the back of your hand. A surgeon or anesthetist will usually visit the ward to see you and talk about any concerns you have, as well as make sure you're sure about what the surgery/ procedure is.
Normally, you can walk up to the surgery room, with a nurse or aide and they'll get you to lie down on a bed-trolley. If you're having a general anesthetic, then they'll get you ready by checking your ID bracelets and asking you a few obvious questions, like ""What is your date of birth?"" before administering the anesthetic. Children are sometimes given this as a gas, but most adults receive it through the IV/ cannula. Then, the anesthetist will talk to you until you lose consciousness. If you're having a local anesthetic, then you'll probably be made ready and asked a few questions, before being taken into the main room with all of the surgical staff.
After your procedure or surgery, you'll be taken into the recovery room and monitored until you're ready to return to your hospital room/ ward. If you're lucky you'll have a TV and remote, bed-adjustment controls, lights for your room and for reading, and a ""Call Nurse Button."" You may even wear ""sleeves"" on your lower legs to avoid blood clots.

, Your room/ward may have a board on the wall with a washable ink pen. If so, one of the things you have to write is the type of diet you're on to avoid allergies and/or foods you simply can't eat.

, If you're religious, tell the hospital staff to call the hospital chaplain or your own priest, minister, or rabbi to come visit you. All you've got to do now is stay calm and entertain yourself until you're discharged.

Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Stop drinking alcohol.,
Avoid drug abuse.,
Treat any bacterial infections you have.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure1," Obesity has been linked to kidney damage. If you are overweight, or are afraid you are going to become overweight, exercise daily. When you are overweight, your kidneys have to work overtime to keep you healthy. You should try to exercise for 30 to 45 minutes, four or five days a week.Some exercises you can incorporate into your work week include running, cycling, swimming, and walking. Try to pick one (or a couple) that you enjoy so that you are more motivated to work out each day.
If you are elderly, the recommended exercise each week is 15 minutes for three days a week.;
, Tobacco smoke does serious damage to your kidneys. There are more than 4000 particles and gases found in cigarette smoke, many of which can damage your kidney. Cigarettes are also linked to kidney fibrosis, which is when your kidney tissue turns hard, causing kidney failure.Cigarette smoke can also cause hypertension, which is elevated blood pressure.

, Alcohol can also cause kidney damage. When metabolized, alcohol becomes aldehyde, a harmful chemical that can hurt your kidneys and liver. Alcohol also increases your chances of heart disease and diabetes., Any drug that you put in your body gets absorbed by the blood and then filtered by the kidneys. These drugs can have a harmful effect on your kidney and could lead to kidney failure if your kidneys have to process too many harmful toxins.For example, cocaine may cause myolysis. Myolysis is the breakdown of muscle mass, which can result in kidney failure.

, This is particularly important to do if your bacterial infection is in your kidney or urinary tract. You will have to take antibacterial medication to treat these conditions, but it will be well worth it, as a kidney dealing with a bacterial infection can be a major health risk.

"
"
Ask your doctor if you need to discontinue any medications.,
Avoid consuming iodine.,
Inform your physician about any contraindications.,
Wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of the exam.",How to Prepare for a Thyroid Ultrasound Exam1," Before your ultrasound, you should speak with your physician to see if you need to discontinue taking any of your medications/vitamins, as some of these can affect the results of the scan.


These medications might include antithyroid medications and thyroid hormones. As these medications are used to treat your thyroid, they could affect the results of your scan.
That said, do not discontinue taking any medications without speaking to your physician first.;
, Avoiding iodine in the days leading up to the exam will help the cells in your thyroid readily absorb the iodine dye that is used as the contrast medium during your scan. This ensures that your physician will receive the best results possible. Medications and other substances that contain iodine include:


Iodized salt
Multivitamins
Kelp
Cough syrup
Amiodarone heart medicines (such as Pacerone or Cordarone)

, Make sure to tell your doctor about any risk factor or health issues that would make you an unsuitable candidate for undergoing a thyroid ultrasound exam. Tell your doctor:


If you have had any procedures performed that used an iodine dye or radioactive material within 4 weeks of your scan. If you have, you'll need to reschedule your scan. These contrast mediums are capable of altering the results of your thyroid ultrasound scan. The cells in your thyroid will not readily absorb the iodine contrast material because they will already be overloaded with it.
If you have previously suffered anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction) from any substance including shellfish or bee stings.
If you are allergic to any medications.
If you are breastfeeding.
If you are or may be pregnant.

, On the day of the exam, the ultrasound technician may ask you to remove your clothing and wear a hospital gown for the procedure. For this reason, make sure the clothing you choose is easy for you to remove.


If you remain in your own clothing, you will need to remove/open the clothing and remove any jewelry that is near your thyroid (which is located in your neck, just below your adam’s apple but above your collarbone).
Consider wearing a button up top/shirt as this makes accessing your thyroid easier.

"
"
Limit the amount of processed food you eat.,
Eat a lot of fiber.,
Decrease the amount of sodium you consume.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stay away from soda.,
Consider taking fat-reducing drugs.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure2," Processed foods generally contain a large amount of sodium and phosphorous. Too much sodium can increase your blood pressure, which can harm your kidneys. Too much phosphate can cause kidney stones which, as the name suggests, can hurt your kidneys. Processed foods include:


Potato chips, cheese spreads, processed meats like hot dogs, chicken nuggets and fish sticks, store bought cookies, cakes, muffins, and crackers, pre-made condiments and salad dressings.

, Fiber helps the body to get rid of toxins and other bad chemicals that can be found in the colon. When bad substances are eliminated in the colon, the kidney doesn’t have to deal with processing toxins, because the fiber in the colon has already done that. High fiber foods include:


Fruits like raspberries, pears, bananas, oranges, strawberries, and figs.
Grain products like whole wheat spaghetti, bran cereal, barley pearls, popcorn, brown rice, and rye bread.
Legumes, nuts and seeds like lentils, black beans, lima beans, sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, and pecans.
Vegetables like artichokes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, sweet corn, baked potatoes, and carrots.

, Sodium refers to common table salt. High amounts of salt in your diet can lead to high blood pressure (which is explained more in Method Three). High blood pressure can harm your kidneys, so it is best to decrease the amount of salt you eat to avoid developing high blood pressure. High salt foods include:


Cheese and cheese spreads.
Pretzels, chips, and other snack foods.
Pickled foods.
Soups and gravies.
Cured meats like bacon, salami and prosciutto.

, You should drink at least 8 to 10 glasses (or 2 to 2.5 liters) of water every day. When you stay hydrated, your kidney is able to process the things that you put in your body (including toxins) more efficiently. When you are not hydrated enough, the toxins will linger in your body fluids, making them harder for your kidneys to process. If you get bored with water, you can also drink the following to stay hydrated:


Fruit juices diluted with water, coconut water, smoothies, fresh squeezed juice, and herbal teas., Soda is one of the worst things (besides toxins like alcohol and tobacco) that you can put in your body. This is because most sodas contain no nutritional value, which means that they are empty calories that you will have to work off. If you do not work these empty calories off, you may become overweight, which will put a lot more pressure on your kidneys., If you have a very high amount of lipids (fat cells) like cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood vessel walls, you might want to consider taking medication that can help you to reduce the number of these fat cells. Such drugs include statins or fenofibrates.


Statins are drugs that lower your cholesterol. The most common types of this drug include Lipitor, Zocor, and Mevacor.Fenofibrates should be used in combination with a low-fat diet and exercise. It is used to reduce the amount of fatty substances (like cholesterol) in your bloodstream."

Understand how diabetes effects kidney function.,
Measure your blood glucose daily.,
Take the medicine your doctor has prescribed.,
Avoid foods that are rich in sugar.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure3," Having diabetes can do a lot of damage to your kidneys; high levels of blood sugar can make the kidneys overwork and filter too much blood. Overtime, overworked kidneys can lose their ability to function properly, resulting in kidney failure., To check your daily blood glucose, you can use a glucose monitor that you can purchase at your local pharmacy. Record each day’s reading. A normal fasting glucose level is generally less than 110 mg/dl. ‘Fasting glucose’ means that the recording is taken before you eat breakfast so your stomach is empty., If you have diabetes, your doctor will have prescribed you with a medication that you can take daily. The medication will either be taken orally or is a shot of insulin. Regardless of the type of medication, make sure that you follow your doctor’s prescription.

, When you have diabetes, you should try to control any spurts of blood sugar levels. This is because these spurts can damage your kidneys, since your body’s insulin is not able to control sudden spurts of blood sugar level. This means trying to avoid very sugary foods as much as possible. You should avoid:


Granulated sugars and other sweeteners.
Soft drinks (sodas) and candy.
Dried fruits.
Cookies, cakes, and other baked goods.

Understand how high blood pressure can affect your kidneys.,
Take an anti-hypertensive medicine.,
Get exercise each morning.,
Try other ways to reduce stress.,
Reduce the amount of salt you have in your diet.",How to Prevent Kidney Failure4," High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels leading into and out of your kidneys. This causes your kidneys to become unable to filter the waste that they receive, causing dangerous levels of fluid and waste to accumulate in the kidneys., If you have high blood pressure and are worried about your kidneys, talk to your doctor. Chances are, your doctor probably has already prescribed anti-hypertensive (anti-high blood pressure) medicine that you should take daily. Some of the most common medications for this condition include:


atenolol, amlodipine, ramipril and enalapril.

, Walking for 30 to 40 minutes each morning can help you to relax and keep you healthy. When you relax through exercise, you are actively keeping your blood pressure under control.


If you don’t like walking alone, join a walking group or walk with a friend each morning.

, Stress plays a big part when it comes to your blood pressure. Exercising can be a great way to reduce stress, but you can also try other methods. Try meditating every day for 30 minutes or take yoga classes that will teach you how to relax by controlling your breath and focusing on the movement of your body.

, As mentioned in Method 2, eating too much salt can really elevate your blood pressure. Try to eat less salt each day; aim for about 6 gm of salt daily. Avoid high salt foods like:


Soups, gravies, and broths.
Soy sauce and salad dressings.
Salami, bacon, and cured meats.
Cheese.
Snack foods (like pretzels and chips).
Pickled foods.

Prepare the child for what the exam will involve.,
Bring various items with you to distract your child during the procedure.,
Try to prevent your child from moving during the procedure.,
Know that it may be necessary to sedate your child for the exam.,
Understand how sedation works.",How to Prepare for a Thyroid Ultrasound Exam2," Before the day of the exam, it's important that you thoroughly explain what the exam will involve. The best way to do this is to pretend as if you are performing the procedure on his/her thyroid. This will help your child feel less anxious during the actual thyroid ultrasound, as they will be more familiar with the procedure. To do a pretend exam:


Ask your child to lengthen his/her neck as if he/she were a giraffe reaching for leaves on a tree. Squirt the ultrasound gel on (you can use a little bit of lotion).
Use the backside of an ice cream scooper as the ultrasound wand. Pretend to be pushing buttons and looking at an ultrasound screen while you gently move the spoon around (above or below the thyroid gland).
Remember to treat your child as if you are an actual ultrasound technician. Ask him/her his name, etc.

, Some helpful items might include:


Small toys
Books
Music
Flash cards

, An ultrasound examination is extremely sensitive to motion. Unfortunately, many children cry and refuse to hold still, which simply prolongs the procedure.


Therefore, it's important that you keep you child as still as possible throughout the procedure, using distraction techniques, or promises of rewards afterwards if they behave well.
Ultrasound technicians at the majority of facilities are familiar with the challenges associated with scanning pediatric patients, so they may also have some techniques that will help keep the child still.

, Sometimes children will simply refuse to sit still for the duration of the exam, making it impossible to achieve accurate results.


If the scan cannot be obtained at the radiology center, you may need to take your child to a hospital for his/her scan, where the exam will be performed under sedation
A hospital has the ability to sedate your child while also monitoring him/her during the scan.

, The medication that is frequently used for sedation is chloral hydrate. This is not a form of anesthesia, but a sedative.


Chloral hydrate can be administered via an anal suppository, in a liquid form by mouth or with a naso-gastric tube attached to an oxygen facemask.
You must have the thyroid ultrasound performed at a hospital if your child requires a sedative, because his/her breathing needs to be monitored during the scan. This is done to ensure apnea (a disorder that causes an individual to randomly stop breathing during asleep) or respiratory depression (aka respiratory insufficiency) does not occur.
The effects of the sedative usually last for a couple of hours.

Ask the doctor about medications.",How to Prevent Falls in Dementia Patients," Dementia can affect how a person sees and interacts with their environment, and so good lighting can help them to judge distances better. Adding more light can decrease shadows and make the room clearer, which can help a person see better. Make sure there's bright enough lights in the whole home, preferably easy-to-access ones.It can help to add nightlights as well, especially if the person is used to not turning on the lights when they get up at night.
In addition, make sure all spaces in the home have light, including closets.
Make sure to open the curtains during the day to help increase natural lighting, but shut them at night, while turning on more lights inside.;
, Inside, it's important to make sure the person has a clear place to walk. Pick up any clutter of the floor, and ensure the floor is even to walk on. If the carpet is rumpled, for instance, it's time to replace it.You should also glue or tape any rugs to the floor (or take them out).
Remove any exposed cords.
Avoid making floors slippery. Make sure to remove any spills. Skip waxing the floors if possible.

, People with dementia can have difficulty seeing distinct edges on objects. For instance, they may not be able to see where the staircase ends or where a step up into the kitchen is. Even if they've lived in the house for years, dementia can make them forget where these hazards are. Adding visual cues, such as bright duct tape on a stair, can help reduce the risk., Use contrasting colors to help define things like bathmats and welcome mats from their background. Also, stick to solid colors, as patterns can lead to confusion. It's best to avoid black, especially on the ground, as a person with dementia may see it as a hole.You can also paint the doorsill a different color, separate the wall from the baseboards by using different colors (such as a lighter color for the walls and darker for the baseboards), and use a contrasting color toilet.
It can also help to mark things like the edge of the bathtub with a contrasting color (using tape or a towel).

, For someone who may have trouble with falling, it's important to have furniture that's not too low to the ground. In addition, try to get away with as few pieces as possible, as that will mean fewer items to run into. Finally, try not to move the furniture very often, as that can be confusing, causing a person with dementia to trip., Stairs increase a person's risk of falling. Move the person's bedroom downstairs, if possible, so they don't have to go up and down the stairs as often. Of course, the person will also need a full bathroom on the bottom floor., The bathroom is one of the places people fall most often. Add things like a raised toilet seat, grab bars by the toilet and tub, and non-slip mats to make it safer and reduce the person's chance of falling. Adding more light can also help., A person with dementia is more likely to be confused when they wake up in the middle of the night then at other times. Add to that fact that they can't see as well and that they may have balance issues because of grogginess, and it's easy to see how night can be a problem. The best solution is to keep as many things as they need by the bed, such as a glass of water, tissues, and their phone. Also add a lamp or flashlight and eyeglasses, if they need them., Make sure to keep items like keys, shoes, and wallets always in the same place. Doing so helps the person find the item more easily, meaning they don't have to wander around the house looking for it. The more they wander, the more likely they are to fall, particularly if they are agitated., Solid shoes are best, particularly ones that don't slip around on the person's feet. Shoelaces are not a good idea, either, as they can come untied and trip the person. Stick to slip-ons with backs or shoes with velcro straps.Make sure the person is wearing shoes even in the house, as most slippers don't provide enough support.

, If the person you're caring for is unstable, a walker or a cane may help them keep their balance. You can find these at the drug store or medical supply store. In fact, some insurances will cover these devices if a doctor deems them medically necessary.

, Noise can make a person with dementia irritable, as it can increase their confusion. It's best to keep the noise down, as with increased irritability and confusion comes an increased risk of falling., When a person's dementia worsens, they may fall back into old routines that are no longer relevant, such as trying to get up and go to work in the morning. This extra wandering increases the likelihood of a fall. However, just telling the person ""no"" will only make them frustrated. Instead, try to distract them with something else they like, such as making them a cup of coffee or playing a game together., An ongoing medical evaluation of the patient is very important. A doctor can examine the person in question. The doctor will look at things like balance and muscle strength to help determine the person's risk. Knowing how much the person is at risk can help you decide how vigilant you need to be., There is a common saying that goes, “If you don’t use it, you lose it.” This means that someone who is not active will become less capable of being active. Make sure that person with dementia has an opportunity to be active on a daily basis to decrease the progression of the disease and balance any dysfunction.

Simple activities such as walking together, doing household tasks, working in the garden, playing music and dancing can benefit the patient both cognitively and physically.

, Vitamin D is vital to health, as it increases calcium absorption, helps with bone health, and assists with mental health. Older people are more at risk for a vitamin D deficiency than younger adults, partially because their body doesn't produce it as well and partially because they don't get as much sun exposure. Talk to the person's doctor to check for a vitamin D deficiency and a supplement if needed., It is also important for a patient with dementia to have an ongoing medication evaluation by their doctor. Some medications can increase the likelihood that a person will fall. Mostly, the drugs that worsen the effects are ones that make the person drowsy or a bit loopy, such as anticholinergics (like Benadryl), sedatives, and tranquilizers. However, blood pressure medicine can also do the same thing, if it lowers the person's blood pressure too much."

Wash your hands.",How to Position a Bedpan," Greet the patient and explain that you are going to help him use the bedpan. Show patience and compassion, as this can be an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation for the patient. Assure the patient that you know what to do and will make the experience as pleasant as possible.
Explaining this to the patient beforehand can help calm your patient and reduce his fear and uncertainty.;
, Wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap. When finished, dry your hands and put on a pair of disposable gloves., Provide the patient with as much privacy as possible, now and throughout the entire procedure.Close the door and cover the windows with curtains.
If the patient shares a room with someone else, draw the curtain separating the two beds.
Keep the patient's legs covered with a blanket or sheet until you are ready to position the bedpan.

, If possible, cover the sheets beneath the patient with a waterproof protector.


If you do not have access to a waterproof protector, cover the sheets beneath patient's buttocks with a large, clean bath towel.

, Fill the bedpan with very warm water. Let the water sit for several minutes, then dump it out and dry off the bedpan.The heat from the water should transfer to the bedpan itself, warming it up. A warm bedpan will be more comfortable for the patient to use than a cold one.
If it is a metal bedpan, make sure it is not too hot.

, Sift a thin layer of talcum powder over the edge of the bedpan.The powder will make it easier to slide the bedpan beneath the patient.
Only do this if the patient does not have any bedsores or cuts on her buttocks. Do not use talcum powder if the patient has any open wounds.

, Alternatively, you can place a few squares of toilet paper in the bottom of the bedpan or coat it with a little vegetable oil spray (if you are in a home setting).


Any of these practices will make the cleanup process easier.

, Now that the supplies are ready, instruct the patient to remove clothing from the bottom half of his body.


Assist the patient if he is unable to do this alone.
If the patient is wearing a gown with an opening in the back, you can leave the gown on. If the gown has no opening, you will need to lift it above the patient's waist.
You will also need to pull the top sheet or blanket back at this time.

, Lower the bed as far as possible to reduce the risk of injury if the patient falls during the procedure.


You should also lower the head of the bed at this time, since doing so may make it easier for the patient to lift or turn as needed.

, The patient should lie on her back. The knees should be bent and the feet should be flat on the mattress., Set the clean bedpan directly next to the patient's hips on the side of the bed.


Positioning the bedpan as close as possible before moving the patient will cause less strain to the patient.

, The patient will need to raise his hips. If the patient does not have the strength to do so, you will need to turn the patient to his side instead.If the patient can lift his hips:

Instruct your patient to raise his hips on the count of three.
Support the patient by placing your hand beneath the lower back. Do not do any serious lifting with this hand. You should only provide light support.


If the patient cannot lift his hips:

Gently turn the patient to the side facing away from you. Work carefully to prevent the patient from rolling onto his stomach or off the bed.



, Slide the bedpan beneath the patient's buttocks with the curved edge of the bedpan facing the back.If the patient can lift her hips:

Slide the bedpan underneath the buttocks and instruct the patient to ease down onto it, using your support hand to guide her.


If the patient cannot lift her hips:

Slide the bedpan directly next to the patient's buttocks. Keep the open end pointing toward the patient's feet.
Gently roll the patient back onto her back and over the bedpan. Hold the bedpan close to the patient's body as you work.



, Carefully raise the head of the bed, bringing the patient's body up into a more natural toileting position.

, Ask the patient to spread his legs slightly so that you can verify proper bedpan placement.Essentially, you need to make sure that the bedpan is positioned securely beneath the entire area of the buttocks.

, Place toilet paper within the patient's reach. Let the patient know that it's there.You should also provide sanitary wipes for the patient's hands.
Keep a signal cord, bell, or similar device near the patient, too. Instruct the patient to ring the signal when finished.

, Give the patient privacy as she uses the bedpan. Let her know you will be back to check in a few minutes, but instruct the patient to ring for you if she finishes before then.Do not leave the patient if doing so would be unsafe.

, As soon as you leave the patient, you should remove your gloves and wash your hands.


Several minutes may pass before you return to the patient again. Before doing so, wash your hands once more and put on a new, clean pair of disposable gloves.

, Return to the patient's side as soon as you receive a signal from him.Bring a basin of warm water, soap, toilet paper, and sanitary cleansing cloths with you when you return.
If the patient does not signal to you within five to ten minutes, check on his progress. Continue checking every few minutes.

, Lower the head of the bed as much as possible without making the patient uncomfortable.This position will make it easier for the patient to move off the bedpan.

, If the patient lifted herself onto the bedpan, the patient should also lift herself off. If you need to turn the patient onto the bedpan, you will need to turn the patient off.If the patient can lift herself:

Ask the patient to bend her knees.
Instruct the patient to raise her lower half. Place your hand beneath the lower back to offer gentle support.


If the patient cannot lift herself:

Hold the bedpan flat on the bed so that it does not spill.
Simultaneously roll the patient to the side facing away from you.



, Slide the bedpan from its current position and allow the patient to rest.Work carefully and avoid sliding the bedpan against the patient's skin while removing it.
Cover the bedpan with a towel and set it aside for the time being.

, Determine whether or not the patient was able to clean himself. If not, you will need to clean the patient.Clean the patient's hands with a wet, soapy washcloth or sanitary wipes.
Clean the patient's bottom half with toilet paper. For female patients in particular, wipe from front to back to reduce the risk of contaminating the urinary tract with bacteria from the rectum.

, Once the patient is clean, remove the waterproof covering or towel.If a spill or other contamination occurs, you will need to change the bed linens and the patient's gown or clothing immediately.
If there is an odor in the room, consider spraying an air freshener.

, Help the patient shift back into a comfortable resting position.If necessary, raise or lower the entire bed or the head of the bed to keep the patient more comfortable.

, Take the bedpan to the bathroom and check its contents.


Look for anything unusual, like streaks of red, black, or green, as well as mucus or diarrhea.
If necessary, measure and record the output.

, Empty the contents of the bedpan into the toilet and flush them away.

, Unless the bedpan is disposable, you will need to clean it thoroughly before storing it.Flush out the contents of the bedpan with cold water. Pour this water into the toilet.
Scrub the bedpan with cold, soapy water and a toilet brush. Rinse it with additional cold water, and dump the water into the toilet.
Dry the bedpan and return it to its proper storage position when done.

, Remove your gloves and wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and soap.You should wash your hands for a full minute, if not longer.
Once everything is clean, you can return the room to its standard condition by opening curtains, windows, and doors that were closed for the procedure.

Use all available technology.,
Decide who will meet with the RAC.",How to Prepare for Your Next Medicare Audit," When you receive a letter notifying you of a Medicare audit, you will have 45 days to respond and schedule the audit dates.


Respond to the letter immediately. Schedule the audit and make sure the date sticks. Many auditors travel, and canceling and rescheduling is inconvenient and not a good way to gain favor with your auditor.
Avoid missing the deadline or trying to delay the audit. This will only cause problems for you and raise suspicion with the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) who conducts the audit.;
, Everyone in your practice, hospital or healthcare facility should understand the importance of the Medicare audit.


Run a training or a seminar on Medicare and the purpose of the audit. Not only will this keep your staff informed, having such a training on the books will demonstrate to CMS and your RAC the seriousness with which you take the matter.
Encourage extra professionalism on the days of the audit. Remind employees not to discuss patients or cases in public areas.

, Having a dedicated group of employees trained and prepared to respond to an audit will keep the process streamlined and efficient.


Invite your smartest employees and best communicators to be on the audit team. It would also help to have someone on the team who has been through an audit before.
Task the team with keeping management updated and informed as they prepare files for the audit.

, The CMS provides quarterly provider updates which your audit team should collect and review.

, If previous Medicare audits have revealed improper payments or coding mistakes, make sure steps were taken to rectify those problems.

, Medicare is permitted to look at Medicare claims as old as 4 years.

,


Determine whether any mistakes were made in Medicare payments in the last 4 years so you will be prepared for any issues that the auditor uncovers. Having a plan in place to correct those mistakes will save you a step after the audit.

,


Use programs that are specifically designed for Medicare audits. You can electronically respond to the audit letter and begin to prepare your files.
Look for a program that works well for your staff. There are web-based portals, software programs and other tools that will allow your audit team to track and respond to internal and external issues.

, This will depend on the size and operation of your facility. Sometimes, the CEO meets with the auditors, and sometimes it is an administrative manager.


Make sure your facility's representative is polite, professional and flexible. He or she is the person who will have to provide any last minute information or respond to the RAC's (Recovery Audit Contractor) requests while he or she is on site.

Ask a loved one or trusted friend to go with you to the appointments before the surgery and take notes on what you will need to do. The person will also be able to provide you with emotional support.
If you don’t understand what the doctor wants you to do, don’t be afraid to ask. It is important that you follow the instructions; the doctor will prefer that you ask lots of questions, rather than make a mistake.If no one is able to accompany you, you can take notes yourself and then read them back to the doctor to confirm that you understood correctly or you can ask your doctor if you can record the conversation. If you ask to record the conversation, explain why you want to do this.;
, It is important to discuss your medications in detail with your doctor before the day of surgery. Your doctor needs to know what medications you are on, how much you take, and when you take them. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and vitamins. Your doctor will be able to evaluate whether they are likely to interact with the anesthesia or other medications that you will need.Be honest with your doctor if you abuse drugs or alcohol. It is important that your doctor know exactly what chemicals are in your system in order to plan your procedure.
Your doctor may ask specifically about medications such as aspirin or other blood thinners. You might be advised not to take them right before the surgery.

, This might include preparations to do in the day before or morning of the surgery. It might also include ways to prepare for the recovery period. Read and review the hospital’s discharge policy. If you have any questions, ask them now. Things to ask include:When should you stop eating or drinking the day before the surgery?
Do you need to stop taking medications before the surgery?
Do you need to wash with a special antibacterial soap before the surgery?
How long will the recovery take?
Are there any special arrangements that you should make ahead of time?

, Your doctor may have suggestions based on how long the recovery is likely to take. Both emotional and physical support are important for a safe and quick recovery. There are several things you might want to consider:



Cook and freeze food before your surgery so that you won’t have to worry about what to eat or where to get it while you are recovering. Then during your recovery, you can simply remove your frozen meals from the freezer, thaw them, and have something delicious to enjoy.Make changes in your house to minimize the physical activity you will have to do. If your your bedroom is upstairs, you can prepare a bed downstairs so that you don’t have to climb stairs until you are ready. You can also make arrangements to have a friend or housekeeping service help you with the housework if you need it.
If you live alone, you might consider asking a friend to stay with you for a few days to provide emotional support and help.

, This person will both be able to provide you with emotional support and help you get settled at home.Your doctor will probably instruct you not to drive for several weeks after surgery. Make plans to have friends and family members drive you places you may need to go.

, This will give you time to pack everything without feeling rushed or anxious the morning of the surgery. It will help prevent you from forgetting anything important. You should bring:A list of your medications and what they are prescribed for.
Your health insurance card. If you have extra documentation for prescription drugs, bring that as well.
Personal items such as glasses, hearing aids, and dentures
Toiletry items such as a comb, brush, toothbrush, razor
Walking aids like a cane or walker
A robe, slippers, and your favorite pillow
Loose clothing. Women should bring a comfortable, wireless bra.
Books or music that will help you relax
No electronics or valuables
A small amount of money to store in a hospital safe, if one will be available to you. This will enable you to pay for medications that you take home with you.

, Be sure to get plenty of sleep the night before and to follow any fasting instructions given by your doctor. This may include:Showering and washing with a special soap, provided by the hospital
Taking only medications your doctor has said you can take
Taking off all jewelry and nail polish
Removing contact lenses, dentures, and glasses before going into surgery
Telling your anesthesiologist if you have difficulties tolerating anesthesia

, You need to be as healthy as possible going into the surgery. This includes even minor illnesses like a cold or the flu. If you have a fever, coughing, or a stuffy nose before surgery, tell your doctor so she can evaluate if you are healthy enough for the procedure.During the two weeks before your surgery, avoid spending time with people who have the flu or a cold.
Wash your hands frequently, especially after shaking hands with people, being in public, or before preparing food.
If it is cold or flu season, ask your doctor if you should avoid crowds of people and public transportation. Avoiding crowds may help you reduce your chances of getting exposed to something.

, If you smoke, you will need to stop at least two weeks before the procedure. Not only does smoking damage your heart, but it can complicate your surgery. It may cause:Blood clots
Breathing difficulties

, A bacterial infection in your mouth can increase the risk that you could have bacteria in your blood which might cause an infection. Tell your doctor:What procedures you have scheduled
When they are scheduled
Why you need the procedures. Your doctor may have advice about when to get the procedures done. If you are having elective valve surgery, you should have most elective dental work done before surgery. If you will have major dental surgery, you will usually have to take antibiotics with the dental procedure.

, It is natural to be worried about undergoing heart surgery; however, the physiological changes that your body goes through when under stress are also an additional burden to your heart. You can ease your stress by:


Talking to your doctor to learn as much as you can about the procedure you will have. Successful heart surgeries are performed every day. You may find it reassuring to research the success rates. Contact your hospital to ask if they have information on your particular procedure, such as how long it is expected to take, how long you will be in the hospital, and the mortality rate or likelihood of complications. Ask your doctor what will happen if you don't get the surgery.
Use relaxation techniques. These methods can help you to control your emotions and reduce stress. You can try deep breathing exercises, meditation, visualizing calming images, and progressively tensing and relaxing the different muscle groups throughout your body.Consult your doctor before starting any new physical activities to make sure your doctor feels that it will be safe for you. Depending on your condition, this could include even mild forms of exercise such as taking walks or doing yoga.

Eat a regular meal after the test is over.",How to Prepare for a Colonoscopy," Colonoscopy is the best technology available for determining whether cancerous or precancerous growths called polyps are present in the colon. Early detection can enable patients to get the treatment they need to prevent growths from advancing to the next stage. The American Cancer Society recommends that people over age 50 should have a colonoscopy every 10 years.Those who are at increased risk of getting colon cancer should have the test done more frequently. This includes people in the following categories:


Those with a personal history of colon cancer or polyps.
Those with a family history of colon cancer.
Those with a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or Crohn's disease.
Those with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).;
, The procedure begins with a rectal exam, during which the physician will feel around the anal and rectal area. A long, thin probe called a colonoscope is then inserted into the colon through the anus. The probe has a tiny camera on the end that can provide images of the colon, revealing the presence of polyps or other growths.


In order to ensure the camera can provide clear images of the colon, it must be empty during the procedure. This means the patient must not eat solid foods the day before and day of the procedure.
The patient is often given medicine to help them relax during the procedure. Many don't remember the procedure once they wake up. It usually lasts about 30 minutes., When you first meet with your doctor to discuss your colonoscopy, you will be given instructions as to how to prepare your body for the test. You'll be told not to eat solid foods and instructed on how much liquid you should drink, and when. Following these instructions is very important to ensure that your colon is clean on the day of the procedure. If it isn't, the camera won't be able to get a clear view of your colon - which might mean you'll have to do it all over again on a different day.


Even having a snack could end up meaning your test will have to get cancelled. It will be tough to fast the day before the test, but it will definitely pay off in the end when your test is over and done with quickly.
It might help to prepare yourself a week in advance by eating lightly leading up to the day before the exam.

, There are certain medications that patients have to stop taking one or more days before the exam. It's very important to be up front with your doctor about what medications you're on before you prepare for the test. In some cases you will need to stay on your medication anyway, but in other cases your doctor might advise you to stop taking them for a few days. Nutritional supplements can also interfere with the test. Talk with your doctor if you're taking any of the following medicines or supplements:


Anti-inflammatory medication
Blood thinner medications
Aspirin
Diabetes medicine
Blood pressure medication
Fish oil supplements

, Colonoscopies are normally schedule in the morning. Clear your schedule so you have time to prepare for undergo the test. Since your doctor will likely give you medicine to relax you, you may be too drowsy to drive home from the test, so consider asking someone to drive you home. You may want to take the entire day off of work, or at least schedule in an hour or two to rest.

, This is the only type of liquid or food you can consume the day before your colonoscopy. A liquid is deemed ""clear"" if you can see through it to read a newspaper. Clear liquids include the following:


Water
Apple juice without pulp
Tea or coffee without milk
Clear chicken or vegetable broth
Soda
Clear sports drinks
Flavored gelatin
Popsicles
Hard candy
Honey

, Any liquids containing pulp or dairy and almost all solid foods should be avoided. Don't eat or drink the following:


Orange juice, pineapple juice or any other juice you can't see through
Dairy products like milk or milk shakes, cheese, etc.
Smoothies
Soups with chunks of food
Grains
Meat
Vegetables
Fruit

, Breakfast, lunch and dinner the day before the procedure should each be composed of at least 4 8-10 ounce glasses of clear liquids.


You could have a glass of coffee without milk, a glass of apple juice and two glasses of water for breakfast.
You could have a glass of sports drink, a glass of clear broth and two glasses of water for lunch.
You could snack on clear hard candy, popsicles or jello.
You could have a glass of tea, a glass of vegetable broth and two glasses of water for dinner.

, Your doctor should have given you a prep medication that you should begin taking at 6:00 pm the day before the test. The prep medication will help to clear your colon for the following day. Sometimes doctors prescribe split prep medication, which means that half should be taken in the evening and half the same day of the test. Follow your doctor's instructions and the instructions on the prep medication packaging. After taking the prep, your stool should begin looking like the clear liquids you've been consuming - that's how you know it's working.


If your stool still looks brown and murky, the prep medication has not yet taken effect.
If it's tan or orange and clear, it's starting to work.
Your bowel prep is complete and you're ready to go when your stool looks clear and yellowish, like urine.

, Do not eat solids the morning of the test. Stick to water, apple juice, tea, or black coffee in the morning.

, If your doctor ordered a 2-part prep, you'll need to take the second part the morning of the test. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.

, Drink 2 8-10 ounce sports drinks right before going to the test, then report for your scheduled colonoscopy.

, You're free to eat whatever you want for the rest of the day.

Consider the situation confronting you.,
Consider your effort vs. the payoff in your current situation.,
Realize that giving up on something in our lives can be a way of shutting one door and opening numerous others.,
Don't listen to people who have no other advice than to ""keep with it."",
Be open about your change of plans and use positive language about your decision to quit.,
Expect doubt to visit now and then.,
Know that you are not someone who gives up generally.",How to Give Up," What is it about the situation that makes you feel like quitting? Is it a long-term problem or simply one that has arisen recently? The duration of a challenge in your life is an important determinant on the worthiness of sticking with something. The rationale that you have done something for a long time, and that investment of time requires you to stick with it until you've seen it through can be an albatross around your neck. It can tie you to something that will ultimately not be fulfilling, and might even turn out badly. Don't stick with something just because you have been doing it a long time - just because you've been doing it for years is no reason to continue doing it. Your reason for continuing must be stronger than that. Not only that, but giving up before you have really started on something is not always wrong - even if you're at altitude in the plane, you can still decide not to make that parachute jump. There are times when listening to our instincts just makes sense for our own personality type.;
, Sometimes, your vision of the career path you choose differs from the reality. Perhaps you wanted to become a Disney animator, but after working in the field awhile, you see that the work is repetitive and it feels tedious to you. Or perhaps you started a graphic design business, but after a few years, you realize that the amount of labor often far exceeds the price you can reasonably charge for each job. Coming to the realization that the payoff does not compensate you for the effort you need to invest is the key. Realizing this is not quitting in the negative sense. It is an honest, unsparing appraisal of your situation. Even Donald Trump advises entrepreneurs ""not to fall so in love with their own ideas that they don't know when to cut their losses - quit and move on."" He advises getting out before those ideas drag you down and you lose everything. In other words, if you're working for peanuts, exhausting yourself for little return, and decide to end this venture so that you can try something that will be more personally or financially rewarding, that's simply cutting out an unprofitable venture and freeing yourself to pursue a better path. It should not be seen as just quitting because something is hard. It's the same with personal ventures - if your relationship is all you, giving all the time, always bending away from what you want, and never coming back your direction (give and take), give up. Break it off and meet someone new who will be more compatible with your wants.

, Even if it's a cut-and dried defeat, it may not be all bad. When something in life defeats us (whether it be a relationship, studies, a project, work, friendships, etc.), it isn't the end of the world. It might hurt a lot, frustrate you, and cause you to rethink everything you've ever believed in, but it is really important to view this as one phase in your life - a time that you have experienced and have learned from. The next stage of your life will be different, as it will be informed by what has happened and what you had to quit in order to move forward. Take this positive view of the ending being a learning process and you will forge ahead well into your new endeavors.

, If they cannot come up with any real and convincing reasons for you to stick with something that is simply not working out in your life, other than that ""giving up is for wimps"", you are not getting good advice. Socially, we are all fed the ideal that giving up is a last resort and not a good one in any case. Realistically, giving up is an essential part of moving on and getting things right the next time around.

, The manner in which you frame your choice to give up whatever it is that is ailing you and holding you back matters. If you go around with sagging shoulders, hunched back, quivering lip, and an attitude as fragile as glass, you risk others amplifying the ""wrong"" decision you have made to give up. On the other hand, if you keep a spring in your step despite your reservation, and you have clear, well-thought out responses to people's qualms about your choice, you will fare much better. People respond positively to a positive take on hard luck stories because they inevitably place themselves in your shoes and try to envision how they would react if it happened to them; moreover, many people are actively storing away your decision to inform their own life's path! So give them something positive and constructive to take away from your experience with your upbeat explanations about why your decision was the right one. They may even have some positive reinforcement or great idea to add, once you have them on board with your decision to quit.

, It's only natural. Equally, however, be ready to counteract doubt immediately with all of the reasons for why giving up was such an essential and important part of your life's growth at this point in time.

, In other words, this has all been about knowing how to pick your battles, rather than a personality trait. Realizing that this is not ""the hill you want to die on"" means you have become discerning enough to know when it is worth hanging in there for something you truly believe has a real chance to work out well. Realistic analysis of your situation is always key to making a sensible decision about giving up. Ultimately, keep in mind that giving up in any instance is about the particular situation in your life, not a way of being for your entire life.

Acknowledge your emotions.,
Modify your thinking.,
Face your reality gap.,
Practice acceptance.,
Give gratitude.,
Be resilient.,
Practice spirituality.",How to Get Through Tough Times1," You may want to ignore the painful feelings the situation brings up or pretend your feelings do not exist. Recognize that by pushing your feelings away, you create more negative emotions. It’s better to accept your feelings and work through them. Don’t try to rationalize the way you feel; the only way to work through your emotions is by feeling them.


For example, if you lose your job, it’s okay to admit you feel angry, upset, fearful, and vengeful.
Set aside 15 minutes each day to feel your emotions. Don’t let your mind interfere, just sit and feel what you feel.You can journal your thoughts and feelings.
Don’t be afraid to cry. Crying releases negative chemicals from the body, and also helps relieve stress, lift your mood, and help you deal with painful circumstances.;
, Try to view the situation as an opportunity to grow and improve.For example, try reminding yourself of how strong and resilient you are during tough times. When you look at things from this perspective, it’s a lot more empowering.


If you didn’t get into the college you wanted to attend, your world isn’t over and you won’t lose your shot at having a career. Remember that you have options and that positive things will come of the situation.
Try to keep your worries in perspective. Try asking yourself, “Is this worry really that bad in the grand scheme of things?” If you are worried about something in the future, ask yourself, “How likely is it that this will really happen?”
If you find that you are worrying incessantly, try choosing a “worry time.” At the beginning of each day, select a 15 minute time interval, in advance, when you can worry about your problems. If thoughts of any problems try to intrude outside of the designated “worry time,” then remind yourself that it’s not “worry time” yet.

, Often life gives you one option when you wanted an entirely different option. The greater distance between what you have and what you want, the greater pain you may experience.Recognize that the reality you wanted did not come true, and you must now live in a different reality.


Instead of resenting your situation, acknowledge that you must adapt to your situation. For instance, if you lack financial resources, don’t keep spending money like you did before. Acknowledge that your spending habits may need to change.

, Many things in life are out of your control, from the traffic on the highway to your boss being irritable at work. Instead of getting wound up and irritated at these situations, take a breath and practice accepting what is out of your control. While you cannot control the situation, you can control your reaction.


You can practice acceptance through meditation. Write a list of all the things that are out of your control. Then, close your eyes and slow your breathing until you are in a meditative state. Imagine handing your list over to a higher power and letting those things go., Even in the most dire of circumstances, having a grateful attitude can provide a much needed perspective that widens your experience beyond your current pain.Even if you feel like you have lost many things, take a moment and acknowledge what you do have, especially the non-material things such as friendship, physical ability, or pleasant weather.


Set aside time each day to reflect on what you are grateful for: you may be grateful for your dog, your children, a beautiful sunset, a pleasant walk, or a much-needed phone call with your sister. Take a few moments and express gratitude for these things.
Remember the toughest points in your life, then remember that you are right here, having successfully worked through those situations and the dark times. You were able to endure that before, and you can endure this now.

, Resiliency is engaging the process of adapting to changes, whether they be temporary, life-long, or crisis situations. Look at the big picture and don’t see difficulties as never-ending. They will end, and you will get through it.Resiliency doesn’t develop when stress is removed from life, it develops when you’re exposed to stress and have adequate time and tools to recover.For example, you may break your leg and not be able to walk for quite some time. Resiliency means finding ways to adapt to your new situation-- like excelling at physical therapy to build up strength, and getting good with a wheelchair or crutches-- knowing that you as a person will prevail, even if your ability changes.
Reflect on past difficulties and what you gained from them. Some people report feeling more confident in their abilities or having a deeper appreciation of life.Know that there is likely some lessons for you to learn through this experience.

, Many people find spirituality helpful when coping with difficult events.Some positive spiritual coping methods include calling in support from a higher power, spiritual forgiveness, reframing the situation from a meaningful benevolent framework, and meditating on positive things."
"
Avoid things that remind you of the event as much as possible, they will only bring your mind back to the subject of what happened.,
Meditate.

,
Remember your regular routines, and do them.

,
Don't watch the Telly much.,
Talk to others.,
Keep up with a good group of people who make you feel safe and happy.

,
Talk to a therapist if nothing really works.,
If someone has passed, don't feel as if you can't do the things you like to do again and you have to keep mourning.

,
Do something you like to do.,
Be positive in any situation.

,
Enjoy your life and don't live it in fear.,
Love yourself and your life, and the people in it.

",How to Get Your Mind off of Traumatizing Previous Events,";
,,, Go for a walk instead, they get juices in your brain going. And it is nice to have a nice breath of fresh air. Don't go alone if you are afraid to.

, Even if they haven't been through the same thing they will still listen to you. Don't talk about the event if you really don't want to. Just nicely hint it to them if it makes you uncomfortable.

,, don't feel as if you are broken because you are not. Something has traumatized you and that is fine, you just need some extra support to get it off your mind and think of other things.

Relax.",How to Get over the Silent Treatment," Especially if the person uses the silent treatment often, recognize that this is a form of emotional abuse. Emotional abuse may go less detected than physical abuse, but it is still damaging and can affect your self-esteem, sense of self, and self-worth. If you feel isolated or humiliated as a result of the silent treatment, the person may be using it as a form of emotional abuse.Be firm in addressing the silence. Say, “This is abusive and I won’t stand for it.”
You cannot change someone. If the person has promised to change yet no progress has been made, take some steps to deal with emotional abuse on your own terms. Involve the support of other people. You may need to leave the relationship.;
, It’s likely the person doesn’t practice healthy boundaries, so it’s up to you to create some. Start by identifying your physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental limits. Think about what makes you feel upset or stressed and what you feel is intolerable in your relationships. Let the person know your boundaries and when they cross them.Be assertive in enforcing your boundaries. Say, “I refuse to engage in the silent treatment. Either you need to use a different approach or I can’t be a part of this any longer.”
You can also say, “You might use the silent treatment, but I don’t. We must discuss this.”

, Ultimately, you can’t change the other person, no matter how hard you try to make things better. If the relationship is abusive and harmful for you, consider walking away. Tell them you need to move on. Your well-being is more important than spending time around someone who has no qualms about emotionally abusing you.Don’t accept emotional abuse in your life. You deserve relationships with people who are willing and capable of communicating in a mature and healthy manner.
People who have long histories of this behavior aren't likely to be ""fixed"" for your friendship or relationship. In the end, you will be happier and have more time and space in your life for others who are ready for your friendship or love.

, The silent treatment is a form of attention, power, and control over another person and is a passive-aggressive approach in communication.Someone might use the silent treatment as a way to avoid conflict or deflect responsibility. At times, people use the silent treatment as a way to punish another person.Ultimately, the person lacks the ability to communicate their feelings appropriately.


For example, a person may want to shift blame onto you instead of owning their faults. Or, they want to magnify your faults instead of recognizing their own. Whatever it is, the silent treatment makes you feel guilty or at fault instead of them.

, Your first reaction may be frustration, anger, or upset. While it’s valid to feel this way, responding with aggression will likely make matters worse. Above all, don’t give the silent treatment back. Nothing will become resolved if you both further your contempt for each other!Staying calm means that you stay in control.
If you notice yourself becoming agitated or angry, focus on your breath. Take long, deep breaths until you feel your body and mind settling down., Take the initiative to talk things over. This means that you will be the mature person and approach them to confront the problem. Choose a time when both of your are available and don't have to rush off to anything, then invite them to talk. Say, “Do you have some time? I’d like to talk and gain some understanding.”

The person may not be ready to talk yet. If they don’t seem ready, say, “I can see you’re not ready to talk about this. Let’s revisit this in three days and talk then.”
Prepare for the conversation ahead of time and plan to meet. For example, say, “I want to talk to you about some problems. Are you available to talk on Tuesday?”, It’s not up to you to mind read or guess what’s going on with the other person. It is their responsibility to express their thoughts and feelings. If you’re not sure what’s going on, ask. Say, “I’ve noticed you’re distant. What’s going on?”


For example, say, “I’m curious as to what’s contributing to your silence. Can you share with me what’s going on?” If they refuse to engage, say, “We can’t move forward if you’re not willing to engage. I need to know what’s going on and I need your cooperation.”
If they remain firm, say that you will revisit the issue later.

, Give them space to share what they’re thinking and feeling. They may or may not talk, but give them the option to describe what’s going on and really listen. Don't assume to know everything Instead, ask lots of open-ended questions to try to elicit some clarity from the person.You can say, “I’d like to hear what you’re upset about, and I’m willing to listen to you if you’re ready to share.”
Facilitate healthy communication and model appropriate behaviors by asking questions and letting them share without interrupting them.

, Make it clear how their silence makes you feel. Tell them that their behavior leaves little room for resolving issues and will likely damage your relationship. However, stay away from blaming them (like saying, “All you do is put things on me” or, “You expect me to solve problems for you”) and instead, say “I” statements (such as, “I feel like you want me to be responsible for your feelings”).Stick to the facts about how the lack of communication between both of you means that things don't get resolved.

, The silent treatment often leads to some time apart. Instead of resenting the person or becoming upset about their actions, appreciate the space and use the time and get in touch with yourself. Put the focus on yourself and not the other person by asking yourself, “What am I feeling?” Recognize any needs you have and take care of them.

, Although the silent treatment is annoying, try to see things through the person’s perspective. Perhaps they don’t know how to express their feelings. The silent treatment can be a way of coping for the person, albeit an ineffective way. Let them know you’re aware that they are upset and you care about how they feel.For example, say, “I can tell you’re upset, even if you can’t talk about it.”

, If you know you’ve said or done something hurtful, fess up. The silent treatment may be a way of expressing hurt without verbalizing that hurt. If you know you’re in the wrong, say something. This gives you a chance to connect with their feelings and let them know that you’re aware of the pain you’ve caused.Just feeling heard can soften their wall.


For example, if you said something hurtful, say, ""I'm sorry, I didn’t realize how much I hurt you when I said that.""
However, do not make this about taking the burden onto your shoulders or taking responsibility for something just to resolve the issue or stop their silence. Acknowledge any wrongdoing on your own behalf but don't apologize for the sake of ending the silence.

, Especially if the person is a family member, partner, or spouse, you may benefit in getting counseling together. Silent treatment is a form of stonewalling, and it does not lead to feelings of intimacy, trust, or happiness in a relationship. See a therapist to help both of you improve your communication and self-expression.Find a couple's or family therapist. You can call your insurance provider or local mental health clinic, or obtain a recommendation from a friend, family member, or physician.

, Talk to a supportive friend or family member about your experience. If you’re confused or don’t know what to do, it can help to talk it over and hear someone else’s perspective. Even if talking about it doesn’t solve the problem, it can be helpful in clearing your head and organizing your thoughts.Find a trustworthy and supportive friend who’s a good listener.
You can also talk to a therapist if you want support and coping strategies.

, Don’t dwell on how the other person is making you feel. Instead, focus on doing things that put you in a good space. Make some time for activities you enjoy and are important to you. This is a great way to show care toward yourself and not let the other person’s actions get the best of you.For example, go for a bike ride, listen to music, paint, or play with your dog. Do the things that make you feel great.

, Dealing with the silent treatment can be stressful, so deal with stress regularly. Make sure you’re making time for yourself and including some relaxation. Practice a relaxing activity every day and aim to do it for 30 minutes or more.Listen to music, do some yoga, or meditate.

Try using a journal to keep track of how you’re feeling. Your emotions may vary throughout the day and you want to keep track of them to see if there are any patterns. Note the time of day the emotion occurs, who was present, where you were, and what happened before and after you started to feel that way.
Different emotions can sometimes feel very similar. For example, you may experience anger when you’re really pretty sad about something. Ask yourself “why” you’re feeling a certain way so that you can really figure out what you’re experiencing.
For example, if you are mad at your ex-boyfriend for ending the relationship, you may ask yourself, “Why am I mad?” You may realize that you’re actually more sad then you are mad.;
, Never make your feelings wrong and don’t try to hide them. Sometimes people think that accepting an emotion will make them feel worse, when really it’s a part of the healing process. Avoiding the emotion is what may actually make you feel worse over the long haul.Instead, try saying out loud to yourself, “It is okay that I am feeling ____.”

, Allowing yourself to express what you are feeling is a great way to begin the releasing process. Here are some things that you can do to release what you are feeling:Writing your feelings down helps to release the emotions through paper. Try journaling.
Talking to someone that you trust allows you to verbally release the emotions. At home this may be a parent or older sibling. At school, it may be best to approach a favorite teacher or your school counselor.
Exercising allows you to use your physical body to express and release emotions.
Crying helps you release those emotions that have been pent up for so long.

, Once you have identified your emotions, accepted them, and began the process of releasing them, it’s time to use some coping strategies to feel better. These coping techniques should focus on helping you take care of yourself in a healthy way.Some people enjoy pampering themselves while others love to use exercise as a stress reducer. Find something that you can do to self-soothe and be sure to do that daily.


As you journal your emotions you may see a pattern begin to emerge. For example, you might notice that you’re sad when you go to a particular place or you get jealous a lot when you’re with a specific person. Your coping strategies should include avoiding these triggers whenever possible.
If you can’t identify a specific source of your feelings then you may be dealing with symptoms of a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety. For example, if you find that you’re always angry in the morning, but you don’t know why, then you should probably see a mental health professional.
If you feel like the emotions are overwhelming or if you feel like hurting/killing yourself, then you should seek help from a trusted adult such as a parent, teacher, counselor, or minister immediately. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1 (800) 273-8255.

, Keep in mind that peer pressure isn’t always a bad thing.The desire to make friends and fit in with your peers is completely normal. However, when your friends try to convince you to do something that you know isn’t right, then it's time to stick to your morals and simply tell your friends no. It can be hard sometimes, but the consequences could far outweigh your friends being a little upset with you.


Always consider the possible consequences before you do anything. For instance, you might ask yourself, “what if the police arrived at the house party and catch me drinking?” or “what would happen if I have sex and get an STD or become pregnant?” If the cons outweigh the pros, then you should let your friends know that you’re not interested.
Your friends may say things to try to convince you to participate even after you’ve said no. They may say “You’re a chicken” or call you names. At that point, it’s probably best to leave and go home.

, Many teenagers fall prey to peer pressure because of struggles with self-esteem.Many teens temporarily succumb to peer pressure in an effort to feel accepted by friends. After all, who wants to feel left out? However, it’s important for you to be the leader rather than the follower. When you find yourself questioning who you are and what you stand for, remind yourself of all of your great attributes.


These attributes are both internal and external. So yes, be sure to include your amazing talents and accomplishments but also consider your other assets as well. This could include your unique personality traits, the way that you always demonstrate kindness, your creativity, your ability to listen well, or anything else that demonstrates how amazing you are.

, If you find yourself in a situation where your friends are pressuring you to do something that you don’t want to do, it’s okay to tell them that you can’t participate because of your parents. Avoid lashing out or sounding mad at your parents, though. Always talk calmly and reasonably, and have a mature attitude. You absolutely would be telling the truth because your parents would not want you to do anything that is harmful to yourself or others. To get out of that sticky situation, you could say things like:


“My mom wants me to come home now.”
“My dad will ground me for two months if I even think about doing that!”
“My mom said that if she ever caught me doing _____ that I wouldn’t be able to come outside again for a month.”

, Spend time around other kids who share your same values and morals. When you spend time around positive peers, they are less likely to try to influence you to engage in risky behavior.Get involved in healthy activities where you can make friends with kids who have good values and high self-esteem. Sports teams, church groups, and extracurricular activities are great places to find like-minded friends.
You may never be totally immune from peer pressure even if you have great friends. Remember, it’s ultimately up to you to make wise decisions.

, Bullies typically bully other people because of issues that are going on in their own lives. Unfortunately, they have trouble dealing with their own problems so they project their unhappiness onto you. However, it’s important for you to know that the bullying isn’t really about you. You have many wonderful characteristics, regardless of what a bully may say. She’s probably bullying you for one of the following reasons:A desire to feel powerful
Jealousy
To look tough in front of others
To feel powerful
To escape her own internal pain
She’s being bullied herself

, The easiest thing to do is to simply walk away from the bully. You can also remain where you are and ignore her. Alternatively, you can stand up for yourself by calmly telling the bully that you are not interested in what she has to say. The most important thing at this point is to keep your cool. You don’t want to react emotionally and run the risk of responding with aggression.


Responding to a bully with humor will often make you a less interesting target for her. Humorous responses often results in the bully losing interest, which means that she may stop targeting you.
Be sure that you keep yourself safe. Not responding aggressively does not mean that you should allow yourself to be in an unsafe situation. If you are being physically hurt, it’s okay to protect yourself so that you can remove yourself from that unsafe situation., If a bully is not confronted about her behavior, she may become more and more aggressive toward you. It’s very important for you to get a trusted adult involved so that things do not escalate.Be relentless in making the bullying stop. Report each and every incident of bullying until it no longer occurs. Never be ashamed to get help. You’re probably not the only one being bullied but you can help put an end to it.
Most of the time adults can find solutions to the problem without letting the bully know that you told on her. Some solutions could be changing your classes or changing your seat in class. The person who is bullying you may receive other disciplinary actions a well.
If you witness bullying occurring to someone else, you should report that as well. No one deserves to be bullied.

, Remind yourself that the bully is just an unhappy person who is trying to make you as miserable as she is.When you think of it from this perspective, the bullying loses some of its power. Remember, don’t allow the bully to control your emotions.


Create a list of all of the positive attributes about yourself. You can also include all the good things that are going on in your life. Whenever you’re feeling down, you can focus on that list.
Try not to make the situation worse by dwelling on the incident and constantly replaying it in your head. Instead, focus on the positive things that happened during the day.

, Be sure to talk about your experiences. Although you don’t want to dwell on the bullying all day, it is important that you have the opportunity to express your feelings. You can talk to a parent, family member, teacher, counselor, clergyman or friend. Talking about it will likely help you feel much better.Give yourself time to heal. Being bullied is a pretty traumatic experience. Talking about it will help but it may take a bit of time before you feel back to normal again.
It’s okay to seek help from a professional if you notice that you’re having a hard time dealing with feelings of anger, hurt, or other negative emotions.

, Volunteering is a great way to let go of the feelings of helplessness that may occur after being bullied.You may want to reach out to other teenagers or younger kids who have been bullied or maybe become active in your school’s anti-bullying campaign. It doesn’t matter what you choose to do, however it’s important to regain a sense of control by becoming active.

, Make it a point to talk to your parents every day. There is no specific topic that you have to focus on; just mundane trivial things are fine. Tell them about something funny that happened in school or about how you did on your history test. Try to make the conversations fun and enjoyable. Creating this bond now will make it much easier to approach them about more serious topics later on.It’s never too late to start working on this bond. Even if you and your parents have struggled in the past, you can start talking to them now.
Your parents want to know more about what is going on in your life. This is an opportunity for both you and your parents to enjoy one another’s company.

, Try to approach your parent when she is not busy doing something else.Ask to tag along with mom and dad when they are going on an errand or maybe suggest going for a walk. These are great times to talk.


A good way to get the conversation started is by saying, “Mom, is this a good time to talk?” or “Dad, can we talk?”

, It’s important to know exactly what it is that you want to achieve from this conversation. Keep in mind that you’ll probably want one of four things from your parents: Permission or support to do something; advice or help with an issue; to be heard or understood without receiving advice or any feedback; or for them to lovingly guide you back on the right path if you’ve gotten yourself into trouble.Be sure to communicate what you need from your parents at the very beginning of the conversation.


You could say something like, “Mom, I want to tell you what is bothering me. I'm not necessarily seeking advice; I'd just like to talk about what is troubling me"". Or you could say, “Dad, I’d really like permission to go on a trip with a friend to the mountains next weekend. Can I tell you about it?”
Bringing up difficult topics can be stressful so it’s okay to write down points that you don’t want to forget. You can refer to your notes during the conversation.

, Sometimes difficult topics produce strong emotions that might prevent you from wanting to talk to your parents. You may be scared or embarrassed to have the discussion. However, don’t let that stop you from having the conversation. Instead, tell your parents what your feeling as a part of the conversation.For example, you could say, “I want to talk to you about something that is going on but I’m afraid that you’ll be angry with me.” Similarly you could say, “I’m scared to talk about this because it’s kind of embarrassing.”
If you’re afraid that your parents may be critical or very angry, you might say something like, “I have to tell you something that may make you angry or disappoint you. I am very sorry for what I did but I have to tell you about it. Can you hear me out for a few minutes?”

, You won’t always see eye to eye with your parents about every issue. However, it’s important to communicate your thoughts in a respectful manner. Here are some strategies to try to keep the conversation respectful:Remain calm and avoid derogatory comments. Instead of saying “You’re so unfair” and “I hate you,” you could say, “Mom, I disagree and here’s why…”
Don’t make it personal. Remind yourself that you are mad at the concept or the decision, not your parent, per se.
Use “I” statements instead of “You” statements. For instance, instead of saying, “You don’t ever trust me to do anything” you could say “I feel like I’m mature enough to date. I was thinking maybe I could start out by going on group dates.”
Try to understand the decision from your parents’ point of view. When you communicate that you understand them then they may be more likely to try to look at situations from your perspective as well.

, Your parents generally have your best interest at heart which means that they won’t always be able to say yes. They may listen, try to be supportive, and guide you as lovingly as possible. However, it’s important to know that you won’t always get a yes. During these times, receive the no gracefully. Use a respectful tone and try not to argue or whine. Responding this way takes a lot of maturity; and when they see that you are behaving in a mature manner they may be more inclined to say yes the next time.When you’re disappointed, sometimes it’s difficult to respond gracefully. It might be a good idea to remover yourself for a while to go blow off some steam. Try going for a walk or jog, cry, hit your pillow, vent to a friend, or do any other constructive activity that will help you blow off some steam.
If your parents are unable to sufficiently meet your emotional needs when you need support, then try seeking support and guidance from another trusted adult. A teacher, minister, guidance counselor, or relative may be good options.

Problem solve.,
Ask for support.,
Prioritize self-care.,
Take a break.,
Engage in therapy.,
Help others.",How to Get Through Tough Times2," While many problems require time and healing, some problems can be solved with a little effort and thoughtful consideration. Think about problems you are facing that may have a solution. This can include work, finances, family, friendships, romantic relationship, and educational stresses. Write down as many solutions as you can think of for each item that you listed. It doesn’t matter whether a particular solution seems realistic or not, just write them all down.It’s amazing which solutions can actually be helpful, so you don’t want to disregard any of them in the initial brainstorming session.


For example, if you and your partner always talk about finances right before bed and end up going to bed angry, start moving your discussions to the morning and have enough time to adequately talk through all issues.
Once you know what the solutions are, be sure to create a specific actionable plan to move forward. This will probably require you to identify specific goals and the action steps that you will take to meet the goals.
For more information on goal attainment, check out How to Set Goals and Achieve Them.

, Don’t be afraid to ask for help or advice. If you are overwhelmed or if you don’t know what to do about something, there are many people who are willing to help. Whether you talk about your difficulties with family, friends, or a therapist, it can be cathartic to verbally express what’s going on to someone else.Don’t try to do it all alone. Trying to live life without support only intensifies the struggle and makes life feel worse.


Don’t let pride get in the way of you seeking help. No one knows everything and you can always reciprocate later.
Talking about your problems can allow someone to give you unique perspective that you may not have considered.
When you talk to someone else, let them know what you want. If you want feedback, ask for thoughts or feelings regarding your situation. If you just want someone to listen, make that clear. Sometimes well-intentioned people will give you feedback to try and solve your problem when all you want is to vent.

, Despite your hardships, much of life may need to go on, including taking care of kids or putting in 40 hours at your job. While getting through this difficult time, make sure you are doing things to care for your body and your emotions.It can be easy to stretch yourself thin meeting other peoples’ needs, but make time to meet your own needs, too. Be sure that you are eating healthy, getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and intentionally creating joy in your life. Find things you enjoy doing and do them.


Treat your body to a massage.
Find time to journal and express your thoughts and emotions.
Find 20 minutes each day to meditate or take a power nap.
Take a walk or go for a hike if you don’t have the time or energy to go to the gym.
Laughing decreases stress.Watch funny wipeout videos or silly animal videos to keep you laughing.
Staying positive also helps. Always search for the silver lining in everything., If you feel overwhelmed by your life situation, take a break. A break can come in many forms: it can be a vacation, a weekend getaway, or even a long walk. Taking a break can even be engaging in distraction, such as reading a book, watching a movie, or going to the gym.Find out what distractions help you cope (not run away from your problems). Find activities you enjoy and go do them! This can also include going hiking, horseback riding, or writing in a journal.

, Sometimes it can be most helpful to talk to a mental health professional when dealing with difficult times. A therapist is someone who is there to support you and ask questions that help you gain a different perspective. A therapist can help you uncover the root of your problems, work through emotional struggles, and help you make positive changes in your life.Therapy helps you explore yourself and your situation in a way that encourages growth.
A therapist can be helpful in a number of situations. If you experience job stress, relationship problems, or difficulty coping, a therapist can help.

, When going through crisis, much of your attention gets placed onto yourself and your situation, which can eventually be draining. Set aside some time to volunteer and help others to put your focus on other people. You can increase your own happiness by helping others.Offer to help out a friend with errands.
Volunteer your time at an animal shelter and help orphaned animals.
Volunteer once a week with children or older adults.

Remind yourself that, often, reputations don’t matter much.,
Know that your reputation might not reflect the real you.,
Keep in mind that reputations can change.",How to Get Rid of an Immature Reputation1," One way to ‘get rid’ of an immature reputation is simply to not let it bother you. Unless the specific content of what people think about you has serious consequences for your ability to make friends, get a job, and so on, your reputation matters only to the extent that you think it does.


Also, caring too much about your reputation can, in fact, be a sign of immaturity. So, if you are overly worried, shrug it off a little bit.Ask yourself why your reputation matters for you. What are the consequences of others seeing you as immature? If they are minor and do not impede you in any important goals, consider shrugging your reputation off and focusing on other aspects of your life that are more important to you.;
, Keep in mind that reputations are an approximate estimation of others’ incomplete knowledge of what makes you, you. People (not necessarily knowingly) may spread information about you that is inaccurate or entirely untrue.


Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself whether you believe you may be immature and if so, whether it might be worth changing your ways.
Remember not to be too bothered by information that is not an accurate reflection of yourself, unless this information is actually damaging in a real, concrete way (i.e., it impedes with a goal that you value, such as having more friends)., Take heart in the idea that just as your behaviors that contribute to an immature reputation can change, so too can your reputation."

Think about why you're sad.,
Analyze your actions from the past.,
Distract yourself.,
Talk to someone close, someone you KNOW you can trust.,
Become a better person.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Be healthy and happy.,
Help others.,
Eventually, some people who are making rumors and saying very rude things about you will stop because you are a new person.,
Stand up for yourself politely and wisely if someone is trying to get in your hair.",How to Get over Past Mistakes and Guilt," What caused you to become so guilty that it's starting to irritate you? Did you accidentally lash out at one of your friends, or did you do something overdramatic/childish? Write down your feelings, what happened, and how you could fix it. If you feel even more guilty while writing, remember, life has a purpose and it definitely isn't slouching around and telling yourself that you're no good.;
, Think about what could've happened. Don't think too deep into it so that it will only make you feel even more worse, write your actions and what could've happened down and then make a promise to yourself that you will think next time something happens.

, Listen to music, draw, write, go outside, kick a ball around, throw rocks, climb hills, do anything that will get your mind off of the painful events. Spend time with your family, have a little snack with them, gossip about things, and play games with them. Don't attempt to try to get them to spend time with you if they're busy or you're tired.

, Vent your feelings out, don't overreact though. Sometimes, a little talking can make some things better.

, If you had made many, many mistakes in the past that seem to go beyond ""sorry"", vow deeply to yourself that it will NEVER, EVER happen again. If people bother you about the things in the past and make drama and hurtful rumors about you, ignore them. Remember, saying bad things about the people who are saying bad things about you will only make it worse.

, Chill outside with a nice drink. Be happy. Be who you really are inside. Fresh air is very good for you.

, Brush your teeth twice a day, floss a couple times after you eat, and go to the dentist every six months. Take showers every 2 days. Brush your hair, get rid of any acne. Get 8-10 hours of sleep and exercise.

, It will feel good to help others. It might even get you new friends. The best people to help out are the people who are dealing with similar problems that you have had.

, You aren't a weak target anymore so they probably will go off looking for someone else to torment.

, Usually the reason why people do bad things to you is because you either offended them somehow or they just want to get a good reaction out of you to gossip about with others, leading to popular belief that you are a very weak target.

Blow it off with humor.,
Think of the insult as a ""gift."",
Ignore insults from people you don't care about.,
Stand up for yourself when you need to.",How to Get over Being Put Down1," One way to get over an insult in the moment is to laugh it off. That is, if someone tries to put you down, simply laugh at them. You may still feel hurt inside, but the act of laughing both turns the situation away from insulting you and makes you start to feel better about it. That is, it's harder to be upset when you're laughing.For example, if someone says, ""That's a really ugly dress,"" you could say, ""Yep, just the way I like all my dresses!"";
, No, you don't have to be grateful for it. However, one anecdote about the Buddha helps clarify this statement. The Buddha was often insulted by one man, but he was not offended. Rather, the Buddha looked at the insult as a gift that could be refused, asking ""Who does the gift belong to if it's refused?"" In other words, it's a way of thinking about the insult. You don't have to accept it and in fact, can ""return"" it to the person just be refusing to take offense., If the person insulting you isn't someone you like or respect, just ignore it. They don't know you well enough to really judge you, plus if they don't have your respect, you have no reason to give credit to the insult.For example, if a random stranger or someone who you have just met insults you, then try not to let it bother you.
Also, keep in mind that people who insult other people at random are probably not very happy themselves. They might be trying to make themselves feel a bit better by making someone else feel bad.

, Just because you don't take offense doesn't mean that you don't need to stand up for yourself sometimes. That is, sometimes confronting a person is the only way you can get someone to stop insulting you. At the very least, it can help you deal with any resentment you're feeling.For example, if someone insults you every day, try telling them to stop. You could use a direct approach, such as ""Your insults mean nothing to me, so you might as well stop. However, if you don't, I will report you."" You can report someone to your teacher, to a boss, or even to the person's boss if you're dealing with someone who's being rude at a business. Of course, you can't report everyone, but you can use it as a way to reproach some people.
You could also use humor to deliver a return insult. For instance, if someone says, ""That's a really ugly dress,"" you could say, ""Not as ugly as your attitude!"""

Find a quiet space, or remove yourself from the negative space.,
Practice a five minute reflection exercise.,
Accept that today might not be your day.,
Try to identify the source of your negative feelings.,
Share your feelings with someone you trust.,
Put your bad day into perspective.",How to Get Over a Bad Day1," It’s important to give yourself time to process the negative feelings you are experiencing. If you are having a bad day at work, shut the door of your office and turn off the lights to give yourself a quiet space. Or if you’re having a rough day at school, go to a quiet space in the library or outside to a park near campus. Seek out a space that is quiet and isolated so you can process your emotions and release any stress or tension.Try to find a spot with no phones, computers, or co-workers or friends who can interrupt you., Once you have found a quiet space where you will not be interrupted, you can do a quick exercise to try to release any negative feelings or thoughts.Close your eyes and sit still for 30 seconds.
Focus on your breathing. Take deep inhales and exhales through your nose. Try to slow down your breathing so it is deep and long on each inhale and exhale. Do this for about a minute.
Continue to breathing slowly and deeply for two more minutes. Ask yourself three questions: “How is my body feeling? Tense? Painful?” “How am I feeling? Angry? Upset?” “What am I thinking about? All the events that lead to the bad day? Things that could improve my day?”
Take another minute to sit and breathe. Open your eyes once the five minutes are over.

, Being in a bad mood while trying to force yourself to cheer up can just make you more upset. So rather than fight your bad day, acknowledge that you are having a hard time so you can then accept it and process it., Reflect on the negative feelings you are experiencing and think about what could have triggered your bad day. Was it stress at work? Anxiety over a test? Frustration towards someone you know? Try to label the source of your bad day in three words or less. For example: “frustration with Lisa” or “stress from clients”.Studies have shown that the simple act of putting our feelings into words can dramatically reduce the effect of those feelings.Sometimes, bad days do not stem from one clear source or reason. So if you are struggling to identify one clear source for your rough time, do not force yourself to come up with an answer. Simply acknowledge that you are upset and then focus on actively trying to process your emotions.

, It may be tempting to keep your dark mood to yourself, especially in a busy communal environment like the office or the classroom. But it’s important to avoid keeping your emotions to yourself, especially if you cannot simply excuse yourself from the room or remove yourself from the situation.


Turn to your co workers or the people you work closely with and tell them, “Listen guys, for whatever reason, I’m in a sour mood today. I’m not sure why, but it’s nothing you have done. If I react emotionally to you, I apologize in advance.”If you are surrounded by classmates or friends, you can simply explain to them you are not feeling positive today, so you may have a temper or be sensitive to their comments.
You could also contact your partner or a close friend to share your bad day and get it off your chest. Be careful about ranting at your partner or friend. Only share the details of your day, your emotions towards the bad events, and then try to move on with the conversation.

, Once you have accepted your bad day and tried to identify the source of your anxiety or stress, think of your bad day in a larger context. Consider how this day will matter tomorrow or next week. Ask yourself:Will this day matter 5 days or 5 years from now?
What can I learn from this situation?
What small action or step can I take to start turning this day around?
Showing gratitude for all that you do have and putting your bad day into perspective can help to reduce your negative thoughts and feelings. Looking at the bad day as a learning opportunity is also a way to put a positive spin on your day.
Thinking about the actions you can do to turn your day around also shows you are trying to actively work against your negative feelings and improve your mindset.

Identify areas of immaturity then act more mature.,
Put others before yourself.,
Respect your parents.,
Consider others' feelings.,
Get comfortable in your own skin.,
Follow social norms.,
Think before you speak.,
Take control of your emotions.,
Overcompensate with other kinds of maturity.",How to Get Rid of an Immature Reputation2," If shrugging off your immature reputation doesn’t do the trick, it is time to identify specific aspects of your character that others view as immature so that you can address them and change your reputation. In other words, note what you want to change, then change it.


Take note of how you think, feel, and act, relative to others your age and slightly older than you. Do you find yourself to be much more dependent on others than people your age? That may be a sign that you have identified an area of your life that is contributing to your immature reputation. You could work to improve this by becoming more self-sufficient; take a task you used to get help with and try doing it on your own!Do not take discrepancies between your behaviors and those of your peers at face value. All people have different life experiences, cultural backgrounds, and circumstances that may account for their behavior differences relative to their peers.
For example, due to an increased emphasis on interdependence, it is more common for children from parents of East Asian descent to live with their parents until older ages relative to Caucasian children.If you did not consider idiosyncratic information about yourself, such as your cultural background, you may unwittingly view your behavior as immature, when in fact it more reflects a cultural difference.

, Acting selflessly is a sign of maturity. Offer to do more chores around the house or to help out a friend in need. Being considerate of others means that you are not just thinking about yourself., You can respect your parents by being open and honest with them, and carefully listening to what they tell you to do. One sign of maturity is respecting and caring for one’s family., Remind yourself to mentally pause in communicating with others and ask, ""how might she feel about what I am about to say?""Remember to keep in mind how you would feel if you were being treated exactly how you are treating someone else.
At the same time, recognize that not everyone feels the same way about everything. Keep in mind relevant information you know about the person you are interacting with. For example, if you know that someone is self-conscious and does not like to be playfully teased, save your joking around for someone else who may appreciate it more.

, Being comfortable in your own skin can matter more for your perceived maturity level, and hence your reputation, than the specific behaviors you engage in.If you feel that you are overly self-conscious, try asking yourself how often you actually spend time thinking about others in a negative way. Chances are it is not that often, and chances are, too, that other people are not spending much time thinking negatively about you, either.

, There are many social norms and following them is a sign of maturity because it says that you understand the social dynamic and you are willing to play by the rules.For example, if someone helps you out, be appreciative and help them back. If you are not able to help them right away, be sure to write a note for yourself so you do not forget to help them when you are able to.
Do not intentionally burp or pass gas or do other things with your body that is against most groups' social norms.
Be sure to use good table manners. Be sure to offer your gratitude to whomever prepared the meal. Offer to wash the dishes as a way of letting them know that you appreciate their hard work. If it is a more formal setting, be sure to unfold your napkin and place it on your lap under your table. Do not speak with your mouth open.

, Do not blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. Craft your words carefully and be careful not to sound too emotional.For example, if you don’t want to do a chore, instead of saying “No! I don’t want to do that!” you might say “Would it be alright if I first finished what I’m doing before I take care of that? It should be within the hour.”

, A lack of emotional control, or showing the wrong degree intensity of emotion based on the context, is another sign of immaturity.To calm your emotions, try re-appraising the situation by posing questions: What is the worst that can really happen from this? Did she really mean to say that or was she maybe being careless, or has she had a long day and should I cut her some slack? Have I ever done that to someone else and should I be more forgiving as a result?

, If you are seen as immature in one domain that you do not want to or feel you are unable to change, become more mature in other ways.


For example, if you really struggle with taking others' perspectives during conversation and do not feel you can address this to improve your reputation, overcompensate by doing more chores around the house, or by becoming even more financially stable or independent, or by fostering your emotional maturity.

Have patience.,
Apologize and mean it.,
Find the source.,
Change social groups.",How to Get Rid of an Immature Reputation3," Because it involves a group's shared opinion of you, reputation change will take time. If you find yourself struggling with patience as you work to change your reputation, remind yourself that your reputation isn't either mature or immature like a light switch is on or off, but is instead on a continuum that varies in maturity, like a light dimmer switch that goes from very bright all the way down to off., If you did something regretful that is contributing to your immature reputation, say sorry and mean it; this will help you repair your reputation.When you apologize, do not over do it. Focus instead on actively showing, through your improved behavior, how you will fix the situation you regret or otherwise avoid it in the future. In other words, when making an apology, don't just tell, also show that you are sorry. , It is possible that someone is leaking information about you that you do not want others to know. Find out who this individual is and ask them not to do so. If they are saying things about you that are inaccurate or entirely untrue, ask them why they are doing that, let them know it is damaging to you, and if they do not stop, seek outside guidance, such as from a parent or teacher. Let others know they are spreading false information about you.To figure out the source, try asking others who they heard particular information about you from.

, One drastic but effective way to change your reputation, which can be paired with your changing the behaviors you have identified as problematic, is to hit the reset button and change social groups entirely.By starting afresh, your reputation now has a clean slate and you can be seen as mature through your new found behaviors, thoughts, and emotions, more easily.

Analyze the put down.,
Consider why the person said it.,
Skip being offended.",How to Get over Being Put Down2," Think about whether there is truth to the put down. Often, you'll find there is truth to it, which is why it stings so much. If you find that the statement is true, think about who it came from. If it's someone you usually trust, take a calm breath and begin to reevaluate the insult., If someone you normally consider calm or reasonable said the insult, think about why they may have said it. In fact, they may not have meant it as an insult at all, but rather constructive criticism. In other words, they are stating something that is true about you, not trying to make you angry.For example, maybe someone said, ""You know, sometimes the things you say are a little mean."" It can come across as an insult, as you might think they are saying you're a jerk. However, they may really be trying to get you thinking about the way you treat people, and so, the statement comes from a genuine place of caring.

, If you find that after you've calmed down, you think the person actually is a decent person you respect and the statement is true, consider how it can help you. Rather than getting offended, think about the truth of the statement, and use that information to guide your future decisions.Using the same example, think about ""You know, sometimes the things you say are a little mean."" Instead of getting angry, think about how that statement could help you. For instance, you could start thinking more about the things you say and how they affect other people. In turn, that could help you improve your relationships, as you're being kinder to people.

"
"
Allow the insult to resurface in a healthy way.,
Use deep breathing and redirection.,
Consider why the insult upset you so much.,
Realize that often times it's not about you at all.,
Give it time.,
Don't be afraid to talk about the things that embarrass you.,
Return the focus to yourself.",How to Get over Being Put Down3," You're probably going to keep thinking about the insult, particularly if you were hurt by the situation. The key is to go ahead and let yourself think about it. You shouldn't obsess, but when you feel the thoughts surfacing, just go ahead and feel the emotion. Then, let it go for the moment until it surfaces again. Try to take an objective approach to the feeling. You are feeling it, but you're not letting it drown you.Each time you go through the process, check if you're ready to let go of the shame. Just asking yourself the question can help you let go of a little bit of it each time.

, Once you've let yourself think though the event, try moving on. Start by closing your eyes and taking a few deep, calming breaths, focusing only on your breathing. Then, switch to thinking about something else. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it keeps your mind away from the insult.Using this technique can help keep you from obsessing over what happened or what was said.

, Now that you have some distance from it, think about why the insult made you so emotional. Oftentimes, the insults that hurt the most conflict with a belief you hold or the way you view the world. The insult shatters that thinking somewhat. It may also play on an insecurity, and you may need to shift your thinking just a bit so you're not as susceptible next time.For instance, maybe you tend to think of people as generally good. Therefore, when someone insults you out of the blue on the subway, you're upset not just because of the insult, but also because the person has shattered your worldview a little bit. Just accepting that some people aren't nice can help take some of the sting out of the insult the next time it happens.

, You're probably thinking, ""It's not about me? It was an insult directed AT me. How can it NOT be about me?"" The truth is that when most people who spout off mean things, it's usually about some problem or stress they're trying to work through. Instead of dealing with it in an healthy way, they let it explode all over you with an insult.Someone who's always insulting may not have learned how to deal with other people in a positive manner. It's still not about you, but rather about the emotional problems the person has.

, While you may want to be over the insult quickly, realize it may take a little time, particularly if you are a sensitive person. It's fine to take the time you need to get over what happened and stop obsessing over what another person said. You have a right to take the time you need to stop feeling hurt., An insult only holds power over you if you let it embarrass you. If you have few things that embarrass you, people will find they have fewer things they can insult you with. The only way to be less embarrassed is to open up to friends and family about the things you find embarrassing. Secrecy will only increase your shame, and you'll likely find many of the people around you have the same ""secrets.""It can also help to talk about the insult that's upsetting you, as a family member or friend may be able to point out things that you hadn't noticed about the situation, making you feel better.

, While put downs can be hurtful, it is important to return the focus to yourself at some point and consider what you think. Do you agree with the comment? If not, then what is your opinion?


For example, if someone said your outfit looks trashy, reflect on why you chose it. Did you like the colors, the shape of the clothes, or something else about it? If so, then that is what really matters. Not the other person’s opinion.

Choose carbs that are high in fiber and have a low glycemic content, such as popcorn.,
Go for food high in magnesium, potassium, and vitamin B6, like bananas and apples.",How to Get Over a Bad Day2," One of the best ways to get over a bad day is exercise. In fact, studies show that regular exercise can increase your energy level and help you deal with stress.Focusing on an activity that will take your mind off of your bad day will also help you get over any negative feelings you may be having. Work out your body and give your mind a rest.Do at least 30 minutes of cardio, or short 10 minute bursts of exercise.
If you can’t make it to the gym, do simple activities like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or going for a walk on your lunch break.

, Exercises that are continuous and rhythmic, like walking, swimming, dancing, and yoga, are good for relaxing your brain and body. These exercises also involve flow like movement, so you are forced to focus on another activity rather than your bad day. Restorative yoga helps your body relax and restore itself. But you don’t have to go to a yoga class to practice yoga. Instead, you can do yoga in your chair at your desk.Lotus position is the traditional seat for meditation and it can be modified so you can practice this pose at your desk. Sit comfortably in your chair, with your neck and spine straight and erect.
Cross your legs so you are sitting cross legged in the chair. Place your hands on your thighs, palms up, with your thumbs and first fingers touching. Breath deeply through your nose for 10-15 breaths.
Not only will this calm your mind, this pose will also release any stress in your spine from sitting at your desk all day.
You can also try a simple relaxing pose to calm your mind. Cross your arms and place them on your desk or a flat surface. Rest your head on your crossed arms and take deep breaths. Close your eyes and hold this position for 10-15 breaths.

, According to a recent study, when we are having a bad day or are in a bad mood, our desire to eat means we are just as happy with healthy food as we are with comfort food.Though you may head straight for a chocolate bar or a big iced coffee on a bad day, remember that you can also go for healthier options and improve your mood.


If you are going to go for chocolate as your comfort food, opt for dark chocolate. Dark chocolate has high levels of phenylalanine. This enzyme has been shown to be good for treating depression and anxiety as it enhances the production of serotonin and dopamine in your brain., These nutrients have been shown to enhance the serotonin levels in your brain, a “feel good” neurotransmitter., We digest food like popcorn slowly, so it provides a fuel source that is nutrient-rich and won’t cause the sugar crash associated with other carbs like cookies and cakes., Vitamin B6 works to up the serotonin levels in your brain which will lead to energy and hopefully lessen your bad mood or day."

Get a good night's sleep.",How to Get Over a Bad Day3," Breathing exercises can help to reduce your stress level and calm down after a bad day. Sit in a quiet space, with your back straight, and try two breathing exercises:The stimulated breathing exercise: This exercise is good if you are feeling lethargic or exhausted by your day and want to wake up your body.
Inhale and exhale quickly through your nose, keeping your mouth closed but relaxed. Your breaths in and out should be equal in duration, but as short as possible. Don’t be afraid to make noise as you do this exercise.
Try for three in-and-out breath cycles per a second. Your diaphragm, which is just below your ribs, should be moving in and out quickly as you breath. Do this exercise for only 15 seconds on your first try. You may feel lightheaded for a minute after you finish the exercise.
Continue breathing normally once you finish your first 15 seconds. You can continue practicing, increasing your time by five seconds, until you reach a full minute.
The 4-7-8 exercise: This breathing exercise is good for calming down and de-stressing.
Place the tip of your tongue against your upper front teeth. Exhale through your mouth, making a whoosh sound. Close your mouth and inhale through your nose to the count of four.
Hold your breath for a count of seven. Then, exhale through your mouth, making a whoosh sound, to the count of eight.
Inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths. Make sure you always inhale quietly through your nose and exhale with a whoosh sound through your mouth.

, Several experts link creative expression to overall well being. Being creative allows you to reflect on your experiences, including your bad day, and express these feelings in a unique or interesting way. Your creative activity could be painting or drawing, it could be playing music or dancing, or it could even be something as simple as making a creative meal for dinner.The creative activity does not have to even be something you are necessarily good at. The idea is you will channel your negative feelings into an activity that will allow you to feel good and express your emotions.

, This could be listening to your favorite album in your car with the windows down, or a Youtube video of a cute animal you just can’t stop watching. Sometimes laughter can act as a way to put a bad day into perspective and break your bad mood., Another way to distract yourself from your negative thoughts is to turn to friends and family for support. Do a fun activity together, like a games night or bowling, go for a drink to blow off some steam, or simply have a friend over for a cup of tea. Spending time with loved ones is a great way to shift your mood and prevent you from focusing on negative thoughts or your bad day., One of the best ways to recover from a bad day and start the next day with a fresh perspective is 8 hours of quality sleep. Go to bed at your usual time, shut off all electronics in bed, and focus on shutting down your mind so you can rest. You should be well rested and refreshed for the next day, which will hopefully be a better, happier day.

Avoid giving in to humiliation.",How to Forget About an Humiliating Experience," Humiliation is painful and it can feel like your personal value is being diminished. However, it's important to accept responsibility if you’ve done something wrong. A common response to humiliation is to deny responsibility and push the problem on to others.Don’t let this defensive move prevent you from facing yourself and pushing through to the other side.


Apologize for your actions if you've made a mistake, like an error at work that causes a lot of problems.;
, A lot of humiliation comes from something called ‘’performance expectation.’’ This refers to expectations placed on your ability to perform a certain task well. The higher the performance expectation, the more harshly you can be judged for failing to accomplish the task.Having a healthy sense of performance expectation is important. Failure is part of the learning process, so don’t put too much pressure on yourself, and don’t allow other people to pressure you either.

, It’s important to be resilient and forgive yourself when you mess up. Feeling bad about our actions can help us discover insight into problems with our behavior, but you can keep the insight and drop the humiliation. Ask yourself if you would repeat your actions a second time around. If you wouldn’t, then that points to the fact that you are genuinely remorseful.Tell yourself that making mistakes is human and you're trying your best to do the right thing.

, Some people have called our time the “age of humiliation.”Being humiliated is a common occurrence for a lot of people, especially with the popularity of the internet, where the intimate details of our lives can show up on public places like social media websites. Humiliation is a widespread phenomenon, although this shouldn’t minimize your feelings or the uniqueness of your situation.

, If the humiliating experience is lingering in your mind and causing you a lot of pain, use principles and techniques from mindfulness meditation to help you let go of the emotional wound and move on with your life.Frequently, a painful emotion or memory keeps us feeling hurt because we are avoiding its expression. Practice facing your emotions without running or shrinking away. Think of the emotion like a wave that comes and goes. Try to observe the wave without interfering with the way it moves. This will help you create distance between yourself and the emotion without denying it.

, Sometimes protecting yourself from humiliation is as simple as figuring out which situations and people are likely to humiliate you. Identify these triggers for humiliation and extinguish them from your life. This could be an overly negative friend who always puts you down, a demoralizing workplace that is never happy with your contributions, or a family that tries to shame you at every turn.

, Humility is about learning to accept and realistically assess your strengths and limitations. Being realistic about your character is a great way to protect yourself from humiliation, which tries to degrade you. A person with humility won’t fall victim to the illusion of worthlessness that humiliating experiences try to push on us.Make a list of your strengths and challenges. Have a close friend or loved one look over the list and discuss it with you. Ask for the person’s honest opinion and try to be receptive to his feedback.

, Research shows that self-esteem can be a powerful defense against the humiliation associated with failure.Follow these steps to increase your self-esteem:


Avoid comparing yourself to other people. Your only competition should be with yourself. The reason you should avoid doing this is because you don’t see what goes on behind the scenes in the lives of other people. You may be comparing yourself to the way they are presenting themselves rather than their true identity.Adjust your self-talk. Replace negative thoughts like “I can’t do it” with hopeful statements such as “this is hard, but I can get through it.” Avoid putting unreasonable demands on yourself with thoughts about what you “should” or “must” do.

, Certain mental health conditions can make you more vulnerable to humiliation. Social phobia, narcissistic personality disorder, and major depression can leave you open to the experience of humiliation more than people who don’t struggle from these hardships.If you’ve been diagnosed with any of these disorders, seek help in order to vaccinate yourself against humiliation before it happens.


Social phobia is a strong fear of being judged by others, with symptoms like anxiety around people, feeling self-conscious, and having a hard time meeting people.Narcissistic personality disorder is marked by having a tendency to hold an unrealistic view of self-importance (such as thinking you're the best cook in the entire world even though you have never attended cooking school and have no practice in cooking), being preoccupied with yourself, and lacking empathy for others.Major depression shows up as sustained feelings of sadness, frustration, and other negative emotions for weeks at a time, interfering with daily life., If you have a hard time forgetting about the humiliating experience, use techniques like attention shifting, relaxation, and repeated exposure to help you move past the memory., Attention shifting is where you use a particular phrase or action to help you deal with the memory, such as thinking ""this is just one experience in my entire life"" whenever it comes up. Attention shifting has been shown to help reduce anxiety in situations, because it allows you to freely choose what you pay attention to, rather than being compelled to focus on negative thoughts and feelings.Whenever the humiliating memory pops up, say to yourself, ""everyone feels humiliated at some point in their life. I know I can recover from this experience.""

, Progressive muscle relaxation is where you tense and then relax your muscles one area at a time. Start with your toes, curling them downward. Do this for a couple seconds and release. Next, tense your foot and lower leg. Keep doing this, moving up your body all the way to your forehead.


You can try other methods as well, such as guided imagery. Picture one of your favorite places to be when the humiliating experience starts to bother you. This could be your living room with candles lit, a football field, or a sunny beach.Keeping yourself relaxed will reduce the likelihood that you dwell on the humiliating experience. It will also help you process and cope with the humiliating experience when it does come up in your memory. Usually, this memory will show up with a lot of anxiety. Relaxation techniques will help you reduce this anxiety and extinguish the memory., Repeated exposure is a technique for exposing yourself to situations so that you gradually begin to realize they aren't that dangerous. You can do this with the humiliating experience, for example, if it happened on a stage at your school, or in a specific room of your house. Spend time in these places and let the panic or discomfort subside.


This kind of exposure therapy requires that you spend enough time in the stressful environment for your mind to adapt to the fact that there's no danger present. If you walk into the room where you were humiliated, start to feel upset, and quickly leave, then the exposure likely won't have an effect. Try to enter the room or face the situation and let yourself slowly relax into your body. Deep, even breathing can help you calm down and accept where you are., The first step to moving past an humiliating experience is to grasp what the emotion is and why it shows up. Humiliation is the experience of losing a piece of your status as a valuable human being. This diminishment has negative consequences for your life because your status as a worthwhile person affects what you think is possible.If you feel intense humiliation, it may change what you think you can do with your life, such as your ability to pursue an education or potential to have the career you want. Some common humiliating experiences are:


Being publicly shamed, like being laughed at or mocked.
Being denied basic needs, like food and clothing.

, Research shows that being humiliated can have powerful negative effects on a person’s self-esteem and quality of life. It can result in major depression, symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder like high anxiety, and suicidal desires.If you feel yourself slipping into serious mental health problems because of a humiliating experience, contact your doctor or local psychologist about getting help.


Cognitive behavioral therapy can help restructure your thoughts and lead you to a healthier, more realistic understanding of the situation. It can help you recover your self-worth and belief in your abilities after a bad case of humiliation.Find a local therapist by clicking here.


, Sometimes a person may try to humiliate you despite your innocence in a situation. For example, he might be jealous of your accomplishments and want to make you feel poorly about yourself. It may have nothing to do with you. Before you accept responsibility for your actions, which is different than accepting being humiliated, make sure you actually did something wrong., Many of us may feel humiliated at relatively small things. These failures can feel like a disaster and we may think that people are judging us harshly, but in the bigger picture they probably don’t deserve the significance we place on them. Avoid sweating the small stuff.For example, botching an interview or a live musical performance can be embarrassing, but they shouldn't usually carry the weight of humiliation.

, If someone is humiliating you, even if you did something wrong, you should realize that humiliation is not an effective technique for changing someone’s behavior. Humiliation is a form of punishment, rather than discipline.There’s no excuse for humiliating someone, even a criminal, so avoid giving in to the person’s tactics by accepting the humiliation."

Look into special treatments.",How to Forget a Bad Memory," Do you notice yourself getting blindsided by your bad memory when you go certain places or are around certain things? Maybe you haven't realized that they're what's triggering your memories. For example, maybe your bad memory is related to an incident that happened at your elementary school, and you recall what happened every time you pass it. If you start taking a new route to work in the morning and avoid the street where your school is, you can keep your mind bad-memory-free a bit more often.


If you're able to completely avoid the things that trigger your bad memory, it might eventually fade out of your mind. You'll have fewer reasons call it up, and as you keep living life you'll replace the bad memory with more important thoughts.
Of course, not all triggers are entirely avoidable, and maybe you don't want to have to change your route to work, or donate your collection of science fiction books, or stop listening to your favorite band just because the last time you saw them live was the night your ex told you he was ending the relationship. If avoiding triggers isn't feasible, either because there are too many of them or you resent giving the memory that power, there are other ways you can deal with the memory.;
, The first few times you remember something bad, it might catch you off guard and leave you feeling anxious and deflated. Your impulse might be to avoid thinking about it as much as possible, but trying to suppress the memory can give it more power when it does pop back up in your mind. Instead of pushing it out of your mind, let yourself remember what happened. Keep thinking about it until it loses its sting. Eventually, you'll just stop thinking about it so much, and when you do, it won't be painful anymore. If the memories become heavier on your mind then get on a long walk or do any exercise briskly.


Try to take comfort in the fact that the event causing the memory is over now. Whatever happened - people laughing at your embarrassment, or a dangerous situation you endured - is in the past.
In some cases, thinking about a bad memory can become a little obsessive. Observe your emotions as you repeatedly recall the memory. If you realize that even after deliberately thinking about the memory it still has the power to hurt you, then try a different method for getting rid of the bad memory.

, Every time you remember something, the memory changes a little bit. Your brain makes up for tiny gaps in your memory by replacing them with false information. You can take advantage of the way your brain works by replacing the bad parts of a memory with different information. Eventually, you'll start recalling the changed version.For example, let's say you have a childhood memory about riding in a boat called ""The Dreamcatcher"" on a lake with your dad. You remember your dad at the stern wearing red shorts and sunglasses, shouting as he watches you lean too far over the rail and fall into the water. You know this is what happened, but years later when you look at a photograph from the day you see your dad was wearing jeans, and the boat was called ""The Kingfisher."" As you see, memories are never completely accurate, and they can be changed.
Try altering the part of the memory that makes you feel bad. Using the above example, if you remember feeling scared and alone when you fell into the lake, try re-imagining the memory so that you focus on how great it felt to get rescued by your dad.
Every time you think about the memory, it will be a little different. If you focus on the good feelings instead of the bad each time, the memory will begin to change in tone. Maybe it won't go from being a bad memory to a great one, but it might lose the power to hurt you.

, Sometimes our brains get into ruts that are difficult to climb out of. If you find yourself dwelling on bad memories a lot, train your mind to switch to happy memories instead. Don't give a bad memory enough time to change your mood or make you feel anxious; instead, the moment it comes into your mind, shift your thinking to a happier memory. Keep practicing positive thinking until you no longer automatically fall into the same old mental ruts.


Try pairing your bad memory with a good one. For example, if you can't stop thinking about a time you fumbled a presentation and the whole class laughed, pair that memory with the memory of a time you performed well and received praise. Each time you think about the bad memory, shift your thoughts to the good one. Having a good memory fresh on your mind will keep you from having to rack your brain for something positive to think about when you're feeling bad.

, The practice of paying more attention the present moment is called being mindful. It means focusing on the here and now instead of dwelling on the past or nervously anticipating the future. Being mindful is an excellent way to relieve stress and get more out of life. Instead of spending time and energy worrying about things you can't change, you get to let go of baggage and just be.


Oftentimes we let our minds drift off during our daily activities, and we completely tune out of what we are doing. Instead of going on ""autopilot,"" take the time to notice small details, like sounds or smells, that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. This will help bring your mind back to the present moment rather than drifting off and fixating on memories.
Adopt a mantra you can repeat when your thoughts drift to places you don't want them to go. For example, you could say ""I am here"" or ""I am alive."" Say something that grounds you in the present.
Pay attention to how your body feels right here, right now. Pay attention to your senses: what do you hear, see, taste and smell right now?
Try meditation. Most forms of meditation are all about mindfulness. Focusing on breathing and freeing your mind from distractions helps you live more fully in the present. Regular meditation practice not only helps you focus, it has also been shown to improve overall mood. , Even the most horrible experiences can teach us something. It might take you a long time to realize what you have learned, especially if the incident is fresh. But if you can look back and see that you gained wisdom from the situation, your bad memory might lose some of its sting. Can you find a silver lining you haven't noticed before?


Remember that negative experiences are an inevitable part of life. Difficult experiences make us stronger, and help us appreciate the pleasurable moments in life. Without feeling bad once in a while, we wouldn't be able to appreciate feeling good.
Try to count your blessings. Whatever you may have lost as a result of this memory, make a list of the things that you are thankful for now.

, As time passes, the bad memory will naturally start to fade a little. You can speed up the process by living life fully and creating new good memories to fill your mind. Spend time doing things you enjoy with people who make you happy. The more positive memories you make, the less significant the negative ones will seem in the long run.


It can help to go to places you've never been before, so you can have brand new experiences that aren't tainted by the past in any way. Book a flight to a new city, or be a tourist in your own city and go to a neighborhood you don't usually frequent.
If traveling isn't your thing, change up your routine in some other way. Go to a new restaurant you've never tried, cook a challenging meal, or invite all your friends over for a dinner party.

, Keep your schedule full and your mind stimulated, so you have less time to dwell on negative thoughts. If you tend to spend a lot of time by yourself, make it a point to go out more with friends, or visit your family more often. Distract yourself with a good book, or pick up a new hobby. The more time you spend sitting around with nothing to do, the more likely are to dwell on old memories. Here are a few great distractions that will help you stay busy:


Take up a new physical activity, like soccer or kickboxing. If you're not into sports, challenge yourself to walk a certain number of miles each day, or start doing yoga. Challenging yourself physically is a great way to free your mind from negative thoughts. Exercising causes your brain to release endorphins that improve your mood.Create something new. You could sew a dress, make a painting, or write a song. Pour your energy into making something, and you won't have time to think about bad memories.
Find an opportunity to volunteer your time. Helping other people is a great way to get your mind off of your own troubles.

, Using mind-altering substances can make things worse, especially if the bad memory has left you feeling depressed or anxious. Alcohol can increase depression, irritability, and anxiety, especially in people who have already been experiencing these symptoms. To keep your mentality positive, it's best to limit or completely abstain from using alcohol and drugs.


Using alcohol and drugs as a way to try to forget bad memories, or as a way to avoid any type of negative emotion, often leads to addiction.If you find yourself turning to alcohol or drugs when you don't want to have to remember something that bothers you, seek help now.
Other forms of escapism should also be avoided. If you tend to gamble, overeat, or take refuge in a habit that could be detrimental to your health as a way to suppress bad feelings, it's important to acknowledge your behavior and curb it, either on your own or with the help of a therapist or support group.

, When you're consumed with negative thoughts, it can be tough to remember to take good care of yourself. But keeping your body in good health has a big effect on the way you think.Eating nutritious food, getting plenty of sleep, and working out a few times a week will go a long way toward keeping bad memories at bay. In addition to making sure your basic needs are met, take time to pamper yourself a bit to help ease the anxiety stemming from your bad memory.



Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and healthy fats.
Aim to get 30 minutes to an hour of exercise every day, even if you just take a long walk after work.
Try to get seven to eight hours of sleep every night, since being fatigued can make your emotions run higher than usual and leave you susceptible to dwelling on bad memories., Acknowledge the memory and the negative emotions associated with it. While this may seem counterproductive, catharsis is a key element of the healing process. Suppressing a bad memory will only cause it to come up again later in life. Let yourself feel angry, sad, embarrassed, or hurt. If you need to cry or scream, do it. You'll come out on the other side feeling more able to cope than if you tried to ignore your pain.

, Turn to a friend or family member whom you trust. Other people can offer advice, share similar stories, and even reassure you that perhaps the incident wasn't as horrible as you have made it out to be in your head. If possible, talk to someone who is unrelated to the incident; this will give you the fresh perspective that you need.


Consider joining a support group. Do some research to find a support group in your area that deals with the particular issue at hand. There are many support groups out there for recent divorces, breakups, chronic illnesses, and so on.
If you are not comfortable sharing the experience with anybody else, write about it in a personal journal and keep it in a safe place where nobody else will find it.

, If you feel you need more than a friend or family member can offer, talking to a professional might be the right choice for you. Since the doctor-patient relationship is confidential, you don't have to worry about censoring yourself or feeling embarrassed. A therapist will be able to help you identify your triggers and learn to overcome them. He or she will teach you techniques you can use to break the hold bad memories have on your mind.
Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be helpful for people dealing with trauma. Consider seeking out a therapist that specializes in this approach., This disorder can develop after a terrifying and harmful experience, such as being sexually abused, getting in a bad car accident, being violently assaulted, or having a debilitating illness. For people with PTSD, memories of trauma don't fade away. It produces a feeling of constant anxiety that the bad situation will happen again. If you think you might have PTSD, it's important to seek help, since it's not something you can deal with by yourself.Symptoms of PTSD include having flashbacks, nightmares, and thoughts that frighten you.
You may feel emotionally numb, depressed, or constantly worried, with a feeling of being on edge all the time.

, If you feel trapped by your memories of a traumatic experience, there are treatments available that may help. These treatments are usually used in conjunction with psychotherapy for the best possible results. Make an appointment with a psychiatrist to discuss whether a special treatment might help you finally feel free of the bad memories that are affecting your quality of life.


Medication might be the first treatment to try. Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication is often prescribed to people who have difficulty escaping negative thoughts.
Somatic experiencing is a treatment aimed toward getting you back in touch with what your body is feeling. It focuses on correcting the fight-or-flight response so that it no longer becomes activated when danger isn't present.
Electroshock therapy is an effective way to relieve the mind of traumatic memories when no other treatment works."

Identify the source.,
Talk to the person using “I” statements.,
Explain what you need.,
Find closure for current relationships.,
Recognize shared humanity in the people who hurt you in the past.",How to Fix Your Trust Issues1," In order to overcome your trust issues, you need to figure out why they are occurring. Trust is developed when a person shows that they can be counted on. Humans first start to develop trust in infancy and the toddler years. If you experienced neglect or abandonment in early childhood, these experiences can contribute to you having trust issues later in life.


In addition, relationships can also influence your ability to trust. If you have been cheated on, lied to, or deceived by someone you care about, this could be the source behind your mistrust.;
, Once you identify the person(s) who were instrumental in your developing trust issues, you should attempt to talk to them about it. Be candid with your partner about how you feel. This allows you and your partner to collaborate on a workable solution to your trust issues.Tailor your words with “I” statements to minimize blaming the other person.


You might say, “I was cheated on in a previous relationship and it’s making it really hard for me to trust you.”

, Opening the door to discuss your trust issues is only half of the equation. You will need to sit down with your partner and come up with an action plan. You can start this off by being clear about your needs.For instance, if you know secrets contribute to why you are mistrustful, make a pact with your partner to not keep secrets from each other. Say something like “I get really insecure when you keep secrets from me. Can we agree to not leave one another in the dark about things that are happening in our lives?”

, If your current partner or loved one hurt you, you will need to find closure from that incident in order to move forward in the relationship. There are various ways to gain closure to rebuild existing relationships.


One way to move on is by writing a letter about the betrayal. Use the letter to explain what happened, how it hurt you, and how it is affecting you today. If the person is still in your life, you can read the letter to them and request an apology. If not, you can simply burn the letter or tear it to pieces to symbolize the situation no longer having any power over your life., If past relationships are influencing your ability to trust today, you need to learn to let go of those hurts. Another way to gain closure is by recognizing that all people make mistakes. This can be hard, but try to rationalize that all people hurt their loved ones at some point. The person who hurt you in the past was only human. You can learn to accept this truth so you can move on from the situation.This can be helpful for getting closure from people who are no longer in your life such as exes or deceased family members.

Listen to music.,
Do yoga.,
Meditate.",How to Get Over a Bad Situation1," Blowing your top isn't going to get you anywhere. Think about what happened and take a big breath. If you want to, you can say something to get your anger out. Keep in mind that what you say will affect what others will think how you're reacting to the situation. Take a brief look at the three most common.


""Whatever."" This really shows that you don't care what going to happen next. It also implies the hint that you're not interested in what's happening.
""Okay! Fine!“ This tells the others that you sick of it and gives the impression you are giving in. Most people will also see that as a bad temper, so think carefully about saying that.
""I really don't care, okay?"" This is a hybrid of the former two, giving the impression of not caring what happens and that you don't want to waste precious time over this.;
, If you don't want to make a commotion, don't! Leave them staring at you. It will save you a whole lot of drama and anger. For peaceful people, this is probably the best solution.

, It will make you feel a lot better. If there is no one to talk to, talk to a stuffed animal or yourself.

, Exercising, eating, reading, watching TV... whatever will cheer you up.

, It relieves stress and can get your groove on. You can listen to any type, and any artist as long as you like it.


However, stay away from music that reminds you of a bad situation, such as breakup or death songs.

, Meditating afterwards will be extremely helpful as well.

, Meditating is known for leaving you refreshed and ready to do anything. All you need is five minutes for yourself and yourself only.

Improve communication.,
Set and respect personal boundaries.,
Challenge negative thought patterns.,
Take a risk.",How to Fix Your Trust Issues2," The most effective way to overcome trust issues is to communicate. Most often, mistrust develops because one partner seems like a mystery to the other. When you and your partner are open and honest with one another, the fears and anxieties are alleviated and trust can be restored.


Have the courage to say what you mean. If a situation with your partner makes you uncomfortable, use your voice. You might say, “It makes me worried that this guy is texting you so late at night.” An innocent situation can get blown out of proportion in your mind simply because you don’t speak up.
Offer feedback. Another aspect of communication is reflecting on your progress. Let your partner know how you think things are going to reinforce good habits. For example, you might say, “I really appreciate how you called to let me know you would be out late. It really gave me a peace of mind.”, Just as you want to be able to trust your partner, they also need to be able to live fully without unreasonable constraints on their behavior. Boundary-setting allows both you and your partner to express your wants, needs, and limitations for the relationship. A healthy relationship also requires that these limitations be acknowledged and respected by both partners.For instance, you might express a need to be monogamous with your partner and share what that means. You might say, “Cheating is becoming emotionally attached to another, having physical intimacy (i.e. touching, kissing, or having sex), or feeling the need to hide a relationship from me.”
On the other hand, your partner might express the boundary of being able to have multiple social media profiles with the allowance that you are granted access to them if you desire.

, A critical inner voice can do just as much damage as lies and deceit. If you are trying to fix your trust issues, you will need to identify and reframe negative thoughts that contribute to your insecurities.Reality testing is a great way to challenge these thought patterns. Consider, for example, that your partner gets a phone call and steps out of the room to take it. You think, “He needs to take the phone call in private. It must be another girl. I knew he was cheating on me.” This can quickly lead down a catastrophic path.
Instead, use reality testing to see what evidence there is that your partner is cheating. Have you seen other clues? Is this a constant behavior? Think about other reasons your partner may need to leave the room. Is he hard of hearing? Has he been waiting on an important call from work? Is the background noisy in the environment? Try to fully examine all aspects of a situation to look at it realistically rather than jumping to a negative conclusion.

, You may not want to hear it, but falling in love and staying in love involves some degree of risk. And, risk is largely associated with emotional vulnerability. While you don’t want to think of your relationship as a dice-roll, you should consider that a small measure of faith—in your partner and your bond—is necessary for the relationship to last.


You won’t be able to spend every minute of every day with your partner. You won’t be able to track every phone call or text message. Nor should you want to. You will feel the greatest security and satisfaction in your relationship from the belief that time apart from each other adds value to the relationship rather than subtracting from it."
"
Confide in a friend.,
See a therapist for trust issues.,
Share your story in a support group.,
Unload your worries in a journal.",How to Fix Your Trust Issues3," Sometimes, sharing your deepest fears with a close friend can provide the relief and reality check needed to recognize whether your worries are logical or far-fetched. As you work on your trust issues, select one friend whom you can count on to be candid with you and keep your confidences.


You might say, “Carla got home really late last night from work. I was worried. What do you think I should do?” Hopefully, your friend can help alleviate your concerns, or steer you to take action if your worries are warranted.

, In some cases, no amount of security in the relationship can help overcome deep-seated insecurities that you have about yourself. If communicating with your partner and setting boundaries doesn’t help, you may need to see a professional.A mental health therapist can help you get to the bottom of your mistrust, give you strategies to exercise greater vulnerability in your relationships, and work with you to challenge critical thought patterns.

, Another way to heal from past hurts and learn practical tips on rebuilding trust is by sharing your story and hearing the stories of others. Relationship support groups can be a wonderful outlet to express some of your concerns and have others who have dealt with trust issues help you through them.Talk to your therapist about referring you to a local support group relating to trust in relationships.
It may also be helpful for your partner to join you at the support groups. Attending may help them to gain greater insight into your fears and develop coping skills to handle your insecurities.

, Similar to having a friend to share your worries, writing down your fears into a journal can serve as a handy tool in overcoming trust issues. Putting pen to paper allows you to go through the process of unloading irrational fears and also offers an outlet for you to challenge these worries with reality-testing.


Journaling can help you reduce tension and stress associated with your trust issues, identify common patterns affecting your relationships, and serve as a problem-solving tool as you work with a therapist."

As a general guideline, the United States Department of Agriculture recommends:Between two and three cups of vegetables
Between one and a half and two cups of fruit
Between five and eight ounces of grains
Between five and six and a half ounces of protein (lean meats and fish, eggs, soy, legumes)
Three cups of dairy
Between five and seven teaspoons of heart-healthy oil such as olive oil or canola oil each day for adults;
, Lose weight if you are overweight. Keeping your weight in a healthy range for your height and body type will decrease your risk of chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis in your weight-bearing joints, all of which can be very expensive to treat without health insurance.To determine whether your weight is healthy for your height, use an online body mass index (BMI) calculator. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.Limit sugar and highly processed food like junk food and fast food. This will help maintain your weight.

, Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of exercise, four to six times per week. Joining a gym or exercising with friends might be a good way to keep you motivated. Keep in mind that any exercise is better than none at all.

A supportive network of family and/or friends can help you cope with stress, solve problems, provide important perspective, and offer love and acceptance.
Talk to your loved ones about any problems you might be having. Even if a problem can’t readily be “fixed,” sharing with another will help you feel supported.Learn coping strategies to deal with stress. Exercise, take a brief nature walk, write in a journal, or teach yourself breathing exercises to interrupt the mental cycles that produce stress.
Do things you love and laugh a lot. Research has found that laughter lowers your stress level, reduces pain, and boosts your immune system., Regular screenings increase your chance of being diagnosed with cancer early, which means the disease will have less of a chance to spread and there will probably be more treatment options available than there would be if the disease were discovered later. Many screenings are offered for free or for low costs at clinics around the country, so do some research to find out what's available near you.The CDC recommends screenings for breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, prostate, skin, and ovarian cancers. The screenings you need will depend on your age, gender, family history, and other risk factors. Talk to a doctor or read the CDC's recommendations to determine which screenings you should get.

, Check local public health departments, community health centers, and free clinics to see if they offer free or low-cost vaccinations to people without insurance.Even adults require a tetanus-diphtheria booster every 10 years.The federal government's Vaccines for Children program is a great option for uninsured individuals under the age of 19 who need vaccines.If you can't find a clinic that offers the vaccine you need at an affordable cost, check with the manufacturer of the vaccine to see if they offer any assistance to uninsured individuals.

, In the United States, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) maintains a database of health centers where you can obtain subsidized medical treatment. These centers provide check-ups and preventive care, treatment for illness, prenatal care, immunizations, dental care, and mental health services.There are nearly 150 medical centers around the United States that are required by the federal government to provide free or reduced-cost services to those who meet certain income restrictions and are unable to pay for treatment. These facilities are known as Hill-Burton facilities.Attending to your mental health is just as important as attending to your physical health. If you are unable to find a federally supported health center that will offer you the mental health services you need at a price you can afford, try using referral services such as Mental Health America or Network of Care. You may also be able to find affordable therapy with a supervised graduate student studying psychology or psychiatry at a local university., Many prescription drug manufacturers offer programs that help people who need their medications but cannot afford them. If you're not able to afford your medications, make sure to ask the company if they can help.There are also a wide variety of prescription savings cards available that can save you a lot of money. Some of these cards require a membership fee, but others are completely free., Getting regular dental care can help prevent more serious and costly problems. Oral health also has an effect on your overall health, so taking good care of your teeth and gums is essential.Do a search and call around to see if there are any dentists in your area that offer services on a sliding scale.

, There are a wide variety of services offered by nonprofit organizations around the country. These organizations may be able to offer you access to the care you need at no cost to you, or they may be able to refer you to clinics that can offer you affordable care. Do a search to see what kind of organizations exist in your area.


Nonprofits such as NeedyMeds compile data on low-cost health care providers and options for obtaining prescription medication. Use the search tools provided by NeedyMeds or other nonprofits to find free, low-cost, or sliding-scale medical care providers in your region., The U.S. government and many state agencies provide assistance programs for low-income individuals in need of medical care. If you meet certain income guidelines, you may qualify for Medicaid or subsidies for a health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act.

, If you are uninsured, it's a good idea to make a plan about what you will do in the case of a medical emergency. This will allow you to get the treatment you want as quickly as possible without having to worry about whether you could have found a more affordable option somewhere else.


Research the various hospitals and medical facilities in your area, and find out which ones offer the best services to people without insurance.
Putting some money aside for medical care can be very helpful if you are able to do so.

, If you need medical care, don't put it off or try to deal with it by yourself, as this could make the situation much worse and much more costly in the long run.


An emergency room cannot turn you down because you are uninsured and unable to pay for services. In case of a true emergency, go to the hospital immediately, and then ask the hospital staff or a nonprofit agency for help paying for the emergency room


, If you have a minor injury or a medical condition that does not require immediate treatment, choosing a regular doctor's office or urgent care facility instead of a hospital can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.When in doubt, always go to the emergency room. Your health is too important to gamble with.

Wash your hands often.,
Avoid sharing needles.,
Practice safe sex.,
Wear protective gear.,
Avoid sharing toiletries.,
Watch out for contaminated substances.",How to Lower Your Risk of Developing Viral Hepatitis1," Hand washing is one of the simplest and most effective ways to avoid getting hepatitis. The steps to effective hand washing are:


Wet your hand with clean water.
Apply soap to your hands and work up a generous lather.
Scrub your palms, the back of your palms, each finger, in between all your fingers, your fingertips, and your fingernails for at least 40 seconds.
Rinse your hands thoroughly in clean water.
Dry your hands with a clean towel.
Rubbing alcohol, hand rubs, and hand sanitizers can also be used. Be sure to scrub for 20-30 seconds.;
, Because different strains of hepatitis are so easily spread through infected blood, never share needles with anybody.


This includes drug needles, tattoo needles, and medical needles.
Be sure to use only new and unused needles, and remember to dispose of all used needles in a sharps container.

, Viral hepatitis can easily be transmitted sexually.


Using condoms properly and limiting your number of sexual partners can help lower your risk of contracting the disease.

, If you are ever in a scenario where you will be handling any sort of bodily fluids, or where you may come into contact with bodily fluids, be sure to wear the necessary protective gear.


Wearing protective gear while performing physical work can also help you avoid cutting your skin, making it harder for your blood to come into contact with the bodily fluids of others.
Here are some common and effective pieces of protective gear:

Gloves
Face masks
Goggles



, To minimize your chances of getting hepatitis, avoid sharing your personal toiletries with others, especially those items most likely to come into contact with blood or other bodily fluids such as:


Toothbrushes
Razors
Nail clippers

, Since hepatitis is transmitted through a variety of different substances, it’s helpful to avoid coming into contact with or ingesting the following:


Contaminated food, especially from places with poor overall sanitation.
Unclean water, especially from unknown sources or from regions with poor sanitation.
Residual stool or urine on surfaces such as toilets and urinals, especially in areas with poor sanitation.
Doorknobs, handrails, and other items touched by many peoples’ hands.
Tip: Washing your hands and, whenever possible, disinfecting surfaces using a disinfectant that contains at least 70% alcohol can help minimize the potentially negative effects of coming into contact with these types of unclean surfaces.

Make a gesture of forgiveness.,
Hold on to forgiveness.,

Make meaning out of suffering.",How to Forgive Without Forgetting," When you forgive, you’re making a decision to free yourself from anger, vengeance, and bitterness. Staying angry does nothing to change what happened, nor does it punish the person who wronged you. You’re the only one who is punished when you keep a grudge or dwell in your anger. Forgiveness allows you to move on from a bad situation and emerge stronger. Forgiveness helps you to live life fully and well.Living with anger and resentment harms you and the people you love. It can make you feel distracted, irritable, tense and less equipped to deal with everyday stresses. You're more prone to overreact to little things like waiting in line at the grocery store, or dealing with a misbehaving pet or a demanding child. It’s hard to fully enjoy life when you’re consumed by bitterness.Anger and resentment can hurt your health. When you keep anger bottled up for a long time, your body remains in a constant flight-or-fight mode. It overproduces the hormones adrenaline and cortisol. This decreases your body's ability to repair its tissues, and weakens your immune system.You’re at greater risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. Breaking out of the cycle of anger makes you less stressed and healthier.;
, Forgiveness is often confused with excusing someone’s behavior or reconciling with the person who hurt you. You can forgive someone, yet still seek justice. You can forgive someone, yet go your separate ways. Forgiveness has nothing to do with what happens to the other person. It has everything to do with letting go of your own destructive emotions and thoughts.Justice is when a person apologizes, receives punishment or works to make amends for the wrong or hurtful action. For example, someone who hurt you might apologize to you. Forgiveness is separate from the person’s apology. You may let go of your anger for that person, yet it doesn’t excuse or erase what happened. You can forgive, yet still seek legal recourse if what the person did was criminal.Reconciliation means you and the other person work to repair your relationship. It involves effort from both parties. Sometimes, reconciling may put you in harm’s way, such as in an abusive relationship. Other times, you or the other person may have no interest in working on your relationship. You can still forgive someone even if reconciling is not in your best interest.For example, if you found out someone you trusted, such as a best friend, was stealing money from you, you'd feel betrayed and angry. Contacting the police is one example of justice. Your friend apologizing and returning your money is another example of justice. Forgiveness without forgetting means you let go of your emotions of anger and bitterness, yet you remember that your friend was untrustworthy. You may or may not decide to reconcile with that person. You may also be cautious when letting new friends into your life to prevent the same thing from happening again.

, You grow wiser when you learn from misfortune. Forgetting the wrongs or pretending they didn't happen robs you of wisdom. Thinking about how you were wronged teaches you about human nature and relationships. Forgive to let go of your anger but don't forget what happened. Forgiving without forgetting is crucial to learning who to trust and how to trust.

, Deciding to forgive is like breaking free from a personal prison. Nothing will erase what happened, yet you can release yourself from the negative emotional side effects. Forgiveness is a choice and only you can choose to forgive. When you make the decision to forgive, you’re moving toward a more positive life., Think about the wrongdoing and the wrongdoer. Bring the hurtful situation to the forefront of your mind. What factors led to the painful event? What things made this situation painful for you? Try to be as objective as possible. Recalling helps you confront the fear, anger, and hurt associated with the situation. Recognizing these feelings, rather than burying or avoiding them, is the first step to forgiveness.Notice your body language while you’re recalling. Look for signs of tension like clenched fists, jaw, or shoulders. Using relaxation techniques such as deep breathing can make recalling easier.
Consider meeting with counselor or therapist if recalling is overwhelming. If remembering makes you extremely anxious or upset, a counselor can help you cope.
Share or write down what happened. It may help to share what happened and the pain that it caused with a trusted friend. Another option is writing it down and then throwing it away. Recognize your pain, anger, and hurt, so then you can move on.

, Empathy means putting yourself in another person’s shoes to understand his feelings or motivations. Imagine what might have caused the person to behave that way. Was the person acting out of fear or pain? Did he have a lapse in judgment or make a bad decision? Understand the other person’s state of mind and motivations.


Pretend you’re interviewing the person who hurt you. Be the interviewer and then answer as if you were the other person. Recreate the story of what happened entirely from the other person’s viewpoint. Understanding a person’s motivations humanizes him. It makes it easier for you to forgive someone if you view him as a person who makes mistakes, rather than an evildoer or monster.

, At one time or another, everyone has wronged someone. Think about a time you acted selfishly, angrily or hurtful toward a friend, teacher, sibling, or parent. What happened? What were your motivations? How did your actions affect the other person? Picture the person that you hurt forgiving you. What does her forgiveness feel like for you? Turn your attention to the person who wronged you. Imagine that your forgiveness is a gift for the person who hurt you.


For example, perhaps you remember a time you acted selfishly. Maybe you told a lie about you friend, causing that friend to get blamed for cheating on a test. Your motivation was to avoid getting into trouble again with your teacher, but you ended up punishing your friend instead. Maybe you felt guilty but were too embarrassed to take responsibility at the time. Try imagining your friend telling you, ""I was upset with you but I've moved on. I have no ill will towards you. I forgive you."" Feel how freeing this is.
Focus on how it feels to give a gift of forgiveness. You do not have to actually present your gift of forgiveness to the other person. By symbolically doing it, you start to release your anger and resentment.

, Create a letter, a certificate of forgiveness, or something physical that reminds you of your decision to forgive. When you make a physical gesture of forgiveness, you’re making a decision to move yourself from a negative place to a more positive, healthier one. It’s a reminder to let go of self-pity, hatred, and vengeance when you think of the hurtful event or the wrongdoer.


Write the letter as if the person who hurt you was going to read it, even though she may never see it. Include how you felt before, during and after the event. Write about the wrongdoer and what her motivations might have been for hurting you. Be sure to write about your choice to forgive and how your life will be now that you are free of resentment.For example, you might write, ""Dear ________, I was a trusting person and I feel you took advantage of me when you ___________. I've lived in fear and anger for a long time. The anger consumed me and affected many parts of my life. You never learned what friendship, kindness, and compassion are, which led you to _______. You have to live with your choices. Today I am moving on. I'm taking control of my life and have freed myself of my anger towards you. I forgive you.""

, Memories of the wrong will surface even after you have made the choice to forgive. Acknowledge these memories rather than hiding from them. Usually, the memories won’t be as disturbing or harmful as before, since you’ve confronted them during the forgiveness process. If negative feelings such as hate or anger arise, remind yourself that you’ve chosen to forgive by looking at your physical gestures such as your letter or certificate of forgiveness. Interrupt the thoughts related to vengeance and self-pity.


For example, if remembering what happened makes you angry, vengeful, or bitter, tell yourself, ""I made a choice to forgive."" Look at your letter or certificate to remind yourself that you're no longer going to be stuck in a negative place. You're emotionally free.

, Keep a journal of your negative thoughts related to the hurtful event, and rewrite your thoughts based on your commitment to forgiveness. By writing down your negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones, you’re training your mind to stay on the forgiveness track.Make four columns. In the first column, write down the event that’s making you upset and your initial thought about the event. For example, “I saw him out having a good time. He’s acting like nothing happened and it’s making me so angry.”
In the second column, write what this initial event or thought means to you. What belief or fear is driving your thinking? For example, “He can’t get away with it. It’s not fair. Things like this always happen to me.”
In the third column, write the short or long term consequences of continuing to think negatively. For example, “Feeling angry isn’t punishing him, only me. I’m tired of feeling this way.”
In the final column, reframe your thoughts in a more positive, forgiving way. For example, “He’s made his choices and has to live with them. I’m moving on with my life. I’m finally feeling free.”, Remember what was done to you so you can grow from it. Think about the hurtful event. What lessons can you learn? Were there any warning signs? Think about how you can avoid a similar situation in the future. How might you act differently if the same thing happened again? Difficult events can be a springboard for growth when you choose to reflect on what happened.For example, you're laid off after dedicating years to a company. You understandably feel angry and betrayed. You gave everything to the company, even missing important family events because of the large workload. Remaining in a vengeful place does nothing except make you miserable. In thinking about the events leading up to the layoff, you realize you sacrificed too much of yourself for a job. You can decide to make more time for yourself and loved ones in the future.

, Repression is when you bury memories of bad events. When you repress memories, you get side effects like anxiety and depression. You may lash out and not realize why. Repression is an unhealthy way to cope. It causes you to get stuck in an emotional rut. The process of forgiving without forgetting is healthier because it brings the negative event into your awareness. You reflect on the event, learn from it, and move on.Pretending like something never happened is a form of repression. For example, if a friend stole money from you but you act like nothing ever happened, you're repressing. You try to act like your old self when your with your friend, but when you get home you yell at your pet or give your loved ones the cold shoulder. Repressing your feelings toward your friend is causing them to come out in other unhealthy ways.

, Forgiving without forgetting helps you create an optimistic, hopeful outlook. When you have an optimistic outlook, you can better deal with life's many challenges. When you're optimistic, you know that bad events and emotions are temporary. When your outlook is pessimistic, you tend to think bad events and ugly emotions last forever.


The process of forgiving without forgetting helps you take control of your emotions. You replace your anger and bitterness with hope and strength.You learn that you can take on any challenge that comes your way and persevere., In a perfect world, people would never hurt or disappoint you. Since the world is far from perfect, forgiving without forgetting makes you better equipped to deal with the many challenges of life. Once you’re free of anger, self-pity, and hate, you’re open to the more powerful and productive emotions of hope and resilience. What you choose to do with your life in the face of suffering defines you. You're the only one who has control of your inner world. When you remove yourself from the burden of resentment, you’ll experience a world of possibilities.Viktor Frankl was a doctor who was imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. During imprisonment, he saw death and cruelty on a daily basis. By thinking of his wife and planning a book, he held on to hope and never lost the will to live. Viktor Frankl survived the camp. He dedicated his life to helping people take control of their inner world when faced with unjust or difficult circumstances.

Get a hepatitis A vaccine.,
Receive a hepatitis B vaccine.,
Realize the shortcomings regarding vaccination options for hepatitis C, D, and E.


While there are several vaccines currently under development, there is no approved vaccine for hepatitis C.The vaccine for hepatitis B can protect against hepatitis D in individuals not already infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).This is because in order for the hepatitis D virus to replicate, HBV must already be present in the body.Finally, while a hepatitis E vaccination has been approved for use in China, its effectiveness and safety are still being tested and evaluated.,
Get a hepatitis immunoglobulin shot.",How to Lower Your Risk of Developing Viral Hepatitis2," The hepatitis A vaccine is used to prevent and lower the risk of acquiring the disease. It is administered through an injection into the muscles, and requires no special preparation. Those who are good candidates for this vaccination are:


Children 1-2 years in age.
People traveling to places with a high prevalence of hepatitis A including Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.
People who live in areas with a high incidence rate of hepatitis A.
Men with male sexual partners.
People who come into frequent contact with needles, whether for drug use or medical purposes.
Those who come into any sort of intimate contact with people from areas prone to hepatitis A infections.

, Like the hepatitis A vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine is injected directly into the muscle and requires no special preparation. Good candidates for this vaccination include:


Recently born babies. Be aware that babies receive hepatitis B vaccinations in three doses: at the time of birth, at 1-2 months old, and again at 6-18 months old.
People younger than 18 years old, but who never received the vaccination as babies.
Those whose sexual partners may have hepatitis B.
People traveling to places with high incidence rates of hepatitis B.
Adults who have never received the vaccination, but who want to protect against the disease. Be aware that adult hepatitis B vaccinations come in three doses: the second dose is given four weeks after the first dose, and the third dose comes five months after the second dose.

, Additionally, despite being found worldwide, hepatitis E has low prevalence in developed countries, so infection in places such as the United States is rare., A hepatitis immunoglobulin shot contains antibodies that destroy certain strains of hepatitis.


Because of this, it can be an effective form of treatment if given to a person within 2 weeks of coming into contact with the hepatitis A virus.
It can also help control some outbreaks of the disease.

Know how the virus spreads.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms.,
Help spread awareness by researching the virus and diseases.",How to Lower Your Risk of Developing Viral Hepatitis4," There are five strains of hepatitis, and while they all share some basic similarities there are also some key differences in precisely how each strain spreads from one person to another.


Hepatitis A is transmitted through the ingestion of fecal matter from an infected person, which means that it very often travels through contaminated food and drink. #*Hepatitis A is rarely fatal, and generally does not cause lasting liver damage.
Hepatitis B is contracted by coming into contact with blood, semen, and other bodily fluids from an infected person. Birth, sexual contact, and sharing needles are all common modes of transmission. Hepatitis B can lead to chronic liver diseases, and can sometimes be fatal.
Hepatitis C is spread when a person comes into contact with the blood of an infected person, typically through sharing needles, a bad blood transfusion, and sometimes birth. Hepatitis C can sometimes lead to chronic liver diseases.
Hepatitis D is transmitted through infected blood and blood products. Hepatitis D requires the presence of DNA from Hepatitis B in order to spread, so those who already have Hepatitis B are the only ones at risk for developing Hepatitis D.
Hepatitis E is transmitted through infected fecal matter, and is most common in regions with poor overall sanitation, where the virus is very often waterborne.

, In some cases, people with hepatitis don’t even know they have it because they experience no symptoms. For those that do experience symptoms, however, here are some of the most common ones:


Fever
Jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin
Fatigue and general bodily weakness
Stomachache
Diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Nausea

, By learning how the hepatitis virus is transmitted and taking steps to prevent its appearance and spread, the likelihood of hepatitis infection occurring in your community is reduced.

The affected kidney can no longer filter ethanol from the alcohol efficiently, which increases the risk of prolonged high microalbumin levels. To combat this, cut out the alcohol and replace it with water, teas, and unsweetened juices.


A glass of red wine once in a while is your best bet if you need to blend in at your next soiree. Anything other than that should be avoided.

, A gradual quitting of smoking is advised rather than immediately stopping it. You may have withdrawal symptoms the same as if you were avoiding alcohol if you go cold turkey. However, regardless of the struggle, it is best if you can control yourself in avoiding these two vices.


Chronic smokers have a greater risk in developing high blood pressure (smoking restricts your blood vessels, forcing your heart to pump harder). Nicotine from cigarettes can increase your blood pressure to 10mmHg. If you smoke all throughout the day your blood pressure will remain constantly high.

, Having a high blood pressure can be a factor of why your albumin levels are high. Normal blood pressure ranges from below 120/80 (mmHg) to 130/80. Blood pressure that is equal to or more than 140 (mmhg) is considered to be high. In order to lower your blood pressure you'll want to limit or avoid foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium.


Also, regularly exercising (3 to 4 times a week) for about 30 minutes each time can greatly reduce your high blood pressure. It is important to maintain your ideal weight and avoid being overweight or obese. It is also good to come to your primary health care provider to have your blood pressure checked to make sure you're on the right track.

, Drinking the recommended 8-12 glasses of water every day will help rule out some of the albumin in your urine. You should add more if you sweat a lot and exercise routinely. This will prevent dehydration; the more you're dehydrated, the more your albumin levels will rise.


Fatty and salty foods not only contribute to high blood pressure, but absorb up the water in your system. It's best to avoid them for both reasons.

, It is important to cut down foods high in sugar from your diet to manage your glucose levels, avoid diabetes, obesity, and to keep an eye on your microalbumin. The normal glucose level ranges from 70 to 100mg/dl.


If you currently have diabetes, the albumin levels in your body will be elevated. 180mg/dl is the average threshold of the kidneys for diabetics. That is why if there are excessive amounts of albumin and glucose in your system, it will affect the function of the kidney and will further cause kidney damage.
This will help you keep an eye on your weight, too. A healthy diet and exercise can aid you to lower your blood pressure and blood glucose, but lowering your blood pressure and glucose will have an effect on your weight, too.

, It is important to keep track and monitor your microalbumin levels. This will let you know if your lifestyle is bad for you kidneys and liver. The microalbumin test will check your albumin count in your urine. Early detection of the problem can lead to significant changes that lessen kidney damage. Talk to your doctor for further management.


To test your levels, he or she will give you either a random urine test or a timed-collection urine test. The first is where you pee in a cup at the doctor's office as normal. The second is where you collect all your urine for the day, record the time, and the entire batch is used as a sample., Upon proper urine collection, the sample will be examined and interpreted by a medical technologist. Microalbumin test results are measured in terms of milligrams (mg) of protein leakage over 24 hours. The results can be interpreted as follows:The normal result is less than 30 mg
30 to 300 mg is indicative of early kidney disease
More than 300 mg is indicative of more advanced kidney disease

Appropriate discussion with your healthcare provider about the test result is necessary to make prompt treatment and management. If the level of microalbumin is higher than the normal, repeating the test may be recommended by your healthcare provider to be sure.



, These drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This results in your blood vessels widening, thereby reducing tension on the blood vessels and volume of the blood -- in other words, it lowers your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are proven to reduce the leakage of proteins in the urine such as microalbumins, thus lowering microalbumin levels.The most common prescribed ACE inhibitors are Captopril, Perindopril, Ramipril, Enalapril and Lisinopril. Your doctor will know what's best for you.

, These drugs lower the cholesterol in the body by hindering the action of HMG-CoA reductase, which is an enzyme necessary in producing cholesterol in the liver. Lower cholesterol means easier work for your heart, blood vessels, and kidneys.The most common prescribed statins are Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin and Simvastatin.

, Insulin is a hormone that helps transport blood sugar or glucose into the cells as a source of energy. Without sufficient insulin, the blood sugar cannot be transported inside the cells and remains in the bloodstream. A daily insulin injection upon the advice of a physician is important to maintain normal blood glucose levels.


This is only for those who are diabetic or have some type of insulin resistance. If your insulin works as normal, taking insulin shots will not help your microalbumin levels.

Use breathing techniques to reduce stress.,
Try meditating.,
Use guided imagery techniques to relax your mind.Guided imagery is a technique used to help reduce unnecessary worrying and stop anxious thoughts.,
Try progressive relaxation.For this technique, you work on slowly tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body.",How to Lower Your Heart Rate Naturally1," It is widely known that stress can increase your heart rate. When you are stressed, your body releases adrenaline, increasing your heart rate to assist in dealing with the stressor. Breathing techniques relax and calm your body and mind, thereby lowering your heart rate. Sit up straight. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly rise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise 10 times.
Quickly inhale and exhale through your nose (about three breaths a second), keeping your mouth closed. Then breathe normally. Repeat this process for 15 seconds or more.;
, Meditation can be used as a technique to calm the body and mind. It is often used by people suffering from illness or physical problems to attain physical relaxation, mental calmness, and psychological balance.Mindfulness meditation is a simple and effective way to begin a practice of daily meditation:Sit in a comfortable position, whether in a chair, cross-legged, or kneeling.
Begin to pay attention to your breathing. Your mind will eventually wander. When you catch your mind wandering, bring your attention back to your own breathing.
Don’t stop to dwell on or judge your thoughts.
Continue this process for a short time, such as five minutes if you are trying it for the first time. Repeat this practice frequently, at least once a day. As you begin to practice mindfulness meditation regularly, you can gradually increase the length of the sessions, if you desire.

, It can help you focus and relax, decrease the negative impact of stressors, and ultimately lower your heart rate. Try the following technique for 10 to 20 minutes:Prepare yourself for visualization. Avoid watching television, surfing the net, and other stressors.
Find a quiet and comfortable place to rest and meditate.
If possible, lie down.
Start by closing your eyes and taking a few deep, slow breaths
Focus on imagining a setting that you find peaceful and relaxing. For example, imagine yourself at a beach, walking, striding in the sand, with the breeze blowing in your face. Imagine you are gently floating on the water.
Then, allow yourself to explore that peaceful place you are imagining.
When you are ready to leave, take a few deep breaths and open your eyes.

, It relaxes your body and mind, which can contribute to a lower heart rate.


Sit comfortably in a chair, or lay down
Tense the muscles in your toes. Hold for five seconds, then release and relax for 30 seconds.
Work progressively, tensing and releasing other muscles in your body in the same way: your legs, your thighs, your abdomen, your arms, and your neck.
You can repeat the exercise by working the muscles from your neck back down to your toes.

Schedule time for exercise.,
Do aerobic exercises to achieve a slower resting heart rate.,
Choose the right exercise intensity to lower your heart rate.,
Determine your target heart rate for maximum exercise efficiency.,
Know how to monitor your heart rate when exercising.",How to Lower Your Heart Rate Naturally2," Exercise has innumerable benefits and lowering your heart rate is chief among them. In the moment, exercise will raise your heart rate; however, over the long-term, consistent aerobic exercise can lower your resting heart rate. You can exercise in any way that you are familiar with and reap these benefits. Try exercising for at least 30 minutes per day.If you find it hard to find time to exercise because you get busy during the day, try setting aside time early in the morning before you start any other activities.
If you find it hard to set 30 minutes or more at time aside for exercising, you can even exercise in two 15 minute blocks at different times during the day and still benefit.

, A lower resting heart rate is attained when the heart is strong. Aerobic exercise provides cardiovascular conditioning, decreasing the risk of heart disease, lowering blood pressure, and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or ""good cholesterol.”Good aerobic exercises include:


Running
Swimming
Walking
Cycling
Dancing
Jumping jacks

, Moderate and vigorous exercise have been shown to lower your resting heart rate.You can try a variety of exercises, but make sure they pass the talk/sing test to ensure that they are at the right level of activity: if you can’t talk while exercising, you are working too hard, but if you can sing while exercising, you aren’t working hard enough., Determining your target heart rate allows you to aim for a certain heart rate range during exercise. This allows you to push your heart to get stronger without dangerously overworking it.First, you must estimate your maximal heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. This is the maximum number of times your heart should beat per minute while exercising.
Then calculate your target heart rate: moderate exercise should lead to 50 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate; vigorous exercise should lead to 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate.
For example, if you are 45 years old, your maximal heart rate is 175 (220 - 45 = 175). Your target heart rate should be about 105 (60% of 175 = 105) for moderate exercise and 140 (80% of 175 = 140) for vigorous exercise.

, Before exercise, take your pulse first, either in your wrist or neck, counting for a full minute with a wrist watch. Then after exercise or during cooling down, take your pulse again.


Taking your pulse at regular intervals lets you know whether you are exercising within your target heart range.
You can also wear a heart rate monitor or a fitness device (possibly even your smartphone) that will monitor and record your heart rate.

Eat foods high in magnesium to support enzymes.,
Get adequate amounts of potassium in your diet.,
Include calcium in your diet to maintain heart health.,
Avoid consuming caffeine.",How to Lower Your Heart Rate Naturally3," Magnesium is one of the most essential minerals to maintaining heart health. It plays an active role in the functioning of over 350 enzymes in your body, which support the functioning of heart muscle and the relaxing of blood vessels. Talk to your doctor about the right amount of magnesium for you (too much can lower your heart rate to dangerous levels). Foods rich in magnesium include:


Green leafy vegetables such as spinach
Whole grains
Nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, and cashews)

, Potassium has a significant role to play in your health as it is essential for the proper functioning of all cells, tissues, and organs in the body. Among these roles, potassium impacts your heart rate, and increasing your intake of it can lower your heart rate. Talk to your doctor about the right amount of potassium for you, since too much may slow your heart rate to a dangerous level. Foods rich in potassium include:


Meats (beef, pork, chicken)
Some fish (salmon, cod, flounder)
Most fruits and vegetables
Legumes (beans and lentils)
Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.)

, Calcium, an electrolyte like potassium and magnesium, is essential for heart health.Your heartbeat’s strength depends very much on the calcium in the heart muscles’ cells. Therefore, to have your heart muscles perform their duty to perfection, it is essential to have the required level of calcium in your body. Good sources of calcium include:


Dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.)
Dark green vegetables (broccoli, kale, collard greens, etc.)
Sardines
Almond milk

, Caffeine is a stimulant that can raise your heart rate.The effects of caffeine can even last for hours after consuming it. For this reason, it is best to avoid caffeine if you are trying to lower your heart rate. Products containing caffeine include:


Coffee
Black and green teas
Some sodas
Chocolate

Limit your alcohol intake.,
Lose weight via a low-calorie diet.,
Add some coffee to your diet.,
Consider taking milk thistle supplements.,
Try supplementing with turmeric powder.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about stopping certain medications.,
Take medications to fight liver disease.",How to Lower AST Levels," Chronic alcohol use will lead to an increase in AST levels because ethanol is actually toxic to the liver cells and damages them.Occasionally drinking an alcoholic (wine, beer, highballs, cocktails) beverage will not impact AST or other liver enzymes significantly, but moderate long-term usage (more than a couple drinks per day) or binge drinking on the weekends will definitely impact enzyme levels.


If you are a moderate-to-heavy or binge drinker and have elevated AST levels in your blood, then cutting back or stopping alcohol consumption will likely lower your enzyme levels — it might take a couple of weeks or longer to see results on a blood test.
Mild alcohol consumption (less than one drink daily) has been linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but any ethanol consumption is at least a little injurious to liver and pancreas cells.
AST and ALT are the most useful measures of liver injury, although AST levels are less liver specific than looking at ALT levels.;
, There are many reasons to lose weight, such as reduced risk of heart attack and stroke, but slimming down by reducing your daily caloric intake is also linked to lower AST levels.Researchers believe it's a combination of less body mass and fewer refined sugars, saturated fat and preservatives to process that reduces the liver's workload and allows it to recover — which is eventually reflected in lower AST levels. Low-calorie diets typically consist of eating less saturated fats and refined sugars, and switching to lean meats, fish, whole grains, and fresh fruits and veggies.


AST and other liver enzyme concentrations constantly decrease in men on low-calorie diets, whereas women on the same diets sometimes show an initial increase in AST levels before seeing a noticeable reduction a few weeks later.For most women, eating less than 2,000 calories each day will lead to some weight loss every week (a pound or so) even if you're only a light exerciser. Most men will lose weight when they regularly consume less than 2,200 calories daily.
Losing weight by vigorously exercising and lifting weights has many health benefits, but AST levels may rise due to constant low-level damage to muscles. , Research conducted in 2014 concluded that drinking moderate amounts of regular or decaffeinated coffee on a regular basis may benefit liver health and lower circulating liver enzymes, such as AST.This suggests that chemical compounds in coffee other than caffeine seem to help protect or heal liver cells. Scientists aren't certain, but they suspect it's the antioxidants within coffee that are helpful to the liver and other organs.


It was the participants who drank three or more cups of coffee daily who had lower liver enzyme levels compared to those who didn't drink any coffee.
Previous research has found that moderate coffee consumption may also help lower the risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and cancer.
If you're hoping to lower AST levels and recover from a liver issue, then decaffeinated coffee is likely the better choice due to the side effects associated with moderate-to-high caffeine consumption (sleep disruption, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset and others).

, Milk thistle is an ancient herbal remedy used for numerous ailments, including liver, kidney and gallbladder problems. Several scientific studies conclude that compounds in milk thistle (particularly silymarin) help protect the liver from toxins and stimulate healing by growing new liver cells.Silymarin also has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the extent to which silymarin can reduce AST and other liver enzyme levels in the blood is not clear as research is conflicted.Due to its relative lack of side effects, milk thistle is likely worth experimenting with if you're looking for a natural remedy to help treat liver disease, even if it doesn't have a dramatic effect on AST levels.


Most milk thistle supplements contain 70-80% silymarin and are available as capsules, extracts and tinctures at most health food and botanical stores.
A typical dosage of milk thistle for someone with liver disease 200-300 mg, 3x daily.
Liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis (A, B and C), alcoholic cirrhosis, congestion and toxic hepatic injury, are the most common causes of moderate-to-severe elevations of AST in the blood., Turmeric powder is the most clinically tested herb because it's a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that helps numerous organs in the body heal, including the liver. The most medicinal compound in turmeric is curcumin, which has been shown to reduce high liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST) in both animals and people.The amounts required to make a significant impact on liver enzymes are about 3,000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks.


Turmeric (curcumin) is also linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and numerous cancer.
Curry powder, which is widely used in Indian and Asian cuisine, is rich in turmeric/curcumin and gives curry its rich yellow color.

, Most people get AST and ALT blood tests because they have symptoms with their livers that their doctors identify as such. Common symptoms related to liver inflammation/injury/damage/failure include: yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark-colored urine, upper right abdominal swelling and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, weakness/fatigue, disorientation or confusion, and sleepiness.Your doctor will take into consideration your liver enzyme levels in addition to your symptoms, a physical exam, positive diagnostic tests (ultrasound, MRI) and possibly a liver biopsy (tissue sample) before arriving at a diagnosis.


Acute liver failure from a variety of causes can develop very quickly (within days) in an otherwise healthy person and become life-threatening, so high AST and other enzyme levels should be taken seriously.In addition to the above mentioned signs and symptoms, a liver panel (looking at all the liver enzymes in the blood) may be ordered routinely for: people who are on long-term medication, heavy drinkers or alcoholics, those with previous bouts of hepatitis, diabetics and those who are obese.

, Virtually all medications have the potential to damage the liver and increase blood liver enzymes (including AST), but it's usually a matter of dosage and how long you've been taking them. Like alcohol, all medications are metabolized (broken down) in the liver so there is potential to be overworked. Having said that, some drugs (or their breakdown products) are naturally more toxic to the liver than other compounds. For example, statin medications (used to lower blood cholesterol levels) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) negatively impact the liver more than most drugs.If your AST levels are high and you are on statins and/or acetaminophen, talk to your doctor about alternative medication or remedies to deal with high cholesterol and/or chronic pain. At the very least, your dosages should be reduced.
When you stop taking drugs that have an especially toxic effect on the liver, your AST levels will naturally reduce over the course of a few weeks or so.
Too much iron accumulation in your body (called hemochromatosis) can lead to elevated levels of liver enzymes too — this may be an issue if you're getting iron shots from your doctor to combat iron-deficiency anemia.
Acetaminophen in the setting of normal liver function, with normal recommended doses is not toxic to the liver. Always follow dosage instructions and recommendations from your physician.

, As noted above, there are numerous liver diseases (and other conditions) that elevate AST and other enzyme levels in the blood. However, there are a limited number of drugs that can help combat liver diseases, such as viral infections (hepatitis A, B and C), cirrhosis (fat accumulation and dysfunction from alcohol abuse) and cancer.Ask your doctor about your treatment options, which may ultimately include a liver replacement if your liver fails completely. Make sure also to get an understanding of the expected side effects from taking such powerful drugs.


Hepatitis B is typically treated with the drugs lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil, whereas hepatitis C is treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin.Diuretic drugs are used to treat cirrhosis (to remove edema), as well as laxatives (such as lactulose) to help absorb toxins from the blood and take the workload off the liver.
There a number of chemotherapy medications (oxaliplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine) used to fight liver cancer, including very targeted therapies such as injecting the drug sorafenib (Nexavar) directly into tumors."

Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disorder of the pancreatic tissue which is manifested as deficient secretion of the hormone insulin by the islet cells of Langerhans which are parts of the pancreas.,
Glucose is a type of sugar that is required by the body cells in order to generate energetic molecules that are called ATP.,
All these processes occur within the liver cells that are called hepatocytes.,
This polar structure does not allow this compound to penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the liver cells freely.,
One is due to a genetic defect in the coding process of the hormone translational process at the DNA molecule or it can be due to an autoimmune disorder that causes the destruction of the islet cells of langerhans by circulating auto antibodies in the blood.,
The destruction of the islet cells of langerhans by the circulating antibodies causes permanent destruction of the islet cells with no possibility of regeneration of the function of the pancreas.,
This type of Diabetes Mellitus can be treated by increasing the responsiveness of the receptors of insulin at the cellular membranes of hepatocytes.,
The immediate and most convenient molecules that can serve as an alternative fuel to glucose are the class of fatty acids that are present in the blood.,
Their structure is mostly hydrophobic which allow them to easily penetrate the cellular membrane of hepatocytes.,
An immediate consequence to the use of fatty acids as a source of fuel instead of glucose is the formation of ketones in the blood as metabolic products of the oxidation of fatty acids.

,
These ketones are of the type of ketonic acids that can be passed in the urine giving it acetone like smell.",How to Learn and Understand the Pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus," This disorder is also manifested as hyperglycemic state in the blood of affected individuals. This hyperglycemia is also referred to as excess glucose level in the body.;
, These molecules are obtained in several oxidation processes of glucose molecules that include the metabolic process of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle in addition to the process of oxidative phosphorylation.

, For these processes to occur efficiently the glucose molecules must be transported from the blood to the hepatocytes efficiently. This is usually accomplished using transport mechanisms that involve the hormone insulin. Insulin is usually required for the transport of glucose into the cells of the liver. Glucose has a polar chemical structure due to its content of many hydroxyl groups that are attached to its cyclohexyl ring.

, This is so due to the hydrophobic nature of the cellular membrane which repels polar compounds. For these reasons the entry of glucose into the liver cells is not possible without the assistance of the insulin molecule. The disorder of Diabetes Mellitus is usually caused due to deficiency of the insulin molecule that is caused by one of two possibilities.

, This autoimmunity can arise for example due to a disorder in the thyroid gland which can secrete autoantibodies that can in turn attack the pancreatic tissue at the level of the islet cells of langerhans.

, This type of Diabetes usually requires the administration of insulin by an exogenous manner through infusion. The other type of Diabetes Mellitus is due to the lack of response of the specific insulin receptors on the cellular membrane of the liver cells.

, This type of Diabetes is the more common disorder of the two diseases. The clinical manifestations of this disorder are primarily due to its associated complications that are the main reasons of making this disorder a serious and progressive disease. The fact that the body is unable to process glucose molecules as a source of fuel leads the body to search for other sources of fuel.

, Fatty acids do not enter the liver cells in the same mechanism by glucose.

, For this reason fatty acids are a good alternative source of molecular fuel that can be used by hepatocytes in order to generate ATP molecules.

,, Also these ketone bodies can accumulate in the blood. The disorder of Diabetes Mellitus can have several complications that are associated with its progressive nature but these will be discussed in a separate article.

Know what is edema.,
Know the factors that cause edema.,
Under normal conditions these two forces oppose each other and the net result is maintaining the fluid inside the blood capillaries.,
This causes in turn a state of edema.,
One type of localized edema is caused by inflammation of the skin for example.,
Learn the compounds that trigger edema.,
The amount of edema is restricted due to the presence of lymphatic circulation which can accommodate liquids in the interstitial space.,
In addition to edema that occurs in acute inflammation there is edema due to allergic reaction in the skin.,
This in turn causes leakage of fluid from the blood capillaries into the interstitium.,
Learn what medical conditions trigger edema.,
The induction of the sympathetic nervous system leads to renal arteries constriction with accompanying decreased filtration in the glomeruli.,
Generalized edema can occur also due to lack of sufficient amounts of proteins in the blood.,
The hypovolemia that comes as a result induces the sympathetic nervous system.,
The causes of hypoproteinemia are either malnutrition or decreased proteins synthesis by the liver as occurs in liver failure.",How to Learn and Understand What Is Edema," Edema is defined as an excessive accumulation of fluids in the space between cells or the interstitial space. There are two main types of edema. These are localized edema and generalized edema. Fluids inside blood vessels are usually under the effect of two types of pressure.;
, These are:


the hydrostatic pressure
the oncotic pressure.


The hydrostatic pressure tends to filter water out of the arteries into the interstitial space.
the oncotic pressure tends to flow the liquids outside the arteries in the direction inside the arteries.

, If any of these two pressures is changed and in particular if hypertension occurs inside the blood arteries, it then tends to cause leakage of fluid from the blood arteries to the interstitial space.

, Hypertension, which usually has several causes is one reason for the etiology of edema.

, Edema is one symptom of acute inflammation. It is usually caused by increased permeability of blood capillaries due to the presence of vasoactive amines which function by increasing the permeability of blood arterioles.

, In addition vasoactive compounds cause dilatation of the blood vessels which causes increased hydrostatic pressure in the arteries through increased blood flow in the dilated arteries. This then causes edema.

, In addition increased hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial space due to the accumulation of fluid there tends to return this liquid into the blood circulation.

, Allergy can cause release of histamine and other vasoactive compounds into the circulation. This can in turn cause increased permeability of blood arterioles and its dilatation.

, This causes in turn edema. Edema due to allergy is in most cases localized to the skin. A common form of edema due to allergy is urticaria or hives.

, In rare instances of allergy the edema may involve other sites such as the larynx and the bronchioles of the lung. This can cause pulmonary obstruction. Other type of localized edema is due to lymphatic obstruction. Generalized edema is caused by retention of sodium and water in the body by the action of aldosterone and the antidiuretic hormone. Heart failure can lead to edema by inducing the sympathetic nervous system due to shock or insufficient blood circulation.

, This follows by renin and aldosterone secretion as a compensatory mechanism to hypovolemia. Aldosterone leads to retention of sodium and water in the kidney tubules which can lead to accumulation of fluid in the extracellular space and edema.

, This condition is called hypoproteinemia. Hypoproteinemia leads to escape of liquid from the blood capillaries into the interstitium due to the low oncotic pressure in the blood capillaries caused by the hypoproteinemia.

, This causes renal arteries constriction in addition to secretion of renin and aldosterone into the circulation. Subsequent conservation of sodium and water leads to the development of edema.

, Another cause of hypoproteinemia is the nephrotic syndrome in which excessive amount of proteins is lost in the urine.

Look for a small bump under the skin.,
Understand the difference between lipoma and a cyst.,
Check to see how soft the bump is.,
Pay attention to any pain you feel.",How to Know if You Have Lipoma1," Lipoma is generally dome-shaped and can range in size; generally, it is between the size of a pea and roughly three centimeters in length. They have been seen in areas such as the back having grown much larger. These lumps are formed by a rapid increase of fat cells in the area., Cysts have a more defined shape and are firmer, compared to a lipoma. The bump formed by lipoma will generally not get any larger than three centimeters in length. Cysts can get larger than three centimeters.

, Lipoma tumors are generally pretty soft to the touch, meaning that they will move under your finger if you press down on them. These sort of tumors are very slightly attached to the area surrounding them, so while they will stay relatively in place, you will be able to make it move around slightly under your skin., While lipoma tumors are generally painless (the lumps don't have any nerves), they can sometimes become painful if they grow in the wrong spot on your body. If the tumor is near a nerve and the tumor starts to grow, it might put pressure on the nerve, causing pain. Talk to your doctor if you start feeling pain near a lipoma spot.

"
"
Keep track of when you noticed the lump.,
Check to see if the lump is growing.,
Define the tumor’s texture.",How to Know if You Have Lipoma2," It is important to know how long the lump has been there and whether or not it has changed during that time. When you first notice a lump, write down the date. Your doctor will appreciate that you did so if you decide to have the lump removed. Keep in mind that a lump can stay in the same place for years without any bad side effects.; most people only get them removed because they don't like how they look.

, The longer the tumor is under your skin, the more likely it is to grow. However, it is relatively difficult to tell if there has been much growth because these sort of tumors grow very slowly. When you first notice the lump, measure it with a tape measure so that you can keep track of any growth. If you notice that the tumor is growing quickly, it is most likely something else and you should go to see a doctor right away.


A lipoma tumor can start out as the size of a pea and grow from there. However, it will generally cap off at about three centimeters in diameter, so anything that grows larger than this might not be a lipoma, though it can be one.

, As mentioned above, lipoma tumors should be soft and should subtly move under your skin when you try to move them around. Softness and the ability to moved around slightly are both good signs--bad tumors (which are referred to as malignant tumors) are generally rock-hard and stationary (meaning they won’t wiggle or bend when you touch them).

"
"
Be aware that age can play a role in developing a lipoma tumor.,
Know that some conditions can make people more likely to get lipoma.,
Understand that lipoma is linked to your genes.,
Be aware that obesity can make a person more likely to develop lipoma.,
Pay attention to any injuries you get from contact sports.",How to Know if You Have Lipoma3," These sorts of tumors generally show up in between who are between the ages of 40 and 60. However, it is good to keep in mind that lipoma can show up at any age, there’s just a higher risk of developing one of these tumors after you pass the age of 40.

, There are a few health issues that can increase your chances of developing lipoma. The health issues that are generally linked to lipoma include:


Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome.
Madelung syndrome.
Adiposis dolorosa.
Cowden syndrome.
Gardner syndrome.

, Studies show that there is a link between your genetic heritage (the health conditions of your family members) and your own health.If your grandmother had lipoma, it is very possible that you will also develop it because you share your grandmother’s genes.

, Lipoma, as mentioned above, is the rapid growth of fat cells in a certain location. But slim, fit people develop them too. When you are obese, you have a lot more fat cells than the average person, making it more likely that those extra fat cells will come together and form a lipoma tumor.

, People who participate in contact sports where they get repeatedly hit in the same spot have a higher chance of developing lipoma tumors. If you get him in the same spot over and over again, make sure to really protect that area next time.

Use chickweed.,
Try neem.,
Give flaxseed oil a go.,
Drink more green tea.,
Increase your tumeric intake.,
Drink more lemon juice.",How to Know if You Have Lipoma4," Chickweed is a small plant that is generally considered a weed, hence the name. However, aside from creeping up on your roses, chickweed also helps treat lipoma. The plant contains saponins, which are chemicals found in certain plants, that break down fat tissue. You can buy chickweed solution at most pharmacies. Take one teaspoon of the mixture three times a day, after meals.You can speed up the recovery process by also purchasing chickweed ointment. Apply the ointment directly onto your lump once a day.

, Neem is an Indian herb. When you use the herb in your cooking, or take a neem supplement, the herb will help to break up the fat that has formed into the tumor. This is because neem stimulates your liver and gallbladder metabolism, making it easier for both organs to break down fat, including the fat in your tumor., Flaxseed oil is rich in omega-3 acids. The acids dissolve the fat growth in the tumor while also stopping the fat cells from continuing to grow. You should apply the flaxseed oil directly on to the affected area three times a day to ensure that the oil is effective.

, Green tea contains nutrients that have anti inflammatory properties that help to reduce the amount of fat tissues in your body. This anti inflammatory property has an indirect effect on your tumor, decreasing its size. Drinking a cup of tea each day will help you get rid of the tumor, or at least make it less visible., This Indian spice contains a lot of antioxidants that help stop inflammation and keep your fat cells from multiplying in the spot where your tumor is. Use a mix of turmeric and olive oil (about one teaspoon of each) and apply it on the fatty bump each day. Repeat this process until the tumor is completely diminished., Lemon juice contains citric acid and antioxidants (substances that remove bad agents from your body) that will stimulate the liver and destroy toxins. With your liver function boosted, your body will burn fat a lot easier, including the fat cells inside the lipoma.Add lemon juice to your water, tea, and other beverages.

Get surgery to remove the tumor.,
Look into liposuction as a form of treatment.,
Talk to your doctor about getting steroid injections.",How to Know if You Have Lipoma5," The most effective way of getting rid of lipoma tumor is having it surgically removed. Generally, surgery is only reserved for tumors that have grown to roughly three centimeters in size. Lipomas usually will not grow back after being removed, but rarely they will return. When the tumor is right underneath your skin, a slight incision is made in your skin, the growth is removed, and then the wound is cleaned and patched up.
If the tumor is located in an organ, which is much more rare, than you will have to go under general anesthesia to have the tumor removed.

, The technique uses suction to remove the fatty tissue. Generally people who choose this option are wanting the tumor removed for aesthetic reasons. It is also used in cases where the growth is softer than normal.Keep in mind that liposuction creates a small scar, but it will become invisible after it is completely healed.

, This is the least invasive way of getting rid of a lipoma tumor. A mixture of steroids (triamcinolone acetonide and one percent lidocaine) is injected into the middle of your tumor. If the growth doesn’t go away within a month, the procedure can be done again until it does go away."

Call emergency services if you’re dizzy and have chest pain.,
Get emergency help if dizziness is accompanied by weakness or slurred speech.,
Notice if your dizziness occurs with a severe headache.,
Call for emergency help if you pass out.,
Seek immediate care if you hit your head.,
Don’t ignore a high fever or stiff neck.,
Go to the hospital if you are continuously vomiting.",How to Know when Dizziness Is a Serious Symptom1," Chest pain by itself should be a red flag that something may be wrong with your heart, but take it even more seriously when it occurs with dizziness. Chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness or lightheadedness are some of the most common symptoms of a heart attack – caused when your heart isn’t getting enough blood to your brain. If this occurs, call for help immediately.You might also experience an irregular heart rate, which may or may not cause chest pain. Get help if you’re dizzy and your heart is beating out of sync.;
, It’s normal to feel a little off-balance or fatigued when you’re dizzy, but if you experience a quick onset of weakness – especially on only one side of your body – this could signal that you’re having a stroke. Pay attention to whether your speech is more difficult or if your face is drooping on one side. Call for help as quickly as possible if you experience any of these symptoms.Other symptoms of a stroke include your face, arms, or legs feeling numb and difficulty walking.

, Even if you get minor headaches regularly, pay attention if you feel dizziness and have a new headache, a severely painful headache, or a headache that differs from what you usually experience. If this occurs, have someone drive you to the emergency department or call for emergency services., Take a trip to the emergency department if you lose consciousness, or if you lose your immediate memory.Sometimes people pass out because they’re dehydrated or anxious, but it can also indicate a serious problem that warrants immediate attention.

, If you become so dizzy that you fall – even if you do not lose consciousness – go to the hospital if you hit your head. Head injuries can be very serious, and symptoms of damage may not occur until later. You need to be tested for a concussion and, possibly, for bleeding inside or around your skull.

, Meningitis can be a serious and potentially deadly cause of dizziness. It often occurs with a high fever of 102°F (39°C) and up and/or a stiff neck.Nausea, vomiting, confusion, a skin rash, or seizures may also occur. Get help right away to begin treating the infection., Vomiting and dizziness may go hand-in-hand.These may be symptoms of vertigo, Meniere’s disease, meningitis, or other illnesses. Persistent vomiting can make you dehydrated quickly – which is both dangerous, and will exacerbate your dizziness. Seek medical care if you’re vomiting regularly for longer than a day.

Keep track of any unexplained weight loss.,
Monitor any unexplained constipation.,
Pay attention to gaseous discomfort you feel after traveling to a new place.,
Be aware that worms can make you feel like you are never full or like you are never hungry.,
Keep track of exhaustion or fatigue that won’t go away.,
Be aware that some people will have no symptoms.",How to Know If You Have Worms1," When you have worms in your body, you get less nutrients than you are used to because the worm is consuming these nutrients. You may therefore begin to lose weight because while you are eating like normal, your body is not absorbing the calories and nutrients that it should because the worm is taking them from you.If you start to lose weight without trying to, keep track of the weight you lose. If you continue to shed pounds, talk to your doctor.;
, If you have constipation that doesn’t seem to be caused by anything, you may have worms. Worms can cause irritation in your gut that interferes with your digestion. This can cause less water to be absorbed into your body, making you constipated.


For example, if you have eaten foods high in fiber, drank a lot of water, or done other things that normally help you to go to the bathroom, and you still can’t go, you may have a worm.

, If you have recently traveled to a new place that is known to have worm problems, and you suddenly develop serious gaseous discomfort, you may have picked up a worm. This gaseous discomfort can be accompanied by abdominal pain.If you were traveling through a foreign country and were dealing with diarrhea, but took an anti-diarrhea pill, you should monitor your gaseous discomfort. Continuing to have discomfort after taking an anti-diarrhea pill can sometimes mean that you have picked up a worm.

, Having worms can make you feel extreme hunger just after eating, or extreme fullness when you haven’t eaten anything.


This is because the worms feed on the food that you have eaten, leaving you hungry, but can also cause you to feel nauseous or gaseous, which can make you feel full.

, When you have a worm, the worm takes all of the nutrients out of the food you have eaten, leaving you feeling hungry. At the same time, this lack of nutrients can make your energy levels decrease, leaving you easily exhausted.This may cause you to:


Feel tired all the time.
Feel exhausted after exerting a slight amount of energy.
Wanting to sleep rather than do anything else.

, Having a worm in your system can affect you differently than others experiencing the same problem. Keep in mind that it is a good idea to visit the doctor after you travel to a foreign country that is known to have a worm problem. It is generally better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to having a worm in your body.

Follow your doctor's treatment recommendations.",How to Know if You Have Laryngitis," Having a voice that is hoarse (scratchy) or weak is the first sign that you have laryngitis. Your voice becomes rough, hoarse or gravelly-sounding, or sometimes too soft or quiet. In acute laryngitis there is a swelling of vocal cords that impairs the normal vibration.Ask yourself:


Do you notice any scratching or vocal fry when you speak?
Does your voice sound more gravelly than usual?
Does your voice give out or soften when you don't want it to?
Has your voice changed pitch? Is it higher or lower than usual?Is it hard to raise your voice above a whisper?Be aware that a change in your voice may also occur after a stroke, when the vocal cords are paralyzed. You may find that you're unable to speak at all. However, there will be other symptoms such as deviation of angle of mouth, weakness of limbs, drooling, and difficulty in swallowing, etc.;
, Irritation of the vocal cords will provoke the desire to cough. However, a cough caused by laryngitis will be dry instead of wet.This is because a laryngitis cough is restricted to the upper airway but not the lower airway where sputum is produced.


If your cough is wet and produces sputum, you most likely do not have a case of laryngitis. You might have a cold or other virus. However, these viruses have the potential to turn into laryngitis after a while.

, Laryngitis can also cause painful or uncomfortable symptoms in the throat. You may feel a fullness or rawness in your throat because of the swelling of the walls of the nasopharynx (the junction between your airway and the food passage) or throat.Ask yourself:


Does my throat hurt when I swallow or eat?
Do I feel the urge to clear my throat constantly?
Does my throat feel tickly or scratchy?
Does my throat feel dry or raw?, Some cases of laryngitis are caused by an infection. In this case, you might also experience a low or moderate-grade fever. Take your temperature to see if you are running a fever. If so, then you might be experiencing a viral laryngitis.Your fever will likely resolve itself in a few days, though your throat symptoms will likely last longer than thatIf the fever persists or gets worse you should seek medical attention promptly because it may be a sign of pneumonia. You should also contact a doctor immediately if your temperature hits 103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher., Laryngitis symptoms often last for several days or weeks after you have recovered from a cold, flu, or other virus. If you have current throat symptoms and also had viral symptoms within the last two weeks, that is a signal that you have laryngitis.Such symptoms include:


A runny nose
Headache
Fever
Fatigue
Body aches and pains

, Breathing difficulty can occur during laryngitis, especially in young children.If you or your child is short of breath, cannot breathe normally while lying down, or makes a high-pitched sound while breathing in (stridor), this is a sign of laryngitis. This is also an emergency situation that will require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor immediately., Chronic laryngitis can sometimes be accompanied by the development of lumps, polyps, or nodules in or near your vocal cords.If you feel as if there is a lump blocking your throat, that is a sign that you have laryngitis and should see a doctor right away. In many cases, this feeling of having a lump in your throat is due to chronic laryngitis caused by acid reflux disease.The sensation may provoke a desire to clear the throat. If you do have this urge, try to resist it: clearing your throat aggravates the condition., The more severe cases of laryngitis can cause a difficulty in swallowing.Other, more serious medical conditions associated with laryngitis might also lead to difficulty swallowing. For example, if there is a large tumor or lump inside the larynx, it may compress the food tube (esophagus) and lead to difficulty in swallowing. This is a symptom that requires immediate medical attention.


In laryngitis due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, there will be chronic irritation of the esophagus by stomach acid. Consequently, there may be ulcers in the esophagus that lead to swallowing difficulty., Many people experience hoarseness every now and again. However, if the laryngitis is a chronic condition, it will last for more than two weeks. Take note of how long you are feeling hoarse on a calendar. Share with your doctor how long your symptoms persist. This will allow your doctor to determine whether your laryngitis is acute or chronic.Voice hoarseness is characterized by a low, raspy voice which tires easily.
There are other causes of chronic hoarseness besides laryngitis. A tumor in the chest or neck may compress the nerves leading to hoarseness. Other symptoms of a tumor include long term cough, bloody sputum, weight loss, appetite loss, swelling of the face and arms, etc. Consult a doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms alongside your laryngitis., This is the most common type of laryngitis. It is sudden in onset and reaches its peak severity within one to two days. The condition usually starts to subside after a few days, and you will feel much better at the end of the week. Most people experience acute laryngitis at some point in their lives.

, Usually laryngitis is preceded by a respiratory infection such as the common cold, flu, or sinusitis.Acute laryngitis can continue for many days after the other symptoms of the infection subside.


You may infect other people by spreading droplets with coughing or sneezing. Practice proper hygiene to avoid infecting others.

, While rarer than viral causes, certain bacterial infections may also cause laryngitis. These include bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, or diphtheria.In this case, you might require antibiotics in order to shake your laryngitis.

, Another cause of acute laryngitis is the sudden overuse of your vocal cords.Shouting, singing, or speaking at length may cause fatigue and swelling of the vocal cords. Those who use their voices often for work or in their hobbies might be at risk of developing chronic laryngitis from voice overuse.However, sometimes voice overuse can lead to temporary laryngitis as well. Some common causes of acute laryngitis from voice overuse include:


Yelling to be heard at a bar
Cheering at a sporting event
Singing loudly without proper training
Talking or singing loudly in a location filled with smoke or other irritants

, If the inflammation persists more than two-three weeks, then it is called chronic laryngitis.Usually the voice change develops gradually over a period of few weeks. The condition often gets worse with prolonged use of the voice box. In some cases, chronic laryngitis is an indicator of more serious medical conditions., Long term inhalation of irritant substances like chemical fumes, smoke, and allergens are all reported causes of chronic laryngitis.Smokers, firefighters, and those who work with chemicals are at particular risk for chronic laryngitis.You should also avoid exposure to allergens. When your body experiences an allergic reaction, all the tissues will suffer inflammation, including the larynx. If you know you are allergic to a substance, try to avoid having that substance in your home to ensure that you do not experience chronic laryngitis.

, The most common cause of chronic laryngitis is GERD or acid reflux disease.GERD patients experience a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus and mouth. As a GERD patient breathes, the liquid content may be aspirated inadvertently, which irritates the larynx. Chronic irritation causes swelling of the vocal cords that may change your voice.GERD is a condition that is treatable with dietary changes and medication. Consult your doctor if you have chronic laryngitis caused by acid reflux disease.

, Consuming alcohol relaxes the muscles in your larynx, making your voice hoarse. Prolonged alcohol intake can irritate the mucous membrane of the larynx, causing laryngitis.Alcohol overconsumption might also exacerbate acid reflux disease and is a risk factor for certain throat cancers. These conditions might also lead to chronic laryngitis., Those who are singers, teachers, bartenders, or public speakers are at particular risk of developing chronic laryngitis.Overusing your voice can cause fatigue and thickening of vocal cords. Misusing your voice might also lead to the development of a polyp (or an unusual growth of tissue) on a mucous membrane. When polyps develop on the vocal cords, they can irritate the voice box, causing laryngitis.


If you are in a profession that is at a high risk of chronic laryngitis, consider taking special speech therapy or voice lessons to train yourself to speak in a way that is easy on your vocal cords. It is also wise for you to rest your voice on days when it is not absolutely necessary for you to talk, yell, or sing., If your laryngitis symptoms persist, or if you experience any particularly worrying symptoms such as having difficulty breathing or swallowing, you should call your doctor right away. Depending on the severity of your condition, you might see your regular physician or you might be referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist., The first step in a diagnosis will be to take your full medical history. Your doctor will likely ask about the demands of your profession, allergies, medications, other symptoms you experience, and about any recent infections you have had.This is the first step in determining whether or not you have laryngitis and whether your case is acute or chronic.


Your doctor will likely ask about symptoms of common medical ailments that lead to chronic laryngitis, such as acid reflux, alcohol use, and chronic allergies.

, Your doctor will have to examine your throat and vocal cords visually, with the aid of a mirror. By opening your mouth and saying ""aaaaaah,"" your doctor will have a better view of these organs.Your doctor will be on the lookout for abnormal bumps, lesions, polyps, swelling, and colors that can help lead her to a diagnosis.


If your doctor suspects a bacterial cause for your laryngitis, you might also have to provide a throat culture. Your doctor will lightly swab the back of your throat and send it to the lab for testing. This leads to an unpleasant, but very brief, sensation in the throat., Most likely your laryngitis is acute and will not require any further testing. However, if your doctor is concerned about the possibility of chronic laryngitis, cancer, or other serious conditions, you might have to undergo more serious tests to determine the severity of your condition.These include:


A laryngoscopy. In this procedure, your doctor will use a light and mirror to examine how your vocal cords move. Your doctor may also insert a small, thin cable with a camera into your nose or mouth to get a better visual of your vocal cords while you speak.A biopsy. If your doctor suspects that you have precancerous or cancerous cells, she might perform a biopsy of your vocal cords. She will remove a sample of cells from the suspicious area and examine them under a microscope to determine whether they are healthy or unhealthy cells.A chest X-ray. This is most commonly done for children who have severe laryngitis symptoms. A chest X-ray can help determine whether there is any concerning swelling or blockages., Depending on the cause and severity of your laryngitis, your doctor may have different recommendations for how to treat your condition. In many cases, your doctor will recommend the following:


Rest your voice. Avoid loud talking or singing until your laryngitis has resolved.Do not whisper. Whispering is harsher on your vocal cords than regular talking. Speak softly, but resist the urge to whisper.Do not clear your throat. Even when your throat feels dry, full, or scratchy, resist the urge to clear it. That just puts more pressure on your vocal cords.Stay hydrated. Keep yourself well hydrated by drinking plenty of water and herbal tea. This will also help lubricate and soothe your sore throat.Use a humidifier or vaporizer. Inject moisture into the air in order to ease your symptoms and help your vocal cords to repair themselves. Using a humidifier or vaporizer overnight while you sleep is an excellent step to take. You can also take frequent hot showers in order to breathe in the steam.Avoid alcohol. Alcohol is acidic and puts unneeded pressure on vocal cords. Stay away from alcoholic beverages while you are experiencing laryngitis. Reducing your alcohol intake can also help prevent future bouts of laryngitis.Avoid decongestants. Decongestants can help when you have a wet cough caused by a cold. However, they exacerbate the dry cough characteristic of laryngitis. Never take a decongestant if you suspect you have laryngitis.Quit smoking. Smoking is one of the leading causes of chronic laryngitis, and it can lead to much more serious conditions such as throat cancer. Quit smoking as soon as you can in order to prevent vocal cord damage.Soothe your throat. Herbal teas, honey, salt water gargles, and throat lozenges are all excellent ways to soothe a throat that is sore due to laryngitis.Seek acid reflux treatment. If your laryngitis is caused by acid reflux, your doctor will likely provide dietary recommendations and medications to ease your symptoms. For example, you should eat smaller meals, avoid eating before bedtime, and avoid acidic foods and beverages such as alcohol, chocolate, tomatoes or coffee.Take voice lessons. If you need your voice for your profession, you may be able to take lessons in order to learn how to use your voice properly. Many singers, for example, require lessons in order to learn how to project their voices without putting undue strain on their vocal cords.Take prescription medication. If your laryngitis is caused by bacteria, you might require antibiotics. If your vocal cords are severely swollen in a way that impacts your ability to eat or breathe, you might require steroids to reduce the inflammation."

Get help if your dizziness keeps coming back.,
Get your heart checked if you often feel dizzy when you stand up.,
See a neurologist if you feel like the room is spinning.,
See a doctor if you experience a change in your hearing or vision.,
Talk to your doctor if you experience dizziness over the age of 65.,
Be aware that there are many potential causes of dizziness.",How to Know when Dizziness Is a Serious Symptom2," It’s normal for a person to sometimes feel dizzy on a hot day or if they stand up too quickly, but if your dizziness is recurring it means something is going on with your body that should get checked. You may be dehydrated, have low blood pressure, low blood sugar, or be experiencing another easily-treatable cause of dizziness. You may also be experiencing an early symptom of something more serious. Don’t ignore recurring dizziness.Get checked out if your dizziness doesn’t go away after you have water and sit down for a while. “Normal” dizziness should be short-lived and resolve on its own.

, Some people just have low blood pressure naturally, and the drop in blood pressure going from sitting to standing can cause momentary dizziness. Dehydration can cause this, too, so notice if drinking extra water helps. Sometimes, however, low blood pressure occurs because your heart isn’t pumping blood to your body effectively – due to an arrhythmic heartbeat, a weak heart muscle, or diseased blood vessels. Have a physical exam and possibly other tests to rule out problems that could cause a heart attack or stroke.If you consistently have low blood pressure (under 100 on top and/or 60 on the bottom) and always have, don’t worry – some people are just made that way.

, Unlike many other causes of dizziness that make you feel like you are spinning, vertigo causes the sensation that the room around you is moving, tilting, or spinning. Dizziness from vertigo may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or trouble standing and walking.Vertigo can be caused by serious or non-threatening issues, usually due to dysfunction in your inner ear. See a neurologist to rule out a serious cause and to get treatment quickly. Your regular doctor can refer you to a neurologist.

, Some viruses that affect your inner ear can cause abrupt dizziness. Vestibular labyrinthitis and vestibular neuritis usually resolve on their own, but you should be examined and diagnosed by a doctor – they may want to prescribe anti-viral medications or provide you with other medicines to relieve your symptoms.Vision changes and weakness could also indicate a neurological disorder like Parkinson’s or multiple sclerosis, which should be treated early., Older people are more at risk for dizziness, and are more likely to experience dizziness as a symptom of a serious disorder like a stroke, neurological disease, or heart condition. Be wary of dizziness if you're over 65, especially if it is recurring or associated with imbalance.Dizziness in the elderly increases the risk of falls, and should be treated to prevent complications of falling.

, Your doctor may need to take a detailed history and do a physical exam to evaluate the cause of dizziness. Some of the types of dizziness and their potential causes may include:


Sudden onset of dizziness can be caused by low blood sugar and metabolic disturbances such as hypoxia, hypocarbia, and hypercarbia.
Chronic dizziness might be related to Meniere’s disease, cerebral insufficiency, cardiovascular or neurologic illness such as multiple sclerosis, blood loss and severe anemia.
Lightheadedness may be related to anxiety, depression and other psychiatric problems. Panic attacks frequently are accompanied by feelings of lightheadedness or dizziness. Medications for these conditions, such as tranquilizers and antidepressants, can also contribute to dizziness.

Keep track of abdominal pain that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.,
Keep track of diarrhea.,
Keep track of any dizziness you experience.",How to Know If You Have Worms2," If you have a tapeworm infection, you may see the worms in the bathroom after a bowel action or on the inner part of your underwear. If you find tapeworms in either of these areas, contact a doctor right away.Tapeworms look like:


Small pieces of thread.
Whitish color.

, If you are concerned that you have tapeworms, look at your eyes and skin in the mirror. Tapeworms can cause you to have an iron deficiency because they feed on your blood, which in turn lowers your blood levels. When your blood levels get reduced, you make notice that your skin and coloring of your eyes has become paler.


Because tapeworms can lower your blood levels, you can also become anemic. Signs of anemia include an unusually rapid heartbeat, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and challenges with concentration., Tapeworms can obstruct the openings and tubes in your intestines, and in the intestinal wall. When your intestines become blocked, you can begin to feel abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.


The abdominal pain is normally felt just above the stomach.

, Tapeworms can make invade and inflame the lining of your small intestine, which in turn stimulates the intestine’s lining to secrete fluid. When excess fluid is secreted, your body has a harder time absorbing the extra fluid, which can lead to you having diarrhea.

, This condition is very rare and generally only occurs in people who have been infected by fish tapeworms. Fish tapeworms consume so much vitamin B12 from your body that they can induce a condition known as megaloblastic anemia.The resulting low red blood cell count can cause:


Dizziness.
Memory loss.
Dementia.

Watch out for aches and pain in your muscles and joints.,
Take note if you have started grinding your teeth when you sleep.,
Seek medical attention if you are concerned you had or are having a seizure.",How to Know If You Have Worms3," Pinworms, which are also known as threadworms, can cause your skin to become irritated. This is because pinworms leak toxins into your blood. When these toxins accumulate in your skin, they can cause itchiness that may resemble eczema.Itchiness might be worse at night because the worms tend to lay eggs at night.
Itchiness could be worse around the anus because this is generally where pinworms lay their eggs.

, You may find that you have trouble falling asleep or that you are waking up in the night more often than is normal for you. This can be a sign that you have pinworms, as the eggs they lay can release toxins that can get into your bloodstream. When this happens, the toxin can be carried to your brain and may interfere with your normal brain functions.This can also lead to you experiencing mood swings where you suddenly feel anxious, when you were feeling happy the moment before.

, Like itchiness and trouble sleeping, the toxin released by pinworm eggs can also affect your muscles and joints. This is because the toxin from the eggs can be transported to your muscles and joints, which can cause:


Inflammation of the muscles and joints.
Dull or aching pain.

, If you have suddenly started grinding your teeth at night when you never have before, this could be a sign that you have a pinworm infection. The toxins that pinworms release can cause you to have simulated anxiety that may cause you to grind your teeth in the night. Signs that you have been grinding your teeth include:


Your teeth becoming flatter or more worn down.
Your teeth being more sensitive than normal.
Jaw pain.
Feeling like your jaw is tired.
Ear or headache.
Chewing marks on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks.

, In severe cases, pinworm toxin can actually lead to seizures. The toxin can cause an interference in the brain that can cause you to have a seizure. Signs of a seizure include:


Jerking movements of arms, legs, or other parts of the body.
Feeling fuzzy or spacey.
Losing control of your urine or bowel movements.
Unexplained confusion, or memory loss.

Take note if you suddenly develop an iron deficiency.",How to Know If You Have Worms4," If you have a hookworm infection, the first symptom you will notice is generally that your skin is itchier than normal. The itching begins with the hookworm larvae enter your skin. You may also notice the skin swelling and becoming red in the area where the itching sensation is the worst. This is also caused by the larvae entering your skin.People commonly feel hookworm itch in their hands and feet.

, When the hookworm enters your intestines, it can aggravate your intestines, leading to nausea and diarrhea. The hookworm can also release toxins that disrupt your digestive system. The nausea may occur with or without vomiting.


Look for blood in your stool. The blood could be red or black.

, Hookworms can cause your colon to become inflamed. They can also irritate the lining of your intestine, which is comprised of the colon, cecum and rectum. When this occurs you might experience cramps in your abdomen.

, This symptom only occurs in severe hookworm infections. Hookworms feed directly on their hosts blood, which can lead to their host becoming iron deficient. Signs that you are iron deficient include:


Extreme fatigue and overall weakness.
Pale skin and eyes.
Chest pain and headache.
Shortness of breath.

Take note if you constantly feel like you need to pass stools.,
Watch out for signs that the whipworms have blocked your intestines.,
Keep track of excessive diarrhea and dehydration.,
Seek medical help if you experience rectal prolapse.",How to Know If You Have Worms5," This condition is called tenesmus. Your body’s immune system fights off an invading organism like worms, it can cause your digestive tract to become inflamed The inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract makes it harder for you to pass your stool normally, which can lead to tenesmus, or the feeling that you need to pass stools, even when your bowels are empty.This can cause:


Straining.
Pain in the rectum.
Cramping.

, Whipworms can obstruct or do damage to your intestinal wall and intestinal lumens (the passages through your intestines).When your intestines get blocked, you can develop:


Abdominal cramping.
Nausea.
Vomiting.

, Whipworms tend to bury their heads into the intestinal wall. This can lead to increase fluid secretion and/or decreased fluid absorption in your colon. When your colon starts increasing fluid secretion, your body has a hard time reabsorbed the fluid, which can lead to:


Diarrhea.
Dehydration or the feeling that you are always thirsty.
Loss of electrolytes and nutrients.

, In a whipworm infection, the rectum loses its internal support because the worms bury their thin heads into the intestinal lining. This can cause the muscles surrounding your intestine to weaken, which in turn can lead to rectal prolapse.This condition is when:


The lower portion of your colon, which is located just inside the anal canal, turns inside out and can come a little ways out of your body."

Keep track of severe abdominal pain you experience.,
Pay attention if you begin experiencing itchiness around your anus.,
Seek medical help if you see worms when you blow your nose or go to the bathroom.",How to Know If You Have Worms6," Roundworms can block your intestines because they are usually thick, and in some cases can grow to be the size of a pencil. When your intestines become blocked, you can develop extreme abdominal pain.You may feel:


A pain in your stomach, like that of a cramp that won’t seem to go away.

, Roundworms can lay eggs that leak toxins into your body. These toxins can release into your system and may cause your anus to become itchy.


This itchiness can get worse at night because the worms tend to lay their eggs at night while you are resting.

, When roundworms multiply, they may start to leave your body to find a different host. This means they they start to exit your body through different orifices. The most common ways for roundworm to exit is through the:

Some kidney stones stay in your kidney, and some detach and pass in your urine. While passing the stones can be painful, they usually don't cause lasting damage.You might pass small stones without realizing it. Or, you may have difficulty passing larger ones.;
, You'll probably feel severe pain in your sides and back, below your ribs, near your groin and lower abdomen. Since kidney stones are moving, the pain can come in waves and vary in intensity. You may have some of these symptoms as well:Pain when urinating
Pink, red or brown urine that's cloudy or smelly
Nausea and vomiting
Constant urge to urinate and urinating more frequently (although small amounts)
Fever and chills (if you also have an infection)
Struggling to find a comfortable position (i.e. sitting, then standing, then lying down)

, Men are more likely than women to develop kidney stones and non-Hispanic white people tend to develop kidney stones more frequently. Being overweight, obese, dehydrated, or eating a diet high in sugar, sodium, and protein can also increase your risk.You're more likely to develop kidney stones if you've already had them or someone in your family has had them.

, Your doctor will perform a physical and test your blood and urine. The doctor is checking for calcium, uric acid, or minerals which could could cause stones to form. You may also get imaging done (like x-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds). This way, the doctor can visualize if there are kidney stones.


Your doctor may want you to collect the kidney stone after you pass it. This way, the stone can be analyzed and the doctor can determine what's causing your kidney stones, especially if you frequently pass them.

, If you have small stones, you should be able to pass them at home by drinking plenty of water, taking over-the-counter pain medications, and possibly by taking prescription medication to help muscles in your urinary tract relax.If you have larger stones or stones that are damaging your urinary tract, a urologist may use shock waves to break up the stones or will surgically remove them.If over-the-counter medications are not enough, your doctor might prescribe you some other medication for the pain.

, Bacteria can enter your urinary tract and grow, eventually impacting your kidney function. Or more rarely, if the bacteria travels through your bloodstream, it can move to your kidneys. One or both of your kidneys can become infected.Your urinary tract is made up of your kidneys, bladder, ureters (ducts that connect the kidneys to the bladder), and the urethra.

, Your first indication of a problem might be difficulty urinating. You might find yourself running to the bathroom, only to feel pain when urinating and an immediate urge to urinate even though you just did. Other symptoms of an infection include:Fever
Vomiting or nausea
Chills
Back, side or groin pain
Abdominal pain
Frequent urination
Pus or blood in your urine (hematuria)
Cloudy or smelly urine
Delirium, or other uncommon symptoms, especially in the elderly

, Since women's urethras (the ducts that carry urine out of the body) are shorter, bacteria can travel easier causing infection. In addition to being a woman, other factors that increase your risk for infection include:A weakened immune system
Nerve damage near the bladder
Something blocking your urinary tract (like a kidney stone or enlarged prostate)
Urine that flows back into the kidneys

, If you have any symptoms of a kidney infection, you should contact your doctor. Since the condition requires medical treatment, it's best to get an immediate diagnosis. Your doctor will test your urine and may do an ultrasound to check for damage of the kidneys.The doctor may want to test your blood for bacteria and might look for blood in your urine sample.

, Since kidney infection is caused by bacteria, you'll probably be prescribed a course of antibiotics. You'll generally need to take these for about a week. In severe cases, you may be hospitalized while you get antibiotics.Always complete the course of antibiotics even if you begin to feel better. Stopping before you're done can cause the bacteria to return and resist the medication.

, Your kidneys may suddenly become diseased or can become diseased because another condition causes damage. For example, high blood pressure and diabetes can damage your kidneys. If the damage is severe enough, you may develop chronic kidney failure. This usually takes place over the course of several months or years.You might develop primary kidney disease if your the nephrons in your kidneys lose their ability to filter blood. Other kidney problems (like kidney stones, infection, or trauma) can damage the nephrons.

, Since chronic kidney disease takes time to develop, you may not notice symptoms until you already have advanced kidney disease. Watch for these symptoms of chronic kidney disease:Increased or decreased frequency of urination
Fatigue
Nausea
Itching and dry skin anywhere on the body
Obvious blood in the urine or dark, foamy urine
Muscle cramps and muscle twitches
Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, feet and/or ankles
Confusion
Difficulty breathing, concentrating, or sleeping
Decreased appetite
Weakness

, If you have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease, you may have a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans also have higher risk of kidney disease. Since some kidney diseases also have a genetic component, family history of kidney disease can mean that you're also at a higher risk.Also, talk to your doctor about all the medications you're taking, as some can adversely affect the kidneys, especially with prolonged use.


If you're over 60 years old, you also have an increased risk of kidney disease.

, It's easy to assume that other conditions could be causing your symptoms, so if you're experiencing any symptoms you should get a medical examination to determine the exact cause. Yearly physicals are important for catching kidney disease (even before symptoms present themselves).


It's also a good idea to talk with your doctor about your family history and any concerns you have about your kidney function.

, Your doctor will do a physical exam and order blood, urine, and imaging tests. The imaging tests can show your doctor if there are any kidney abnormalities. The blood and urine tests may reveal if your kidneys are having trouble filtering waste, protein, or nitrogen from your blood.Your doctor may also test how well the nephrons in your kidneys are working by checking the Glomerular Filtration Rate or GFR.Your doctor also might order a biopsy of the kidneys to determine the cause or the extent of kidney disease.

, Once your doctor has determined the cause of your kidney disease, you'll be treated for the other condition. For example, if a bacterial infection is causing your symptoms, you'll get antibiotics. But, since kidney disease is chronic, your doctor may only be able to treat complications. In severe cases like kidney failure, kidney dialysis or transplants are options.To treat complications of CKD, you may be prescribed medications to treat high-blood pressure, treat anemia, lower your cholesterol, relieve swelling, and protect your bones.
Your doctor might also order you to avoid certain medications, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or other NSAIDs.

Evaluate the quality of your pain.Pain that relates to a heart attack most often feels like a pressure, or squeezing, sensation.,
Look for non pain-related symptoms.In addition to pain in your arm, jaw, neck, and back, there are other symptoms you may see during a cardiac episode, as well.,
Call Emergency Medical Services (911) if you are experiencing heart attack symptoms.If you are in doubt about your current condition, it is safer to call 9-1-1 or triple zero (000) or the Emergency Medical Services number for your area for quick transport to the hospital and further management.,
Undergo a series of diagnostic examinations.If you suspect you may be having a heart attack, your doctor will perform a number of tests in order to determine and to confirm the diagnosis.,
Note the duration.,
Consider that your left arm pain could relate to angina.,
Identify other symptoms.,
Note any pain related to neck movement.If your pain is worsened when you move your neck or upper back, cervical spondylosis may be to blame.,
Identify pain when you move your shoulder.If the pain flares up in your arm when you move your shoulder, it could actually be shoulder arthritis.,
Look for signs of a nerve injury.,
Check your blood pressure and pulse.,
Consider alternative diagnoses for arm pain.Think back to see if you can remember any recent injuries you may have sustained.",How to Know if Left Arm Pain Is Heart Related," It can range from mildly painful, or not painful at all (in what are called ""silent heart attacks""), to full pain that people would rank a 10 out of 10 in intensity. The pain is often in the chest area, and may radiate down your left arm, to your jaw, or to your back.;
, These include:Nausea
Lightheadedness or dizziness
Cold sweating
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing due to chest tightness
If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms in conjunction with your pain, it is best to see a doctor as soon as possible to rule out the possibility of a heart attack.

, Always remember that if you have a heart attack, time is very important and not a second should be wasted because your life is at risk.As you wait for emergency medical personnel to arrive, take 2 baby aspirins (180mg total) as these can diminish the severity of a heart attack.Aspirin works by preventing further blood clots, and it is a blood clot in one of the coronary arteries (the arteries surrounding the heart) that causes a heart attack to begin with (so aspirin helps to prevent this clot from getting worse). Do not take aspirin if you have been diagnosed with GI bleeds or allergies to aspirin.
Also take nitroglycerin if you have it on you as you wait for the ambulance to get there.This can diminish chest pain and help you to cope with the symptoms until you get to the hospital (at which point the doctors can offer you additional pain medications such as morphine).
DO NOT take nitroglycerin if you have had Viagra or Levitra in the past 24 hrs, or Cialis in the last 48 hrs. It can cause a dangerous loss of blood pressure and other complications. Tell your EMS workers and doctor if you have taken these medications in this time frame.

, You will receive an electrocardiogram (an ECG) to evaluate your heart's rhythm; abnormalities will show up in the case of a heart attack. You will also receive blood tests, mainly to check for an elevation of cardiac enzymes in the blood stream which is indicative of strain on the heart.


Depending upon your symptoms and how clear the diagnosis is to your doctors, you may or may not receive additional diagnostic tests including: an echocardiogram, a chest x-ray, an angiogram, and/or an exercise stress test.

, If your left arm pain has a very short duration (seconds) it is very unlikely to be caused by the heart. Along the same lines, if the pain has persisted for a long time (for days or even weeks), it is also unlikely to be heart-related. If it lasts in the realm of a few minutes to a few hours, however, it may be a heart attack. If your pain is recurring in short intervals, take note of all the durations and intensities of the pain on a piece of paper to bring to your doctor. This could also be heart-related and warrants prompt medical attention.


When the pain is released or accentuated by movement of the thorax (mid-spine region), it is probably due to a spinal degenerative disc disease, especially in older patients. This type of pain is unlikely to be caused by the heart.
Similarly, when the pain appears after a vigorous exercise with your arms, it is probably muscular in origin. Look at your daily patterns. What seems to aggravate it?

, Angina is a pain that occurs when there is insufficient blood flow to the heart.Angina is often a squeezing or pressure sensation; you may feel pain in your shoulders, your chest, your arms, your back, or your neck. It may also resemble the feeling of indigestion.Although it is atypical for angina to appear only in the left arm, it is possible.
Angina is usually worsened or provoked with stress - either physical stress (such as exertion, like after climbing a flight of stairs), or emotional stress (such as after a heated conversation or a disagreement at work).If you suspect you may have angina, it is important to see a healthcare provider sooner rather than later.It is not life-threatening like a heart attack, but it nevertheless requires appropriate evaluation and treatment.

, In addition to the pain in your left arm, take note of any other areas that you are experiencing pain. This is one of the most accurate ways to tell whether your left arm pain is heart-related or not (and if it's serious). A heart attack is likely to be accompanied by:

Sudden and excruciating chest pain that radiates down to your left arm. It can be experienced on both arms but it is usually felt in the left arm because it is nearest to the heart.
Pain and tightness in the jaw that is usually felt in the lower jaw; it can be in one side only or on both sides. This pain can also feel like a bad toothache.
Radiating pain in the shoulders that feels like a heaviness and pressure around the shoulder and chest area.
Dull back pain caused by the presence of pain in the chest, jaw, neck and arm.
Note that a heart attack may also be ""silent,"" in that it presents without serious pain.

, This is one of the most common causes of left arm pain. More than 90% of people older than 65 have evidence of cervical spondylosis. This is a general term for age-related tears affecting the disks in your spine (particularly in your neck area). As the disks dehydrate and shrink, cervical spondylosis develops. It tends to worsen with age as the back wears out.


Moving your neck and upper spine can determine the cause of the pain. When movement increases your pain, this is probably related to cervical spondylosis.
Heart attack pain is not lessened or worsened by movement or applying pressure on the spine or neck. If movement or pressure aggravates the pain and you are without other symptoms, it is most likely cervical spondylosis. However, this is still a serious condition that you should report to your doctor.

, Many patients that come into the emergency department with the fear that they're having a heart attack are actually suffering from this condition. This is a disease that destroys the smooth outer covering (cartilage) of the bone. As the cartilage disappears, the protective space decreases between the bones. During movement, the bones rub against each other, causing shoulder pain and/or pain in the left arm.


Although no definitive cure exists for arthritis of the shoulder, many treatment options are available to relieve the pain. If this describes you, don't worry. It sounds serious, but the progression can be stopped.

, If you lose the function in your arm, it's most likely to be a nerve-related injury.The arm nerves arise at the spinal cord level in the lower neck and form a nerve bundle, called the brachial plexus. This bundle splits, giving rise to the nerves of the arm. Arm nerve damage from the shoulder to the hand causes varying pain, but usually this is associated with a loss in arm function (such as numbness, tingling, or decreased range of motion). Your arm pain could be on the nerve level and have zero to do with your heart.

, If these are affected, peripheral arterial disease may be the cause. This is due to atherosclerosis and is more common amongst smokers.To determine if this is the culprit, a quick visit to your doctor and getting your blood pressure and heart rate checked will solve the puzzle.

, Your left arm pain could be related to an arm or shoulder injury from recent trauma. Speak to your doctor if your arm pain is ongoing and if you cannot find any logical reason for it.


If left arm pain presents suddenly, with sweats, disorientation and other pain, see a doctor immediately and allow her to rule out life-threatening conditions.

Understand that problems with high potassium are generally the result of kidney disease or medication use.There are other causes, but these two are the most common by far.,
Get an electrocardiogram.Because high potassium can be so dangerous to the heart (and because heart symptoms are one of the major ways to diagnose it), your doctor will want to get you an electrocardiogram (a test that evaluates your heart's rate and rhythm pattern) as quickly as possible if your levels are significantly elevated.,
Review your list of current medications with your doctor.,
Have an IV inserted.Assuming your potassium is high enough to warrant more aggressive medical treatment, your doctor will ask the nurse to insert an IV line as this can help to deliver the appropriate treatments more effectively and efficiently.,
Ask about diuretics.,
Have hemodialysis.,
Continue to be monitored by doctors post-treatment.,
Modify your diet.,
Watch for cardiac symptoms.,
Pay attention to nausea and vomiting.,
Look for fatigue and weakness.Potassium helps muscles function, so if you have too much or too little, your muscles can weaken, making you feel weak, tired, and lethargic.,
Be aware of any numbness or tingling sensations.Feelings of numbness or tingling are also related to muscle activity.,
Understand that you may have no symptoms at all.",How to Lower Potassium Levels," Treatment of high potassium will aim to induce potassium loss via excretion through your urine.Start by getting a blood test from your doctor to confirm whether or not you have high potassium. It is a diagnosis that is hard to tell by symptoms alone, so a blood test is very important prior to starting treatment of any sort.Other less common but equally important causes of high potassium are certain ""high glucose states"" (called ""diabetic ketoacidosis"") that can occur in the body in severe diabetics, as well as severe injuries to your body, often from an accident of some sort.;
,


If your potassium is only mildly elevated, however, your doctors may try a more conservative approach and ask you to come back for a repeat test.
The pattern on the electrocardiogram will give your doctor a lot of valuable information on the current state of your heart.This is important not only to help with the diagnosis of high potassium, but also to determine the urgency of treatment, as the state of your heart (and the potential of your heart being in danger from too much potassium) will dictate the strategy your doctors use to lower your potassium.

, You may be taking a prescription drug that is causing hyperkalemia, or high potassium levels. Your doctor may suggest switching to a new medication or lowering your dose. Also, he or she will suggest to stop taking any potassium supplements or multi-vitamins that contain potassium.If you have very high potassium, your doctor will stop altogether any medications that contribute to elevated potassium that he or she can in the short term, to help speed your recovery.However, discontinuing a medication is not enough on its own to treat severe cases of high potassium, which will need more aggressive methods of treatment.

,


Your doctor will likely suggest intravenous calcium, usually 500-3000 milligrams (10-20 mL) one at a time, 0.2 to 2 mL per minute.
Your doctor may suggest that you take resin, which will help your body eliminate potassium through the bowels. The typical dose is 50 grams, which can be taken orally or administered in 30 mL of Sorbitol.
If your doctor believes it is necessary, you may need to take insulin and/or glucose to move potassium into your cells, where it should be. The usual dose of insulin is 10 units by IV; the usual dose of glucose is 50% (D50W) 50 mL (25 grams). These are typically administered as 1  ampule by IV over 5 minutes, onset in 15 – 30 minutes for 2 to 6 hours.

, Diuretics or water pills are sometimes given to remove excess potassium through urination. Diuretics can be taken orally in a 0.5-2 mg dose, 1-2 times/day, or through an intravenous  insertion, in a 0.5-1 mg dose. Your doctor may repeat in 2-3 hours for up to 2 doses if needed.


Note that this treatment is not enough for urgent cases, but may be very helpful for more mild cases of elevated potassium.

, If you are having kidney failure or if you have a significantly elevated potassium level, hemodialysis – a process by which a machine removes waste, including excess potassium, from your blood, since your kidneys are unable to do so – is your best treatment option., After you have received treatment for your high potassium, it is extremely important to have continual monitoring of your potassium levels to ensure that they stay in a safe and normal range. Normally, patients stay in hospital for a short time after being treated for high potassium, where they can be hooked up to ""cardiac monitors"" (which monitor your heart function) and otherwise monitored until the doctors determine it is safe to go home.High potassium is a potentially life-threatening condition, especially for the effect it can have on your heart.Therefore, appropriate monitoring with your doctor post-treatment is key. There are times when this extra monitoring can make the difference between life and death, as your doctors can be there to catch any potential ""relapse"" of elevated potassium.

, A diet with less than 2g per day of potassium is recommended to prevent relapses of elevated potassium. However, it is important to note that eating high potassium foods is rarely the cause of high potassium levels. As previously mentioned, it is usually caused by kidney disease or medications., Too much potassium can affect the way your heart works, causing symptoms like arrhythmia (an abnormal rhythm), palpitations or skipped heartbeats, and, ultimately, cardiac arrest. If you have any reason to think you might be having cardiac symptoms, get to a doctor immediately., High potassium levels can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms can lead to dehydration.

, This feeling may be exacerbated by other symptoms, especially vomiting.

, You may notice these sensations first in your extremities (the hands and feet) and then around your mouth; this may be followed by muscle twitching. Get medical help if you have these symptoms.

, Many people have no symptoms and only discover the high potassium levels when their doctors run blood tests."

Consult a mental health professional.",How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts," Keeping a journal is important so that you can note when these negative thoughts show up, under what circumstances, and how you react to them in the moment. Often, we have become so accustomed to our negative thoughts that they've become ""automatic,"" or habitual reflexes.Taking a moment to record the thought in your journal will begin to give you the distance you need to change these thoughts.When you have a negative thought, write down what the thought was. Also note down what was happening when the thought occurred. What were you doing? Who were you with? Where were you? Had anything happened that might have triggered this thought?
Note your responses in the moment. What did you do, think, or say in response to this thought?
Take a little time to reflect on these. Ask yourself how strongly you believe these thoughts about yourself, and how you feel when you experience them.;
, Negative thoughts can be about others, but frequently, they're about us. Negative beliefs about ourselves can manifest in negative self-evaluations. These self-evaluations can look like ""should"" statements, such as ""I should be better at this."" They can also look like negative labeling, such as ""I'm a loser"" or ""I'm pathetic."" Negative generalizations are also common, such as ""I'm always ruining everything."" These thoughts suggest that you have internalized negative beliefs about yourself and accept them as fact.Take note in your journal when you experience thoughts like this.
When you write them down, try to give yourself a little space between yourself and the thought. Write down ""I had the thought that I was a loser,"" rather than just repeat ""I'm a loser."" This will help you come to realize that these thoughts aren't facts.

, Negative thoughts, especially about ourselves, usually result in negative behaviors. As you record your thoughts, pay attention to the behaviors that you use to respond to them. Some common unhelpful behaviors include:Withdrawing from loved ones, friends, and social situations
Overcompensating (e.g., going to extremes to make everyone else happy because you want them to accept you)Neglecting things (e.g., not studying for a test because you believe you are ""stupid"" and will fail anyway)
Being passive rather than assertive (e.g., not voicing your true thoughts and feelings in a clear way)

, Look for patterns in your negative thoughts that reveal core beliefs. For example, if you frequently see thoughts such as ""I should do better at tests"" or ""Everyone thinks I'm a loser,"" you may have internalized a negative core belief about your ability to perform, such as ""I'm stupid."" You are allowing yourself to think in rigid, unreasonable ways about yourself.These negative core beliefs can cause a lot of damage. Because they run so deeply, it's important to understand them, rather than just focus on changing the negative thoughts themselves. Just focusing on changing negative thoughts is a bit like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound: it will not address what's at the root of the problem.
For example, if you have a core negative belief that you are ""worthless,"" you will likely experience a lot of negative thoughts related to that belief, such as ""I am pathetic,"" ""I don't deserve anyone to love me,"" or ""I should be a better person.""You will also probably see negative behaviors related to this belief, such as bending over backwards to please a friend because deep down, you believe you're not worthy of having friendship. You need to challenge the belief to change the thoughts and behaviors.

, Once you've been keeping track of your thoughts in your journal for a bit, take some time to ask yourself what unhelpful rules, assumptions, and patterns you can identify in your thinking. Ask yourself questions such as:What are my standards for myself? What do I find acceptable and unacceptable?
Are my standards for myself different than my standards for others? How?
What do I expect of myself in various situations? For example, how do I expect myself to be when I'm at school, work, socializing, having fun, etc?
When do I feel the most anxious or self-doubting?
In what situations am I hardest on myself?
When do I expect negativity?
What did my family tell me about standards and what I should and shouldn't do?
Do I feel anxiety in some situations more than others?

, Make the decision that you are going to play an active role in determine your own thoughts. You can control what you think about. This means making a daily effort to consciously program thoughts or affirmations into your mind as well as learning to be mindful and more present. Remember that you are a special, one-of-a-kind person that deserves love and respect - from others and from yourself. The first step to getting rid of negative thoughts is making a commitment to doing so.It is often helpful to choose a particular thought or unhelpful ""rule"" that you want to focus on changing, rather than trying to completely eradicate all negative thinking overnight.For example, you could select negative thoughts about whether you deserve love and friendship to start with.

, Those negative thoughts you encounter are not facts. They are the product of negative core beliefs that you've adopted over the course of your life.Reminding yourself that your thoughts are not facts, and that your thoughts don't define you, will help you distance yourself from unhelpful negative thinking.


For example, instead of saying “I'm stupid,” say, “I'm having the thought that stupid.” Instead of saying, “I'm going to flunk the exam” say “I'm thinking I'm going to fail this test.” The difference is subtle but important in re-training your consciousness and eradicating negative thinking.

, Knowing exactly why we have negative thoughts is hard to pinpoint, but there are several hypotheses about why this happens. According to some researchers, negative thoughts are a byproduct of evolution in which we are constantly scanning our environment for clues about danger or looking for places of improvement or things to fix.Sometimes negative thoughts are brought on by anxiety or worry, in which you are thinking about all that could go wrong or could be dangerous, humiliating, or anxiety-provoking. Additionally, negative thinking or pessimism can be learned from your parents or family when you were young.Negative thinking is also associated with depression and it is thought that negative thinking progresses depression and depression spurs on negative thinking in a cyclical fashion.Lastly, negative thinking can stem from past traumas or experiences that cause you to feel shame and doubt.


Think about any troubling conditions or situations that might be related to why you feel badly about yourself. For many people, typical triggers may include work meetings, school presentations, interpersonal problems at work or home, and significant life changes, such as leaving home, changing jobs, or separating from a partner.Keeping your journal will help you identify these triggers.

, For a lot of us, negative thoughts and beliefs can become so normal that we just assume them to be accurate reflections of reality. Try to be aware of some key patterns of thinking that be harmful; this can help you better understand your behaviour. Here are some common types of negative thinking that therapists term ‘cognitive distortions’:All-or-nothing or binary thinking
Mental filtering
Jumping to negative conclusions
Turning positives into negatives
Emotional reasoning
Negative self-talk
Overgeneralization

, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is an effective method of changing your thoughts. To begin changing your negative thoughts, you have to take notice of your thoughts as they happen. Catch yourself thinking negatively and stop to see which of the types of negative thinking it is. You can even write it down in a journal the when you are first learning to alter your thought to gain some clarity on the process.Once you’ve identified the type(s) of negative thinking at work, begin to test the reality of the thought. You can look for evidence to the contrary. For example, if you think, ""I always mess things up"", think about three instances where you did something successfully. Also be aware of the things that you do successfully as you practice CBT, as an evidence against the limiting thoughts. You can also experiment with the thought to see if it true. For example, if you think, ""I’m going to pass out if I try to give a speech in front of people"", experiment with this thought by staging a mock speech in front of others to prove to yourself that you will not pass out. You can also try a survey to test thoughts. Ask others about the thought you had to see if their interpretation is the same as yours.You can also try replacing certain words that make the statement negative. For example, if you say ""I should not have done that to my friend” you could say ""Things would have turned out better if I had not done that to my friend"" or ""I’m sad I did that to my friend, and I will try not to repeat it in the future.""
Overtime, these CBT-based exercises can help you adjust your thoughts to be more realistic, positive, and proactive, rather than negative and self-defeating.

, This type of thought occurs when you perceive that life and everything you do only has two paths. Things are either good or bad, positive or negative, etc. You do not allow room for flexibility or re-interpretation.For example, if you don't get a promotion but are specifically encouraged to apply the next time there's an opening, you might still insist that you're a total failure and worthless because you didn't get the job. You see things as either all good or all bad and there is nothing in between.
To challenge this type of thinking, ask yourself to think about situations along a scale from 0-10. Remember that things are extremely unlikely to be a 0 or a 10.For example, you might tell yourself, “My work experience for this promotion was about a 6 of 10. That suggests I wasn’t a good fit for this position. That doesn’t mean I won’t be a good fit for another position.”

, When you filter, you see only the negative side of things and filter out everything else. This usually results in distortions of individuals and situations. You may even blow negatives way out of proportion.For example, if your boss noted that you made a typo on a report, you might focus on this and ignore all the good things she said about your work.
Instead, focus on potentially negative situations, such as criticism, as opportunities for growth rather than attacks. You could tell yourself, “My boss really liked my work, and the fact that she told me about the typo shows that she respects my ability to correct mistakes. That’s a strength. I also know to proofread more carefully next time.”You can also try to find one positive thing for each negative thing you notice. This will require you to broaden your focus.
You may also notice yourself diminishing positives, such as saying “I just got lucky” or “That only happened because my boss/teacher likes me.” This is also inaccurate thinking. When you work really hard for something, acknowledge your effort.

, When you jump to conclusions, you assume the worst when there is almost no evidence to support that contention. You haven’t asked the other person for information or clarification. You’ve just made an assumption and run with it.For example, ""My friend didn't respond to the invite I just sent a half hour ago so she must hate me.""
Ask yourself what evidence you have for this assumption. Require yourself to compile a list of evidence in support of the assumption, just like you were a detective. What do you actually know about the situation? What do you still need to make an informed judgment?, You infer that how you feel is reflective of a larger fact. You accept your thoughts as true and correct without asking questions of them.For example, ""I feel like a total failure, so I must be a total failure.""
Instead, ask yourself for other evidence about this feeling. What do other people think of you? What does your performance at school or work suggest? What evidence can you find to support or discredit this feeling? Remember that thoughts are not facts, even when they feel true.

, When you overgeneralize, you assume that one bad experience automatically ensures more bad experiences in the future. You base your assumptions on limited evidence and use words like always or never.For example, if a first date doesn’t go as you hoped, you might think, “I’m never going to find someone to love.”
Eliminate those words such as “always” or “never.” Use limited language instead, such as “This particular date didn’t work out.”Look for evidence to challenge this thought. For example, does one date really determine the rest of your love life? What is the actual likelihood of that?

, Negative thoughts are just like any other thoughts. They come into your head. They exist. Acknowledging your unhelpful thoughts doesn’t mean accepting that they’re “right” or true. It means noticing when you experience an unhelpful negative thought and acknowledging that you had it, without judging yourself for it.Trying to control or repress negative thoughts, such as saying “I’m not going to have negative thoughts!” can actually make them worse. It’s a bit like telling yourself not to think about purple elephants -- now, that’s all you can imagine.
Several studies have shown that acknowledging, rather than fighting, negative thoughts can help you work past them.For example, if the thought shows up that you are unattractive, notice it by telling yourself something like, “I am having the thought that I’m unattractive.” You aren’t accepting this as true or correct, just acknowledging that the thought exists.

, Mindfulness is a technique that invites you to learn to observe your emotions without heightened emotions.The principle of mindfulness is that you need to acknowledge and experience the negative thoughts and emotions before you can let them go. Mindfulness is not easy because it means becoming aware of the negative self-talk that often accompanies shame, like self-condemnations, comparisons with others, etc. However, the task is to acknowledge and recognize shame without getting caught up in or giving power to those emotions that arise.Research has shown that mindfulness-based therapy and techniques can facilitate self-acceptance and help reduce negative thoughts and feelings. Try to find a quiet space to practice mindfulness. Sit in a relaxed position and focus on your breathing. Count the inhales and exhales. Inevitably, your mind will wander. When this happens, don't chastise yourself but take note of what you are feeling. Don't judge it; just be aware of it. Try to bring attention back to your breath, as this is the real work of mindfulness.By acknowledging but de-centering your thoughts and not letting them take over, you are learning how to cope with negative feelings without actually trying to change them. In other words, you are changing your relationship to your thoughts and feelings. Some people have found that in doing this, eventually the content of your thoughts and emotions changes (for the better) too., For example, you might think, “I should not ask for help because that would show weakness,” or you might think “I ought to be more outgoing.”When you notice this language, take the time to ask yourself some questions about these thoughts:


How does this thought impact my life? For example, if you think “I ought to be more outgoing or I won’t have any friends,” you might feel embarrassed when you don’t accept social invitations. You might push yourself to go out with friends, even when you feel tired or could use the time to yourself. This could cause problems for you.
Where did this thought come from? Thoughts often come from rules that we hold for ourselves. Perhaps your family were very extroverted and encouraged you to be highly social, even if you’re an introvert. This might have led you to believe there was something “wrong” with being more quiet, which could lead to a negative core belief about yourself such as “I’m not good enough the way I am.”
Is this thought reasonable? In many cases, our negative core beliefs are based in overly inflexible and rigid thinking that holds us to unreasonable standards. For example, if you’re an introvert, it may not be reasonable for you to be outgoing and social all the time. You may truly need time to yourself to recharge. You may not even be enjoyable company if you don’t get that time you need.
What do I gain from this thought? Consider whether you benefit from this thought or belief. Is it helpful to you?

, Often, substituting qualified terms such as “sometimes,” “it would be nice if,” “I’d like to,” etc. is a good first step in making your expectations for yourself more reasonable.


For example, instead of saying, “I ought to be more outgoing or I won’t have any friends,” qualify your language with flexible terms: “Sometimes I will accept invitations from friends, because friendship is important to me. Sometimes I will take time to myself, because I am also important. It would be nice if my friends understand my introversion, but even if they don’t, I will take care of myself.”

, Often, negative beliefs about yourself are extreme and totalizing. They say “I am a failure” or “I am a loser.” These beliefs allow for no “grey area” or balance. Try finding a more balanced view of these self-assessments.For example, if you frequently believe you are “a failure” because you make mistakes, try to make a more moderate statement about yourself: “I am good at quite a few things, average at quite a few things, and not so good at a few things -- just like everyone else.” You aren’t saying you’re perfect, which would also be inaccurate. You’re acknowledging that, like every other human on the planet, you have strengths and areas for growth.
If you frequently totalize yourself, such as “I’m a loser,” or “I’m pathetic,” rephrase this to acknowledge the “grey area”: “I make mistakes sometimes.” Note that this statement is not something you are, it’s something you do. You are not your mistakes or your unhelpful thoughts.

, If you feel yourself in danger of ruminating, that broken-record loop where you get “stuck” in an unhelpful thought pattern, nurture self-compassion and kindness. Instead of berating yourself and engaging in negative self-talk (i.e., ""I'm stupid and worthless""), treat yourself as you would a friend or other loved one. This requires careful observance of your behavior and the ability to step back and realize that you would not let a friend engage in this kind of self-destructive thinking.Research has suggested that self-compassion has numerous benefits, including mental well-being, increased life satisfaction, and decreased self-criticism, among others.Offer yourself positive affirmations each and every day. This works to restore your sense of self-worth and increase the compassion you show for yourself. Set aside time each day to say aloud, write, or think affirmations. Some examples include: ""I am a good person. I deserve the best even if I have done some questionable things in my past""; ""I make mistakes and I learn from them""; ""I have lots to offer the world. I have value to myself and to others.""You can practice compassion when you keep your journal. When you’re tracking your negative thoughts, show yourself some kindness regarding them. For example, if you had the negative thought, “I am so stupid and I will fail this test tomorrow,” examine it with kindness. Remind yourself not to totalize yourself. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. Plan on what you can do to avoid similar mistakes in the future. You could write something like, “I am feeling stupid because I didn’t study enough for this test. Everyone makes mistakes. I wish I had studied more, but I can’t change that. Next time, I can study more than a day in advance, I can ask a tutor or my teacher for help, and I can use this experience to learn and grow from.”, Think about the good stuff. Chances are that you are not giving yourself enough credit for everything that you've done throughout your life. Impress yourself, not others. Take some time to reflect and look back at your past glories from big to small; this will not only help you become more aware of these accomplishments but can also help validate your place in the world and the value you bring to the people around you. Consider grabbing a notebook or journal and setting a timer for 10 to 20 minutes. During this time, write a list of all of your accomplishments and return to it as you have more to add!In this vein, you are becoming your own cheerleader. Give yourself positive encouragement and credit for the things you do. For example, you might note that although you're not getting all the exercise you'd like to be getting, you have been going to the gym one extra day a week.

, Be optimistic and avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy of pessimism. If you expect bad things, they often occur. For example, if you anticipate a presentation going poorly, it just might. Instead, be positive. Tell yourself, ""Even though it's going to be a challenge, I can handle this presentation."", If you have negative thoughts in your head, it’s possible you have people around you who are giving fodder to those same types of negative messages about you, even close friends and family. In order to let go of shame and move forward, you'll need to minimize ""toxic"" individuals who bring you down rather than lift you up.


Consider the negative statements of others to be 10 pound weights. These weigh you down and it becomes more difficult to bring yourself back up. Free yourself from that burden and remember that people cannot define who you are as person. Only you can define who you are.
You may also need to think about people who make you feel badly about yourself. You can't control anyone else's behavior; what you can control is how you respond and how you let their behavior impact you. If another person is unjustly rude, mean, or dismissive or disrespectful towards you, understand that he may have his own problems or emotional issues that is causing him to act negatively towards you. However, if this person is triggering your low self-esteem, it is best if you can walk away or remove yourself from situations where that person is present, particularly if he responds negatively if you try to confront him about his behavior.

, Almost all humans benefit from social and emotional support, whether it be from families, friends, co-workers and others in our social networks. It's helpful for us to talk to and strategize with others about our problems and issues. Oddly enough, social support actually makes us better able to cope on our own with our problems because it increases our self-esteem.Research has consistently shown a correlation between perceived social support and self-esteem, such that when people believe they have social support, their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth increase. Thus, if you feel supported by the people around you, you should feel better about yourself and better able to cope with negative feelings and stress.Know that when it comes to social support, there is no one-size-fits-all mentality. Some people prefer to have just a few close friends whom they can turn to, while others cast a wider net and find support among their neighbors or church or religious community.Social support can also take new forms in our modern age. If you feel anxiety about having to talk to someone face-to-face, you can also stay connected with family and friends or meet new people via social media, video chats, and email., Research has shown that people who volunteer tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not. It may seem counter-intuitive that aiding others helps you feel better about yourself, but the science does indeed that feelings of social connectedness that accompany volunteering or helping others make us feel more positive about ourselves.As a bonus, helping others makes us happier! In addition, you will also be making a real difference in someone's world. Not only will you be happier, but someone else might also be as well.
There are so many opportunities out there to get involved with others and make a difference. Consider volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter. Offer to coach a children's sports team during the summer. Step in when a friend needs a hand and make them a bunch of meals to freeze. Volunteer at your local animal shelter., If you are struggling to change or eradicate negative thinking and/or feel that your negative thoughts are adversely affecting your daily mental and physical functioning, you should make an appointment with a counselor, psychologist, or other mental health professional. Note that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is very helpful for changing thinking and is one of the most researched types of therapy and has strong evidence of its efficacy.In many cases, a therapist can help you develop useful strategies to improve your self-image. Remember sometimes people just can't fix everything on their own. Moreover, therapy has been shown to have a significant effect on raising self-esteem and quality of life.In addition, a therapist can help you cope with any other mental health issues that you may be facing as a cause or consequence of your shame and low self-esteem, including depression and anxiety.
Know that asking for help is a sign of strength, not a sign of personal failure or weakness."

Look for swelling in the area behind your knee.,
Feel for any tightness behind your knee.,
Monitor any stiffness you feel around your knee.,
Pay attention to any pain you feel at the back of your knee.",How to Know if You Have a Baker's Cyst1," This swelling is caused by fluid forming in the cyst, causing the area to become inflamed. The swelling will look like a bulge at the back of the knee and is best seen when you are standing up and your leg is straightened.You can also tell if your knee is swollen by standing in front of a mirror and comparing it to your other knee.;
, When the fluid in the cysts accumulates, it will put pressure on the back of your knee. You might feel like your knee is about to burst, particularly when you are standing up with your legs straight--this is when the skin around your knee is fully stretched and you’ll be able to notice the feeling of tightness., Stiffness is different than tightness in that if you are stiff, you will feel like you have a hard time bending your knee. Tightness, on the other hand, will feel like your knee is a water balloon that is about to pop. Your knee might feel stiff because the cyst will cause the joint and muscles in your knee to become inflamed, making them stiff.You might also find that you feel discomfort when you have to stand for a long period of time.

, When the cyst behind your knee fills with fluid, it will put pressure on your knee. It may also put pressure on the nerves in the area behind your knee; when nerves are pressed on, you might feel pain. If the cyst is pressing nerves you will definitely feel pain when you move your knee a lot. Most people with baker’s cysts describe the pain in two ways:


Some people feel localized pain, which means they feel intense pain right where the swelling is worst.
Some people feel general pain through the knee.

Pay close attention to the woman’s age when trying to conceive.,
Consider visiting a fertility specialist sooner if you have had miscarriages in the past.,
Seek treatment if you have had any problems with endometriosis, ovarian cysts or if your fallopian tubes are blocked.,
Seek the help of a fertility specialist if the male in the relationship has a low sperm count.",How to Know when to See a Fertility Doctor1,"


If you are 35 or younger, have had unprotected sex at least 2 times per week and have not been able to conceive in a 12 month period, you may need to contact a fertility specialist. When you are under the age of 35, your body is still at a good and healthy age to conceive naturally. It is important to contact a fertility doctor and have him run some fertility tests at this point.
Women who are over the age of 35, have had unprotected sex at least 2 times per week and have not been able to conceive should schedule an appointment with a fertility specialist after only 6 months. This is because women who are over the age of 35 often have a more difficult time conceiving naturally, and additional fertility measures may be needed. As women age, the quality of their eggs declines, menstrual cycles are more likely to become irregular and the process of conception can just become more difficult in general.;
,


If you are thinking about trying to conceive a child, but you have had 3 or more miscarriages in the past, it can be a good idea to go see a fertility specialist before trying to conceive. Although many women who have had prior miscarriages have gone on to deliver healthy babies, the fact that you have had problems carrying a child in the past may signal an underlying fertility problem. Repeat miscarriages can be due to a variety of factors, including an irregularly shaped uterus, a weak cervix, a hormonal disorder or problems with implantation. It is best to have a complete fertility workup performed to rule out any underlying conditions that may result in another miscarriage.

, These issues can cause problems when you are trying to conceive. If you have been diagnosed previously with these or other problems with your fallopian tubes, you may need the assistance of a fertility specialist to conceive.


Another issue that may warrant the help of a fertility specialist is if you have had any irregular ovarian reserve tests. It does not matter at what age you had the irregular test, if the test was positive, you should seek assistance from a fertility specialist.

,


Many times after trying unsuccessfully to conceive for many months, a couple will ask their family doctor to perform a sperm analysis on the male. If the analysis confirms that the male has a low sperm count, it can have a significant impact on the couple’s ability to conceive. Sometimes the family doctor will offer tips on improving sperm quality and tell the couple to give it more time. Because there can be an underlying cause for the low sperm count, it is important that the couple seek the assistance of a fertility specialist.

Monitor an increase in pain anytime you move your knee.,
Watch for any visible fluid at the back of your knee.,
Monitor how much you can move your knee.,
Look out for signs of enlargement.,
Be aware that an enlarged cyst can rupture.",How to Know if You Have a Baker's Cyst2," While early stage baker’s cysts might cause pain when you use your knee a lot or when you move in a certain way, as the cyst gets worse you will be able to feel the pain whenever you move, regardless of how small the movement its.The pain will become more intense and may take on a burning sensation right where the cyst is located.

, When too much pressure gets put on the cyst at the knee joint, the cyst can actually tear. The fluid from the cyst will drain into the surrounding area, and the cyst will actually split open so that you might be able to see liquid leaking down the back side of your knee.

, The longer you wait to take care of the cyst, the less you will be able to move your knee. This inability to move well is both because of the pain you will feel when you move, and the inflammation that will actually keep you from bending your knee. Signs that you should consider getting treatment for your cyst include:


Being unable to fully bend your knee.
Being unable to fully extend (or straighten) your knee.
Feeling pain while trying to bend and extend your knee.

, Sometimes a baker's cyst might become enlarged and actually spread down into your calf muscle. If this happens, your calf might develop a red, rash-like appearance. Your leg might also feel warm (which is known as erythema) and your lower leg could become swollen (which is called distal edema). The swelling is caused by the enlarged cyst pressing on the veins of your leg.


If you are aware of other medical conditions, this enlarged cyst is similar to the condition called deep vein thrombosis.

, On rare occasions, an enlarged cyst can break open, leaking fluid into your calf muscle. Signs that this has happened include severe pain, warmth, and tenderness in your calf. Your calf might also develop red or blueish spots where blood has leaked into the surrounding tissue. If you see any of these symptoms, go to a hospital immediately.

Understand that some health conditions can lead to the create of baker’s cysts.,
Know that some knee injuries can increase your chances of developing these cysts.,
Be aware that previous surgeries can predispose you to getting these cysts.",How to Know if You Have a Baker's Cyst3," Baker’s cyst is common in people who have an underlying condition that is affecting their knees. When your knee is dealing with other causes of inflammation and pain, it becomes more likely that a cyst will develop because of that inflammation. Conditions that make it more likely that you will get a baker’s cyst include:


Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and psoriatic arthritis.

, If you have injured parts of your knee in the past, such as sustaining a meniscus tear or straining one of your ligaments, your chances of getting a cyst increase. This is because your knee will already be slightly inflamed; this inflammation can lead to the development of a cyst., If you did have a knee injury in the past, chances are that you had surgery to correct the injury. When your knee gets worked on, it can potentially become inflamed later if you stress it too much before it is fully healed. Like with arthritis, the inflammation caused by this stress can make you more prone to getting cysts.

Let your doctor lead you in the right direction.,
Figure out the costs of fertility treatments to help lead you to the right specialist.,
Research.",How to Know when to See a Fertility Doctor2," Once your gynecologist has informed you that you and your partner have fertility problems and need to contact a fertility specialist, ask him to refer you to a good specialist. This can be very valuable, as a referral from your trusted doctor is likely a fertility specialist that he works closely with or that he normally refers his patients to.


It can also be very helpful to seek the assistance of family and friends. If the specialist your doctor refers you to does not seem like the right fit for you, ask around. Seek referral advice from others who may have been in the same position as you.

,


You can compare the cost of services among different specialists to help you make a decision about which doctor is best for you. It is very important to research what your insurance will and will not cover and also to get to know the hidden fees that will be charged to you when you seek treatment.
Sometimes you will be quoted a price that will not include everything, so it is important to inquire about additional costs that may not be listed, such as laboratory fees.

,


Be sure to research any facility or doctor that you have been referred to. This does not only mean researching the pregnancy rates of a certain facility or doctor, but also researching the facility itself and the doctor’s credentials. You should know everything there is to know about a facility and its doctors before proceeding with treatment.
Pay careful attention to the reviews a fertility clinic or doctor receives. What past patients have to say about the treatment they received can be an invaluable tool in selecting a good fertility specialist.

Get regular dental examinations to catch cancer early.,
Have an oral examination done to identify and diagnose any abnormalities.,
Have a biopsy done to get your tissue analyzed.,
Undergo fine needle aspiration to diagnose lumps.,
Stain the tissue to identify cancer cells.,
Have light based detection done to identify where the affected tissue is located.,
Have microcytoscopy done to avoid repeated biopsy.",How to Inspect the Mouth for Cancer2," Most dentists will do an oral examination during your regular dental visit.


This will ensure that any signs of oral cancer are picked up at their earliest stages.
Getting regular dental examinations is a great way to nip any kind of oral disease in the bud.
If you are under high risk for cancer (due to tobacco use, alcohol abuse, sun exposure or family history), then your dentist will give you periodic oral cancer screening tests during your regular oral examinations.

, During an oral examination, your dentist will check inside your mouth for color changes, red or white patches, and sores/ulcers.


With gloved hands, your dentist will press all your mouth tissues, including your cheeks, lips, tongue, floor and roof of the mouth, and sides of your tongue for any lumps, swelling, or changes of texture.
Your dentist will do a complete examination of all your tissues and check for any cancer indications and changes in your mouth, face, and neck region.
If your dentist identifies some cancer risk signs and symptoms, then he/she will do some more additional tests to screen for oral cancer.

, If your dentist finds any abnormal changes during the oral examination, then a biopsy will be carried out to detect cancer cells.


During a biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the affected area will be removed and checked for cancerous cells.
Your dentist will give you a local anesthetic to numb the area where the biopsy is going to be done.
Tissue taken from the area will be sent to a laboratory to test for the presence of cancer cells.

, If your dentist identifies lumps in your neck, then he will do a fine needle aspiration to get a sample of whatever is creating the bulge.


Your dentist will put a needle in the lump and draw out the cells and fluids contained within the lump.
The fluid will be sent to a laboratory to check for the presence of cancerous cells.

, Tissue staining helps to identify the area where cancer cells are forming.


Your dentist will ask you to rinse your mouth with a blue colored dye (Toluidine Blue) or he/she will apply the dye over the affected tissue.
If the tissue is stained a blue color when the dye is applied, then it indicates the presence of cancer cells.

, Light based detection helps to diagnose cancer by identifying the exact position of cancerous tissue.


First you will wash your mouth with a 1% acetic acid solution.
This removes debris and dehydrate the cells, which makes it easy to visualize the cells or tissues of your mouth.
A blue-white light is used to examine the inside your mouth.
This light makes the healthy tissue appear blue or dark in color.
The affected tissue looks white in color.

, If you have already had a biopsy done, sometimes your doctor will deem it best for you to avoid repeat biopsies, because they are somewhat invasive.


A small amount of blue dye will be painted over abnormal tissue area.
Then the area is closely checked for cancer cells with a microscope.

Purchase a pillbox.,
Review your medication storage instructions.,
Place your daily pills in the pillbox.,
Refill the pillbox.",How to Keep Track of Medications2," Pillboxes can be a great organizational tool that will allow you to keep detailed track of which pills you need to take and when. These pillboxes have multiple compartments which will hold your medications and make it clear when you need to take them and can make it obvious when you've missed any. Many pillboxes will have room for at least a week's worth of medications.
Some pillboxes will have multiple compartments for different times during a single day.

, Not all medications will be able to be stored in a pillbox. These medications will have special storage instructions that you must follow in order to ensure that the medication is kept from expiring or otherwise degrading.Medications that require refrigeration should not be kept in a pill box.
Some medications cannot be exposed to light and may need to be kept in their original container.

, Once you have selected a pillbox that is best suited for your medical needs you can begin to place your medications in that pillbox's compartments. Take your daily dosage of each medication that you take and place it in the appropriately marked container in your pillbox. This will help keep your medications organized and allow you to keep track of which medications you've taken.For example, a medication that is taken on Monday and Tuesday should be placed within the compartments that are label for Monday and Tuesday (Sometimes ""Mon"" or ""Tues"" or ""M"" or ""T"").
If your pillbox has containers for times of day, place those medications with specific usage times in those containers.
Some pillboxes will allow you to make custom labels for the containers. List the name of the medications you place in the container and the times of day you are to take them on your label.

, As you work through your pillbox, taking medications as scheduled, the pillbox will become empty as the week goes on. This will allow you to see if you have missed any scheduled medications throughout the week or month. However, when the pillbox is emptied, you will need to fill it back up with your next round of medication.Make sure you refill the pillbox accurately in regards to your medication schedule.
If you notice you are running low on a prescription, try to get it refilled as soon as possible.

Try keeping a checklist.,
Create a medication calendar.,
Pay attention to your prescription refill dates.,
Set alarms or electronic reminders.",How to Keep Track of Medications3," One of the simplest methods of keeping track of your medications is to keep a checklist. Your checklist will contain the name of all medications and the date and time when you need to take them. Once you have taken your medication, check the item to stay on schedule.Mark the dosage size, when to take, and if the medication needs to be taken with food on your checklist.
Make multiple copies. Try leaving them in convenient locations such as next to your medications or posted on a bathroom mirror.

, Making a medication calendar will allow you to visually recognize which medications need to be taken and when on a daily basis. Listing a medication's name and time of day that it needs to be taken will let you know if you are on track with your schedule or if you have missed taking a medication.On each day you need to take a medication, write down the time you need to take it and the name of the medication.
Cross off a medication after you have taken it.

, While you are keeping careful track of when you are taking your medications, you will also need to keep track of when you are going to run out. If your prescription is a recurring one, keep careful track of when you will run out and need to refill your prescription, keeping on your schedule.Some prescriptions can be prescribed for refills over a period of months or for a three-month supply, while others (like pain medication) cannot. It is important to ensure that when the physician prescribed the medication, you know how much is being prescribed at a time you can plan for refills.
Keep track of when your prescriptions are running low and refill before you run out.

Show appreciation.,
Show your commitment to them.,
Ask others what they need from you.,
Use technology.",How to Feel Connected1," A simple “thank you” goes a very long way. Unfortunately, it is something that people who are close often take for granted. Telling someone you appreciate their time, love, and efforts can strengthen your bond and help you to become more connected.

For example, cook your parents a dinner for no reason, write a friend a note, or simply tell someone how much you appreciate what they do for you. You’ll be surprised at how much these gestures can do for your relationship.;
, Simply showing up and being there for your loved ones says a lot about how much you value your relationships. Putting in the time shows them that you are committed and want to stay connected.

Attending family events, children’s recitals, or simply visiting someone once a week can help to strengthen your relationship and keep it strong., You may never know how to improve your relationship unless you ask the right questions. Your loved ones could feel shy about telling you what they need. Asking them opens the door and can give you some insight on what you can do.

For example, you could ask if there’s anything you can do to make them feel more loved or appreciated. You could ask if there’s anything they want you to change about yourself or what you can do to make their life happier. Learning this information can help to strengthen your bond., The internet is an excellent tool to stay connected to friends and family. Whether you live close or far away, technology provides a variety of ways for you to keep in touch.

For instance, using video chats gives you face time with the ones you love. Additionally, email and text messages can keep you in constant contact, thereby strengthening your relationship. Sending pictures through text or email is another ideal way to stay connected."

Have quiet time.,
Get in touch with your body.",How to Feel Connected2," Meditation is a practice that can help you slow down and feel calm. It can also help to clear your mind of extra noise that could stop you from connecting with yourself and your spirituality. Take a few moments each day to spend this much-needed time with yourself.

To start, sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and begin to breathe naturally. Focus on how your breath makes your body feel and move. Your mind will likely try to wander. Just do your best to bring it back to your breathing., There’s just something about being surrounded by natural elements that can help you get in touch with your spiritual side. You’ll find that you’ll likely slow down and feel calm if you spend some time outdoors.

Take a hike in the woods, spend time reading at the lake, go for a run, or spend a day at the beach. Even sitting in your backyard can allow you to feel more connected to yourself., The world is a loud and busy place. The constant noise can make you feel frazzled and lost. Spending time in silence can help you get in touch with yourself again.

Turn the radio or television off and simply enjoy the silence. Doing so will allow you to think more clearly and give yourself time to calm down. It can also make you more mindful of yourself and your surroundings., A variety of exercises and activities allow you to become more connected to your body. Movement also allows you to clear your mind and feel more at peace.

For instance, yoga, dancing, walking, or running help you to become more in tune to your body and your mind, which can make you feel connected to yourself and your spirituality."

Visit senior centers.,
Make a donation.,
Start a food drive.,
Sponsor a family.",How to Feel Connected3," It’s easy to become wrapped up in yourself. Spending time with others who are lonely, however, can help to keep you grounded and feel like part of the community. Visiting senior centers allows you to spend time with those who may have no one. It can also help you form new relationships.

For instance, playing a game or simply reading a book to someone at a senior center can bring joy into their lives and help you feel connected. Even just watching TV with a senior or having a conversation with them can help you feel in touch with humanity., Chances are you have items lying around your home you don’t need anymore. The good thing is, someone else probably does. You can donate these items to local thrift shops or homeless shelters.

Also consider making a monetary donation to an organization. Along with helping, you can also receive a tax deduction for giving to them., Ask your boss if you can set up a collection box in your office to donate to a food drive. Although food donations to organizations are appreciated any time, they are especially needed during the holidays.

You can also set up a collection jar on your desk for money to be donated to a charity or organization., Find a family that needs help during the holidays and take care of them. This means you can provide them with clothing and food, or even give them financial help. Offering these basic needs can make their holiday better, and make you feel good about yourself.

Contact local religious groups or schools about families who are in need. You can likely find a few families who need your help through them."

Follow your doctor’s instructions.,
Monitor your blood volume regularly.,
Ask your doctor about starting an endurance exercise program.,
Have a blood transfusion.,
Get IV fluid therapy.,
Discuss iron supplements with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about growth factors to increase your blood volume.",How to Increase Blood Volume," Low blood volume (hypovolemia) can be the result of a serious medical condition that requires treatment, so it is important to consult your doctor before you try to do anything else. Symptoms that may indicate that you are hypovolemic include dry mucous membranes, lost elasticity in the skin, decreased urine output, and an increased heart rate.If low blood volume is not addressed in its early stages, then it can lead to hypovolemic shock, which is a medical emergency.;
, It is important to work with your doctor to diagnose and treat underlying medical conditions. Before taking steps to increase your blood volume, you should consult your doctor about any conditions you may have that necessitate it. Without speaking with your doctor, you may not understand the intricacies of your condition or know about potential dangers inherent in treatment. Your doctor will consider:


If you have a metabolic disorder or disease like diabetes. If you do, you may be unable to rely on certain treatments, such as supplements or solutions that include glucose.
If you have low blood volume, your doctor will take steps to diagnose conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, anemia, heart failure, or internal bleeding., When trying to increase your blood volume, you need to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. By acting on your own, without the guidance of a professional, you may put your health in jeopardy.


Do not try to increase your blood volume on your own if you have any sort of metabolic or blood disorder.
If medically necessary, your doctor may prescribe prescription medications to help you increase your blood volume.
Inform your doctor before taking any action to increase your blood volume., When trying to increase your blood volume, you need to monitor your blood pressure and other vital statistics. Although these statistics won't exactly reflect your blood volume, they may give you an indication of whether your efforts are working. Watch your:


Heart rate
Pulse
Blood pressure
Blood sugar, if you are diabetic, Recent studies have linked endurance training with an increase of blood volume over time. Thus, committing to an endurance exercise routine is one of the simplest ways to naturally increase your blood volume. The blood volume increase produced by exercise improves exercise performance and cardiovascular fitness.However, make sure to check with your doctor first.


Consider engaging in a cardio workout regularly. For instance, run, walk, swim, or cycle 3 to 5 times a week for 30 minutes to 1 hour – or even longer.
Your cardio program should last months rather than weeks, and it also needs to be maintained to maintain the increased blood volume. Studies have shown that red blood cell volume increases after about 2 to 4 weeks. Thus, you’ll likely see best results after 1 to 2 months of cardio., Your doctor may order a blood transfusion to replace blood that has been lost through surgery, major injury, or a medical condition. This will increase your blood volume by putting more blood directly into your body., IV fluid therapy may be administered by a qualified medical professional if your doctor thinks it is necessary. IV fluid therapy is also known as a volume expander, which includes saline solution and is used to treat fluid loss associated with blood loss.Saline solution will be given to you under the direction of a medical professional if you are dehydrated or have other medical conditions.
Talk to your doctor about saline solution if you think it might work for you in increasing your blood volume., Iron supplementation boosts red cell production, which helps your body to carry oxygen throughout your body. However, do not start taking an iron supplement unless you have been directed to do so by your doctor., Growth factors cause the bone marrow to make more blood cells. One example of this type of drug is Erythropoietin (EPO)."

Learn the difference between jealousy and envy.,
Be honest about your feelings.,
Discover the source of your insecurity.,
Break it down.,
Seek reassurance.,
Don’t view yourself in competition with your friend.,
Forgive yourself.,
Spend less time with your friend.",How to Feel Happy for Your Friends Instead of Jealous1," To feel the emotional energy of jealousy means that you are feeling a sense of insecurity about a potential loss, or not having or having enough of a desired resource. It is important to understand that there is a difference between the emotional feeling of jealousy and envy.

Jealousy is the overwhelming fear that another person may take something away from you that you consider of importance. For most people, it is a normal human response to experience the feelings of jealousy from time to time. However, for a few others, jealousy can be destructive in life, often interfering with their normal functioning. It is when jealousy becomes overpowering, making it difficult for you to engage and function normally that you may need to think about seeking professional support for help.
Envy is that emotion you may feel of wanting something that someone else has. It is common for the feeling of envy to spark other emotions such as sadness, while jealousy is more associated with feelings of anger and resentment.;
, If you are jealous, you need to admit it before you can ever work on feeling happy for your friends.You can either admit your feelings to yourself, to a third party, or to your friend directly. All three forms of admission are equally valid. Choose the one that you feel most comfortable with.For instance, you might want to quietly admit your jealous feelings to yourself to avoid the embarrassment that might accompany such an admission.
On the other hand, you might want to confess your feelings to a therapist or a close friend. Doing so might help you feel as though you’ve lifted a weight off your shoulders in a more substantial way than you might if you simply acknowledged your jealousy to yourself in private.
Depending on the depth of your jealousy and the level of your friendship, you might want to admit your feelings to the friend you’re jealous of. If you and your friend are very close and have a very open and honest relationship, you might choose to confess your feelings to them directly. You might, for instance, say, “I am very jealous of your good looks.”

, Jealousy appears when someone else has something that you wish you had. Your friend might, for instance, have a talent, an object, or a relationship that you wish was yours. Analyze your friendship and identify the specific source of your jealousy., Being aware of that initial pang of jealousy will allow you to put some focus on it and deconstruct it. Ask yourself what the reason for your jealousy is. Jealousy can tell you a lot about where you are at emotionally and mentally right now, and what it is you want or need. Are there other emotions attached to your jealousy such as anger, hurt, fear, frustration, or resentment?

Consider the information you’ve obtained and identify ways to find healthy coping skills and solutions to your issues.

, Once you identify the source of your jealousy regarding your friend, ask them, a friend, or family member for reassurance. For instance, if you are jealous of your friend’s style or clothing, you might ask a friend or close family member, “Do you think my clothes are nice?” or “Do I have a sophisticated and modern style?”If you don’t feel comfortable asking someone else for reassurance directly, think back on times when you’ve been complimented on your style, or reflect on times when you felt pleased and confident in the way you dressed.

, Reframe the relationship between you and your friend as one in which you can both accomplish great things in different areas of your lives. For instance, instead of feeling jealous for your friend’s swimming abilities, put yourself in their shoes and ask, “What can they not do that I can do quite well?”For instance, if your friend is a great swimmer, you might be jealous of that ability.
But if you are a great writer, they might be jealous of your ability.
Recognize that everyone has different talents and abilities, and not everyone has the same opportunity to develop the same skills.
Remember, just because your friend has earned praise or recognition doesn’t mean that you don’t deserve praise or recognition, or will never meet with praise or recognition.
This process occurs over a long period during which you will gradually adjust your attitude in order to overcome jealousy.

, Jealousy often stems from feelings that you do not possess anything of value, or from a belief that you are somehow to blame for failing to accomplish something your friend has managed to accomplish. This perceived failure often leads to jealousy. Forgiving yourself can help you eliminate this jealousy.


To forgive yourself, see that your friend’s situation - like yours - is based largely on contingencies that are out of their control.
For instance, if your friend has a great relationship, you might feel envious that you do not have a great relationship (or even any relationship at all).
Instead of looking at your friend’s success as an indictment of you, look at it as merely good luck for them. They just happened to be in the right place at the right time to meet the person they went on to have such a great relationship with.

, If you find that your jealousy for your friend makes it impossible to spend time with them, take a break from them. You don’t need to announce a formal break with your friend. Instead, decline their invitations for a period of time during which you can regain your perspective and rediscover how great a friend they are.For instance, the next time the friend you’re jealous and not happy for invites you out, say, “No thank you. I think I’ll be staying in tonight.”
Spend the time apart from your friend contemplating your relationship with them and reflecting on all the great things about your friendship."

Discuss any preexisting conditions.,
Be prepared for multiple appointments.",How to Increase Circulation With Reflexology," The main theory as to how reflexology works was first formulated in the 1890's. The theory states that by applying the techniques of reflexology, signals are sent along the nervous system which results in the body lowering the overall level of tension. This lowering of tension increases circulation and well-being.An additional theory states that by relieving stress, any pain caused by that stress is also reduced.
One final theory states the body contains ""energetic"" circuits, which can be blocked by stress. Reflexology helps to remove these blockages and keep your ""vital energy"" flowing.;
, These charts will give you a map of which areas of the body correspond to other areas of the body. Many charts are color coded and make it easy for you to find the areas that can help improve circulation.Good charts will display the areas being worked on from a few different angles. This can make it easier to determine the specific areas of the foot you may want to target.
Get a chart that has adequate labeling. You won't want a chart that has too little or too much information. Find a chart that you feel you can understand easily.
Charts will either label areas directly, using descriptive terms, or use a numbering or symbolic system. If the chart uses a numbering or symbolic system, make sure they come with a legend or key.
Your chart should have some basic information on how to apply simple reflexology techniques.
To learn more information on reflexology, you may want to purchase a more in depth book or take some classes.
Speak with a reflexologist to learn which charts and books they recommend.

, Find the corresponding reflexes for circulatory and cardiovascular on the chart. Any areas dealing with the chest or heart will be the main reflex points you will be working with.Your chart should have basic information on which points to target for cardiovascular issues.
If your chart uses a numerical system, find the area of the foot that corresponds with those numbers.
Some charts will have areas that deal with circulation, but recommend targeting organs such as lungs, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, and bladder.

, Thumb-walking is a technique that you will be using to put pressure on the areas of your foot that are specified by reflexology to increase circulation. It also allows you to work for a longer period of time without straining your hand or thumb.


Thumb-walking is as easy as bending and straightening your thumb.
You will be using the inside edge of the tip of your thumb to apply pressure.
Lay your thumb flat on the surface of the foot, or any surface for practice.
Bend your thumb. You whole hand should move up slightly when you bend your thumb. Think of a caterpillar crawling.
Straighten your thumb out. Keep your hand in place while only your thumb moves forward.
Apply pressure in between the bending and unbending of your thumb.
You can also do this with your fingers as well. Use the same motion with your index finger, bending and straightening it, as you slowly work the area.

, Reflexology can be carried out anywhere; however, creating a peaceful and clean setting will help obtain better results.Peaceful surroundings can help you relax and get the most out of your session.
Keep lighting low and make sure the temperature is comfortable.
Consider gentle music or even silence. Both can help bring about relaxation.
Wash your hands and trim your fingernails. Remove any jewelry from your hands.

, Remove any socks or shoes. Make sure the feet are clean and free from any wounds or obvious injuries. Wash both hands and feet before you begin.Make sure your fingernails are trimmed and have no sharp edges.
If the feet are injured in any way, do not apply reflexology techniques to them. Look for any cuts, rashes, or warts before continuing.

, Take out your reflexology chart which maps areas of the foot you will be working with. While you can work with the entire foot, there are some spots that are believed to best target the heart and circulation.


If your chart uses numerical or symbolic references, learn which numbers and symbols correspond to which areas of the feet.
Find the areas that are labeled or correspond to the heart, circulation, and the lungs.
Keep your chart in a place that makes it easy to reference once you begin working.

, Press the heart reflex point on your left foot using both of your thumbs. This reflex point is quite large, so walk your thumbs all over the area in a clockwise direction.Targeting the heart reflex area is believed to reduce any stress in that area and result in better circulation.Use the ""thumb walking"" technique. Lay your thumb flat, then bend it, bringing your hand up with the bend. Lay your thumb flat again and keep your hand still.You can also use the ""finger walking"" technique. This is the same idea as the thumb-walking, however, you use your index finger. This is mainly used on the top of the foot.
Apply pressure only for a few seconds as you move along the heart reflex area.If you forget exactly where the heart reflex point is, check your reflexology chart.

, Apply pressure to your lung reflex point on your left foot. This reflex area is even larger than your heart reflex area.The lung reflex point surrounds your heart reflex point.
Apply gentle pressure for a few seconds as your work the entire area.
Use both of your thumbs to press and release the entire lung reflex point.
You can also use your knuckles to apply pressure.
By working with the lung reflex point, it is believed that any tension in that area will be reduced. This will result in better breathing and increased circulation.

, You don’t need to buy any special equipment for a hand reflexology treatment. Just as with foot treatments, peaceful surroundings can help you relax and get the most out of your session.If working on another person, have them lie or sit down comfortably.Hand treatments can be applied anywhere; however, the ideal is a calm and secure environment.
Wash your hands and trim your fingernails. Anyone involved should remove any jewelry from their hands as well.

, Look at your reflexology chart and find the locations associated circulatory system. Look over your hands, or the hands of the person being worked on, to find these locations indicated by the chart.


Your chart may have numbers or symbols mapped on the foot. If this is the case, learn which numbers or symbols correspond to circulation.
There may be other areas the chart recommend working with for circulation, such as lungs or kidneys.
Targeting these area is believed to reduce any stress in that area and result in better circulation., Your fingers are thought to correspond with anything above your neck, such as brain, skull, hearing and sight. Start working on the top, backside, of your left thumb. Gently apply steady pressure for a few moments, before moving slightly down your thumb. Work your way down the entire length of your thumb.Use your opposite thumb to push into these points. Push firmly and move your thumb in a very small circle.
Apply pressure for about three to five seconds.
When finished with your thumb, move on to your index finger. Start at the top again and work your way down, applying pressure with your thumb as you go.
Continue to do this to all of your fingers.
By applying these techniques to your hand, it is believed that tension will be reduced in the body. This tension reduction will improve circulation., Your palm is thought to have reflex connections with your torso and the organs within it. Place your hand on a flat surface, palms facing up. Apply pointed pressure with your thumb to the pads just under your fingers. Move down, up, and across each pad.After you are done with the pads below your fingers, move onto the palm of your hand.
Once finished with the palm of the hand, keep moving down, up and across, this time on the outside edge of your hand.
Now, work from the base of the thumb to the outside edge of the hand. This will cover a large area of your hand and the many corresponding areas of the body.
Finally end by applying gentle pressure to the wrist, right to left, then left to right.

, Follow the same steps to target all the points of your opposite hand. By working with both hands it is believed that a balanced and optimal effect will be achieved., Similar to selecting a good doctor or mechanic, you will want to look at their practice closely. Investigating potential reflexologists will help to ensure that your treatments are of the best quality and that your money is well spent.Seek out referrals. Try talking to your doctor and see if they can refer you to any reflexologists in your area. You may also want to check with family and friends who have visited any reflexologists in the area to get their opinion.
Look for professional organizations and their affiliated reflexologists. Research organizations such as the American Reflexology Certification Board, the Reflexology Association of America, and Professional Reflexology Association.Look into any training or certification your reflexologist might have. Ask your reflexologist about the training they may have received and any certificates or accreditation they may have earned. There are national standards for accreditation, which should have included around 110 hours of instruction. , There are some medical issues and conditions that can prevent reflexology from being an option. Alert your reflexologist about any of the following conditions, as they may prevent you from receiving treatments:Do not get reflexology at all if you have any of these conditions:

Deep vein thrombosis
Thrombophlebitis
Cellulite on the feet or legs
Acute infection with high temperature
Stroke- in the first two weeks
An unstable pregnancy


Only a properly trained reflexologist should work with you if you have any of the following conditions:

Pregnancy in the first trimester
Insulin dependent diabetes
Cancer
Epilepsy
Anti-coagulating drugs
People taking high dosage drugs or a variety of drugs
Having had recent heart surgery, within 6 months.
Contagious conditions such as plantar warts, AIDS, Hep B or C



, Reflexology works best when used regularly. A single appointment be helpful, however, it seems the results of reflexology are cumulative in nature. It is recommend that you begin with one session every week for six to eight weeks.
Treating a specific illness may require a higher frequency of treatments.
Don't use reflexology exclusively. Although it may help in some ways, combine its techniques with other treatments your primary doctor may have recommended.

Express pride in your friend’s ability.,
See your friend’s success as your own.,
Do a reality check and don’t assume.,
Challenge your jealous thoughts.,
Think about the harm your jealousy is doing to your friendship.",How to Feel Happy for Your Friends Instead of Jealous2," Begin telling the friend that you are jealous of that you are proud of their accomplishments or abilities before you’ve totally overcome your jealousy. For instance, if you are jealous of a friend who got the job you wanted, say, “Wow, that is great news. I am so glad for you.”If you believe that your jealousy is so overpowering that you might betray it in your friend’s presence, just send them an email or text message to let them know that you are glad for them.

, When your friends meet with success or accomplish something great, thinking about them as an extension of you can reduce your feelings of jealousy and increase your feelings of happiness for them. This way, you can in some small part consider your friend’s accomplishments your own – at least privately.For instance, when your friend announces that they got a scholarship, you might reason to yourself, “I have been a good friend to them, and without me (and their many other friends), they might not have been driven to get that scholarship.”

, You have many faces and roles in life. You have a public outside face that you present to the outside world, and you have your private face that you may keep hidden from the world, and sometimes even from your closest friends and family. What you see and know of someone in their social setting may be completely different in their home or private setting. Even your closest friends and families may not show you everything about them, so it is unfair of you to make assumptions that things are perfect for that other person.

For example, a friend, co-worker, or classmate of yours may seem to have an awesome life, but he may be secretly struggling with many things.
Don't assume that all those rumors and things you see of the outer-world are true. Everyone has struggles with something, and you have no idea what that person’s inner-world might be like.

, When you think a jealous thought, reject it and replace it with a more positive thought that makes you feel happy for your friends instead of jealous.This might be hard at first, but with practice, you will get better at catching jealous thoughts and swapping them for thoughts that make you feel happy for your friends instead of jealous.For example, when you think, “My friend is really good at dancing. Unfortunately, I am a terrible dancer,” immediately stop and say to yourself, “It’s okay that she is a better dancer than I am. Her skill does not make me jealous. With practice, I can become just as great a dancer as she is.”
This pattern of behavior will help you take control of your negative feelings as they emerge so that you can feel happy for your friend instead of jealous.

, When you are jealous of a friend, you will likely behave in a cool and detached way toward them. Jealousy will cause you to, for instance, to keep your secrets and personal feelings hidden.Over time, tamping down your feelings around your friend will erode the trust you two should share together as friends.
This realization will inspire you to feel happy for your friend rather than jealous.

"
"
Practice gratitude.,
Use positive affirmations to boost your attitude about yourself.,
Manage your stress.",How to Feel Happy for Your Friends Instead of Jealous3," Incorporate gratitude exercises into your daily routine. For instance, when you wake each day, spend five to nine minutes writing about someone or something that makes you happy. It could be the friend you’re jealous of, a teacher, a vacation you had, or even your dog. Whatever it is that you’re thankful for, write about it.You might also choose to engage in this sort of gratitude exercise before going to bed each night. Everyone has something to be grateful for in their lives. Instead of fixating on the things you do not have, take some time each day to think and create a list of all the things you are grateful for. For every feeling of jealousy that may pop up, put conscious effort into replacing it with a thought of gratitude.

, Jealous thinking is often a defense mechanism. Positive affirmations can reduce your defensiveness and make you more willing to feel happy for your friends instead of jealous.For instance, you might say, “I am a good person and I am possessed of many useful skills.”
Your positive affirmations might also be more general, such as “Today will be a wonderful day.”

, Jealousy is a result of stress, and can cause even more stress. Find a healthy way to cope with your stress by taking up yoga or some other form of exercise. You might also try:Improving your sleep habits. If you get less than eight hours of sleep per night, you are more likely to be stressed and irritable the following day.
Changing your diet. Poor nutrition can multiply stress. Eat mostly fruits and veggies, and avoid processed foods loaded with salt, fat, and sugar. Stick to whole grains (whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole wheat pasta) and avoid refined wheat and grains (white bread, white rice).
Talking to others about your feelings. Even after you’ve admitted that you have feelings of jealousy regarding your friend, you are likely to continue feeling that way for some time. To cope with these feelings, unburden yourself to another friend family member, or counselor.

Finds ways to relax.",How to Improve Your Hospital Stay and Recovery Experience," This is very important. Most patients focus on not wanting to be sick, rather than getting well. This difference may seem subtle but it is very important. If you focus on your health, you are literally activating your cells and organs that will help your body to heal. Your intention to get well, assists your body in ways that modern medicine is finally beginning to acknowledge.;
, Use them as a catalyst, as a challenge to overcome whatever disease you are facing. Despite the odds, others have lived and you can, too! Many patients defy their doctor’s predictions. Unfortunately, doctors are trained not to give “false hope,” and often give patients dire predictions that appear to be credible predictions based on statistics involving other patients. Of course, such bleak predictions will have a very negative impact on recovery and health.

, Regardless of the diagnosis and prognosis you are facing, please know all is not lost. Men and women like you have faced the challenges of living with and overcoming serious and potentially fatal diseases.

, The will to live, the desire to get well, has a tremendous impact on our bodies and can mean the difference, literally between recovery and illness, health and disease and life and death. They can’t accurately predict how long you will live. Remember: All statistics are about other people's experiences and may not necessarily predict yours unless you allow them to be such by putting your faith in them.

, How do you feel about this experience called “disease”? Does it create fear, anxiety, denial, and constant thoughts? That’s normal. All of these emotions are a part of the disease process. You can work your way through all of them, with awareness and patience.

, Sometimes you’re frightened, anxious, distressed. Also, loneliness, pain, fatigue. That’s very normal. Acknowledge them.

, Ask your doctor questions about your condition. Write them down, or designate a trusted family member and friend to be your advocate. Demand that all staff (and visitors!) wash their hands or use hand sanitizer. This is the best way to avoid infection and complications that may extend your recovery or endanger your life.

, Turn off the news (any type, unless you just watch the weather)! Don’t watch violent, depressing television programs.

,, It doesn’t matter who that is. A health professional, family member, spouse, friend or someone else can be a great well-being coach, a valuable asset.

, Medical research demonstrates optimists are healthier and recover faster than pessimists. Every crisis can be viewed as an opportunity. Your cup isn’t necessarily half empty, it’s half full. Face every crisis as an opportunity. Pessimism can be redirected.

, This is a very important thing to do. Most illnesses are stress related. When your body is relaxed it has the opportunity to regenerate and heal.

Try eating between two and three servings of sulfur-containing vegetables each day, like kale, broccoli, or cauliflower., Legumes like beans and lentils also contain sulfur. Add several servings of legumes to your diet each week. Try eating beans and rice for dinner or a lentil stew for lunch. Consuming these foods can help your body optimize its collagen production., Isoflavone-rich soy products can increase your collagen production. Soy consumption can increase in the amount of collagen in your skin. It can also boost skin elasticity. Try soy products including tempeh, tofu, soy milks, and soy cheese., Eggs are a great source of collagen. They also provide the proper mix of amino acids needed to support the development and maintenance of connective tissue in the human body. Cooking can interfere with an egg’s membranes, so an egg collagen supplement is the best way to go. However, you can still get collagen by eating eggs., It is important that your skin and body remain hydrated if you are trying to increase your collagen production. Staying hydrated will support collagen production. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses or about two liters per day., The best way to get vitamin C is by eating foods rich in this important nutrient. You can get your daily dose of vitamin C by eating foods like strawberries, strawberries, and bell peppers."

Take a daily collagen supplement.,
Consider a fish collagen supplement.,
Try an egg-based collagen supplement.,
Take a bovine collagen supplement.,
Consider a vitamin C supplement.",How to Increase Collagen2," Collagen supplements may help boost collagen in your body. You can opt for a supplement that comes in pill form, or for a powder that you stir with water or add to a smoothie. Make sure you take the supplement regularly for best results.Talk to your doctor before starting to take a collagen supplement.

, Collagen from fish can be quickly absorbed by the body. Because of this, it is considered one of the best sources of collagen for humans. Look for a supplement that also includes vitamin C, which will help with absorption., If you are a vegetarian, or if you do not want to consume a collagen supplement made from animals, you should try an egg-based alternative. These supplements are made from egg shell membranes and can help your body build collagen., These supplements are made from the skin, bones, and muscles of cows. Opt for a bovine collagen supplement that is made from grass-fed cows. If possible, go for a supplement that is also organic., While the best way to get vitamin C is through foods rich in this nutrient, you can also take a supplement. Aim for one that is food-based and contains at least 75 mg of vitamin C."

Try a facial massage.,
Consider retinol treatment.,
Apply a vitamin C antioxidant cream.,
Go for skincare products that contain polypeptides.,
Try exfoliating your skin.,
Protect yourself from things that can deplete collagen.",How to Increase Collagen3," Getting a professional facial massage, or giving yourself one in the comfort of your own home, may help stimulate collagen production and boost your circulation. Try gently massaging your face with your fingertips, using gentle upward circular motions. Start at your jawline and slowly move up to your forehead.Try giving yourself a facial massage once per week.

, Topical vitamin A, also known as retinol, might increase collagen in your skin. Talk to your doctor about a prescription for topical retinol. You can also purchase retinol treatments over the counter, but these creams and lotions will have a lower concentration of retinol in them., Antioxidant lotions, creams, and serums that contain vitamin C may increase collagen levels in your skin. Talk to your dermatologist about the best options for your skin type and texture. You can also purchase over the counter skincare products that contain vitamin C., Applying products to your skin that contain polypeptides may stimulate the synthesis of collagen in your skin. Try applying a penetrating polypeptide serum before your moisturizer, or a moisturizer that contains polypeptides.Look for a collagen stimulating polypeptide like matrixyl on your skincare product ingredients list.

, Exfoliating your skin can help to boost collagen production as well.Try using an exfoliating facial cleanser in place of your normal cleanser once per week. You can also use an exfoliating body scrub once per week., There are certain substances and activities that may deplete the collagen in your skin. Do your best to avoid these substances and activities. Things that may deplete collagen include:Smoking. Quit smoking if you are a smoker! Smoking damages more than just your skin.
Exposure to sunlight. Always wear sunscreen when you spend time outside in the sun. Wearing a wide brimmed hat can also help to protect the skin on your scalp and face from the sun.
Exposure to pollution. Avoid going outside on extra smoggy days. Exposure to pollution can also deplete the collagen in your skin.
High sugar consumption. Limit the amount of sugar in your diet to avoid depleting your skin’s collagen by consuming too much sugar."

Stand with your feet apart while you breathe deeply.,
Practice holding your breath.,
Inhale for five seconds.,
Practice controlled breathing while exercising.",How to Improve Lung Function1," Bend over at the waist, keeping your knees loose. Exhale completely. Now inhale deeply as you slowly rise to a standing position.


Once your lungs are filled with air, hold your breath for 10 seconds and exhale slowly. Do this at least 5 times.
This helps lungs adapt to storing more oxygen and allows good gaseous exchange without getting breathless.;
, Another exercise involves controlling your muscles. Take a deep breathe, then close your eyes and hold it. The less you move, the longer you can hold your breathe for.


Try to count to 100 in your head. This may be difficult at first, so just hold your breath for as long as you can, then gradually increase your time., Hold your breath for 5 seconds and then exhale slowly. This helps to increase your lungs' muscle strength.


This also increases your inhaling capacity by allowing the alveoli (respiratory sacs) to coil and recoil., The best way for you to breathe is in through your nose with your mouth closed. This is important, because this will warm and moisturize the air you are breathing in.


Cold, dry air can trigger a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or asthma attack. Purse your lips as you breathe out.

Talk to your physician before starting an exercise routine.,
Determine how many repetitions you should be doing.,
Figure out how long you should be exercising for.,
Do warm-up exercises.,
Practice cardio exercises.,
Join water aerobics.,
Try exercising at high altitudes.,
Splash some water on your face while working out.,
Know when to take a break.,
Do cool down exercises.",How to Improve Lung Function2," The first thing you need to do is speak with your physician. Once he/she says you can begin an exercise program, keep in mind that it may take some time for you to reach your goals. Remember that consistency is the key to success.

, Count how many times you can perform an exercise before you feel somewhat out of breath.


For example, for leg-lifts start out with three and go from there if you do not feel winded. Once you feel a little winded, you have reached the number of repetitions you should begin with.
Then you can slowly move forward from that number. Again, remember if at any time you feel winded do not add any more leg-lifts.

, If an exercise relies on length of time rather than repetitions, make sure you have a watch or clock nearby so you can determine how long you can do the exercise for before becoming winded.


Once you have an idea, you can use an alarm/timer on your cell phone to time yourself. This is a great way to avoid looking at the clock continuously.
You will also be able to keep track of how well you are doing and know if you are ready to add a little more time.

, You need to warm-up before your exercises and then cool-down afterwards. This is a great time for stretching. Never bounce while you stretch. You just want to feel a slight pulling sensation, nothing too intense. Here are some good warm-up exercises you can do:


Shoulder shrugs: Sit up straight and slowly lift your shoulders up toward your ears. Slowly put your shoulders back down. Repeat 4 times.
Head turns: Sit up straight and slowly turn your head to the right, then slowly turn your head to the left, stopping in the center. Repeat 4 times.
Marching on the spot: Stand up straight and place your feet a hip width apart from one another. March in place for one minute.

, Doing an activity like cardio or aerobics can lead to a significant increase in lung capacity and stamina, due to the increased demand for oxygen. Any high intensity form of exercise performed for 30 minutes is recommended.Walking is a great form of aerobic exercise. You can use a treadmill or walk around your neighborhood
Ride a stationary bicycle
Take a water aerobics class at your local health club – this is especially beneficial for people with COPD and asthma because the air is usually warm and moist.
Go swimming at a local pool.

, Exercises done in water are very beneficial as the water provides resistance, increasing the workload Since more energy and oxygen is required, lung capacity increases., High altitude trekking or camping is another way to improvise lung capacity. Since higher altitudes have less oxygen, it becomes more difficult for the lungs to cope.


This causes a shift in the body's normal mechanism, therefore causing the red blood cells to hold as much as oxygen s they can by increasing the haemoglobin.
This helps in developing lung capacity.

, This slows your heart rate causing the lungs to oxygenate more blood, thereby increasing the capacity of the lungs.

, When you are performing any type of exercise, you should take a rest if you start to feel breathless. The ideal position is to sit in a chair that supports your shoulders and remain there until you are breathing normally again.

, Some effective cool down exercises include:


Chest stretch: Stand up straight and put your hands behind your back. Clasp your hands together. Pull your shoulders back while simultaneously pulling your elbows together.You should feel a slight stretch in your chest. If you feel more than a slight stretch, you are leaning too far back.
Backstretch:Sit down in a chair and clasp your hands together in front of you. Lean forward while arching your back like a cat. If you feel more than a slight stretch between your shoulder blades, you are leaning too far forward. Try to hold the stretch for 10 to 20 seconds.

Try tensing your stomach muscles.,
Practice blowing balloons.,
Try playing wind instruments like woodwind or brass instruments.",How to Improve Lung Function3," Lie down on the floor or bed with a pillow under your head or knee. Now place your right hand under your ribcage and your left hand on top of your ribcage.


Inhale through your nose slowly and try puffing your stomach. Tense your stomach muscles and exhale slowly through your mouth.
Three or four daily sessions of this exercise for up to 10 minutes is beneficial for lung function.

, Blowing balloons is a good activity for increasing lung capacity, as it forces the lungs to pump more air, exercising the and making them stronger.

, Playing these kinds of instruments will help you to control your breathing and expand your lung capacity. If you don't want to play an instrument, you could also try singing lessons, as singing has been proven to increase lung capacity."

Watch for symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs).,
Identify any kidney pain in older children.,
Look for dysfunctional urination.,
Look for other symptoms of bladder/bowel dysfunction (BBD).,
Be aware of birth defects.,
Check your family history for the presence of urinary reflux.,
Make an appointment with a doctor.,
Do a sonogram study of the kidneys and bladder.,
Have a catheter inserted for a bladder reflux test.,
Do a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).,
Use a radionuclide cystogram (RNC).,
Decide on a treatment.",How to Identify Urinary Reflux in Children," UTIs are a common sign of urinary reflux, so if your child has one or several UTIs, you should consider having him tested for VUR.


In infants and toddlers with urinary reflux, symptoms of UTIs include an unexplained fever, diarrhea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and irritability. You may also notice frequent urinating in small amounts, blood in the urine (hematuria), or cloudy, strong-smelling urine.
If your child is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher, contact your doctor. If your child is three months or older and has a fever of 102 °F (38.9 °C) or higher, contact your doctor.
Older children might experience similar signs, but can also communicate several others. These include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, and being hesitant to urinate or holding urine to avoid that burning sensation.Listen for other, less specific complaints from older children. These can include going to the bathroom more often, saying, ""It burns,"" or, ""It hurts,"" when urinating, or complaining of a stomachache.;
, Older kids with urinary reflux (as well as other UTIs) may also experience kidney pain. Kidney pain is felt as a pain on either side of the back, just beneath the lower ribs.

, Dysfunctional urination is a symptom of more serious urinary reflux. This can be an overactive bladder, a tendency to ""hold in"" urine, or the inability to release anything but a very weak stream of urine (particularly in boys). Your child may also be suffering from severe constipation (holding in stool).

, These may include having to urinate often or suddenly, long periods of time between bathroom visits, daytime wetting, and posturing to prevent wetting. Your child may also have pain in the penis or perineum (the area between the anus and genitals), constipation (fewer than two bowel movements in a week, and painful, large, or hard when they happen), bedwetting, or incontinence (the inability to hold stool in the colon and rectum)., One type of VUR is caused by an obstruction in the bladder. In some cases this is the result of surgery or injury. It is also common in children with spinal cord birth defects like spina bifida., VUR can be a genetic disease, so if the parents had it in the past, their children could develop it. If the mother had VUR in the past, as many as half of her children could have VUR.. Similarly, if one child has it, their siblings might, especially younger siblings. About 32% of siblings will develop the disease, and nearly 100% of identical twins.Some doctors will advise against the testing of siblings. They believe it is unnecessary to test kids who have not experienced UTI's or any other negative symptoms.

, If you suspect VUR, or just have evidence for a UTI, you will want to go to a doctor to get a diagnostic test and the best treatment options. When you visit the doctor, you should have information ready that will help him or her understand the situation better. It is a good practice to write this information down before going to the doctor.Information you should have includes:


Any signs or symptoms your child has, and for how long.
Your child's medical history, including recent health problems and general information.
Your family medical history, especially whether any of the child's close relatives (parents and siblings) have had VUR.
Any medications your child is currently taking, both prescription and over-the-counter, and how much they have taken.
Any other questions you might have for the doctor.
When you are at the appointment, don't be afraid to ask questions that occur to you. You want to find the right treatment for your child, so do everything you can to learn your child's condition, and what your options are.

, A sonogram uses very high frequency sound (ultrasound) to generate images, which avoids radiation exposure. The sonogram will not be able to identify the presence of urinary reflux in itself; however, it will reveal any damage to the bladder and kidneys caused by more severe reflux or any anatomical problems that may be associated with reflux.


This procedure is painless and safe, but it can be difficult to perform well if your child is uncooperative.
In children with urinary reflux, an ultrasound may reveal swollen, scarred or unusually small kidneys.
If the doctor wants to look at the bladder, it is important for it to be as full as possible. This can be difficult with babies and very young children. Let the technicians know the last time your child urinated. If it has been awhile, the doctor can try to do the bladder part of the study first before your child urinates. Older children often will be asked to urinate after the first part of the study, and take additional images after.

, The two most common and reliable tests for reflux require using a catheter, a thin flexible tube the doctor inserts into the bladder. Your child will be lying on her back on an examination table. The doctor will gently clean the area around the urethral opening with a special soap to minimize bacteria. Following this, a thin tube is slowly passed through the urethra into the bladder. When the tube is fully in the bladder, urine will begin to drain. The tube is secured with tape and the selected procedure is done.Since the tube is inserted into the opening of the urethra (where the urine exits the body), your child may be anxious or embarrassed. It can be reassuring if a parent is present during the procedure. A Child Life specialist may also be present to distract and help relax your child.
When having a bladder catheter inserted, there are several things that your child can do (if old enough) to help the tube pass as easily and comfortably as possible. Girls should place their legs in a frog leg or butterfly position with knees bent and feet touching. Boys should lie with their legs straight.
As the tube is passed, have your child slowly blow air out of the mouth with pursed lips like blowing bubbles or a pinwheel. This helps to relax the muscles that can tighten around the urethra, making it more difficult to pass the tube.

, After the bladder catheter has been inserted, you doctor may choose to test for the presence of urinary reflux using a VCUG. The doctor will fill the bladder with a solution that appears clear (like water) but can be seen using an x-ray. Once the bladder is full, the child is asked to urinate (while still lying down on the examination table) and the tube is pulled out. During the filling and emptying of the bladder, multiple x-ray images are taken. These images will be used to determine whether fluid in the bladder flows back towards the kidney.


When each picture is taken, you child must remain still for a few moments.

, Alternatively, your doctor may choose to do test for the presence of urinary reflux using an RNC. The doctor will fill the bladder with a solution containing a very small amount of a radioactive substance. Rather than an x-ray machine, the procedure uses a camera that detects tiny amounts of radiation. At the conclusion of the test, the bladder is emptied, the catheter removed, and a final picture taken. The location of the radiation will help your doctor to determine whether fluid from the bladder is flowing back towards the kidneys.


The camera is pretty big and is suspended over the child, close to, but not touching, the abdomen. Your child will need to hold still for a number of minutes while the camera detects the emitted radiation.

, Opinions vary on the best ways to treat VUR. These will depend on your individual child, and how much he or she is suffering. These can range from small doses of antibiotics to surgery, and depend on a variety of factors unique to your child.Bladder training by a medical professional is often helpful for children with urinary reflux.


Most mild cases will go away on their own, so your doctor may recommend doing nothing but observing for urinary tract infections. Your doctor may perform follow-up tests to make sure it goes away in time or does not cause any problems."

Understand that using spirulina for weight loss has not been verified as effective by the FDA.,
Know the nutritional content of spirulina.,
Be aware of the possible side effects of taking spirulina.,
Be aware that spirulina can be contaminated if it is not harvested correctly.",How to Improve Your Health with Spirulina," Your doctor can tell you whether the supplement will interact with any medications you may be taking. It is also good to let your doctor know what you are taking so that he or she doesn't prescribe you a medication in the future that will interact poorly with your supplements., Spirulina is a complete protein. This means that it contains all the amino acids needed by humans to make more protein., Spirulina contains a wide variety of vitamins. These include:


B Vitamins: Spirulina is particularly high in thiamin and riboflavin, and contains all the B vitamins except Vitamin B12. Spirulina contains a substance similar to Vitamin B12 called pseudovitamin B12, which is not active in humans.Spirulina contains significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, E, and K.
Minerals: Spirulina is particularly high in copper, iron, and manganese. It also contains significant amounts of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc and selenium.

, Some of the substances found in spirulina are very effective as antioxidants.These antioxidants can limit exercise-induced muscle damage and increase endurance.Antioxidants can also decrease inflammatory markers and allergic disorders, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis).Antioxidants can also potentially prevent pre-cancerous oral lesions from becoming cancer., Spirulina seems to drive the increased production of nitric oxide, a vascular dilator. This can significantly bring down high blood pressure.Higher doses of spirulina (about 1 tablespoon per day) appear to be needed for this kind of effect.

, Spirulina may be useful in the treatment of viral diseases such as hepatitis C and influenza. This is because of its immune-promoting properties., There are a number of benefits of spirulina both as a nutritional supplement and as an aid to weight loss. For most of these benefits, 1-4 grams of spirulina a day (about ½ tablespoon) is sufficient.


Many people take spirulina in pill form. You can take approximately four to six 500mg pills of spirulina spread out throughout the day., Eating these types of foods can help you to lose weight. The glycemic load of spirulina is 10, making it a low glycemic food. This is why spirulina is recommended for those with diabetes.


1 cup of spirulina contains 325 calories, with 30% of calories derived from carbohydrates, 48% from protein and 22% from fats.
1 cup of spirulina contains 4 grams of dietary fiber.
Spirulina has also been shown to be effective in reducing blood sugar levels and the levels of A1c, a biomarker used to follow blood sugar control in people with diabetes., This is an important goal for your health that is connected to weight loss as well. Spirulina provides nutrients that can decrease LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and raise HDL-cholesterol. This provides protection against heart disease.In addition, the antioxidants in spirulina have been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation, a marker for heart disease and fatty liver disease., Spirulina has been promoted as a weight loss aid, but the FDA has declared that is is ineffective for weight loss. This means that nothing in the spirulina can induce weight loss.However, because spirulina has a low glycemic index, is relatively low in calories, is highly nutritious, and allows you to feel fuller for a longer periods of time.
Taking a ½-1 tablespoon of spirulina before meals (usually about 1 hour before) can result in significant weight loss especially when combined with increased physical activity.
In fact, spirulina is used in many areas of the world to treat malnutrition., This is important information to know for any supplement you want to take. One cup (112 grams) of spirulina contains:64 grams of protein
9 grams of fat
0 mg Cholesterol
3 grams of saturated fat
2.3 grams of PUFA (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids) including 922 mg omega-3 fats and 1404 mg of omega-6 fats.
27 grams of carbohydrate

, There are theoretical possibilities that spirulina may boost the immune system and should be avoided by anyone with an autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among others. In addition, drugs which suppress the immune system interact with spirulina.


These medications include: azathioprine (Imuran), basiliximab (Simulect), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), daclizumab (Zenapax), muromonab-CD3 (OKT3, Orthoclone OKT3), mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), sirolimus (Rapamune), prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone), corticosteroids (glucocorticoids), and others.Since spirulina is a complete protein, it also contains an amino acid, phenylalanine, which may make a condition such as phenylketonuria (PKU) worse., Like other blue-green algae, spirulina can be contaminated by microcystins, which are toxic substances that people should not ingest. Spirulina can also absorb heavy metals from the environment, which you will then absorb when you eat it.To avoid taking contaminated spirulina, you should only buy it from a reputable brand. Ask at your local natural food store what brands are best and most well regarded.

Ask your doctor before making changes to your diet.,
Limit your intake of soy if you are taking hormones or have hypothyroidism.Soy can inhibit absorption of your thyroid hormones if taken too close to a dose of medication.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Include a moderate amount of lean protein.,
Take a supplement that contains zinc, selenium, and vitamin D. All three are necessary for healthy thyroid function and taking these supplements may even improve thyroid function in some people.Find a multivitamin that contains 100% (and no more than 100%) of your recommended daily allowance of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D.



Zinc.,
Reduce your iodine intake if you are scheduled for radioactive iodine uptake or therapy.",How to Improve Thyroid Function1," No diet has been proven to improve thyroid function or treat a thyroid problem.Making drastic changes to your diet or adding supplements may cause more problems, so be sure to check with your doctor before you do anything, especially if you take thyroid medication. If you take thyroid medication, avoid taking it along with:Walnuts
Cottonseed meal
Soy flour
Iron or calcium containing supplements
Antacids
Ulcer medication
Cholesterol-lowering drugs;
, In addition, eating too many products that contain soy can also cause problems for someone who has borderline hypothyroidism.


You can still eat soy in moderation, but do not make it part of your daily diet.If you use soymilk as a replacement for dairy milk, then try replacing soy milk with rice, almond, coconut, or hemp milk.
Soy is fine for people with hyperthyroidism.

, Fruits and vegetables are a healthy addition to any diet. Make sure that you eat a variety of different fruits and vegetables. You can eat fruits and vegetables that are either fresh, frozen, or canned., Even though nearly all animal products contain iodine in moderate to high levels, you will still need to get some protein in your diet. Avoid processed meats and choose fresh cuts of meat instead.Try to include a serving of lean protein every day, such as:


Skinless chicken or turkey
Lean cuts of beef
Pork tenderloin

, Adult men require 11 milligrams and adult women require 9 milligrams of zinc per day.Selenium. Adult men and women require 55 micrograms of selenium per day.Do not take more than 200 micrograms per day.Vitamin D. Adult men and women up to 70 years old need 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D every day. Men and women older than 70 require 800 IUs (20 micrograms) of vitamin D every day.Do not take any iodine supplements. Whether you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, anyone with thyroid problems should not take iodine supplements., It may be necessary for you to follow a low-iodine diet for a couple of weeks if you are going to have this procedure.Many foods contain iodine, but some contain high amounts and you will need to watch your intake of these foods. Foods to limit or avoid include:Fish and shellfish
Dairy products
Iodized salt
Anything that contains carrageenan, agar-agar, alginate, nori, iodate dough conditioners, and FD&C red dye #3
Eggs and products that contain eggs (egg whites are okay)

Exercise with caution.,
Sleep more.,
Relax.",How to Improve Thyroid Function2," If you have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and you do not exercise, then you may want to include some daily activity such as walking or riding a bike to stimulate your metabolism. Talk to your doctor about when it might be safe to begin working out. Due to the changes to your metabolism, you will need to wait until your medication has stabilized your condition before you jump into physical activity.


Those with hyperthyroidism should also be cautious about starting an exercise routine, because their metabolism is already running at high speed. Adding in exercise can lead to heart failure.Again, talk to your doctor about when it is safe for you to begin working out.
If your doctor approves then you might want to aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week. You can get this amount by exercising for 30 minutes on five days of the week.Try walking, biking, swimming, dancing, skiing, or whatever physical activity you prefer.

, If you have an overactive thyroid, then getting enough sleep can be a problem.If you have an underactive thyroid, then you may feel like you never get enough sleep due to the fatigue that the condition causes.Try to get the recommended amount of sleep each night to support your body’s processes.


Adults require about seven and a half to nine hours of sleep every night.If you feel like you are not getting enough sleep, then try to sleep for an extra hour each night and see if that helps.
Try to go to bed at the same time every night and make sure that you allow yourself enough time to get at least seven and a half hours of sleep every night., Although the link is uncertain, stress may contribute to poor thyroid function.Stress can also contribute to other health problems, so it is important to learn how to manage the stress in your life.Some good ways to manage your stress include:


Deep breathing
Yoga
Meditation
Journaling
Engaging in hobbies

See a doctor if you are concerned about your thyroid function.,
Take your medications as directed.",How to Improve Thyroid Function3," If you have been experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism then see your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can order a simple blood test to determine whether or not there is an issue with your thyroid.Signs of hypothyroidism include: fatigue, steady weight gain, feeling cold when it is warm, thinning hair, dry skin, excessive fatigue, swelling of the legs, joint pain or swelling, elevated blood cholesterol, constipation, impaired memory, low heart rate (under 60 beats per minute), severe depression, and puffy face.Signs of hyperthyroidism include: sudden weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, sweating, severe anxiety, insomnia, and irritability.

, If you have a thyroid condition then your doctor will prescribe medications to help you feel better. Make sure that you take your medications as directed and ask your doctor if you are having any problems from taking the medications. Your doctor may need to adjust the dosage.


Keep in mind that not treating thyroid disease can lead to more severe problems, such as infertility, nerve damage, heart problems, and goiter.If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor may prescribe thyroid hormone therapy.If you have hyperthyroidism, you may take radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. Beta-blockers may be used to help control side effects of hyperthyroidism, like rapid heart rate and palpitations."

Understand what differentiates pre-diabetes from full diabetes.,
Understand the risk factors for developing pre-diabetes.",How to Identify Pre Diabetes Symptoms," Two of the most noticeable symptoms of pre-diabetes are increased hunger and increased thirst. Pre-diabetes causes you to urinate more frequently, resulting in a loss of fluids. This loss of fluids leads to increased thirst.


In addition, the loss of fluid makes it harder for your blood to transport energy (in the form of glucose) to the body's cells. You will find yourself eating larger quantities of food and feeling hungry more frequently, as your body tries to compensate for this lack of energy.;
, One of the mot obvious symptoms of pre-diabetes is increased urination, which may develop abruptly.This happens as a result of the increased blood glucose levels, as not all of the glucose can be reabsorbed into the blood stream. This causes higher levels of glucose in urine, which draws water from the blood and results in increased urination.People with pre-diabetes may have a daily urine output from 4 liters (1.1 US gal) to as much as 30 liters (7.9 US gal). Another way to confirm pre-diabetes is to look for high levels of glucose in the urine.

, When the body loses large amounts of fluid (due to increased urination) the blood is unable to transport the necessary energy to the body's cell, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. As a result, pre-diabetes patients may find themselves feeling constantly tired and out of energy.

, When blood sugar levels are high for a long time, body water may be pulled into the eye lenses, causing them to swell. This leads to impaired vision in a condition know as diabetic retinopathy. It is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. , When blood glucose is poorly controlled, blood vessels throughout the body begin to function abnormally and undergo structural changes that result in inadequate blood supply to the extremities. This leads to pain and numbness in the hands and feet.


The pain is sharp and stinging while the numbness can be described as tingling or a funny feeling in the affected area.
The decreased blood flow can also prevent wounds from healing properly, which is another sign of pre-diabetes.

, One of the complications of diabetes is ""autonomic neuropathy"", which can cause impotence among male patients. Autonomic neuropathy causes damage to the nerves and arteries in the genital area, which interferes with the blood flow necessary for an erection., Also known as a HbA1C test, the glycosylated hemoglobin test is performed to diagnose pre-diabetes and diabetes with no fasting required. It is used to measure the average blood glucose level in the body over a period of two to three months.


A1C results of 5.7% to 6.4% usually lead to a diagnosis of pre-diabetes, while a result of 6.5% or higher confirms the presence of diabetes.

, A fasting plasma glucose test is performed after the patient has been fasting (not eating or drinking) for eight hours. During this test, a blood sample is taken, then the plasma is separated from the blood and mixed with a variety of other substances to test the level of glucose.


Blood glucose levels of 100-125 mg/dl indicate the presence of pre-diabetes, as blood glucose is high, but not high enough to classify as diabetes.
Blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dl or higher indicate the presence of type 2 diabetes of diabetes mellitus. This means that the body can’t produce a sufficient amount of insulin, develops a resistance to insulin, or can’t utilize insulin properly.

, An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is done to gauge the patient's ability to handle a specific quantity of glucose. First, a sample of the blood is taken and tested for glucose levels. Then, two hours later, the patient is asked to drink a large beverage containing a pre-measured quantity of glucose. Another blood sample is taken and tested, and the two samples are compared to determine how well the body processed the glucose.


A blood glucose level of 140-199 mg/dl will usually result in a diagnosis of pre-diabetes. This means that the blood glucose level is relatively high, but is not high enough to classify as diabetes. However, pre-diabetes still increases the patient's risk of developing type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease.
A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher is an indication of type 2 diabetes or diabetes mellitus. This means that the body can’t produce sufficient amounts of insulin, has developed a resistance to insulin or can’t utilize insulin properly. People with this condition are more likely to suffer from heart disease and stroke.

, The glycemic index is a scale used to measure the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels. To reverse pre-diabetes, it is important to eat foods with a low glycemic index —as this limits fluctuations in blood glucose levels, helping to stabilize blood sugar.


Low GI foods include vegetables like avocados, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, spinach, mushrooms, fruit like apples, bananas, grapes and berries, seeds like flaxseeds and sesame seeds and nuts like almonds, cashews and walnuts.
You can also eat most seafoods, pasture-raised poultry and grass-fed meats, and grains such as oats, bran, brown rice, quinoa, rye, buckwheat, barley and wholewheat.
Stay away from foods with a high glycemic value, such as white potatoes, white breads and bagels, white rice, pretzels, popcorn, saltine crackers, cornflakes, melon and pineapple.

, Try to limit your fat intake to about 25% of your total daily calorie intake. Within this, saturated and trans fats should only make up less than 10% of energy intake.


To reduce your fat intake, consider buying leaner meats (such as chicken, turkey and lean cuts of pork or beef such as sirloin or chuck roast) and lower fat dairy products (like low-fat or skim milk and yogurt).
Also, reduce serving sizes of main courses, meat, desserts, and other foods high in fat.

, Limit your salt intake to less than 2,300 milligrams each day — this equates to approximately one teaspoon of salt.


Try to avoid adding extra salt to your food — use herbs and spices to flavor your food instead. Always check the labels on food items to see how much salt has been added.
To cut down on the sodium levels in canned vegetables, drain the can and rinse the veg in fresh water before preparing.

, Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat at every meal, as this will help you to feel full and make you less inclined to eat unhealthier foods that cause a spike in your blood sugar. At least half your plate should be filled with fruit and veg at every meal.


Try starting meals with a salad or a broth or tomato- based soup with lots of vegetables. This helps you eat more good-for-you veggies while filling you up before you get to the higher fat and calorie courses.
Remember that fresh fruits and vegetables are usually healthier than canned or frozen.

, Sodas and candy contain high levels of sugar, which causes a spike in your blood glucose levels and makes you much more likely to develop diabetes. Try to cut these items from your diet as much as possible by switching to healthy snacks and flavored waters instead.

, Your weight affects your health in many ways. Being overweight can lead to high blood pressure and prevent your making and using insulin properly, leading to type 2 diabetes.


Therefore, losing just 5 to 10 % of your total body weight can help reduce your risk of heart disease and reverse pre-diabetes. You can effectively lose weight through a combination of regular exercise and eating a healthy diet.
Some tips to help your weight loss along include keeping a food journal where you log the quantity and type of food you eat each day. This helps you to identify problem areas and stay on track. You should also try eating your food off a smaller plate — this tricks your brain into thinking you've eaten more than you actually have.

, Regular exercise is essential in reversing pre-diabetes — it helps you to lose weight; keeps your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels under control; and helps your body to use insulin. Try to exercise for 30 minutes a day, five times per week.


Try to find a form of exercise that you enjoy doing, as this will help you to feel much more motivated. It doesn't matter what the activity is, whether it's running, rowing, dancing or kickboxing, as long as it gets the blood pumping and your heart rate up.
You can also introduce more physical activity to your everyday life, using several simple tricks. Try taking the stairs instead of the elevator, getting off the bus several stops before your destination and walking the rest of the way, or parking your car far away from the entrance of the grocery store.

, In medical terms, pre-diabetes is known as either “impaired glucose tolerance” or “impaired fasting glucose.” It is a condition where the level of glucose in the blood is higher than its normal limit, but is not high enough to qualify as diabetes proper.


Individuals diagnosed with pre-diabetes are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and are at an increased risk of developing heart disease. However, the good news is that pre-diabetes can be reversed if the affected individual shifts to a healthier lifestyle.To confirm a diagnoses of pre-diabetes, your doctor will perform a blood glucose test. People with blood glucose levels of 100-125 mg/dl have ""impaired fasting glucose"", while people with levels between 140-199 mg/dl after an oral glucose tolerance test are said to have ""impaired glucose tolerance"".
People with serious diabetes usually have a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dl or greater. However, this diagnosis can only be confirmed if the same result is achieved in two separate tests., People who conform to certain risk factors have a higher chance of developing pre-diabetes. People with these risk factors may have pre-diabetes even if they don't display any obvious symptoms. The risk factors are divided into two types; modifiable (or reversible) and non-modifiable.



Modifiable risk factors: These include things like being overweight, having a sedentary lifestyle, being centrally obese, having high blood pressure (140/90mmHg or higher), having a HDL cholesterol level of 35 mg/dl or lower and/or a triglyceride level of 250 mg/dl or higher.

Non-modifiable risk factors:' These include things like being 45 years of age or older, having a family history of diabetes, being pregnant or suffering from gestational diabetes, belonging to certain ethnic groups (African-American, Asian American, Hispanic American or Native American) which are predisposed to developing pre-diabetes."

Share your emotional concerns as well as your physical health concerns.One key element of a great doctor-patient relationship is the comfort level you feel sharing your emotional concerns.,
Create joint health goals and accountability with your doctor.All too many people leave the doctor's office with a diagnosis and treatment plan, but feeling very much alone in terms of the support they receive implementing these new health and treatment strategies in their life.,
Let your doctor know about areas where he or she is not meeting your needs.It is important to express to your doctor exactly what you are looking to get out of the doctor-patient relationship.",How to Improve Your Doctor Patient Relationship1," For many people, the emotional concerns that surround the physical health problems may be the most distressing - things like wondering how a certain disease or condition may affect your quality of life, your quantity of life, your ability to do the things you love, or simply your ability to function in day-to-day life.


Doctors are trained to address the emotional issues that may surround your health concerns, so it is okay to open up to your doctor about your underlying fears and the emotions you are feeling around a diagnosis.
The emotional component is often very high on patients' list when they rate the quality of their doctor-patient relationship.
Do not underestimate the importance of this, as having a doctor who can address your emotional concerns in addition to your physical ones offers a much more holistic approach to your overall health and wellness.;
, One of the hallmarks of a great doctor-patient relationship is feeling inspired and motivated by your physician, and feeling a positive energy and sense of accountability with him or her.


Studies have shown that people with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or related conditions (including high blood pressure, obesity, and high cholesterol), have better health outcomes when they share a positive relationship and a sense of accountability with their physician that helps to motivate them to achieve their health-related goals.The benefit of a positive doctor-patient relationship has been shown to be equivalent to a prescription medication, in terms of the difference it makes in health outcomes!

, Some things on your wish list may not be possible to attain, due to the limited timeframe that doctors have available for each visit. However, you can communicate that the basics of understanding you as a person and providing emotional support around the challenges you may be facing with your health is important to you.


After communicating your needs and desires, if you feel that your doctor-patient relationship remains unsatisfactory and is unlikely to improve, you can search for a new doctor.
Everyone deserves to feel that their health care is of the highest quality in all areas, not just physically, but also emotionally.
Your doctor is someone that you are trusting your life to, so it is key that he or she is someone with whom you share a positive relationship.

Prepare for your appointment.If you want to optimize the help you can receive from your doctor in one visit, and also improve your relationship with your physician, it helps to come to your appointment prepared.,
Prioritize your problems.One of the major challenges for both doctors and patients is the limited time that your doctor has to spend with you during one appointment.,
Take notes during the appointment.Oftentimes, a lot of important information can be covered during a doctor's visit, and it may be hard to remember it after the fact.",How to Improve Your Doctor Patient Relationship2," If you have recently been hospitalized or received care from another physician for any reason, bring the medical records with you so that your doctor can review these and be fully up to date with any medical care you have received. Also bring with you a full list of your medications, including doses as well as the reason you are taking each medication. Finally, you will want to ensure that your doctor is aware of your complete medical history, including any past surgeries, any past hospitalizations, and any ongoing chronic health conditions that you are experiencing.


Depending on how long you have known your physician, he or she may already have this information on file; however, if not, it is important to be organized and to present all of it upfront.
Also, write down all of the information regarding your current health concern in an organized way before your appointment. It can be frustrating for both you and your doctor if this information is not readily available, or if you forget important details because you were not prepared. This, in turn, can take away from the quality of your doctor-patient relationship.

, In order to maximize what can be achieved in one visit, and to in turn achieve the highest level of satisfaction for both you and your doctor, it is important to prioritize your problems before arriving for your appointment and to let your doctor know right away what issues you have. It is ideal if you can bring a numbered list with your concerns listed on it, if you have more than one. Show this list to your doctor when you arrive, and ask him or her how many issues can be covered in one visit.


This is important first of all because it allows your doctor to identify what he or she deems to be the most concerning issue first, and not to let something that could potentially be hazardous to your health slip under the radar.
It also allows your doctor to know ahead of time what issues there are so that he or she can cover as many as possible during one visit.
If you have lots to cover, it is important to respect your doctor's timeline and to book a second appointment if everything cannot be covered all at once.Having this respect for your doctor's timeline will help your him or her to be through and complete in the issues covered during this visit. It will also allow him or her to relax, knowing that the rest of your issues can be addressed in subsequent visits.

, It can be frustrating for both doctors and patients to have important instructions missed for this reason. If you bring a pen and paper to your appointment and write down important instructions, it can help to maximize the benefit you obtain from the visit, as well as allowing your physician to feel effective and valued in their advice and recommendations.


You can bring a family member to your appointment to take notes for you, if this helps.
It may be especially helpful to bring a family member if the appointment is discussing an emotional issue, such as relaying a challenging diagnosis, or planning treatment for a condition such as cancer.
When your emotions are heightened, it can be much more challenging to remember details after the fact; for this reason, having a family member or a friend present can help.

Research doctors in your area who are accepting new patients.The first step in finding yourself a family doctor is to research which doctors in your area are accepting new patients.,
Consider whether that physician's schedule is a good fit for you.You should be able to find out by making a simple call to the receptionist at the doctor's office whether the physician's office hours work for you, as well as to confirm that your insurance is valid at the practice.,
Empower yourself to seek out the qualities you are looking for.",How to Improve Your Doctor Patient Relationship3," Depending upon your location, this may be a hard task or an easy task. It depends on the amount of doctors practicing there compared to the amount of patients looking to find a family physician. You may have plenty of options available, or you may struggle to find a family physician who is currently accepting new patients.


You can look on the Internet to research family doctors who are accepting new patients in your area.

, Different clinics are operated in different ways, and it is important to find one that works well with your schedule and lifestyle.

, If you are seeking a new family doctor because you do not feel that the relationship with your current doctor meets the standards you are hoping for, it is important to actively seek out the qualities you are looking for. Many family doctors will offer a first appointment as a ""meet and greet,"" which gives both you and the doctor a chance to connect and to see if the two of you will be a good fit for a professional healthcare relationship moving forwards.


During this initial visit, you can bring up the aspects of a doctor-patient relationship that are important to you.
You can use this visit to assess whether or not the new doctor is likely to be a good fit for you.

Have more fruits and veggies around the house.,
Use less meat in home-cooked meals.,
Get whole-grain bread and noodles.,
Eat less of the nutrient poor foods.,
Reduce saturated and trans fats.,
Serve healthy fats.,
Check labels for sodium content.,
Check labels for sugar content.,
Monitor your blood pressure.,
Don’t smoke.,
Practice stress reduction and relaxation techniques to keep your heart healthy.",How to Improve Your Family's Heart Health1," Fruits and vegetables are vital parts of a healthy and nutritious diet. Not only do they provide plenty of vitamins and minerals that support heart health, they provide filling fiber. Since fruits and veggies are also low in calories and have lots of flavor, they make for great snacks.Wash and cut veggies and keep in them your fridge for a quick and easy snack.
Keep fruit on your counter so it will catch a snack-seeker’s attention. Draw silly faces on bananas or citrus fruit to make them even more appealing.
If you do get canned options, make sure to select low-sodium vegetables and fruits that are packed in either their own juice or water.;
, Preparing and eating meals at home is one of the easiest ways to cut down on unhealthy ingredients. However, many people are used to cooking and serving meat as the main course in family meals, which is not the healthiest option for your family’s heart health.Vegetable or legume-based dishes should be prominently featured in home cooked meals. Beans in particular contain plenty of protein and fiber with much less fat, and are a great alternative to meat.
A veggie stir-fry, for instance, can often please the whole family, and a fruit salad makes for a great side.
Add more vegetables to your meat dishes as well.

, Bread and pasta are staples in many family kitchens. While high-fiber options tend to be healthy for your heart, others can actually hinder your health. In particular, choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain bread, or loaves that list whole-wheat flour as their first ingredient.Lean towards whole grain pasta and other whole grain options like brown rice, barley, and buckwheat.
Have your kids help you pick things like cereal and crackers. Show them how to check nutritional labels and give them tasks like, ""Find a box that has at least 5 grams of fiber per serving.""
In general, try to avoid heavily-processed, low fiber foods. The less sugar the better.

, Nutrient poor foods are those that are high in calories and fat, but that contain less nutritional value. Examples include sodas, potato chips, cookies, crackers, and candy. Try to avoid or severely limit these nutrient poor foods., Saturated and trans fats significantly contribute to your cholesterol levels, and thus you and your family’s risk of heart complications. While eating some saturated fats is allowable, try to avoid trans fats entirely. Red meat is one of the most common contributors to saturated fat consumption, as are dairy products.More specifically, check the nutritional labels of the food you’re buying. No more than 14 grams of saturated fats or 2 grams of trans fat should be eaten daily.
If your household does consume meat, lean towards low-fat, high-protein options, such as chicken.
As a rule of thumb, only purchase meats with less than 10% fat and trim visible fat off cuts of meat before cooking it.
Always select low-fat dairy options, such as fat-free milk or yogurt.
Always check the label on packaged food. Trans fat can hide in some unlikely foods, such as crackers.

, Monounsaturated fats, such as those in olive oil, and polyunsaturated fats, such as those in avocados, nuts and seeds, and some fish, are actually great for your heart. While all fats are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation, these types of fats can actually help lower your cholesterol.Get in the habit of cooking with olive oil or another oil high in mono/poly-saturated fats instead of butter.
Flax is especially healthy for your heart. You can use the oil to cook with, or simply eat the seeds with low-fat yogurt, low-sugar applesauce, or whole-grain oats.
Try to serve cold-water fish like salmon or mackerel once a week for family meals, and have more nuts around for snacking in between meals.

, Many people consume too much sodium, which can raise blood pressure and contribute to heart disease. Note that you should be eating no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. That amount is present in about a teaspoon of salt. Fortunately, it’s easier to reduce sodium consumption than you may think.Try seasoning food with herbs and spices instead of salt. Watch out for mixed seasonings though; salt is often a main ingredient.
Avoid canned, processed, or packaged foods whenever possible. When you do purchase these types of foods, opt for low-sodium options.
Note that frozen meals and pizzas are especially high in sodium content.
Be sure to check condiments too, which also often come in low-sodium options.

, Steering clear of added sugars is also a god strategy for improving your family’s heart health. Check labels on the products you buy and pass on any items that include high amounts of sugar. Try to stick with products with no added sugar or that have a very low amount. The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 6 teaspoons (100 calories worth) of added sugar per day and men consume no more than 9 teaspoons (150 calories worth) of sugar per day., Getting your family’s blood pressures taken regularly is a good way to monitor your heart health progress. You can visit a blood pressure monitoring station at a drug store, or get your blood pressure taken at your doctor’s office. You can even purchase a blood pressure monitor to use at home., Smoking is bad for your heart and it can lead to serious complications such as heart attacks and strokes. It can also damage the structures in your heart and reduce the functioning of your blood vessels.If you or anyone in your family is a smoker, then do what you can to quit. Talk with your doctor to find out about smoking cessation options that may help you and/or your family members., Managing your stress is another important part of keeping a healthy heart.Be sure to make time for stress reduction in your daily routine. Set aside at least 15 minutes per day to meditate, breathe deeply, or do some yoga."

Do physical activities as a family.,
Limit everyone’s screen time.,
Encourage family members to address weight issues.",How to Improve Your Family's Heart Health2," Physical activities, especially “cardio” activities, can help improve your family’s heart health in all sorts of ways. While there are different specific guidelines for people of different ages, doing physical activities as a family is good for everyone.


More specifically, children need an hour or more of aerobic activity every day, including vigorous exercise three days a week. Adults can get by with a bit less activity, but keeping up with the kids as much as you can will help keep your own heart young and healthy too.
Examples of moderate aerobic activity that you may enjoy as a family include walking quickly, riding a bicycle, and light hiking.
Examples of vigorous aerobic activity you may enjoy together include team sports that involve running, jogging, swimming, and hiking with elevation changes.
The American Heart Association recommends to aim for 30 minutes of walking a day., Many modern entertainment options utilize a screen. Chances are, people in your family spend plenty of time on television, internet, and/or video games. It’s important to limit the time spent this way, as largely sedentary lifestyles are unhealthy, and can contribute to conditions that put the heart at risk.


Set specific time limits for the amount of time everyone is allowed to spend staring at screens at home - including yourself.
Avoid using “screen time” as a reward, or withholding it as a penalty. It’s better to treat activities that feature a screen less attention all around.
When you do watch television, watch it together. Incorporate physical activity by challenging each other to do pushups, crunches, or stretches while watching, perhaps during commercials. Even better: during montages, get up and dance or jog in place with your kids.

, People who are overweight are at higher risk of many conditions that can contribute to heart disease. If you or someone else in your family is overweight, encourage them to address their physical condition and offer to join them in changing their behavior.


Folks hoping to lose weight need to exercise with moderate intensity for sixty to ninety minutes everyday.
Say things like, ""Let's start taking walks before or after dinner every night. We both need to stay serious about getting some physical activity every day, and it'd be great to get some evening fresh air too.""

Get informed about your family history.,
Breastfeed children for their first year.,
Do not allow smoking in your home.,
Drink alcohol in moderation.",How to Improve Your Family's Heart Health3," One of the numerous important factors that contribute to heart health is your genetics. In particular, it’s important to know if your family has a history of heart diseases, as this predisposition can inform the decisions you make about you and your family’s health moving forward.Speak with your parents and grandparents about any health conditions they have, including things like high blood pressure.
Similarly, inform your own and your children’s doctor about any heart conditions that run in your family. The more your healthcare providers know about your genetic heritage, the better they can help advise you about your family’s health.

, Your own as well as your children’s cardiovascular health can be strengthened by breastfeeding. Not only do breastfed children grow up with a smaller chance of developing some heart conditions, they are also less likely to develop conditions that lead to other health complications.Feed your baby exclusively with breastmilk for the first six months. Continue to include breastmilk in their diet until they are about a year old.

, Smoking significantly and immediately damages your own cardiovascular system, as well as that of anyone you smoke around. People who are exposed to secondhand smoke are as much as 30% more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Even brief exposure can have serious effects upon your own or others' heart health.If you or a guest smokes, have them do so outside and away from open windows or doors.

, Having a drink now and then is okay for most healthy adults, but drinking in excess can lead to serious health problems like high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity. If you do drink, make sure that you limit yourself to no more than one drink a day if you are a woman, or up to two drinks per day if you are a man."

Factor in your age and gender.",How to Identify Lung Cancer Symptoms," One of the most common symptoms of lung cancer is a cough that does not go away. See a doctor if your cough lasts more than two weeks, if it increases in intensity over time, or if you cough up blood (this is called hemoptysis) or a lot of phlegm.


Ironically, smokers, who have the highest risk of lung cancer, tend to cough a lot and, consequently, do not seek treatment for this most common symptom. If you smoke, be aware of any changes in your cough, and meet with your doctor regularly. Consider getting checked for lung cancer every couple of months
You’ll also want to note any changes in the character of the cough. You should be worried if, for example, a dry cough suddenly starts producing a lot of sputum. Likewise, you should be worried if the color of your sputum changes. In particular, keep an eye out for chocolatey brown, black, or greenish sputum.;
, Shortness of breath (dyspnea) is a common symptom of lung cancer, but it is often attributed to obesity, old age, or weather changes. See a physician if you are having trouble breathing, especially if your shortness of breath occurs outside of any strenuous activity.


In some cases, a lung cancer patient will feel back pain that worsens the deeper that they breathe in.

, Dull and persistent aching in your chest, shoulders, or arms could be an early symptom of lung cancer. This discomfort might progress to include tingling, numbness, and even paralysis.

, If you have multiple episodes of bronchitis or pneumonia, talk to your doctor about the possibility of cancer. Tumors can obstruct your airways and make you prone to these kinds of infections.

, Lung cancer, like other cancers, can cause a loss of appetite. If you notice your appetite has diminished, make an appointment with your doctor.

, Cancer cells use an inordinate amount of your body’s energy and can affect your metabolism, leading to weight loss. This is sometimes exacerbated by the loss of appetite some patients experience. If you lose ten pounds suddenly or without dieting, consult a doctor.

, All cancers can produce fatigue, but the symptom is so vague that it does not always prompt people to seek treatment. If you have risk factors for lung cancer or have any other symptoms, or if your fatigue is pronounced, see your doctor immediately.

, When lung cancer advances, tumors can hurt the vocal cords and obstruct the air passages, sometimes leading to hoarseness and wheezing.

, When a tumor advances into the esophagus, it can cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).

, Tumors can interrupt nerve supplies and make you feel weak. This may lead to tingling sensations, numbness, or even paralysis.

, Fluid accumulation in the lungs (pleural effusion) can be a consequence of lung cancer.

, If you notice that your skin or eyes are looking yellow, you may have jaundice. When lung cancer spreads, it can affect the digestive system and, specifically, the liver, producing this condition.

, Pressure from a tumor on the chest vein can lead to swelling in the neck, arms, and face.


In addition to this swelling, this pressure can also cause drooping eyelids, with one pupil becoming smaller than the other.

, In advanced cases of lung cancer, the cancer may spread to the bones, leading to pain and possible fractures. Unexplained pain or fractures definitely require a full medical work-up.

, When lung cancer spreads to the brain or compresses the superior vena cava (a large vein that supplies blood to the heart), it can cause headache, blurred vision, paralysis, and seizures. These are serious medical problems that require a doctor’s intervention immediately.

, Lung tumors secrete hormones and can produce symptoms that seem unrelated to the lungs. These include:


Palpitations and tremors
Puffiness in the face
A bloated appearance
Enlargement of the breasts in males (gynaecomastia)

, Lung cancer can also produce a high fever and a change in the shape of your fingernails. If you notice these or any other unexplained symptoms, especially if you have other symptoms or carry a high risk, see a doctor.

, People who have smoked for a long time or who smoke more than two packs of cigarettes per day have a much higher risk of developing lung cancer. Chewing tobacco and snuff also increase your risk.

, Even if you do not smoke yourself, frequent contact with second-hand smoke increases your risk considerably, especially if you live with a smoker.

, If you have had radiation to treat other cancers, your risk of developing lung cancer goes up. In general, though, under these circumstances, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

, Gasoline fumes, diesel fumes, mustard gas, vinyl chloride, and coal products may increase your risk of developing lung cancer. This factor explains why people in certain jobs have higher incidences of the disease.


Exposure to other chemicals, including arsenic, chromium, and asbestos, may also make you more susceptible to lung cancer. These chemicals are mostly impossible to sense, however, and so are difficult to avoid.

, If you have a relative who has been diagnosed with lung cancer, you may also have a higher risk.

, Lung cancer rates increase with age, with people over 60 carrying the highest risk. Men develop lung cancer more frequently than women do.

Fit yourself with a proper vest.,
Balance the vest.,
Wear your vest around the house.,
Increase your weight over time.,
Walk a balance beam.,
Engage in cardio exercise.,
Try some weight training.,
Practice normal movements, if you wear the vest for medical reasons.,
Have your doctor evaluate you for cardiovascular problems.,
Find out if you have any muscular-skeletal problems.,
Consult a specialist.",How to Improve Balance with a Weighted Vest," To get used to a weighted vest, you need to get an appropriate vest for yourself. Ultimately, you want to get a vest that can carry more weight than you’ll need in the beginning. You’ll also need a vest that is suited for your objectives.


If you will be wearing a vest for medical reasons, embracing the goals of weight or endurance training may help you achieve your primary goal.
If you also have a goal of endurance training, you may need a weight vest that can hold 10% or more of your weight.
If you also have the goal of strength training, you may need a weight vest that can hold 20% or more of your weight.
Make sure you get a vest that is rated for whatever activities you’ll be doing. For instance, some vests allow a much greater range of arm movement – these are good for weight lifting. Others offer less, and may provide extra support for runners or walkers with skeletal-muscular problems.
Make sure the vest is comfortable.;
, After fitting yourself, you should take some steps to balance the weight on the vest. Ultimately, you’ll want to adjust it and the weight on it so you’ll be comfortable and balanced.


Try to evenly distribute weight throughout the vest. If you put 10 lbs. on one side, put 10 lbs. on the other.
Use just a little bit of weight at first. Consider 5% or less of your total weight. For a 200-lb. person, this would be 10 lbs. or less.
Consult your trainer for advice.
If you're wearing the vest for medical reasons, you may work with much smaller increments of weights, such as an eighth of a pound.
If a medical doctor has recommended using a weighted vest, contact them for help about balancing your vest., Your first step in improving your balance will be to wear the vest as much as you can around your house or yard. By doing this, you’ll be able to get used to it in a relaxed and informal environment.


Try a variety of activities while you’re wearing your vest. Do normal chores like taking out the garbage, cleaning your home, and more.

Be careful around stairs or other potential hazards when you first start wearing your vest. After all, your balance might not good, yet., An important part of improving your balance with a vest is to slowly increase your weight over time. By increasing your weight, you’ll get used to the weight and be able to improve your balance.


Use a minimal amount of weight at first.
Increase your weight in manageable increments over the period of 8 to 12 weeks.
Try to avoid going above 20% of your total body weight.
Make sure to not engage in any exercises that may overexert you when you are trying to get used to the vest., Perhaps the best way to improve your balance with a weighted vest is to use a balance beam. By using a balance beam, you’ll force yourself to confront your balance problems head on.


Use a balance beam at a gym or park, if you're healthy.
If you don’t have access to a balance beam, use a long board, a curb, or simply try to walk along a line.
Force yourself to walk the beam, line, or curb until you are more confident in your ability to balance when wearing the vest.
If you're wearing the vest for medical reasons, avoid a balance beam and try to walk along a straight line. , Spending time doing sustained cardio with your weighted vest will help you improve your balance. This is not only because you’ll spend a lot of time with your vest on, but because wind up in different positions and situations with it on.


Try running.
Use an elliptical with your vest on.
Walk briskly with your vest., Weight training is another good way to improve your balance with a weighted vest. By training while you wear your vest, you’ll get used to lifting while you wear your vest. This’ll challenge your ability to keep your balance.


Try lifting free weights.
Use exercise machines., If a doctor has recommended the vest because of a medical condition, you should begin by practicing normal movements that you do every day. This is because your first goal will be to improve and regain your balance.


Try walking up and down a half flight of stairs. Don't push yourself too much. Make sure you have a helper around if you fear falling down.
Try moving your arms, turning around, and standing and sitting down while wearing your vest. With much repetition, you'll improve your balance on these basic functions.
Work with a physical therapist who can instruct you on other exercises to do while you wear your vest., Before committing to an exercise routine using a weighted vest, you should consult a physician. This is important, as weighted vests are intended to put extra pressure on your cardiovascular system. If you have cardio problems, this could produce dangerous effects.


Tell your doctor of your plans to use a weighted vest.
Talk to your doctor about your cardio health. See if they will run blood work, take your blood pressure, and monitor your pulse and heart rate., A weighted vest may exacerbate muscular-skeletal problems. Because of this, you need to make sure you don’t have any problems that may be made worse by wearing a weighted vest.


Have your doctor investigate any chronic aches or pains you have.
Be careful if you have any neck or back problems.
If you have osteoporosis, a weight vest might help you. Consult your doctor., If you have a disability or condition that negatively effects your balance or ability to stand, you may benefit from wearing a weighted vest. However, you should talk to your specialist first. They will be able to instruct you on how to use and calibrate your vest.


Weighted vests are increasingly being used to help people with disorders like multiple sclerosis. The vests help to improve their balance and general physical abilities.
Work with your doctor to determine the right amount of weight to use.
Distribute the weight until you feel balanced. The weight may not need to be balanced evenly."

Serve calcium-fortified beverages and foods.,
Allow your child to eat fortified breakfast cereals.,
Serve dark greens and cruciferous vegetables.,
Go vegetarian and serve tofu or tempeh.,
Include canned fish in your child's diet.,
Go with almonds.,
Incorporate sources of Vitamin D. Calcium gets a lot of attention in regards to bone health, but there are other vitamins and minerals that are essential as well.,
Include regular sources of magnesium.,
Choose foods high in phosphorus.,
Make sure your child is eating adequate amounts of Vitamin A. Vitamin A isn't only important for your vision.,
Incorporate sources of Vitamin C. Vitamin C is an easy to find vitamin — it's found in many fruits and vegetables.,
Encourage a well-balanced and varied diet.,
Emphasize water and non-dairy milk only.,
Focus on a lower sodium diet.,
Encourage your child to exercise regularly.",How to Improve Bone Density in Kids with Milk Allergies," Although milk, cheese and yogurt do have a large amount of calcium, there are other foods that can provide calcium as well. Children who are allergic to milk can consume fortified beverages and foods as alternatives that will offer an adequate amount of calcium.


Calcium is an essential mineral to children's and adult's bone health. Food manufacturers are now adding this mineral to many foods including a variety of beverages.Common calcium-fortified foods include: orange juice, soy milk, dry cereals, almond milk, breads, oatmeal and tofu. Orange juice and non-dairy milk can have anywhere from 200–400 mg of calcium per serving.
Note that the bioavailability of calcium in these foods (how well your body absorbs the added calcium) varies greatly. For example, the calcium in orange juice is absorbed well. Whereas the calcium in soy milk settles to the bottom, so its recommended to shake up your soy milk before serving.;
, It's best to try to spread out your child's calcium intake over the entire day. A little calcium at each meal makes it easier to meet the recommended intake of 1,000–1,300 mg daily.Start your child's day off with a calcium-rich breakfast.


In lieu of the typical cereal and cow's milk breakfast, swap over to some common fortified foods for breakfast. Combining a few of these can help your child get in a decent dose of calcium early in the morning.
If your child enjoys cereal and milk, look for a cereal that's fortified with calcium. Read over the nutrition label and find the percentage of calcium in a single serving of the cereal. It should have at least 10–15% of your child's calcium needs. Cereals can have anywhere 200–1,000 mg of calcium per serving.
Serve your child's cereal with fortified soy or almond milk. Remember, thoroughly shake up these non-dairy milks to ensure you're getting the full dose of calcium.

, Depending on the age of your child and her taste preferences, you can try serving her some dark greens and other calcium-rich vegetables. These foods in particular are fairly high in calcium and can help your child reach her daily needs.


Greens and lettuces that are highest in calcium are: collard greens, kale, and mustard greens. Other vegetables include broccoli, broccoli rabe and bok choy.Vegetables aren't overly high in calcium but can have anywhere from 50–350 mg of calcium per serving.
Although there are other vegetables that are high in calcium as well (like beets, rhubarb and spinach), the calcium in these particular vegetables is not well absorbed.
Serve salads with dinner to help your child get in more dark greens. You can also make sure to serve broccoli or bok choy with dinner as well. If your child packs lunch, consider blanching broccoli to be served with a ranch dip as a side.

, A vegetarian source of calcium can be found in soy foods, tofu and tempeh (fermented soy beans). These items can replace meat in meals or served alongside another protein source for an added hit to calcium.Tofu can have 200–400 mg of calcium per serving. Tempeh can have about 180–200 mg of calcium per serving. If paired with other calcium-rich foods (like broccoli or bok choy) your child will get a fairly high-calcium meal.
Give these vegetarian protein sources a try. Both tofu and tempeh can be sautéed, baked, stir-fried or even crumbled into casserole dishes. They have a mild flavor and are generally well-liked by children.

, If your child enjoys the occasional tuna salad sandwich, this might be a good way to increase his overall calcium intake. Both canned fish and some fresh or frozen fish contain a decent amount of calcium.Canned tuna or salmon can have anywhere from 35–250 mg of calcium per serving. In addition, cod, herring and trout have about 20 mg of calcium per serving.
Try making tuna or salmon salad sandwiches or wraps for your child's lunch (served with some dark greens on fortified bread can increase the overall calcium content) or have fish a few times a week with dinner.

, A great way to add more calcium to your child's diet is through almonds. These nuts are not overly high in calcium, but can be added to snacks or meals to boost their calcium content.Per serving of 1 oz, almonds contain about 70–80 mg of calcium. Other nut varieties do have some calcium, but it's very minimal.
Make your own trail mix with almonds and dried fruit for your child to bring in her lunch box or have as an afternoon snack. You can also serve chopped almonds on top of salads to add a little crunch and hit of calcium.

, Adequate consumption of Vitamin D is also essential to bone health.


Children need adequate amounts of both calcium and Vitamin D. These nutrients work together to help children build strong and dense bones when they're young. Adequate amounts of calcium alone is not enough for proper bone health.Children need about 400–800 IU of Vitamin D each day.Although this is a fairly low dosage, even kids who play outside regularly are showing signs of deficiency.
Food sources of Vitamin D include: egg yolks, fatty fish (like salmon and tuna) and fortified foods (like orange juice, soy milk and cereals). You can also get some Vitamin D naturally as you sit in the sun.
Unfortunately, there are not many food sources of Vitamin D. In addition, if you're putting sunscreen on your child, that doesn't allow his skin to make Vitamin D when he is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor about giving your child a low-dose Vitamin D supplement to help ensure he is getting adequate amounts.
Your doctor may also recommend about 10 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen three times a week to help make Vitamin D naturally.

, Magnesium has also been associated with bone maintenance for adults; however, recent studies show that adequate intakes of magnesium are equally important for bone growth in children.A recent study showed that children's magnesium intake was directly linked to how much bone they developed as they aged. Lower intakes were associated with lower bone densities.
Average daily recommendations are as follows: Birth to 6 months: 30 mg; 7–12 months: 75 mg; 1 – 3 years: 80 mg; 4 – 8 years: 130 mg; 9 – 13 years: 240 mg; boys 14 – 18: 410 mg; girls 14 – 18: 360 mg.In general, a well-balanced and nutritious diet will provide adequate amounts of magnesium. Specific foods that contain magnesium include: nuts, spinach, fortified cereals, soy milk and soy products, black beans, fortified bread, avocado and potatoes.

, Another essential mineral to a child's bone growth and development is phosphorus. Although a nutritious diet should provide adequate phosphorus, ensure your child is getting enough through their diet.When children do not have a balanced or varied diet, they might not be consuming adequate phosphorus. Studies have shown that low levels of phosphorus have been associated with poor growth and poor bone and tooth development.Children under 10 years old need about 500 mg of phosphorus each day. Children over 10 need about 1300 mg of phosphorus daily.
Foods that have relatively high levels of phosphorus include: protein foods (like poultry, beef or pork), nuts, dairy products, beans, lentils and whole grains.

, This essential vitamin also plays an important role in the growth of bones in children.


Vitamin A specifically is responsible for cells to be able to divide or replicate properly. Skeletal cells in children are dividing and replicating fast as children grow, build and develop bone tissue.Children need about 400–600 mg of Vitamin A each day. Younger children under 10 need the lower amount — as they get older they need slightly larger amounts each day.Vitamin A is found in a large variety of foods including: sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkin, spinach, cantaloupe, red peppers, fish, liver, mangoes, apricots, broccoli and fortified cereals.

, In addition to other nutrients, Vitamin C is key for a child's bone health.


Although you may commonly think of bones being made fully of calcium, the main protein found in bone is collagen. Vitamin C is essential for the production and maintenance of collagen.
Recommended daily doses for children are as follows: Birth to 6 months: 40 mg; 7 – 12 months: 50 mg; 1 – 3 years: 15 mg; 4 – 8 years: 25 mg; 9 – 13 years: 45 mg; boys 14 – 18 years: 75 mg; girls 14 – 18 years: 65 mg.Foods that are particularly high in Vitamin C include: citrus fruits (like oranges, grapefruit and their juices), kiwi, red and green bell peppers, berries, tomatoes and melons.

, There are many nutrients that are needed to help kids develop strong and healthy bones. Even with a milk allergy, the best way to get all these nutrients is through a balanced and varied diet.A balanced diet for kids means that they're eating foods from every food group (except dairy foods) each day. In addition, you should help them focus on foods that will replace the calcium-rich foods from the dairy group.Kids should be eating foods from the protein group, vegetable group, fruit group and from the grains group every day.
It's also important for children to eat a large variety of foods. Offering them different types of fruits, vegetables and protein sources will help ensure they get adequate amounts of essential nutrients.

, Many children do struggle to get in adequate amounts of calcium each day - regardless of whether or not they have a milk allergy. Many health professionals are stressing the importance of limiting some food choices to ensure kids do get adequate calcium daily.


Health and nutrition professionals are noticing that children's calcium levels are decreasing overall. The reasoning behind this is that there has been an increase in the amount sodas, energy drinks and sports drinks that kid's are drinking.This is replacing the calcium-rich beverages in children's diets.
Encourage your child to stick to water and calcium-fortified beverages like 100% orange juice, soy milk or almond milk. Aim for at least 40–60 oz of water daily plus a glass or two of fortified beverages.
Have your child avoid or restrict how often she drinks beverages like soda, tea, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks or coffees.

, Following a lower sodium diet isn't just for those with high blood pressure. Sodium and calcium have a unique relationship in the body making it important for children to also follow a moderate to low sodium diet.


Calcium and sodium share the same transport pathway in the body. When children have increased sodium levels from their diet, they excrete more calcium in their urine. This decreases how much calcium can be absorbed by the body.Children's main source of sodium is from processed foods, fast foods and other restaurant foods. Help your child limit their intake of foods like: chips, crackers, snack cakes, fast food, fried foods and pizza.
Have your child focus on less processed, more whole foods. For example, instead of crackers as a snack, have them go for an apple with all natural peanut butter.

, Although a balanced diet high in calcium and Vitamin D (and other nutrients) is essential for healthy bone growth in children, it's also important to encourage activity. Both strength training and cardio are essential for a child's healthy bone growth.Regular physical activity can help increase bone growth in children. In addition, it helps set up good behaviors long-term. Physical activity, especially weight bearing and strength training exercises, help maintain bone mass as an adult.
Children should be active for at least an hour daily. Make sure they're doing a lot of aerobic exercises during these 60 minutes. Playing outside games, playing sports, riding bikes or hiking with the family all count towards this hour.
Exercises like walking, running and dancing are all considered weight-bearing exercises. Encourage your child to participate in these daily to help build his bones as he gets older.

Select one who is experienced, medically licensed, and certified to perform circumcisions.


Most pediatricians do provide this service prior to baby being discharged from the hospital.;
, Talk to your doctor about what she recommends for pain relief for your son during and after the circumcision. Local anesthesia is usually all that is considered necessary — general anesthesia should not be used on infants.There is debate as to pain relief options when performing a circumcision. Injectable anesthesia is most often used for circumcision — the dorsal penile nerve block, which is delivered via two injections, is used in 85% of cases in the US. Another injectable option, known as ring block, has also proven to be extremely effective.Topical creams, such as EMLA cream, may also be an option. Ensure that you are comfortable with what is recommended and if not, you can obtain a second opinion.
Newborns do experience pain, and research has proven that local anesthesia is safe and effective, so make sure your doctor is using adequate pain relief measures during the procedure.

, Safety measures must be in place to ensure a safe and efficient circumcision for your son. Ask your doctor what kinds of safety precautions he will implement during the procedure. This includes the use of a shield to protect the glans (acorn-shaped end of the penis) from being accidentally cut during circumcision.


The most popular shield is the Gomco shield, though many others are available.

, The physician should talk you through the procedure and techniques, as well as the sanitary precautions taken. You should feel comfortable with every step of the procedure and confident that you fully understand the entire process. Make sure this is part of the birth plan and education prior to delivering and that you do plenty of research beforehand so you are prepared. Discuss these details with your doctor so you can be aware of what to expect, both for yourself and for your son.There are three different methods typically used for circumcision:



The Gomco Clamp – With this method, the doctor uses a probe to separate the foreskin from the head of the penis. After that, a bell-shaped device is fitted over the head of the penis and under the foreskin, which may require an incision in the foreskin. The foreskin is pulled up over the bell and a clamp is tightened around it to reduce blood flow to the area. Finally, a scalpel is used to cut and remove the foreskin.

The Mogen Clamp – With this method, the doctor also uses a probe to separate the foreskin from the head of the penis. Then the foreskin is pulled out away from the head and inserted into a metal clamp. The doctor will hold the clamp in place while the foreskin is cut with a scalpel. The clamp will remain in place for a few minutes to ensure all of the bleeding has stopped.

The Plastibell Technique – With this method (similarly to the Gomco Clamp method), the doctor uses a probe to separate the foreskin from the head of the penis. Then the bell-shaped device is fitted over the head of the penis and under the foreskin. Next, a piece of suture is tied around the foreskin to cut off the blood circulation to the foreskin. The doctor will then use a scalpel to cut off the extra foreskin, but the suture is left on. It will fall off on its own approximately three to seven days later.

, Ensure the infant has been thoroughly examined by a physician or nurse practitioner and has no physical problems. Before you move forward with the circumcision, you should make sure there are no physical warning signs or abnormalities, especially to his penis.Sometimes it is necessary to wait until your child is older to perform a circumcision. For example, if your child has a condition called phimosis in which the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head of the penis.In these cases, circumcision will be postponed until the child is two years old (or even until puberty, if the parents so choose); however, there can be more complications, more pain and associated trauma, and a longer healing time for an older child, so you must take the proper precautions and consider your choice carefully since circumcision is essentially an elective surgery.
Newborns typically recover from the surgery within 24 hours. Older children and adults can take three to four days for recovery.For older children or adults, you might consider general anesthesia. This poses certain risks, but can reduce possible trauma related to undergoing the surgery while awake., This is always taken into factor by the physician performing the circumcision. She will verify that the infant was born at full term, or nearly so, and weighs five pounds or more. If your son was premature at birth or weighed less than five pounds, you should consider waiting until he has reached this weight requirement before doing the circumcision.

, Make sure that his family history has been investigated and there are no bleeding disorders. An issue like this could make a circumcision more risky. Be sure to discuss these issues with your doctor well in advance.During the pregnancy, health problems of both father and mother should be discussed to assess risks and benefits of the circumcision and other procedures. This assessment can help avoid any unforeseen problems; however, even with the best assessments, life can offer surprises that are unforeseen.

, This means that your son should be eating well and gaining, not losing weight. Consider postponing the circumcision for at least seven or eight days if these conditions are not met.

, Check that he has recovered from jaundice or from the birth trauma, if the birth was traumatic. It is important that your son be as healthy and stable as possible before moving forward with the circumcision.

, Ask your doctor about what you should expect after the procedure and what you will need to do to care for your son after his circumcision. Get details on how to care for any post-circumcision issues from the physician, including:


Instructions for aftercare
Pain relief
Special diaper changing instructions

, For about a week after the surgery, you will need to be extra diligent in caring for your son while he heals from the circumcision. Understand what symptoms might require medical intervention and know what to look for during healing.Some problems to watch for include oozing from the surgical site, continued bleeding around the circumcised area, abnormal urination patterns (or no urination), or other signs of infection as a result of the surgery.

, You will need to have the circumcision checked to assess the healing process and see if there's any need for additional surgery. Typically, your doctor will schedule the follow-up appointment for one to two weeks after the procedure., This is a crucial time for your son in which he’ll need extra care to ensure his circumcision heals properly. This is a major issue that will affect him for the rest of his life so you’ll need to be diligent in your care after the procedure to reduce the risk of scarring or other damage that could affect him into adulthood.Keep the penis clean.
Keep the area covered with a healing lotion, such as petroleum jelly, perhaps on a gauze wrapped (but never taped) around his circumcised penis.
Know how to stem minor bleeding, specifically using sterile contact methods. Add a little pressure to the area that is bleeding.

Do R.I.C.E.,
Rest the limb with the hematoma.,
Ice the area for 20 minutes, several times a day, for the first 48 hours.,
Compress the hematoma to reduce any swelling.,
Elevate the affected area.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever or anti-inflammatory medication.,
Wait a few months for the hematoma to subside.,
Head to the nearest hospital if you suffer a hematoma on your head or your internal organs.,
Go to the nearest medical facility if the skin is broken on the hematoma.,
See your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after two weeks.",How to Heal a Hematoma," R.I.C.E. stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. These steps can be used at home to treat hematoma on your arms and legs and should be practiced on a daily basis for the best results.Try to apply R.I.C.E. as soon as you develop the hematoma for optimal recovery and healing.;
, Make sure you rest the affected area during the first 24–72 hours of developing the hematoma. This will prevent any further bleeding and allow the area to heal.Some physicians recommend that you rest a lower limb that has hematoma, such as your leg, for at least 48 hours. The duration of the rest period is dependent on the extent of the hematoma.

, Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel, or perform an ice massage on the affected limb. This will decrease the pain and swelling of the hematoma.To apply an ice massage, freeze a plastic foam cup of water. Hold the cup and place a cloth or paper towel over the affected limb, then apply ice.
Never apply ice or an ice pack directly to skin, as this increases risk for a thermal burn or frostbite.
After the first 48 hours, you can use a heated compress, such as a heating pad or a very warm washcloth, two to three times a day, to help your body reabsorb the blood from the hematoma.

, Use a compression wrap or a compressive elastic bandage over the hematoma until it appears less swollen. You can find compression wraps and compressive elastic bandages at your local drugstore or pharmacy.You should maintain compression on the area for at least two to seven days. Make sure the compression bandage is on properly and it is snug, but not cutting off blood circulation to the limb.
A wrap that cuts off circulation will trigger throbbing in the area or skin color changes such as becoming deeper purple or blanching entirely.

, This will help to reduce the pain and swelling. Raise the affected limb above the level of your heart on a chair or a stack of pillows., This medication will help with the pain and swelling you may experience as the hematoma heals.Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is a very effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle and take no more than two pills at a time. Repeat this dosage every four to six hours.
Naproxen sodium (Aleve) is another anti-inflammatory medication. You can take this medication every 12 hours as needed for pain and swelling.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an effective pain reliever that can be used to ease any discomfort or pain.
If you have a bleeding disorder, avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs, including aspirin, as these medications can interfere with blood platelets and prolong your bleeding.

, If you have a hematoma on your arm, leg, or hand, you should do diligent home treatment and be patient as the blood reabsorbs into your body. After a few months, the hematoma should fade on its own and the pain should subside., any injury to an area that isn't an arm or leg should be immediately evaluated due to risk for internal hematoma.An acute subdural or epidural hemorrhage to your brain can develop over a period of minutes or hours. Both occur around/in the brain, both occur with trauma, and both require immediate evaluation. If not promptly treated, they can lead to a severe brain injury and possibly death. Subdurals are often accompanied by a ""thunderclap"" headache.
It is also possible to develop chronic subdural hemorrhage. This type of hemorrhage can develop over a period of many days to many weeks and you may not notice any symptoms until some time after the hematoma develops. It is important that you get the hematoma on your head or internal organs checked by a doctor to rule out any serious complications.

, If the skin is broken on the hematoma, you may be at risk of infection. Your doctor will need to examine the hematoma and decide if it would be beneficial to drain the blood from the hematoma.


If you develop new, unexplained bruising, these could be a sign of another medical issue. Your doctor should examine the new bruises and determine what may be causing them to develop.

, If an extremity hematoma does not improve despite diligent home treatment after two weeks, make an appointment to see your doctor. You should see reduced swelling and pain from the hematoma after two weeks of good home care. Your doctor will examine the hematoma and determine if there many be other medical issues that are slowing down the healing process.

Dental work involves concentration on the task at hand but also interactions with patients.

, You can have a more pleasant experience if you use relaxation techniques. There are different relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises to medication that can help you more easily get through your visit, especially if you fear going to the dentist.Try nitrous oxide, sedation, or anti-anxiety medications such as alprazolam to help you relax during your visit.Your dentist can administer these options before and during your visit.
If you are very scared, ask your dentist to prescribe anti-anxiety medication before your appointment.Tell your dentist if you take any anti-anxiety medication that she did not prescribe. This can help minimize the risk of potentially dangerous interactions between medications.Using sedatives during a dental procedure can increase the price, which dental insurance may not cover.
Try breathing exercises. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold it, and then exhale for 4 seconds. As you inhale, think the word “let” and as you exhale think “go.” These can deepen your relaxation., Many dentists now offer different media to distract patient during visits. Accepting the offer to distract yourself with music or television may relax you.Take your own headphones if you like, but know the dentist’s office will sanitize their equipment in between patients.
Ask if you can listen to music or a book during your appointment if your dentist doesn’t offer distracting media., You will probably receive follow-up instructions from your dentist for things like additional procedures you need, cleaning instructions, or when to come for your next visit. Make sure to take this with you so that you don’t forget them and can follow your doctor’s orders.


Ask your dentist any questions you have on follow up care or instructions she gives you on how to care for your oral hygiene.

Whole grains such as whole wheat bread, pasta and brown rice.
Lean meats such as chicken, pork, and fish.
Vegetables such as spinach, broccoli and bell peppers which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants.
Fruits such as berries, oranges, apples and bananas.
Fat free or low fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Other protein-rich foods such as eggs, beans and legumes.
Broth-based soups.;
, Foods that should be eaten rarely or in moderation include sodas, fried foods, full-fat dairy products, sugary processed foods like cookies, cakes and cereals. Eating these calorie-laden foods in excess could cause you to become overweight or obese, increasing your risk of heart disease, diabetes and other serious health conditions.You should also limit your intake of caffeine and alcoholic drinks.

, Drinking water is a core element of your physical health. Water regulates your body temperature and keeps your joints well-lubricated. It also removes toxins from your body via urination and bowel movements.The recommended amount of water to drink each day will vary from person to person, but general guidelines suggest 13 cups of water for men and 9 cups of water for women every day.To get in the habit of drinking more water, keep a bottle of water on your desk. Seeing the water in close proximity will probably prompt you to drink it more often, but you can also set your phone or computer to give you a reminder every half hour to drink.
If you are in the habit of drinking soda, try drinking sparkling water instead. The fizzy, carbonated texture of the drink will remind you of soda, but you won't be consuming any of the harmful sugars or chemicals from soda.

, You don't have to compete in Ultra-Marathons in order to reap the physical benefits of exercise. 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise (like brisk walking, running, swimming or hiking) 4-5 times a week is the recommended amount for most people.


Exercise can help you lose weight and reduce your risk of suffering from heart disease, diabetes, chronic fatigue, and even some cancers, such as endometrial and lung cancer.It may take some time to find a form of exercise you really enjoy. Try a wide variety of activities: walking, running, swimming, yoga, pilates, ballet. You can also look into team sports such as soccer, basketball, football, and softball. Your local gym or community center may offer classes in these areas, but you can also look for DVDs or fitness videos on YouTube to give you guidance.
Don't give up on a new exercise regime immediately. It will take time for your muscles to adjust to the demands of the activity. Try each activity for at least a month before you move onto something new.

, A full night's sleep can have multiple physical benefits, from boosting your immune system to improving your ability to concentrate and complete projects when you are awake.If you struggle to get a full night's sleep, try creating a regular bedtime routine in the hour leading up to the time you want to sleep. Wash your face, brush your teeth, and play some relaxing music. You might read a book in bed before going to sleep. Repeating these activities will prepare your body for sleep.
Improve your sleeping conditions. If you need to sleep in a cool room, add an extra fan or remove a layer of blankets from your bed. If you live by a noisy street, try using a white noise machine to drown out any noise. Use thick curtains to shut out any light from street lamps or nearby buildings.

, Showering every day will not only help you feel refreshed, it will also promote good hygiene. Be sure to use water and soap when you shower or take a bath. , Regular hand washing is one of the most effective methods in preventing the spread of disease. It reduces the transmission of diarrhea, the flu, and other communicable diseases.Be sure to use warm water, antibacterial hand soap (either in a bar or liquid form) and a clean towel to dry your hands.
Wash your hands before you prepare food, insert contact lenses, or apply any kind of medical treatment such as a bandage to the skin.
Wash your hands after going to the bathroom, taking out the trash, blowing your nose, handling raw meat or eggs, or touching an animal., Brush your teeth in the morning and in the evening for two minutes each time. Use a fluoride-based toothpaste. Your dentist may want you to brush after every meal or 3 times a day, so always follow her directions.You can purchase toothpaste and a toothbrush from your local grocery store or a drugstore.
Floss. You should also floss between your teeth to remove bacteria and protect your gums from infection. Take a piece of dental floss and wrap the ends of it on the index finger on your right hand and the index finger of your left hand. Insert the string of floss between your teeth, moving it up and down to thoroughly clean the space between the teeth and your gums.

, Your skin is the largest organ in your body, so it is important to take good care of it. Always wear sunscreen when you spend time outdoors and get regular skin checks from a doctor or dermatologist.

See a doctor right away if you notice a new mole or growth on your skin. Melanoma (skin cancer) is one of the most common forms of cancer and it can spread to other parts of your body if not treated early., You should schedule a yearly exam with your family doctor (or general practitioner) just so they can monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, weight, reflexes and any other signs of good health.


If you are a woman, then you should have annual checkups with a gynecologist as well.
If you have a family history of a particular disease -- such as diabetes or lung cancer -- you should talk to your doctor about monitoring for these conditions and what you can do to prevent them from developing.

, Just because the symptoms of mental illness might not be visible in the same way as those of a physical disease, you shouldn't dismiss the symptoms of stress, depression or anxiety. Symptoms of poor mental health might include:Anger or irritability
Crying
Feeling powerless or helpless
A sense of disconnection or numbness to your emotions
A loss of appetite or diminished libido
Loss of interest in activities you normally love

, You probably have a very busy schedule with the demands of work, home and everything in between. But preserving your mental health means making time for doing things that bring you joy and also keep you calm.


Make a list of things that you enjoy doing in your spare time. Perhaps you like practicing photography, reading mystery novels, or testing out new recipes. Whatever it is you enjoy doing, set aside at least a few hours each week in which you can relax and take this time to yourself.

, Simply breathing in long, soothing breaths can help regulate your body's response to stress.


Inhale by expanding your diaphragm outward; this is located in your lower stomach. Hold your breath for five seconds. Then, exhale, drawing your diaphragm back inward.

, In meditation, you empty your mind so you only focus on your breathing and the rhythms of your body as you inhale and exhale.Find a comfortable space to sit or lie down while you focus on your breathing. If you are not comfortable lying or sitting down, then try going for a walk and focusing only on your surroundings.
If you tend to ""overthink"" or have a rush of anxious thoughts, especially before you go to bed, meditation can help you clear you mind of these toxic ideas and instead focus on the experience of breathing.

, In addition to having excellent physical benefits, exercise can also relieve the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The endorphins released during exercise might help boost your mood and relieve the symptoms of depression.Many forms of exercise -- such as yoga and tai chi -- combine the benefits of exercise with the focus on deep, meditative breathing. These exercises are a great way to quell the symptoms of stress or anxiety., While you should certainly visit a counselor or psychiatrist if you suffer from depression or acute anxiety, you might seek treatment for seemingly more minor experiences of stress. A counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist can give you helpful tips for managing stress and maintaining your mental health., Social health is bolstered by networks of friends and family members. They are people who support us, give us guidance, and celebrate joyful moments in life. They provide a crucial sense of belonging that is necessary to our overall health.Keep in mind that you do not need to have tons of friends to be happy. Even one or two good friends may be enough to provide you with a strong support system.
Try to build networks that meet regularly in person. Taking a class, attending a monthly book club, or joining a local tennis team means you will have a regular, recurring opportunity to make friendships., If you are looking to make new friends, then join groups where you have a particular hobby or skill in common. For instance, consider joining a hiking group or a creative writing group.Look online at local Facebook groups or groups on MeetUp to find hobby-based groups.

, Another great way to bolster your social health is to give back to your community. This will help you meet new people while also strengthening your sense of belonging to your local town or city.


Volunteering has been shown to have enormous benefits for its participants, especially in increasing their psychological well-being and sense of social integration., Perhaps you have a co-worker you've wanted to get to know better. Invite him out for a cup of coffee. If you have a friend you have not spoken to in a few months, go ahead and give her a call or shoot her an email to see how she is doing.


Maintaining older friendship networks has been shown to yield significant happiness for people. Happiness, contentment and a sense of social belonging are key ingredients to maintaining your social health.Remember that you don't need to have lots of different friendships in order to have a healthy social life. Maintaining a few quality friendships can have greater benefits -- including a prolonged lifespan -- than only having peripheral friendships with acquaintances., Whether you are trying to make new friendships or revive old ones, consider hosting and organizing events when you can bond socially with others. Invite new friends over to dinner (you can make it a potluck if you don't want to cook for many people). If you don't have space to host dinner, consider having cocktails and appetizers instead.You can also organize very simple events, like going to see a movie or a concert, trying out a new restaurant for brunch or dinner, or grabbing a drink at happy hour.

, Similarly, do not reject opportunities to meet new people. If you are invited to a party, attend it, even if you do not know anyone else going.Be open to trying new things. If someone invites you to a new restaurant or a festival you've never been to, then go along with it. Even if it is not exactly what you would prefer to do, be flexible for the sake of meeting new people.

, One of the best ways to make friendships is to simply show interest in the other person. Ask them about their hobbies, their current goals or missions, and what are they passionate about.Look at people directly in the eye when you talk to them. Smile and have a friendly, generous manner toward them.
Don't dismiss someone just because they seem to different from you at first (i.e. they may have a different political or religious belief system than you). While they might appear to be your polar opposite, they still could be a wonderful, loyal friend to you."

Brush your teeth twice a day using a good toothpaste.,
Floss daily to remove particles from between the teeth.,
Use antiseptic mouthwashes to protect your gums.,
Massage your gums to improve circulation.,
Swish salt water around your mouth to kill bacteria.,
Apply a special gum gel to keep gum disease under control.,
Follow a healthy diet.",How to Heal Gum Disease1," Brushing your teeth twice a day helps to reduce plaque, prevent gingivitis and protect your gums from infections.


When brushing, the toothbrush should be placed against the teeth at a 45-degree angle from the gum line. Use a gentle circular motion as your brush, don't go back and forth, as this damages tooth enamel.
Do not use too much force or pressure. Allow the tips of the bristles to reach between the teeth. Cover all the inner, outer, chewing surfaces of all the teeth, making sure the grooves and crevices are cleaned well.
Take particular care to clean the inside of the lower, front teeth and the outer surfaces of the upper back teeth as these are the surfaces that tend to collect the maximum tartar.
Use toothpaste specially made for gum diseases and for gum protection. For example, Crest Pro-Health, Corsodyl daily toothpaste, Colgate pro gum health etc. You can also check for tooth pastes that contains fluoride and an antibiotic like triclosan.
Brush twice a day, for a full three minutes each time. Once you finish, rinse your mouth out with water or mouthwash.;
, Regular flossing reduces the risk of gum diseases and bad breath by removing food particles and plaque from between the teeth and around the gum lines.


Floss before bedtime and at least once during the day. To floss correctly, dispense around 18 inches (45.7 cm) of floss from the dispenser. Wind it around the middle fingers of each hand, keeping a 1-inch section open for flossing. Floss the upper teeth first, then the lower teeth.
Don't ""snap"" the floss between the teeth, as this can irritate sensitive gums. Instead, try to slide the floss gently down the side of each tooth.
Keep using a fresh section of floss as you move along from tooth to tooth. Also, floss the back of the last molar carefully.
Avoid using tooth picks to remove food particles between the teeth which will damage your gums and causes infection.
If your teeth are very close together and hard to floss between, try using an interdental brush.

, Mouthwash controls plaque formation on the gums and washes away any food particles/debris.


Use an alcohol-free mouthwash that contains chlorhexidine or hexidine - this will kill bacteria and heal infections without irritating the gums.
You can also use chlorhexidine digluconate mouthwashes for the treatment and prevention of gum disease. These include Corsodyl mouthwash, Colgate Pro-Gum Health mouthwash, etc.
Use mouthwash twice a day, according to the instructions on the packaging.

, It's very important to massage your gums daily to increase blood circulation, which strengthens the gums and prevents them from bleeding.


Massage also helps to remove foods/debris from between the teeth and around the gums. After brushing, use your fingertips to gently massage the gums, using small circular motions. Special gum massagers are also available in stores for easy use.
Massage for at least 30 seconds to 1 minute twice a day if you have gum disease, and at least once in a day if you have healthy gums.

, Salt water helps to control bacterial growth in your mouth. It also has astringent properties and aids in wound healing by reducing inflammation.


Take a glass of warm water and mix in a tablespoon of sea salt. Take a mouthful of the salt water, gargle for 30 seconds, then spit it out. Do not swallow.

Repeat this process twice a day until the gum disease is under control. After that, you can continue to rinse with salt water once a week.
The heat of salt water increases blood flow to the infected area and helps in faster healing.

, Special gum gels (such as Anabel) are available in drug stores. These help to stop bleeding and reduce inflammation, keeping gum disease under control.


You can apply the gel after your brushing/or after using mouthwash. Take a small amount of gel (approximately 25mm) on your finger tip and rub it onto the gum surface. Massage it smoothly into the gums with your finger tips for a minute
After applying the gel, you should not rinse your mouth or eat/drink for at least 30 minutes This prevents the gel from being properly absorbed by the gums.
Use the gum gel once or twice a day, as per the product advice and you should notice an improvement in the condition of your gums in about a week.

, Following a healthy diet can help to build up your body's immune system, allowing your body to fight the gum disease from the inside out. Some of the most important vitamins and minerals for healthy teeth and gums include:



Vitamin C: helps to keep your teeth firmly implanted in the gums. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, dark green vegetables, kiwi and broccoli.

Vitamin A: helps to fight gum infection and promotes healthy gums. Vitamin A rich foods that you can add to your diet are carrots, green leafy lettuce, sweet potatoes, fish, eggs, corn, banana etc.

Vitamin D: promotes your gum health by supporting the immune system and reducing inflammation. Sources of vitamin D include organ meats, fish, eggs and sun exposure.

Omega-3 fatty acids: help to reduce gum inflammation. Foods rich in omega-3s include fish (salmon, sardines), flaxseed and fish oil.

Folic acid: helps to keep your mouth healthy by promoting cell growth of the gums and all surface tissues in mouth. Leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, legumes are rich sources of folic acid.

Coenzyme Q10: reduces the gum disease symptoms like bleeding, inflammation and depth of gum pockets. The foods rich in COQ10 are beef, pork, chicken, fatty fish and organ meats.

Keep your food and symptom journal up-to-date. Ideally journal at least 2 weeks of meals and show to your doctor or dietitian for further evaluation.;
, Many studies have shown that a high fiber diet has a large variety of benefits to your overall health and GI system.Even with a vague condition like leaky gut, eating adequate fiber can help keep your GI system functioning properly.


The benefits of fiber are widespread and include: normalizing bowel movements, decreases your risk for bowel diseases like diverticulitis or hemorrhoids, lowers cholesterol levels, maintains stable blood sugar levels, and can support healthy weight loss.Recent studies have also shown that fiber can help change the environment of your gut by increasing the amount of beneficial or ""good"" bacteria.

Most studies show that these types of ""good bacteria"" can improve the health and integrity of your gut.Probiotics are good bacteria that are added to or are formed naturally in some foods.Yogurt, kefir fermented vegetables (like pickles or kimchi), preserved fruits, and chutneys are beneficial examples of probiotics.
Probiotics can also be taken in supplemental form. Take a dose between 5 and 10 billion units a day.

, Adding foods that contain higher amounts of prebiotics while consuming foods that are fortified with probiotics can improve your gut health.


Prebiotics act as a food source for the probiotic bacteria. They are found in foods that contain indigestible carbohydrates and provide a great energy source for those good bacteria.
Include foods like: onions, garlic, bananas, honey, whole grains and artichokes., Dehydration can make it difficult for your intestines to pass waste products, causing further inflammation and increased susceptibility to other GI conditions.Maintain adequate hydration to help prevent these side effects.


Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily. However, if you have GI issues, are prone to constipation or have leaky gut syndrome, increase your water intake up to 13 glasses daily.Even though many other drinks will help hydrate you, water is the best source, especially while trying to heal yourself. Stick with plain water, flavored water or decaf coffee and tea.
Drinks that contain alcohol and caffeine should be avoided, along with those that contain high concentrations of sugar.

, Studies have shown that people that consume higher levels of refined and added sugars are more likely to have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.Although there hasn't been a direct correlation between sugar and these autoimmune diseases, there is a connection between the two.
Avoid foods (as much as possible) that contain ""high fructose corn syrup"" or ""corn syrup."" Those are the most common processed sugars. Refined and added sugars are highly processed, contain little to no nutritional value and are added to a variety foods during their processing.Foods that have high levels of refined and added sugars include: sweetened beverages (sodas, coffee drinks or fruit juice cocktails), cookies, cakes, candy, ice cream, pastries and other baked goods.
Limit these foods as much as possible. If you're trying to figure out a specific diagnosis or decrease symptoms, it's advised to eliminate these foods completely.

, If you're experience chronic GI symptoms or even a sudden onset of GI symptoms, call your doctor and follow up regularly. It's important to manage these symptoms or be treated for an accurate diagnosis.


If you have not been to a GI specialist, consider making an appointment for a consult. Discuss your symptoms, their severity, how long you've been experiencing them and any other information you can provide.
Also bring your food and symptom journal. This can help your doctor judge whether or not your condition has been caused by or worsened by specific foods.
Take all medications and instructions provided by your doctor. Follow them exactly and make sure to go back in to see your doctor on a regular basis.

, Smoking cigarettes has been connected to a variety of negative side effects. In addition, smoking has been linked to a variety of GI issues.


Although smoking hasn't been linked to leaky gut specifically, smoking has been linked to the following GI issues: cancer of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, colon, liver and pancreas, GERD, peptic ulcers, liver disease, Crohn's disease, colon polyps, pancreatitis and gallstones.Quit smoking as soon as possible. If you can, try to quit cold turkey. This will immediately stop the intake of unhealthy toxins into your system.
If you're unable to quit alone or cold turkey, see your primary care physician for help. She may be able to prescribe you some medication or refer you to a smoking cessation program.

, Antibiotics and some over-the-counter medications can be helpful to a variety of conditions, but if you struggle with a leaky gut these medications may worsen your condition.Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known GI irritants and can irritate the stomach when taken on a regular basis.Avoid using them as you strive to heal your GI system and pinpoint a diagnosis.
Also, consider speaking to your doctor about other pain management methods. Many people rely heavily on NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin for regular pain relief (as with conditions like arthritis). Ask about other options to help decrease stomach and GI irritation.
Antibiotics can be hard on your digestive system, as well, but you should always talk to your doctor before stopping the use of a prescribed antibiotic.

, Your body's natural healing processes are strongest while your body rests during sleep. Try to get a full 7-9 hours of sleep each night, especially during your initial recovery stage.

Undergo root planing to treat gum diseases deeper in the gums.,
Consider flap surgery in advanced cases of gum disease.",How to Heal Gum Disease2," Scaling and polishing treatments can be done every six months by your dentist to heal and prevent gum disease.


This is a procedure where the plaque and tartar deposits are removed from your teeth with the help of an ultrasonic cleaning instrument or sometimes with hand instruments.
Scaling itself shows dramatic improvement in the health of the gums. Polishing helps to remove any superficial stains and make the tooth surface smooth. This slows down the build-up of plaque on your teeth, preventing future gum disease., Root planing is a procedure where the surface of the tooth root is cleaned by deep scaling, using specialized instruments.


Bacteria on the root of the tooth is removed and the root surface is debrided to provide a fresh new surface available for the reattachment of the gums.Local anesthesia may be required to carry out this procedure.

, Flap surgery is done in advanced cases of gum disease (such as periodontal disease), especially when several teeth are involved.


Under local anesthesia, a gum flap is raised and the tooth surface is cleaned to remove bacteria and infected tissue. Bone graft is placed wherever the bone loss is significant and the flap is sewed back into place. Sometimes a soft tissue graft will also be necessary or the bone surface will need to be reshaped to prevent easy growth of bacteria.
Following the surgery, a dressing is placed over the wound and the patient is asked to return after a week for removal of the sutures/dressing.
Antibiotics like amoxicillin /doxycycline may be prescribed along with some painkillers like ibuprofen/crocin etc.

Read the decedent’s will.,
Make an accurate accounting of estate assets.,
Pay the decedent’s uninsured medical expenses.",How to Handle a Decedent's Uninsured Medical Expenses1," When the decedent has a will, their property will be placed in a legal entity called an estate. The estate's value will be increased or decreased based on creditor claims and asset accumulation. As the estate administrator, it is your duty to collect estate assets and tally up valid debt claims.It is important to read the will so you can understand what assets will be a part of the estate and how the decedent wants the assets handled.


For example, the decedent might pass most of their property outside of the probate process, which means the estate will not include those assets. Also, the will might direct you about the manner in which assets should be used to pay debts, including uninsured medical debts. Some wills might state that cash, bank accounts, and securities should be used first to pay off debts. The will might also state that real property should be the last thing liquidated to pay for outstanding debt.
Make sure you understand the wishes of the decedent and follow their directions as best as possible.;
, Once you understand the wishes of the decedent, you need to account for all of the estate's assets so you know what is available to pay for outstanding debts. When you make an accounting of estate assets, you need to calculate the dollar value of each of those assets. Once you calculate the dollar value of each asset, you will add them together to get the total value of the estate. If the estate's asset values exceed the value of the estate's debts, the estate is considered solvent.Some assets can be easily valued. For example, if the decedent left a bank account behind, its value will simply be the amount of money left in the account.
However, other assets can be more difficult to value. For example, if the decedent left personal property (e.g., home furnishings and kitchenware), you might have to have the property appraised in order to determine its fair market value.

, Because uninsured medical expenses will be considered an estate debt, it will need to be paid with assets from the estate. If the decedent's estate is solvent, you can pay the medical debt whenever you wish. If you know the estate will be solvent and the medical expenses are relatively small, you might consider paying the debt early to get it out of the way. However, if you are not sure whether the estate will be solvent and the medical debt is large, you might wait to pay the debt until you are sure you have enough money to pay all the debts.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Prepare for your doctor's appointment.,
Get your Viagra prescription.,
Consider your insurance coverage.,
Take your Viagra prescription to a pharmacy.,
Purchase Viagra online.,
Never purchase Viagra from online sources that do not require a prescription.,

One way to ensure it's legal and safe to buy is that the site or seller requires a doctor's prescription. You should make an appointment with your doctor to get a prescription before trying to buy Viagra.


Make sure your doctor is covered under your health insurance plan. If you have health insurance and do not want to be stuck with an unexpected bill, make sure to call your insurance company before making an appointment to confirm your doctor is covered under your plan.
Though it can be emotionally difficult to broach the subject of taking Viagra with your doctor, studies have shown that 80% of men feel better after discussing erectile dysfunction with their physicians.;
, To make the most out of your doctor's appointment, you should prepare questions and answers ahead of time. You'll want to make sure to inquire about the potential side effects, contraindications (or conditions that make Viagra untenable for you, such as a history of heart problems, stroke, liver or kidney disease, etc.), and risks of taking Viagra. You should also ask what results should expect from using the medication. Be prepared as well to submit to a full medical history and answer the following specific questions about why you are interested in taking Viagra:Why do you want Viagra?
When did your erectile dysfunction start?
Is your erectile dysfunction always a problem? How often do you experience it?

, After discussing your erectile dysfunction and your medical history, ask your doctor for a prescription for Viagra. You may have your doctor's office directly submit the script to your preferred pharmacy, or you can take it with you and use the script to purchase Viagra at a pharmacy or online.


Note that Viagra is only available in three doses: 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. You doctor will prescribe whatever he deems is best for you., If you have health insurance, confirm your coverage online or with a customer service representative. Along with other basic personal information (such as your birth date and social security number), remember to have your health insurance ID number handy for when you log-in online or speak to a representative on the phone. Find out whether Viagra is covered under the prescription coverage component of your insurance plan.


If Viagra is not covered, you may want to check to see if similar drugs that help treat erectile dysfunction, like Cialis or Levitra, are covered by your health insurance plan. You can then ask your doctor if these might work for you.
If you don't have any health insurance, consider purchasing a plan. You don't need a health insurance plan to purchase Viagra, but prescriptions are usually cheaper with one. There are many factors to considering when shopping for health insurance including rate, coverage, HMO vs. PPO vs. EPO plans, deductibles, etc. Should you choose to buy health insurance, take your time to shop and compare before making a purchase.
Knowing whether or not you have insurance to cover the medication will make a difference in how you obtain it. If Viagra is covered by your insurance, the prescription co-pay is usually the same at all pharmacies, so there is no need to shop around for the best price. And having your doctor's office directly submit the script means that your prescription will be ready faster. However, if your Viagra is not covered by insurance, taking the script with you gives you the time to shop for the best price.

, This is the more traditional method of getting Viagra. Your doctor may send the script directly to your pharmacy of choice, or you can take the script into a pharmacy. After the pharmacy receives your prescription for Viagra, it may take a few minutes, or even a day for the pharmacy to fill your prescription.


When you pick up your prescription, be prepared to pay your co-pay if you are insured, and the entire cost of your prescription if you are not insured. If you have health insurance, make sure you bring your health insurance ID card with you and give it to the pharmacists.
The pharmacist may want to talk to you about usage and risks. This is standard for any new prescriptions and may be useful for you.

, The online world does big business in selling Viagra and, unsurprisingly, online scams are quite common. If you opt to buy Viagra from an online retailer, you should take some precautions and do your research. Make sure the online pharmacy or other retailer is legitimate. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy has a website where you can check to see if an online pharmacy is licensed and accredited as a Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site (VIPPS).Watch out for the following warning flags: the price seems much cheaper than other online sellers; there is no contact information, such as a phone number or address, provided on the website; the seller doesn't require a prescription for Viagra in order to sell it to you; the medication comes in different forms other than the three doses (25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg), such as ""fast-dissolving strength,"" ""soft-tab,"" etc.
Be careful when ordering the medication online that you have input the right prescription and dose. Check as well when you receive the medication that it is the exact dose and type of medication that your doctor instructed you to take., This is illegal and dangerous. Harmful substances, such as blue printer ink, amphetamine, Metronidazole (a powerful antibiotic that can cause an allergic reaction, diarrhea or vomiting), and binding agents (such as drywall), have all been found in ""fake"" or ""counterfeit"" Viagra.Viagra is actually one of the most counterfeited drug in the entire world. In one study, 80% of websites selling Viagra were not selling the real drug but fakes.
To stay healthy and avoid these harmful substances and potential adverse consequences, only obtain Viagra at your local pharmacy or through an accredited online source.

, Once your Viagra arrives at your house, you can start using it. Be sure that you follow your doctor's explicit instructions regarding dose and frequency of Viagra use. Typically, this medication is taken on an empty stomach about one hour before sexual intercourse. Note that deviating from your doctor's instructions can be life threatening.Do not use Viagra recreationally.
Do not combine Viagra with amyl nitrite as this combination can be fatal.
Very few men report any side effects, such as flushing, stuffy or runny nose, headache, changes in vision, and dizziness, from taking Viagra. You should, however, seek medical attention if you experience any loss in vision or hearing or if you experience an erection that does not go away on its own (after more than four hours)."

Determine if an intervention is appropriate.An intervention occurs when friends and family who are concerned about someone join together (sometimes with a doctor, counselor, or intervention specialist) to try to help the person understand the consequences of addiction or behavior.,
Clarify if the person wants help.,
Develop a plan of action.,
Stage the intervention.,
Convey the consequences of refusing help.,
Prepare participants for the emotional upheaval.,
Suggest an in-patient program.,
Visit the person when appropriate.,
Clarify the law.Involuntary commitment implies you are taking a person’s freedom away.,
Visit the city or county courthouse.,
Attend the hearing.,
Secure a restraining order if necessary.,
Prepare for attorney involvement.,
Anticipate an early release.,
Gather supporting documentation.,
Assess the situation and call 911.,
Be an advocate for the person.When speaking on the phone and when the emergency responders arrive, you need to explain that the person suffers from mental illness and that you are the person’s advocate.,
Facilitate teamwork for a positive outcome.,
Accompany the person to the hospital.,
Let the process happen.,
Mobilize all resources for future events.,
Remain strong and focus on healing.,

Realize you are not alone.There is a tendency to think you are the only one who experiences the thoughts and feelings you are having.",How to Get Someone Committed to a Mental Hospital," The intervention group often asks the person to accept treatment or offers to help find a solution to the problem. Examples of addictions that may warrant an intervention include:


Alcoholism
Prescription drug abuse
Street drug abuse
Compulsive eating
Compulsive gambling
For other mental health concerns (such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal tendencies), an intervention can be too embarrassing or misunderstood.
For someone that is a harm to themselves or others, calling 911 is the best option - no intervention needed.;
, Basic human rights allow a person to ask for and accept help. Those same rights allow a person to reject the help they might need. The person may not think they have a problem, but their demonstrated behaviors tell you otherwise. Part of your role will be to help convince them that they need the help and need to accept it.

, Prior to the intervention, develop at least one treatment plan to offer to the person. Make arrangements ahead of time if the person is going to be escorted to the mental health facility directly from the intervention. The intervention will mean little if they do not know how to get help and does not have the support of loved ones.

, Help comes in many forms, and must be forced sometimes. It is a hard decision to make, but one that is necessary if the person’s mental condition has spiraled out of control and the person’s life is in danger.While an intervention will likely be overwhelming to the person, the intent is not to put the person on the defensive.


Those who will participate in the intervention should be carefully chosen. The person’s loved ones can describe how the situation is affecting them.
You will likely have to ask the person to attend the meeting at the location where the intervention is supposed to take place without revealing the reason.

, Be prepared to offer specific consequences if the person rejects seeking treatment. These consequences must not be empty threats, so the person’s loved ones should consider the consequences to be imposed if she does not seek treatment, and be willing to follow through.

, Participants should prepare specific examples of how the loved one’s behaviors have hurt the relationship. Often, those staging an intervention choose to write letters to the person. A person with a mental illness may not care about their own self-destructive behaviors, but seeing the pain her actions inflict on others can be a powerful motivator for seeking help.


An intervention may also include the person’s colleagues and religious representatives (if appropriate).

, Contact several mental health facilities and inquire about their services. Don’t be afraid to ask specific questions about their daily schedules and how the center handles relapses.


If an intervention is not necessary, assist the person in researching both the mental illness they are suffering, and recommended therapy and drug treatment plans. Be supportive and allow the person to feel in control of the impending activities.
Tour the suggested programs and keep in mind that the more receptive the person is of the treatment plan, the better the chances of successfully managing their illness.

, If the person is admitted to an in-patient treatment program, there will be rules for visitation that will need to be clarified. Understand that you need to allow the person to participate on her own without influence from anyone on the outside. The staff will inform you when to visit and the visit will likely be deeply appreciated.

, This serious procedure varies from state to state, but in general, involuntary commitments are either judicial or emergency and require input from a doctor, therapist, and/or the court.Often, after a suicide attempt, temporary commitment is mandatory.


Every person has the right to the least restrictive treatment, which isn’t always the most beneficial treatment.
Here is a link you can use to look up specifics and what is required on civil/judicial commitment by state: http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/get-help/know-the-laws-in-your-state.

, Do this in the district where the person has a residence. Ask the clerk for the proper petition forms. You can complete them there or take them home and return at another time. Once the forms are complete submit them to the clerk.


You will be asked to describe the behavior the person is exhibiting that would support this person being formally committed to a mental facility.

, If there is not a reason for immediate commitment, a hearing will be scheduled, and the judge will make the final determination based on any evidence presented. Once the papers are filed, you will have little direct influence on what happens though you will likely be called upon to testify at the hearing.


The person may be ordered by the court to undergo a mental health evaluation, which may or may not result in the court ordering treatment. If so ordered, the person may be committed to receive treatment or ordered to undergo supervised outpatient treatment.

, The person in question may have serious problems with being placed in an inpatient mental health facility. If there is not an immediate resolution, and you feel you are in potential danger, seek a restraining order against the person to restrict her contact. If she violates that, you can ask the police and mental health professionals to intervene.

, The person has the right to get a second opinion, and if not completely impaired, will likely argue that she should not be committed. Be prepared to talk about the situation with her attorney, health care professional, or other advocates.


If it comes to this, it would be wise to secure the services of an attorney yourself.

, Be aware that the person may get released from the mental health facility without you knowing, or being prepared. The person’s demands and demonstration of “healthy” behavior, a doctor’s orders, or lack of insurance coverage can be reasons for early release.


You can sometimes block a premature discharge by strong advocacy such as pleading your well-documented case to the doctor in charge. If you're truly committed to this course of action, you will need to be a strong voice for yourself. If the person is somebody close to you, remember that this is in everyone's best interest in the long run.
Cutbacks in both services and staff have significantly shortened hospital stays. If you can participate in discharge planning, insist on real, demonstrated signs of progress, real, insurance-authorized supports for recovery, and real protections for you and the person.

, If you are seeking immediate commitment and there is no immediate danger, you will likely be required to provide evidence to justify your request. This may be the statement of a licensed physician, or sworn statements by other witnesses that the person in question could be a danger to themselves or to others.


If the judge agrees, local law enforcement will detain and escort the person to the local mental health facility, and a hearing will be scheduled for further resolution.

, Whether it is a first time occurrence, or there is a history of situations requiring the authorities, be confident in your assessment of the severity of the situation. Emergencies are not a time to feel embarrassed or coy when the situation involves a person with a mental illness. It may be a matter of life or death.


Describe the situation in a calm and detailed manner. Be very clear about the situation, and do not increase the likelihood any potential threat. Law enforcement personnel are trained to prevent injury or death to others; however, tragic consequences can occur at the expense of the person with a mental illness.

, Make it clear that this person deserves compassion and respect to avoid potential harm.


It will be up to you to ensure that all parties are aware that the person suffers from mental illness. This will help avoid potential unfair treatment and harm to the person.

, Be helpful to those trying to provide assistance. The person is likely to be agitated, upset and afraid of being taken away. Who wouldn’t be? The consensus is that you are all working as a team to help this person get the help she needs.You will need to reassure the person by saying, “These people are here to help you and they want the best for you. I want the best for you too. I know this might seem scary, but this will all work out.”
If a crime has been committed the person will likely be taken in and processed.
If the person violates a restraining order the police will arrest the person. They may bring in an emergency services team, which will include a physician who can commit the person.

, If it is appropriate to ride in the emergency vehicle with the person to the hospital, then do so. Drive or get a ride to the hospital where they are taking the person for evaluation. You will need to be present to provide essential health related information they will need to perform a psychiatric evaluation.


This might be very difficult, but you must find the courage to help this person.
Keep in mind that you would appreciate the same accommodation should something like this happen to you.

, The moment is difficult when you realize that the only way the person can be helped is if they admit her for further evaluation. An emergency hospitalization for mental illness in a treatment facility will be temporary in nature. There are many things to be considered. Depending on the circumstance, a person can be held involuntarily for 72 hours or longer., Once the person is committed, you will have limited time to organize and put a plan into action. Where will the person stay when they are released? Are children involved, and if so who will they stay with? What out-patient treatment will the person need? Are there any support groups or organizations that can provide guidance?


Although the person might be held for a 72 hours period, they may be released early and without your knowledge. Anticipate this and ask the doctor or nurses, “If she is released prior to the end of the 72 hour hold I need you to contact me as soon as possible.”
They may not share this information if you are not family or authorized to hear private medical information per HIPAA regulations., The person may be very close to you: a parent, spouse, or child, perhaps. If she has a mental illness, you're not hurting her by having her committed—you are giving her an opportunity to heal, or at least get the treatment she needs. You are also doing this in a way that will prevent her from causing physical or emotional injury to others.

, If you are struggling to manage the stress and anxiety related to helping a friend or loved one with a mental illness, find someone to talk to who can help. Psychologists and Psychiatrists are available in your local area and can be located through the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association.

, Once released, a person who must manage mental illness will need structure in her life. You can be a big part of making that happen. A welcoming attitude might be exactly what the person needs. Every person has a need to feel a sense of belonging, and you can foster that for the person., It is important that she takes her medication, and attends therapy or support group meetings. These are likely to be a requirement of any treatment program.


Help the person be accountable to her program. Ask her if there is anything you can do to help her stay committed to attending. Be kind, but don't let her slack off.

, Be resourceful if the person needs your help in the future.Mental illness is a disease therefore it can be managed, but not cured. Relapses will most likely happen, and everyone involved should not consider a relapse a failure. However, treatment will be needed following each relapse.


Once you go through the process of helping a person with a mental illness, you will have the know-how, confidence and information necessary to help others.

, You must understand that many others have felt exactly what you are feeling and have struggled with getting a person with a mental illness the help they need. Fight the urge to push yourself to the outside where you might isolate yourself and not get the help that you need.

Know thyself.,
Plan ahead.,
Dress for success.,
Know what your practitioner wants from you.,
Be specific without being verbose.

,
Give a chronological account.",How to Get the Most out of Your Doctor Visit," Each individual is unique. Bodies are different, symptoms are different, and reactions to medications (for better or for worse) are different for each patient. No doctor will know your body better than you know yourself. Your doctor will be looking for what has changed or is different, and they must rely on you for that information.;
, Many patients arrive without consciously identifying their goals for the visit. Make a short list of specific concerns you would like to discuss, starting with the most important ones.

, Your practitioner needs to see and often feel the parts of the body in question. Time spent dressing and undressing is time you could be spending face to face with the doctor. For example, if you have a cough and ask if you might have pneumonia, or if you have concerns about your heart, expect to have to take off your shirt (and bra, if appropriate) to have them listen to all parts of your lungs and heart. Wear a shirt that buttons all the way down.

, Primary care practitioner have an average of 10-15 minutes to spend per patient, from start to finish, including asking you all their questions, performing a physical examination, determining a diagnosis, and prescribing whatever treatments are necessary, then to write it all down in your permanent medical record. You can count on a practitioner asking an alphabet of questions, with a common medical mnemonic being “(O)-P-Q-R-S-T”: Pain (“Where does it hurt?), Quality (“What does it feel like?”), Radiation (“Does it move anywhere?”), Scale (“How bad is it? How much does it affect you?”), Timing (“When did it start? How long does it last? Does it come and go? Is it gradual or sudden in onset? What makes it better or worse?”), and Other (“Any other symptoms?”) The quicker you get those details out in the open, the quicker your practitioner can help you get to a diagnosis (and to a solution).

,, While you should not start from the dawn of time and creep forward, a good place to start is “this seems to have started (so many days ago) with…”

Check the state’s insolvency statute.,
Determine when medical expenses are to be paid.,
Start making payments in accordance with the law.,
Pay the medical expenses if funds are available.",How to Handle a Decedent's Uninsured Medical Expenses2," An estate is considered insolvent when its debts are greater than the value of its assets. When this happens, not every debt will be able to be paid off. State law will dictate the manner and order in which estate debts will be paid from an insolvent estate. Each insolvency statute will have an order of priority in which you must make debt payments.


Each category of debt defined in the state statute must be paid off in full before you can move on and start paying debts from the next category.
Because each debt within a single category is given equal priority, if the estate does not have enough assets to pay for all the debts in a single category, the creditors in that category will all receive a pro rata share of the available assets.Once every estate asset has been liquidated and used to pay debts, no other creditor will be paid (absent an exception to the rule - e.g., the necessaries doctrine).

, While each state's insolvency statute will vary, the general order of priority is usually the same. For example, in Virginia, you must pay debts in the following order:Costs and expenses of estate administration (e.g., probate fees, attorneys' fees, administrator commissions)Family and homestead allowances (e.g., a sum of money paid to support the surviving spouse)
Funeral expenses currently not to exceed $4,000
Federal debts and taxes
Certain medical and hospital expenses, which only extends to the decedent's last illness and is capped at between $425 and $2,150
State debts and taxes
Debts obtained while decedent was acting as fiduciary
Local debts and taxes
All other debts, which will include any outstanding uninsured medical expenses that were not paid for earlier

, To start making payments from an insolvent estate, compile the estate's debts into their respective categories. For example, if the estate has probate fees and attorneys' fees, you will put those debts in the same stack at the top of your list. If the estate has federal debts, you will put them in the same stack but they will be placed in line after the more senior debts. Once you have lined up all of the estate's debts in the order they must be paid, you can start making payments.


Start by adding up the total amount of debt owed in the most senior category (i.e., costs and expenses of administration). If the estate's value exceeds the value of these debts, pay all of these debts in full. For example, assume you are paying the expenses of administration, which equal $3,000. Next assume the estate's assets currently equal $10,000. In this example, you will be able to pay all of the expenses of administration, in full, and the estate will be left with $7,000.
Once one category of debt has been paid in full, you can move to the next category. If at any time the total value of debts in a single category exceeds the value of the remaining estate, you will not be able to pay that category of debts in full. Instead you will have to pay each debt in the category on a pro rata basis. For example, assume you are paying five different federal debts, each one amounting to $1,000. Next assume you only have $2,500 in estate assets to pay the debt. In this example, each debt makes up 1/5 of the category, so each creditor will receive 1/5 of the remaining estate assets. Here, each creditor in this category will receive $500 (i.e., 1/5 of $2,500).

, If funds are available when you reach a category that includes the decedent's uninsured medical expenses, you will pay them in full, up to the capped amount set by law, or on a pro rata basis depending on the situation.


If you are able to pay the medical expenses in full, the debt will be satisfied.
If you hit the cap and still owe money, you will have to push the debt down the priority list to the next applicable category. If any money remains when you reach that category, you will again have to decide whether you can pay the rest of the debt in full or whether you will have to pay a pro rata share.
If you can only pay a pro rata share because not enough assets are available in the estate, you will pay the appropriate share and the rest of the medical debt will be discharged unless an exception exists (i.e., it will go away and the creditor will simply lose the money owed to them).

"
"
Contact a lawyer.,
Ask about the common law “necessaries doctrine.” When you talk to the lawyer about the situation you are in, you should first explain your concern about not being able to pay off the medical debts of the decedent.,
Determine if the doctrine applies.,
Inform the spouse of your findings.",How to Handle a Decedent's Uninsured Medical Expenses3," In some states a surviving spouse might be liable for the medical debts of the other spouse if the decedent's estate cannot pay the debt itself. If you, as an administrator, have done an accounting and determined that the uninsured medical expenses might go unpaid because the decedent's estate is insolvent, you should contact a lawyer. Probate lawyers will quickly be able to advise you on the possibility of the medical debt being pushed off on a surviving spouse. To find a lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with various qualified lawyers in your area.


The lawyer will be paid with assets from the estate and you will not be personally responsible for paying the lawyer for his or her services. However, if the fees are unreasonably high, the probate court may reject them and you may be responsible for paying them on your own. Also, it may be difficult to hire a lawyer if there are not enough estate funds available to pay him or her.

, Next, ask the lawyer about the common law necessaries doctrine. Under this doctrine, if the medical expenses were incurred by a spouse who was still married to the other spouse when death occurred, and the deceased spouse does not have the assets to pay the debt, the surviving spouse would be liable for them.


This doctrine is exceedingly uncommon in part because of its discriminatory nature against women. This is the case because the original doctrine only flowed one way (i.e., women had to pay for the man's medical expenses but not the other way around). For example, Alabama found the doctrine unconstitutional and does not apply it anymore.
However, some states have modified the doctrine so that it is gender neutral and flows both ways (i.e., both a husband and a wife can be liable for the other's unpaid medical expenses). For example, in New Jersey, both spouses are liable for the necessary expenses incurred by either spouse. The income and assets of the surviving spouse will only be exposed if the deceased spouse does not have assets of his/her own to satisfy the debt., Ask the lawyer if the necessaries doctrine applies in your state, and if so, to what extent it applies. If the lawyer tells you there is a distinct possibility the surviving spouse could be liable for the remaining medical expenses that can't be paid by the decedent's estate, you might have to (or want to) take certain actions to inform the surviving spouse.

, If the doctrine applies, you should tell the surviving spouse about it. This will give them a chance to consult an attorney about the debt, the doctrine, and how it can be handled.

Define medical expenses.,
Analyze your options for the tax treatment of medical expenses.,
Pay the expenses and claim them on the decedent’s income tax return.,
Count the unpaid medical expenses as liabilities on Form 706.",How to Handle a Decedent's Uninsured Medical Expenses4," As the estate's administrator, you will not only have to handle the estate's debts but you will also have to file the decedent's income tax return and estate tax return. When a decedent has outstanding qualified medical expenses, you will have to determine how to handle them for federal tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) usually defines medical expenses as only those that are not reimbursed (i.e., uninsured expenses). For tax purposes, you must reduce the decedent's medical expenses by the amount of insurance reimbursement the decedent receives.For example, if the decedent was charged $10,000 for medical care but $7,000 was covered by insurance, the decedent's medical expenses would amount to $3,000.

, If medical expenses are paid by the decedent before death, those expenses are deductible on the final income tax return (Form 1040) you will fill out on his or her behalf. In addition, if the decedent's medical expenses are paid out of the estate within one year of death, you can treat the expenses as paid by the decedent when they were incurred (i.e. you can deduct them on Form 1040).


However, if the medical expenses are not paid and you do not elect to pay them within one year of the decedent's death, they will be considered liabilities of the estate and you will have to claim them on the estate tax return (Form 706)., If the estate is able to pay the uninsured medical expenses and they are paid within one year of the decedent's death, the expenses can be deducted on Form 1040 only to the extent they exceed 10% of the decedent's adjusted gross income (or 7.5% if the decedent was 65 or older).


If you elect to make this deduction, you will do it by attaching a statement to the return. The statement will simply say you are making the election.
If you elect to take the Form 1040 deduction, you will be barred from counting any unpaid debt as a liability on Form 706 (i.e., you can only choose one option)., If the decedent is wealthy (i.e., they have an estate worth around $5.43 million), you should consider counting unpaid medical expenses as liabilities because liabilities will reduce the value of your taxable estate. If the decedent's estate exceeds the filing threshold ($5.43 million), reducing the value of the estate by including more liabilities will help you reduce the amount of estate taxes owed.


The estate tax rate (40%) is much higher than most income tax rates, which means you want to decrease your estate value as much as possible if you are hovering around the filing threshold.
However, if the estate is not even close to the $5.43 million threshold, you should automatically take the income tax deduction if the estate can pay the medical expenses."

Gather your supplies.,
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.,
Inspect your insulin.,
Fill the syringe.,
Avoid putting more than one type of insulin in a single syringe.,
Give your injection.,
Pinch the skin.,
Inject your dose using a quick dart-like motion.,
Place the needle and syringe into a sharps container.",How to Give Yourself Insulin2," Insulin administration using a syringe and needle is still one of the most common methods people use to take their insulin.


Start by making sure you have everything you need, including your insulin syringe and needle, alcohol pads, the insulin, and a sharps container nearby.
Remove the insulin vial from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before it is time for your dose to allow the insulin to reach room temperature.Check the dating on your insulin vial before you proceed. Do not use expired insulin or insulin that has been opened for more than 28 days., Dry them completely with a clean towel.Be sure your injection site is clean and dry. Clean the area with soap and water if needed before you begin.Avoid wiping the area with alcohol. If you do wipe the area with alcohol, give the area time to air dry before you administer the dose., Many people use more than one type of insulin. Look carefully at the label to be sure you have the correct product for the scheduled dose.If the insulin vial is in a container or has a cover, remove it and carefully wipe the bottle with an alcohol wipe. Let the bottle air dry, and do not blow on it.Inspect the liquid inside. Check for any visible clumps or particles floating inside the vial. Be sure the vial is not cracked or damaged.Insulins that are clear should not be shaken or rolled. As long as they remain clear they can be given without mixing.Some types of insulin are naturally cloudy. Cloudy insulins should be gently rolled between your hands to mix them properly. Do not shake the insulin., Know the dose you need to administer. Remove the cap from the needle, taking care not to touch the needle with your fingers or to any surface in order to keep it sterile.Pull back the plunger of the syringe to the same mark as the amount of insulin you intend to remove from the vial.Push the needle through the top of the vial, and push the plunger to inject the amount of air you just put in the syringe.Keeping the needle in the vial and the syringe as straight as possible, turn the bottle upside down.Hold the vial and syringe in one hand, and gently pull back on the plunger to withdraw the exact amount of insulin needed with the other.Check the liquid in the syringe for air bubbles. With the needle still inside the vial and still holding it upside down, gently tap the syringe to move air bubbles to the top part of the syringe. Push the air back into the vial, and withdraw more insulin if needed to be sure you have the correct amount in the syringe.Carefully pull the needle from the bottle, and place the syringe on a clean surface without allowing the needle to touch anything., Many people use different types of insulin to cover their blood sugar needs for a longer period of time.If you use more than one type of insulin for each injection, the insulins must be drawn up into the syringe in a specific order and according to your doctor’s instructions.If your doctor has instructed you to use more than one type of insulin at a single injection, draw the insulins up exactly as your doctor directed.
Be sure you know the the amount of each insulin you need, which product to put in the syringe first, and the total amount of insulin that should be in the syringe when you are finished drawing up both insulins.The shorter acting insulin product, which is clear, is drawn into the syringe first, followed by the longer acting product, which is cloudy.You should always go from clear to cloudy when mixing the insulin.

, Avoid scars and moles by one inch, and do not give insulin within two inches of your navel.Avoid bruised areas or areas that are swollen or tender., The insulin is to be administered into the fat layer just under the surface of the skin. This is called a subcutaneous injection. Creating skin folds by gently pinching the skin helps to prevent injecting into muscle tissue.Insert the needle at either a 45 degree or 90 degree angle. The angle of the needle insertion depends on the injection site, the thickness of the skin, and the length of the needle.
In some cases where the skin or fatty tissue is thicker, you may be able to insert the needle at a 90 degree angle.Your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider will guide you in understanding the areas on your body that should be pinched and the angle of insertion for each injection site., Push the needle all the way into the skin and slowly push the plunger of the syringe to deliver your dose. Be sure the plunger is completely depressed.Leave the needle in place for five seconds after injecting, then pull the needle out of the skin at the same angle it went in.Release the skin fold. In some cases, diabetic healthcare providers recommend releasing the skin fold just after needle entry. Talk to your doctor about your insulin injections specific to your body.Sometimes insulin leaks from the injection site. If this is the case with you, then gently press the site for several seconds. If this problem continues, talk to your doctor., Keep the sharps container in a safe place away from children and pets.Both needles and syringes are only to be used once.Each time a needle punctures the top of the vial and the skin, the needle becomes dulled. Dulled needles cause more pain, plus they carry a much greater risk of infection."
"
Prime the pen device.,
Administer the insulin.,
Use your pen only for your own injections.,
Dispose of your used needle.",How to Give Yourself Insulin3," Allowing a few drops of insulin to drop from the needle tip ensures there are no air bubbles and nothing is obstructing the flow of insulin.Once your pen is ready to use, dial the dose you need to administer.Using a fresh needle, a primed device, and the correct dose dialed on the pen device, you are ready to administer the injection.Follow your doctor's instructions on pinching the skin and the angle of entry in order to more effectively administer the insulin.

, Once you have pushed the thumb button completely in, count slowly to ten before withdrawing the needle.If you are administering a larger dose, your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider may instruct you to count beyond ten to ensure the dose is properly delivered.Counting to ten or beyond ensures that you get the full dose intended and helps to prevent leakage from the injection site when you withdraw the needle., Insulin pens and cartridges should not be shared.Even with fresh needles, there is still a significant risk of transferring skin cells, disease, or infection from one person to another., As soon as you have given yourself the injection, promptly remove and discard the needle.Do not leave the needle attached to the pen. Removing the needle prevents insulin from leaking from the pen.Removing the needle also prevents air and other contaminants from entering the pen.Always discard used needles appropriately by placing them in a sharps container."
"
Keep a chart.,
Rotate your injections clockwise at each site.,
Minimize the pain.,
Pinch your skin properly.,
Choose the best needle length for you.",How to Give Yourself Insulin4," Many people find it helpful to keep a chart of the sites as they are used so they can routinely rotate their injection sites.The areas of your body that are most suitable for insulin injections include the abdomen, the thigh, and the buttocks. The upper arm area can also be used if enough fatty tissue is present., Develop a system that works for you to consistently rotate your injection sites. Continue to move around your body using new sites for each injection.Using a clockwise strategy is helpful for many people to help rotate their injection sites.
Use a chart or drawing of your body areas to identify the sites you just used or are planning to use. Your diabetic healthcare provider or doctor can help you develop a system to rotate your injection sites.Inject into your abdomen, two inches away from your navel and not too far towards your sides. Looking into a mirror, begin on the upper left of the injection area, move next to the upper right area, then lower right, then lower left.Move to your thighs. Begin closest to your upper body, then move the next injection site further down.In your buttocks, start with your left side and closer to your side, then move towards your midline, then to the right side and towards the midline, then to the areas closer to your right side.If your arms are appropriate according to your doctor or healthcare provider, move systematically either up or down with injection sites in those areas.
Keep track of the sites as you use them in a systematic manner., One way to help minimize the pain upon injection is to avoid injections at hair roots.Use needles with shorter lengths and smaller diameters. Shorter needles help to minimize the pain and are appropriate for most people.Acceptable shorter needle lengths include those that are either 4.5 mm, 5 mm, or 6 mm in length., Some injection sites or needle lengths work best if you gently pinch the skin to create skin folds.Use only the thumb and index finger to lift the skin. Using more of your hand causes muscle tissue to be lifted and increases the risk of injecting your insulin into muscle tissue.Do not squeeze the skin fold. Gently hold the skin in place to give the injection. Squeezing tightly can cause more pain and possibly interfere with the dose delivery., Shorter needles are appropriate for most patients, can be easier to use, and are less painful.Consult with your doctor about which needle is appropriate for you.


The purpose of using shorter needles, pinching the skin, and injecting at a 45 degree angle is to avoid injecting the insulin into muscle tissue.Consider the need to use skin folds as you rotate your injection sites. Injecting into areas with thinner skin layers and more muscle tissue often require pinching the skin and injecting at an angle.Talk to your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider for instruction on the areas of your body that would need for the skin to be pinched to create skin folds even when using the shorter needle lengths.
In many cases, there is no need to lift or pinch the skin when using the shorter needles.Injections with the shorter needles can often be given at a 90 degree angle when there is enough fatty tissue present at the injection site."

Consider using an insulin pump.,
Recognize the disadvantages of insulin pumps.,
Adjust to your pump.,
Ask your doctor about a jet injector.,
Use inhaled insulin devices.",How to Give Yourself Insulin5," Insulin pumps consist of a small catheter inserted into your skin with a small needle, which is held in place with an adhesive dressing. The catheter is attached to a pump device unit that holds, and delivers your insulin through the catheter. Using pumps have both advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages to using an insulin pump include the following:Pumps eliminate the need for insulin injections.Insulin doses are more accurately delivered.Pumps often improve the longer term management of diabetes as indicated by blood level measurements of your hemoglobin A1c.Pumps provide constant insulin delivery in some cases which eliminates the swings in your blood glucose levels.They make it easier to deliver an extra dose when needed.People that use pumps have fewer hypoglycemic episodes.Pumps allow more flexibility in when and what you eat, and allow you to exercise without the need to consume extra carbohydrates., According to the American Diabetes Association, even though there are disadvantages to using an insulin pump, most people that use one agree that the positives outweigh the negatives.Some disadvantages to using an insulin pump include the following:Pumps are reported to cause weight gain.Serious reactions including diabetic ketoacidosis can occur if the catheter unknowingly becomes dislodged,Insulin pumps can be expensive.Some people find it troubling to be connected to the device, which is usually worn on a belt or top of a skirt or pants, practically all the time.Insulin pumps often require hospitalization for a day or more for the catheter to be inserted, and for you to be properly trained on how to use it., Using an insulin pump alters your daily routines.Develop a routine to limit the time you turn it off, or take it off.
Have back-up pens or insulin vials and syringes available if the pump is not working properly.Learn to account for extra carbohydrates consumed in order to adjust the dose delivered through your pump.Keep accurate records of your blood glucose levels. Daily records with additional notes of exercise times and extra foods consumed are best. Some people record information three days each week, spread out through the week, to provide a good balance of information.Your doctor will use your logs to adjust your insulin dosing and improve the overall care of your condition.Usually about three months of of average blood sugar levels will give your doctor a good idea of how well your diabetes is controlled.

, Insulin jet injectors do not use needles to get the insulin dose through the skin.Instead, insulin jet injectors use strong air pressure, or blasts of air, to spray the insulin through your skin.Jet injectors are very expensive and somewhat complicated to use. This form of technology is new. Talk with your doctor if you are considering this method of delivering your insulin dose.In addition to their high cost, some risks have been identified such as improper dose delivery and trauma to the skin.Research is ongoing to determine the risks and benefits of administering insulin in this manner., Some forms of rapid-acting insulin are now available in the form of inhalers, similar to the inhalers used to treat asthma.Inhaled insulin is to be administered just before meals.You will still need to administer your primary long-acting insulin by another method.Several manufacturers have made insulin inhalers available in the United States, but the research in this area is ongoing. Much is still to be learned about the risks and benefits of using insulin by the inhaled method."

Talk about your worries.,
Spend less time on the computer.,
Keep your hands busy.,

Try aromatherapy.,
Recognize your worries and move on.,

Think about social influences.,
Live in the moment.",How to Stop Worrying," If worrying is interfering with your day-to-day life and you can't stop, try putting off your worries until later. Give yourself permission to worry, but only during certain times of the day.For example, you might set aside a half an hour after dinner each day for worrying. If a worry pops into your head at any other time, you can recognize it, but just tell yourself ""I'll think about that later.""This technique lets you set your worries aside for awhile so you can get through your day.;
, A study from the University of Chicago shows that writing your worries down can help you let go of them.Writing your worries down can help make the problem feel more manageable.


This strategy works well with postponing your worries. Making note of them on the list can help you feel like you can let your worries go until ""worry time."" Then, when it is worry time, you can just go over your list., Talking through your worries can also help. It can put things in perspective and help you get to the root of your issues.Be aware though that too much of this can be hard for your friends. If this is an ongoing issue, consider seeing a counselor or other mental health professional.

, Recent studies have shown that people who rely on computers and other devices for social interaction suffer from more anxiety.Consider cutting down on your screen time to help with excess worrying.Social media use in particular may lead to conflict, and comparison of yourself with others. It can also make it harder to relax. All this can promote worry.Switching off your devices several times a day can give you more control over your relationship with technology., Doing something with your hands, such as knitting or using ""worry beads"" may help reduce stress and worry.Recent studies by the Medical Research Council show that keeping your hands busy during troubling events may reduce how much they bother you later.The research has not discovered any impact on worries about things that have already happened. But, if you are in a troubling situation, do something patterned and repetitive with your hands. It might reduce worries about it later., Exercising is not just good for your body. It is also an effective way to decrease the anxiety that leads to worry.Regular exercise may be more effective than prescription drugs for decreasing your anxiety levels.


Research on animals shows that exercise increases levels of serotonin. This is a brain chemical that relieves anxiety and makes you feel happier., Taking slow deep breaths activates the vagus nerve, which can help reduce stress and worry.Some people recommend taking ""4-7-8"" breaths when worried. To do this, exhale completely through your mouth. Then, inhale through your nose, counting to four as you do so. Hold your breath for seven seconds. Finally, exhale through your mouth, counting to eight as you do so., Medical research shows that meditating affects the brain in ways that decrease worrying. If you are a persistent worrier learning how to meditate may be very helpful.


Meditation increases activity in the Ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls worrying.It also grounds you in the present moment. Meditation, done right, should make it impossible to think about future problems, at least while you are meditating.

, Recent medical studies support the claim that the scents of certain essential oils can reduce stress and worry. In particular, the smell of grapefruit was shown to be effective in this area.Essential oils and other aromatherapy products are available in many health stores and natural food shops. You can also try just smelling a grapefruit!

, Sometimes, trying to suppress your worries seems to just make them worse. So, don't try to ignore your worries. When they pop into your head, accept them, but then try to move on.It is hard to avoid thinking about something you are actively trying not to think about.Writing your worries down or setting a designated ""worry time"" can be very helpful in letting them pass., When you do think about your worries, a good way to process them is to categorize them. Specifically, for each try to determine the following:



Is this problem one you can solve, or not? If a worry is about a problem you have the power to fix, the best remedy may be to start fixing it. Once you have a plan to fix the problem, you will be less worried. If you cannot solve the problem, accept it, work through it and move on. Is this worry about something that is likely, or unlikely, to happen? A worry about something that is likely to happen may indeed be troubling. On the other hand, if you decide it is not likely to occur, this can be a first step in letting that worry go.Is this worry about something about something really bad, or not? Think about what it is that you are worried might happen. If it did occur, how bad would it really be? Most things we worry about aren't actually that terrible. If you decide it wouldn't be a catastrophe, this can help you let go. That's doubly true if it also isn't that likely to happen!Throughout this process, try to think rationally. Ask yourself what evidence you have that your worry is a realistic one. Think about what you might tell a friend who had the same worry. Try to imagine the most likely outcome, rather than the worst-case scenario., If there is a specific worry that bothers you often, you can try to make it boring, so your brain will return to it less often. Do this by repeating it in your head again and again for several minutes.For example, if you worry that you might get in a car accident, repeat in your head the words ""I might get in a car accident, I might get in a car accident."" In the short term, this may increase you anxiety. But, after a little while, the words will lose their power and become boring to you. Chances are, they'll stop popping up in your mind so often after that.

, An important change in your thinking is accepting that life is unpredictable and imperfect. This is key to stopping worries in the long term. A good place to start this change is with a writing exercise. Jot down your answers to these questions:Is it possible to be certain about everything that might happen?
In what way is needing certainty helpful to you?
Do you tend to predict bad things will happen just because you are uncertain? Is that reasonable?
Can you live with the possibility that a bad thing might happen, if that outcome is not likely?
When worries come to mind, try to remind yourself of your answers to these questions.

, Emotions can be contagious. If you spend a lot of time with other worriers, or people who make you anxious, you may want to reconsider how much time you are spending with those people.Spend some time thinking about the people you spend time with, and how they affect you. It may even be helpful to keep a ""worry diary"" that tracks when you worry most. If you find that it's right after seeing a certain person, you may decided you need to spend less time with him or her. Or, you might decide there are certain topics you don't wish to discuss with this person any more.
Changing your social circle can change the way you think.

, Most worries rise from fears about the future, rather than our immediate surroundings. Focusing on you surroundings and the moment you are experiencing can be a good way to shut down worries.Some people recommend a ""stop, look, listen"" technique. In this approach, when you are worrying, stop and recognize the worry. Take a deep breath. Then, look at your surroundings. Spend five minutes focusing on the details of the world around you. As you do so, speak calmly and reassure yourself that things will work out."

Humidify the air in your home.",How to Get Rid of Catarrh," Dehydration can make catarrh worse. You should sip water throughout the day. This can help loosen mucus in the throat, lessening your symptoms. Opt for cold water, as this will chill your throat slightly. This can help minimize irritation.Sipping water can help ease symptoms like itchiness, which you may be tempted to deal with by cleaning your throat. Clearing your throat can actually make catarrh worse, so sip water when you feel the temptation to clear you throat.
Carry a cold water bottle with you at all times. This way, if you want to clear your throat, you can quickly sip water instead.
Keep a water bottle with you at school or work. Make sure to drink water with meals.;
, You can buy a saline nasal rinse at most pharmacies and drug stores. You can also buy one from your doctor. You can also make one at home by placing half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of water. Let it boil and then use the water when it's cold.Usually, you use a small suction device with a bulb on the end to draw the nasal saline spray in. You then insert the tip of the device into your nose and squeeze the bulb to release the spray.You then breathe in through your mouth. The solution should come out the opposite nostril. You can blow your nose to get rid of any remaining solution.
This does not work for everyone. If your symptoms worsen using decongestant sprays, talk to your doctor about other medications to explore.

, Boil water and then inhale the steam, as this may help loosen mucus in the back of your throat. It can help to add a small amount of menthol crystals or eucalyptus oil to the water. Make sure not to place your face too close to the pot, as you want to avoid getting burnt.Young children should not use this method.

, Oil-pulling is one of the best ways to get rid of catarrh. To do oil-pulling, put about a tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth and swish it around for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then, spit out the oil. Repeat this once daily., Dissolve 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of salt in an 8-ounce glass of water. Then, garble the water for a few seconds. Spit it back into the sink. This may help alleviate symptoms of catarrh., Some over-the-counter medications can help ease catarrh. Decongestants, antihistamines, and steroid nasal sprays can help with catarrh that does not improve with home treatment.Do not use over-the-counter medications without consulting a pharmacist, especially if you have health conditions or are taking existing mediations. Some medications are not safe for everyone.
You can also try Mucinex to help thin out mucus. Make sure to drink lots of water along with the medication.

, Usually, catarrh will pass on its own without treatment. However, long lasting catarrh can become difficult to live with. Your catarrh is intense and does not respond to treatment, make an appointment with your doctor. You may have an underlying condition that needs to be addressed., Catarrh can be caused by conditions such as nasal polyps or allergies. If your doctor suspects one of these conditions is causing catarrh, you may be referred to a specialist for evaluation.You may have to undergo an allergy test to rule out allergies.
Treatment depends on the cause of your catarrh. Nasal polyps, for example, may be treated with nasal sprays that contain steroids., Sometimes, the cause of chronic catarrh is unclear. If your doctor cannot find a clear cause, they may advise you on specific self-help techniques. These techniques will be specific to you and your conditions. Go over self-help techniques with your doctor and ask any questions you have. You want to follow your doctor's instructions carefully to help treat catarrh., Catarrh, especially when caused by allergies, may be triggered by environmental hazards. Try to minimize your exposure to anything that tends to trigger outbursts.If you have any allergens you know of, such as pollen, minimize your exposure to them throughout the day.
Smoky places tend to trigger catarrh, so stay away from areas prone to smoke.

, Air conditioners and heaters tend to dry out air. This can make catarrh worse or trigger it again after it passes. Try to stay away from such environments.If you work in an office that uses an air conditioner or heater, request to sit away from the unit to avoid triggering catarrh.

, Dry air can make you more prone to catarrh. Buy a humidifier to moisten the air in your home. This can help prevent you from developing catarrh again.You can buy a humidifier online or at a department store.

, It's important that someone is in the room with you if you are planning a surgery or hearing important information about your health care.

, This is very important, as each one must know what the other is doing so your care can be coordinated and understood by all parties

, Although they usually ask what you are taking,they often don't read what is in front of them.

, Pharmacists usually know more about the interactions of medications than doctors. It's their specialty.

, Doctors are very pressed for time but even if you've waited long passed your appointment time, you need to get the answers you came for, and you need their full attention while you are there. Don't feel guilty or rushed; this is YOUR time with the provider.

, Again, no need to feel embarrassed or guilty for 'taking up their time' It's your body, your health, and your concerns. Plus, you are paying them plenty.

Touch the pimple with clean hands.,
Wipe the pimple with alcohol.,
Clean the area with witch hazel.,
Wash the pimple.,
Apply acne cream.,
Apply ointment gel.,
Use peroxide.,
Let them heal naturally.",How to Get Rid of Pimples Inside the Ear1," Before touching the pimple, make sure that you wash your hands one to two times. Touching pimples with unclean hands can cause the pimples to get worse, since dirt and oil may further block your pores., One way to start healing the pimple is to wipe it with an alcohol pad. This also helps keep it from getting infected and stops the spread of any infection., Witch hazel is another disinfectant that can help clear up and prevent ear pimples. Wipe the ear area with a cotton ball or swab coated in witch hazel., Wash the area with the pimple with water as warm as you can stand it. Also use natural soap or an oil-free cleanser. This cleanser should contain Salicylic Acid, which helps unclog pores and heal pimples. For inside the ear, use a warm or hot washcloth or Q-tip to wash and massage the pimple. Don't rub the pimple; that can cause further irritation.Be very careful when using the Q-tip — do not insert it into your ear canal. Only use it to swab the outside of your ear.

, To help reduce the pimple, apply acne cream that includes two to 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. Let the cream dry on the pimple.You can also apply 10% Glycolic Acid cream.

, Try placing some Neosporin or other ointment cream or gel to help heal the pimple. Let the gel dry., Soak a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and spread it on the pimple. If the pimple is inside the ear canal, you can pour peroxide into the ear. Drain the peroxide into a bowl or onto a cotton swab.

, Pimples in the ear are just like any other pimple. Ear pimples tend to be caused by a buildup of dirt, shampoo, and earwax. The key is to leave them alone and they will heal.


Don't try to pop them, even if this is what you normally do with pimples. Aural pimples (pimples on the ear) are not only painful when squeezed, but if they are on the fleshy lobe of the ear or inside the ear, they can bleed for some time afterwards and cause more problems.

Ask your doctor for a demonstration.,
Avoid using any insulin product if you are allergic.,
Do not administer insulin if you are having a hypoglycemic event.,
Monitor your skin for lipodystrophy.,
Discard used needles properly.,
Never re-use or share a needle.,
Do not change insulin brands.,
Never use insulin that has expired.,
Discard insulin that has been open for 28 days.,
Know your products and your dose.",How to Give Yourself Insulin6," Do not rely on articles or videos online to teach you how to administer insulin, whether it's via a syringe, inhaler, or another device. Your doctor can answer any questions and show you the correct way to use your device (for instance, with shots she will need to show you at which angle you should insert the needle). Your doctor will also give you your exact dosage and all the necessary prescriptions.

, Seek medical attention immediately if you experience an allergic reaction.


Some insulins are derived from animal sources, most commonly pork, and may cause allergic reactions in people that have severe allergies.Common allergic reactions to insulin include local and systemic reactions. Local reactions occur as redness, minor swelling, and itching at the injection site. This type of skin reaction resolves in a few days to weeks.Systemic allergic reactions can present as a rash or hives that covers large portions of the body, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing, decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and sweating.This is a medical emergency and you should call 911 or have someone take you to the emergency room if it is close by.

, Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level is too low.Insulin will make hypoglycemia worse; instead, you will need to consumer quick-acting carbohydrates or simple sugars.


Low blood sugar interferes with your brain’s ability to function properly.
Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include dizziness, trembling, headache, blurred vision, having trouble concentrating, confusion, and sometimes trouble with speaking. Other symptoms can include tremor, heavy sweating, increased heart rate, feeling anxious, and hunger.</ref>
Using fast-acting insulin in the midst of a hypoglycemic event will quickly drop your blood sugar even further and result in severe confusion, inability to communicate, and loss of consciousness.If you mistakenly administer insulin when you are having a hypoglycemic event, quickly alert friends or family to seek medical attention, or call 911 if you are alone. Severe hypoglycemia events are serious and life-threatening situations.You can begin to reverse the reaction by drinking orange juice, taking prepared glucose tablets or gel, or quickly begin to consume some form of sugar., Lipodystrophy is a reaction that sometimes occurs on the skin where frequent insulin injections are given.Symptoms of lipodystrophy include changes in the fatty tissues just under the surface of the skin. Unwanted changes that indicate lipodystrophy include both thickening and thinning of the fatty tissue in the injection site areas.Check your skin regularly for lipodystrophy as well as inflammation, swelling, or any signs of infection., Never put syringes or needles in the regular trash.Sharps, including used needles, lancets, and syringes, are considered to be biohazardous waste since they came in direct contact with someone's skin or blood.Always dispose of needles that are used or damaged in a sharps container. Sharps containers are designed to be a safe way to dispose of syringes and needles.Sharps containers are available for purchase at your local pharmacy, or online.Review your state’s biohazardous waste guidelines. Many states have specific recommendations and programs that can help you develop a regular system for disposing of biohazardous waste.Work with a mail back kit. Some companies offer to supply you with the appropriate sizes of sharps containers, and agree to set up an arrangement for you to safely mail those containers back to them when they are full. The company will dispose of the biohazard materials appropriately, according to EPA, FDA, and state requirements., Once the injection has been given, discard the needle and syringe in a sharps container. When an insulin pen is empty, discard the device in the sharps container.


A needle that has pierced your skin, or the skin of someone else, is not only dulled, but contaminated with possibly serious and contagious diseases.

, Some insulin products are very similar but not exact. Talk to your doctor before you make any changes in your insulin regimen, including switching brands.Even though some brands are similar, your doctor has chosen the brand that best suits your needs, and your dose has been adjusted to the way that product reacts in your body.Use the same brand of syringes and needles. It is easy to become confused and administer the wrong amount if the syringes and needles look different.

, Check the expiration date on your insulin product often. Avoid using insulin that has passed its expiration date.While the potency may be close to the potency when purchased, there is a risk that you will not get enough from using products that have expired, contaminants may be present, or particles may have formed inside the vial., Once the first dose has been used from an insulin product, it is considered open.This includes insulin that has been properly stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Since the top of the insulin vial has been punctured, there is an increased risk of contaminants inside the vial, even if you have stored it properly., Be familiar with the brand of insulin you use, your dose, and the brand of additional supplies you use.Be sure you consistently use the same size insulin syringes and needles that were prescribed for you.Using a U-100 syringe in place of a U-500 syringe can be extremely dangerous, and vice versa.
Talk to your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider if you notice any changes in your products or have any questions."

Ask for something for you or a family member to take notes on. You can ask some questions later, but if you don't write them down you may forget for the few minutes you spend with the physician.
Many of the questions can be answered by other healthcare personnel, such as your nurse, as well.;
, You know your body and mind best. Your family can be just as valuable if you are not able to communicate, so make sure they know what you want and will follow through with it in case you cannot.

, Are you having elective surgery? Do you need IV antibiotics for an infection? Does your condition need monitoring? What does the procedure involve? What is the expected outcome? Your physician or Emergency Room/ A&E physician should explain this, but if you don't think you understand, don't be afraid to ask.

, Let your physician and nurse know if you want to consider alternative medical treatments while you are hospitalized.

, An exact answer may not be possible for various reasons, however, your should be able to get an approximation.

,,, Have a copy available to bring with you for the hospital staff.

, Something you can either grab yourself or a family member can bring in later.

, Common tests include blood pressure and blood oxygen testing and being given a identity wristband. Try and keep track of who you've seen so that you can feel confident later, when you haven't seem anyone for a while, that you've already been attended to.

, This will help alleviate some of the feelings of loss of control and anxiety that often accompanies hospitalization.


If something has not been explained, or you didn't fully understand the explanation, ask for clarification.
If you are admitted for emergent care, your healthcare workers may be very focused upon vital or life-saving treatments, and there may not be time for extended question and answer sessions, but they should do their best to make sure you understand.

,


For example: You are tired of getting needles stuck in your arm for blood tests every few hours. It hurts, you're bruised, and you just don't want to deal with it.
Consider that without that kind of monitoring, not only could your treatment be delayed, or not as effective, it could mean that your condition could worsen without your nurses and physicians being able to monitor it, causing you to spend more time in the hospital or suffer from complications.

, That is, after all, while you are there. If you need pain or nausea medication to be able to do so, let someone know. You are part of your healthcare team.

,, If you are anxious or unhappy about something, in pain, or need something, they need to know it. What they are not aware of, they can't fix.

, They are, almost without exception, in place to protect you, the patient.


For instance, if a hospital has policies in place to prevent falls. You may be well able to walk about and do things for yourself, but a nurse or aide may insist on helping to the bathroom, might making you feel helpless or silly.
What you may not be taking into consideration is that you may feel fine, but those pain pills you took a half hour ago have the potential to impair your judgment, at least a little. Also, if you're feeling a little out of it, then possibly the nurse has noticed something you haven't and wants to prevent you sustaining an injury. No one goes to the hospital and plans on falling while they are there, but it happens.

, There is a whole system of medication checking between the physician, the nurse, and the pharmacist, but the last stop is you. Mistakes can be made, and you can decrease that possibility even more. If you can, always check what you're taking and that it is the correct dosage for you. Remember, you might only receive a few pieces of medication a day, but a nurse may dole out hundreds. If unsure, it is always perfectly acceptable to get your nurse to double check.

, Whether you are having an elective surgery or and extended more difficult stay, you do not want either of these complications.

, Write them down or ask someone to write then down for you and make sure you ask the physician what the results were.

, This can avoid a lot of frustration and frayed nerves. Different areas have different laws and policies regarding information and if your family is worried, then a lack of knowledge may make them feel even more anxious.

Leave the compress on for 10 – 15 minutes. You can do this three to four times a day.This helps when you have a lot of painful inflammation.

, Wet a black tea bag with hot water. Place the tea bag over the pimple and cover with a hot, wet washcloth. The tannins combined with the heat will help reduce inflammation.

, Milk has alpha hydroxy acids, which help unclog pores and remove dead skin. Soak a cotton ball in milk, then squeeze it. Wipe the milk along the pimple. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then wash the area with lukewarm water. You can repeat 3-4 times a day., Tea tree oil has antibacterial properties that can kill the pimple causing bacteria. It also helps speed up the healing process. Spread the tea tree oil mixture on the pimple with a cotton ball.Always dilute tea tree oil. Use one part tea tree oil with nine parts water.

See a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Pimples Inside the Ear3," One of the most common reasons for ear pimples is lack of hygiene. Touching your ears with unwashed hands can transfer oil and bacteria to the skin, which clogs the pores and causes pimples., Make sure to keep the shell of your ear, your earlobes, and behind your ear cleaned. Shampoo, gel, and other hair products can get on the ear and cause pimples. Use soap and water and clean when you shower or wash your face and hair.Clean the inside of your ear when needed.

Find out if you have health insurance.One of the key things to look into as a young adult is whether or not you have some form of health insurance coverage in place.,
Find a doctor in your area.Many young people encounter the challenge of finding a new family doctor (and/or new specialists) when they move away from their hometown.,
Determine when you are due for your next routine checkup.There have been varying recommendations as to the frequency with which you should receive routine checkups.,
Schedule an appointment.,
Gather your relevant medical information for your doctor.It is important that your doctor has a full list of any ongoing health concerns or past serious health issues you have encountered (such as episodes requiring hospitalization, past surgeries, and/or other major health concerns that you have faced in your life).,
Be prepared to discuss your lifestyle choices openly.In order to do a full and thorough review of your overall health, your doctor will need to ask you personalized questions, including questions around your lifestyle.,
Disclose any new family history of disease.In order to assess your risk for various diseases, your doctor will also need to know a detailed family history.,
Take note of any specific concerns you have for this visit.Last but not least, as you prepare for your routine checkup, be sure to write down any unusual or concerning symptoms you have been experiencing lately.,
Discuss any new concerns and the plan for the appointment.Because appointments with your doctor generally take place with a limited time frame, it is important to set a plan at the start of the appointment as to what will be covered.,
Receive any general screening or vaccinations that you are due for.Your routine checkup is a chance to receive screening tests and/or vaccinations that you are due for.,
Have a physical exam.There are normally very few abnormal things that are found on a physical exam in young adults, simply because the probability of having serious health concerns at this age is much lower than it is in older adults.,
Talk about any changes to your health management.,
Do not wait for your routine checkup if you have a problem.If you have any concerns about your health, it is best to book an appointment with your family doctor sooner rather than later.,
Go to the Emergency Department for severe problems.,
See your doctor more often for ongoing health concerns.If you have ongoing health concerns, you will likely need to see your doctor more frequently, such as every three months.",How to Get Routine Checkups As a Young Adult," Some young people can remain on their parents' health insurance plans until the age of 26 (depending upon who is the provider of your parents' insurance), and some young people receive health insurance coverage options at discounted prices through their college or university.


To determine if you have health insurance, ask a parent, check with your school, or check your former insurer's website to see if your past coverage is still valid. The key thing is to find out whether or not you currently have coverage and, if not, to look into getting some to help with the costs of your medical visits and medications.
If you already have a connection with a healthcare provider, such as a family doctor, you can ask him or her about common insurance plans that his or her patients have, as well as which health insurance he or she recommends for you.
It is wise to consult the doctors you will be seeing about health insurance (if you do not have any), to ensure that the coverage you purchase will be most effective for you (and will cover the doctors you choose to see).
Coverage in the United States can be purchased through marketplace from November 1st of the year prior to it taking effect (for example, November 1, 2015, to purchase insurance for the year of 2016) all the way through to January 31 of the year the insurance applies to (in this same example, January 31, 2016, to purchase insurance for the year of 2016). If you miss this three month registration period, you will need to wait until the following year to purchase health insurance.You may also have to pay a penalty fee for not being insured.
For families and people with low income, the Medicaid Program in the United States may be an option.Other countries may offer universal healthcare coverage to everyone.;
, This often happens when young adults go away to college, or move for other major life transitions. It can be hard to find a doctor in a new town, particularly if there is a shortage of doctors in that area who are accepting new patients. Here are some strategies to help you in your search to find a new doctor:


Find a family doctor first. A family doctor is normally your gateway into the healthcare system and, if you need specialist care, your family doctor can provide the necessary referrals to set you up with specialists.
Ask family or friends in the area who have a family doctor if they can ask for a referral. Oftentimes family doctors will take members of the same families that they already treat, even if they are not accepting ""new patients"" from the general population, so it is worth looking into.
Look online to find a resource that lists available family physicians in your area. Often the local physician licensing board will have such a list available, to help with people's search for a family doctor in their area.
Use walk-in clinics until you are able to get routine care from a family physician. While you spend time and energy looking for a family doctor, it is key not to put your healthcare on hold. Go to a walk-in clinic in the meantime, until you are able to find a doctor who can consistently care for you, as using a walk-in clinic is better than neglecting your routine healthcare checkups altogether.
Check your insurance provider’s website. Most insurance companies have a list of the providers in their network on their websites. You can search using your zip code and other criteria to find a doctor near you.

, Every one to five years is sufficient for young adults. Of course, you should see your doctor more frequently if you need prescription refills, have ongoing medical conditions, are due for screening tests such as a Pap test, or have worrisome symptoms. Some guidelines for different types of screening include:


Blood pressure checks once every three to five years for healthy adults between 18 and 39 years old. Patients who are overweight, African American, or have significant family history should have their blood pressure checked once every year.Lipid / Cholesterol levels once between the ages of 17 to 21, then more often if the levels are abnormal, or once every one to two years if the levels are normal starting at age 35 for men and 45 for women.
Weight and BMI (body mass index) at every visit to monitor for obesity. If you are obese, then you will need to be screened for diabetes with a hemaglobin A1C test at least one time and then again every three to five years.
Pap smear for women aged 21 to 29 years old once every three years. Women aged 30 to 65 years only need to have a Pap and an HPV test once every five years, but once every three years is also okay.HIV test at least one time in your lifetime. However, you may need to get tested more often if you engage in certain behaviors that increase your risk, such as having unprotect sex with multiple partners, sharing needles, having sex for money, or having sex with someone who is HIV positive., Once you have found a physician in your area who is willing to take on your care, the next step is to call to make an appointment. For routine checkups, the appointment will generally be scheduled in the realm of weeks to months following your call (depending upon how busy the physician is). Of course, for more urgent or concerning issues, your doctor will prioritize your visit and see you sooner.


At the time you call to make your appointment, it is wise to ask about the insurance coverage you have and the amount of copay you may need to provide to pay for your portion of the visit.
Knowing this information ahead of time prevents you from inadvertently receiving a bill that you did not expect at the end of the appointment.

, If you are seeing your regular family doctor, he or she may already be familiar with your personal medical history. However, if you are seeing a new doctor, it is helpful to have this information on hand to readily share with him or her.


If you have a fairly extensive or complicated past medical history, then arrange to have your previous medical records sent directly to your new doctor’s office before your appointment. For example, if you have been hospitalized many times, have had complex surgeries, or have a chronic condition that you have been treated for over many years, then you should arrange to have you medical records sent to your new doctor.
It is also key to have with you a list of all the medications that you are currently taking, including dosages and the reason you are on each medication.
Medication management is one of the key jobs of a family doctor, so having this information available upfront can make this task much easier.
Note any medications that you are running low on, so that you can ask your doctor for prescription refills if needed. This is something you do not want to forget to do at your routine checkup.

, Be prepared to discuss things such as your sexual choices, your diet, your exercise, and use of any illegal substances.


It is important to answer these questions honestly, so that your doctor can accurately assess your risk for certain health concerns that may be associated with your lifestyle choices.
Note that doctors are trained to provide a safe and non-judgmental space so that you feel comfortable sharing personal information in an honest and open way.

, If you see the same doctor regularly, he or she will likely already have notes on your family history. However, if any of your family members have had recent health concerns, including diagnoses such as heart disease, diabetes, stroke, or cancer, it is important to bring this up at your routine checkup and to let your doctor know.


You may be more susceptible to diseases that others in your family have had, and this may influence the way that your doctor approaches your routine health checkup. This is why it is key information to share with your doctor.
You may also be eligible for additional testing (such as genetic testing for cancer, if this runs in your family), which is another reason to openly share your family health history with your doctor.

, Also take note of any developments (new things to take note of) in any chronic health conditions you may be suffering from.


Do not be afraid to share concerns with your doctor, even if you think they are ""trivial.""
It is your doctor's job to address them, and anything that is causing you concern is worth exploring with your doctor. (At the very least, if it does not turn out to be something serious, it can at least bring you peace of mind to talk about it.)
Also use your appointment to ask any questions you may have about your health, your medical diagnoses, and/or your treatment plans.

, Tell your doctor about any new concerns you would like to address right off the bat, so that he or she can account for that.


Your doctor can then let you know whether there is time to cover all of your concerns in one appointment, or whether a second appointment will be needed.
It is best to cover each issue thoroughly, rather than to try to cram them all into one appointment.

, Things to ask your doctor about include receiving your routine Pap test if you are a woman, obtaining STI (sexually transmitted infection) screening if you have had any new sexual partners, getting a blood pressure check, and receiving the yearly influenza vaccine (and/or any other vaccines that you may be eligible for).


Depending upon your specific health history, you may also be due for routine blood tests and/or other tests that relate to specific illnesses.

, However, your doctor will likely do a generalized screening physical exam, including examining your head and neck, listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking all of your vital signs, just to be sure that no abnormalities are detected.


If you do have ongoing health concerns, your doctor will likely spend additional time examining the affected area of your body.
He or she may also order further investigative tests of that area, such as possible imaging tests (like an x-ray, a CT scan, or an ultrasound).

, After you have discussed any health concerns with your doctor, received any routine screenings, blood tests, and/or vaccinations, and had a physical exam, your doctor will end the appointment by summarizing his or her thoughts about your health. Your doctor will also go over any changes to your treatment plan and/or your medications moving forwards.


He or she will also discuss any additional investigative tests that may need to be performed.
Your doctor will let you know when to return for your next appointment. Any specialist appointments or referrals (if needed) can be completed at this time.

, Routine checkups are meant for those who do not otherwise have a reason to be concerned about their health; if you have cause for concern, it is important not to wait to book an appointment.


This way, if you do have a medical condition, it can be addressed and treated as early as possible, which usually leads to the best outcome.
Also, if it turns out not a serious medical issue, seeing your doctor can at least provide you with peace of mind.

, If you have severely concerning symptoms, such as severe pain, unrelenting nausea and vomiting, or are otherwise feeling very unwell, do not wait to book an appointment with your family doctor. Rather, proceed to the Emergency Room immediately to receive prompt medical care.

, However, your doctor will specify the time intervals at which he or she would like to see you.


Reasons for more frequent appointments include monitoring for any progression of symptoms, obtaining repeat blood tests or other tests, and getting prescription refills, among other things.

Identify your symptoms.,
Ask your doctor.,
Use anti-fungal creams.,
Purchase a vaginal suppository.,
Take an over-the-counter oral medication.,
Apply an anti-itch cream.",How to Get Rid of a Yeast Infection at Home1," Your risk of yeast infection may increase if you are taking antibiotics, or if you are pregnant, overweight, diabetic, or have an impaired immune system. Symptoms of candidiasis may include:itching, irritation, soreness, or a burning sensation in the vaginal area
an odor-free white, lumpy discharge
skin rashes, patches and blisters in the groin;
, You should see your doctor if you think that you may have a yeast infection, if you are experiencing symptoms for the first time, or if you develop other symptoms. Your doctor may take samples for testing, such as a vaginal wet smear, CT scan or test of your stool in case the infection has spread. If you have frequent candidiasis, your doctor may test you for an immune deficiency or some other disease. You may have a complicated yeast infection if you are:experiencing severe signs and symptoms, such as extensive redness, swelling and itching that leads to the development of tears or cracks (fissures) or sores
having recurrent yeast infections — four or more in a single year
dealing with an infection caused by a type of candida other than Candida albicans
pregnant
diabetic
using certain medications for a condition such as HIV

, Your doctor may prescribe antifungal medication to help cure the infection or advise you to use an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine. A true yeast infection is caused by a fungus, so over-the-counter antifungal creams are one of the most common treatments used.If you don’t improve within 3-4 days, call your physician for advice
Do NOT use OTC products if you are pregnant or if you have had recurrent infections. See your doctor for help treating your yeast infection.
Make sure to use an antifungal cream specifically marketed for use as a yeast infection treatment. Other anti-fungal creams may not be formulated for use around the vaginal area.
OTC creams are used over the course of one to seven days. Follow the instructions on the package to learn how often that cream should be used.

, Like an antifungal cream, an over-the-counter vaginal suppository treats the infection by coming into direct contact with the fungus causing it. The ingredients may vary a bit, but usually contain antifungal medications like clotrimazole, butoconazole, miconazole or tioconazole.Over-the-counter suppositories are also available as one to seven day treatments. Read the instructions that come with the suppository to learn how often you should use it and how to insert it properly.
The suppository is usually conical, rod-shaped or wedge-shaped, and they are inserted directly into the vagina.

, Over-the-counter oral tablets do exist, but they are not as common as topical treatments and may not be quite as effective against stronger infections. Consult your doctor before trying new medication, as some medications can have side-effects when taken with other medicine, herbs or supplements. Read the package label to determine the correct dosage and frequency. Treatment by over-the-counter oral tablet usually takes one to seven days.
These tablets consist of an antifungal medication that is safe to ingest.
Avoid overusing antibiotics as these can kill the friendly bacteria that normally keep Candida in check.

, Anti-itch medication should be applied only around the vulva but not inside the vagina. Vaginal creams can be combined with low-strength corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and itching and usually come with an applicator for accurately measuring the amount of creams used.Consult your doctor before using any over-the-counter creams.
Creams are thicker than lotions, but they can leak, so consider using a sanitary pad or panty liner. But don’t use a tampon because it will absorb the cream and decrease its effectiveness.
An anti-itch cream will not treat the infection, but it will ease the itching, irritation, and general discomfort associated with yeast infections. It should be used along with an anti-fungal cream, vaginal suppository, or oral tablet.
Only use an anti-itch cream formulated for the vaginal area. Other anti-itch creams could upset the pH balance of the area, thereby making the infection worse.

Protozoa only have one cell, and unlike helminths, they can multiply inside the human body. The most common protozoa include giardia and cryptosporidium.;
, The exact set of symptoms can vary depending on the parasite you have, and you may have a parasite inside you for years before any symptoms manifest.


Even so, there are some symptoms that the majority of infected people do experience. These include abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysentery, nausea, vomiting, bloating, itching around the rectum, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss.
When you're infected with a helminth parasite, you may see parts of the worm in your stool.

, Since many of the most common symptoms appear alongside other health conditions, too, you should also assess your risk factors when determining if parasites might be the root cause of your problems.


If you live in or visit an area known to have parasites, your risk of becoming infected will dramatically increase. This is especially true if you embark on international travel to countries with poor sanitation.
Poor sanitation and poor hygiene, in general, are risk factors for developing parasites.
Those with weaker immune systems are more likely to become infected. This includes children and the elderly, as well as anyone with a prior health condition that weakens the immune system, such as HIV.

, If you think you have an intestinal parasite, make an appointment with your health care provider regardless.


You must do this first, even if you wish to get rid of the parasite with home remedies.
Your doctor will test for parasites using a standard set of tests.

Most typically, the doctor will wish to collect a stool sample for examination.
When testing for pinworms, the doctor may press a piece of tape against the anus for examination with a microscope. If you have pinworms, the tape will usually collect microscopic eggs.
If your condition is serious or otherwise urgent, your doctor may wish to diagnose the problem using x-rays.



, If you've been diagnosed and treated for parasites, you should schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor after your treatment regimen ends.


In most cases, the doctor will retest your stool for parasites. If you still have an infection, you will need further treatment.
Once the parasite leaves your system, your doctor will likely give you instructions on how to avoid reinfection. Reinfection can be more dangerous than the initial infection.

, Avoid all sugars aside from honey and opt for whole foods instead of their refined equivalents. You'll also need to avoid most juices and dairy products.


Parasites thrive by absorbing sugars, so any simple carbohydrate you consume will ultimately give the parasite fuel to continue living.
Ideally, you should avoid most sources of sugar for at least one to two weeks while you treat the infestation, then for an additional one to two weeks afterward as your body recovers.

, Some preliminary studies suggest that pumpkin seeds, papaya seeds, and almonds may help prevent and cure parasitic infections within the intestines. Try to consume one or two handfuls of these foods each day for at least two weeks, or for the duration of the infection.


If you aren't able to eat these nuts and seeds by themselves, consider adding them to smoothies, yogurt, and other food.
For instance, grind down the seeds of one medium papaya and mix the paste with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of coconut oil and 1 cup (250 ml) coconut milk. Blend it all together with the fruit of the papaya and 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of organic honey. Drinking the resulting smoothie for seven consecutive days might be enough to eliminate mild to moderate parasitic infestations., While not every fruit and vegetable can fight off parasites, some varieties may have the potential to do so. Include as many as possible in your diet until you get rid of the parasite completely.


Some of the most helpful fruits include pineapple, blackberries, pomegranates, and papayas. You can eat the fruit fresh or drink the juice. If you don't like the taste of these fruits, most can also be taken in supplemental form.
Several potentially helpful vegetables include onions, garlic, cabbage, kale, beets, and carrots. If you don't want to alter your diet too dramatically, you can make subtle changes by seasoning more of your food with garlic and onions.

, Since intestinal parasites dwell within your digestive tract, thoroughly flushing out your system may push the parasite out of your body.


Drinking plenty of water and sugar-free fluids should help.
Eating more fiber may also help, especially when you have a worm-type parasite. This may not be quite as effective for single-cell parasites, however.

, Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that keep your digestive tract healthy. Taking probiotics can naturally strengthen your body as it battles an invading parasite.


Most yogurt contains the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus, and eating one or two servings of yogurt each day can gently restore to bacterial balance in your gut.
Alternatively, you can take probiotics in supplemental form. Follow the dosage instructions on the package to determine how much to take and how often.

, While your body relies on many different nutrients to stay healthy, vitamin C and zinc are especially important for a healthy immune system. Getting an adequate amount of sleep each night will also boost your immune health and allow your body to fight the infection.


As a general rule, try to get 90 mg of vitamin C and 20 to 30 mg of zinc each day. You can get both nutrients through food or through health supplements.
When fighting any parasitic infection, try boosting the amount of sleep you get each night to eight or nine hours.

, The B-vitamins in apple cider vinegar can help nourish the body as it fights against infection, and its acidic pH can help neutralize the pH of the body while improving digestive health.


Start by taking 1 tsp (5 ml) of apple cider vinegar up to three times daily. Taking it 30 minutes before each meal can improve your body's ability to absorb it.
If you handle the initial dosage well, you might be able to gradually increase it to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) instead of 1 tsp (5 ml).

, Certain herbs and spices are believed to help strengthen the body and combat invading parasites. You can take most in the form of capsules, powders, and teas.


Herbs commonly used against parasites include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise, wormwood, curled mint, and black walnuts.
Similarly, cinnamon is one spice that may have anti-parasitic properties. Season your dishes with cinnamon or drink a solution made with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of cinnamon and 8 oz (250 ml) of water up to three times daily.

, In particular, both coconut oil and olive oil may help your body get rid of intestinal parasites.


Cook your meals with either oil instead of using butter, margarine, or other cooking oils.
To aid your body as it fights the infection, consider taking either oil supplementally, as well. Dissolve up to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of coconut oil into hot tea. Toss 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of olive oil with any vegetables you consume or drink it straight.

, Dissolve 1/2 cup (125 ml) of Epsom salts in a full bathtub of hot water. Soak in the water for 15 to 20 minutes.

, As you eliminate parasites from your intestines, you may experience severe bodily discomfort and abdominal pain. Going through the treatment at a fast pace will increase this discomfort.


If you're receiving treatment under the guidance of your physician, follow the schedule set by your doctor to ensure the maximum benefit.

, Depending on the type of parasite and your personal medical history, there is some chance that your doctor will prescribe a different course of drug therapy other than the primary three.


Each medication works differently. Some require one dose, while others may require continued doses that lasts for multiple weeks. Regardless of the specifics, though, you should take the drug as prescribed to maximize its effectiveness.
Other drugs used to treat giardia and similar protozoic parasites include tinidazole, which is given in a single dose, and nitazoxanide, which is taken in an easy-to-swallow liquid form.Mebendazole is another drug commonly used against pinworms and roundworms.Praziquantel and nitazoxanide are other anti-parasitic drugs typically prescribed for tapeworm infections."

Learn about saliva-producing medication.",How to Get Rid of a Dry Throat," As a general rule of thumb, you should be drinking eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water and other hydrating fluids each day.


Staying hydrated gives your body the resources it needs to produce the amount of saliva needed to keep your throat moist. Additionally, drinking fluids can also thin and loosen mucus, thereby preventing it from clinging to the interior walls of your throat and causing irritation there.
Tea can be an especially good beverage choice for those suffering with dry throats.Many herbal teas offer natural relief for irritated throats, and teas made from actual tea leaves contain antioxidants that boost your immune system. Avoid caffeinated teas since caffeine can cause dehydration, though.;
, Soak or mix dry foods with broths, soups, sauces, gravies, creams, butter, or margarine before eating them.

Humidifiers add warm moisture to the air, and breathing in that humid air will help soothe and hydrate your dry throat.
If you don't have a humidifier, consider filling a deep pan with warm water and placing it near a heat source (other than a space heater). As the water heats up, it should gradually make the air in the room more moist.
Take a hot shower and spend several minutes breathing in the steam. Similarly, you can position your face over a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam it produces. These options may at least provide temporary sources of dry throat relief.

, These products can usually be purchased without a prescription and may come in the form of sprays, swabs, and rinses.


Even though artificial saliva isn't as effective as natural saliva, it can still make the tissues in your throat more moist and may soothe any discomfort associated with chronic dryness.
Look for products that contain xylitol, carboxymethyl cellulose, or hydroxyethyl cellulose.Each option has its own strengths and weaknesses, and one may work better for you than the others, so you might have to try several products before finding one that works for you.

, Air inhaled through the mouth is unfiltered, so it's more likely to dry out the membranes in your throat. Breathing through your nose, on the other hand, will filter the air and make it more humid.


If your nose is too congested to breathe through, try taking over-the-counter nasal decongestants to help remedy the problem., Foods that fall into these categories are more likely to aggravate the dryness you already feel, so it's best to avoid them until the problem is fixed.


In addition to making your throat feel more dry, spicy or salty foods can actually make a dry throat feel painful.
You can probably tell when foods are salty or spicy, but you might consume plenty of dry foods without even realizing it. Examples of dry food consumed in many households on a daily basis include toast, cookies, dry breads, dried fruit, and bananas.

, Both alcohol and caffeine actually dehydrate you instead of hydrating you, so they strip valuable moisture away from your throat and the rest of your body.


Both alcohol and caffeine directly dry out the mouth and throat, but they can increase overall dehydration by triggering more frequent urination, too.
On a similar note, you should also avoid acidic beverages, including most fruit juices and tomato juice. While these fluids may not increase overall dehydration, they can irritate an already dry, sensitive throat. Moreover, acidic beverages are more likely to further encourage tooth decay, and people who suffer from dry throat and dry mouth are already at a higher risk of developing decay.

, Many common medications can be classified as ""anticholinergic"" drugs. These decrease secretions, including saliva production, and may result in an excessively dry throat.


Some examples include antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, and antispasmodics. Many drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, overactive bladder, and chronic bronchitis can also cause a problem.
If you're suspicious of a certain medication, it's best to consult your doctor about it before taking action. Do not quit using any prescribed medication unless your doctor tells you to do so.

, Many standard mouthwashes and toothpastes can actually aggravate the problem, so you should consider switching to formulas that are specially formulated for people with dry throats or dry mouths.


The wrong commercial mouthwash or rinse can be especially harmful for a dry throat. Most formulas contain alcohol or peroxide, and either ingredient will only cause your throat and mouth to experience further dryness.
You can ask a dentist for recommendations, but if you'd rather look for a good alternative yourself, know that most mouthwashes and toothpastes formulated for dry throats and mouths will be labeled accordingly.

, If you currently smoke, quitting should help remedy your dry throat. The smoke you inhale drags drying agents and other irritants into your throat, and those irritants might be partially or fully responsible for your chronic dryness.


Cigarette smoke paralyzes the hair in your nose and lungs. As a result, your respiratory system is unable to move mucus, dust, and other irritants out of the body. This leads to coughing and more significant dryness in your mouth, nose, and throat.

, If you have a persistent dry throat that worsens or doesn't go away with home treatment, you may need to schedule an appointment with your physician or dentist. Your condition might warrant professional attention.


Untreated chronic dry throat can lead to some noteworthy complications. For instance, you may eventually find it difficult to swallow food. When accompanied by dry mouth, a dry throat can also make it difficult to chew or taste food, and you may experience more tooth decay if you are unable to produce enough saliva to protect your teeth and gums.
Moreover, dry throats that develop into sore throats might be caused by viral or bacterial infections. When left untreated, these conditions can develop into more serious health problems.

, Certain medical conditions can cause a chronically dry throat, and if one of them is to blame for your current difficulties, your doctor will need to diagnose and treat that condition to improve the dry throat itself.


Some illnesses, like Sjogren's syndrome, directly impact your saliva glands and cause saliva production to decrease. Other conditions, like oral yeast infections, colds, allergies, and diabetes, may increase throat dryness indirectly.

, If your dry throat is caused by immune disease or saliva gland damage, your doctor may choose to prescribe pilocarpine, a drug that increases natural saliva production by stimulating associated nerves.Alternatively, if your dry throat is caused by Sjogren's syndrome, your doctor may prescribe cevimeline to help treat it and other associated symptoms.

Search for homeopathic remedies.,
Answer all questions as accurately as possible when using the online remedy finder.,
Examine the results.,
Retake the test a couple of times over the next few days.,
Compare your results.,
Buy your chosen remedy.,
Follow the instructions for taking the remedy.,
See if the remedy works.",How to Get Rid of Chronic Cystitis for Good2," Although not proven to work, homeopathic remedies have reportedly been successful for many people. If medical treatment hasn't worked for you, discuss the option of homeopathic remedies with your doctor, and then search for an appropriate treatment. Use ABC Homeopathy's online remedy finder or a similar tool to help you find an appropriate remedy.

, For chronic cystitis, you need a remedy that addresses your disease and your mind, so check both MIND and URINE under ""Where is affected?""On the next pages, check all the things from the listed that are close to your symptoms. Be as specific and precise as possible, and check everything that applies.


It could take around an hour to finish answering all the questions, but it is important to read everything and proceed carefully - and an hour checking stuff is better than a lifetime of suffering.

, When the test is done, you will get a list of possible homeopathic remedies, with percentages for each one. Don't be alarmed if they are mostly around 30% percent. It doesn't mean that the one for you isn't among them, so scroll to the names and  percentages, and take a screenshot so that you can remember the precise results.

, This will ensure that your final results are the most accurate for your illness in general, not for however you happened to be feeling the first time you took the test. Take the test every two days, and take it three or four times, for the best results.

, Find the average percentage for each remedy over all the tests you took. Then research the top five or ten remedies (those with the highest percentages). Read up on the personalities corresponding to each remedy, and learn about what each remedy does and how it works. Remember that homeopathic remedies can be fickle and work differently for each person, so choose the one that will work best for you. Ask your doctor or another expert if you have questions or concerns, and double check your chosen remedy with your doctor before you begin treatment.

, You can buy it directly from ABC Homeopathy, or find it in a local business. Don't worry, these remedies aren't terribly expensive. Even if you have to try a few before you find the one that works for you, you will spend a lot less than a lifetime of antibiotics and suffering.

, Most work best when taken with water. Dissolve the pills in clean water - usually tap water in a clean water bottle works just fine. Shake the bottle vigorously to mix the solution before taking it, and then take only the prescribed dose. Usually this will be about a capful of the solution four times a day for four days and then twice a day for two weeks, but confirm with your doctor or another expert before beginning treatment.

, Sometimes symptoms worsen for a day or two when you begin treatment, before improving dramatically or stopping altogether in the week or so following. Persist with the treatment for about a week before you decide whether it's working; if it is helping, continue treatment. If it doesn't work, discuss the treatment and symptoms with your doctor, and then go back to your list of possible remedies. Pick another one to try, and repeat the above steps to see if that works.


Continue trial and error until a remedy works or until you've gone through all possible remedies. Keep your doctor informed as you go through this process so that he or she can be on the lookout for anything that might be potentially dangerous.

Under Obamacare, insurance companies are obligated to provide coverage and benefits that they were not previously required to offer. As of January 2014, qualifying health care plans must do the following:


Cover people with preexisting conditions and not drop people who become ill
Stop making unjustified rate hikes
Allow you to appeal company decisions
Provide the Ten Essential Health Benefits, including emergency care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, and newborn care
Provide free preventative services such as yearly physicals, immunizations, and screenings;
, Each state provides a marketplace, also known as an exchange, which showcases a list of that state's qualifying health care policies. The state marketplaces allow you to ""shop"" for an affordable policy with the kind of coverage you and your family need. Each policy has a monthly premium that you pay in order to receive insurance coverage.


In the states' marketplaces, the cost of the plans depends on your income.If you earn less than $45,960 per year as individual or $94,200 as a family of four, you may be eligible to receive cost assistance subsidies and get low-cost or free insurance.You may also be eligible for Medicaid, which will required a separate application.
Even if you're already insured, you may still want to consider opting for plan listed in your state marketplace. Plans that existed several years before the PPACA was passed have been ""grandfathered in,"" and aren't obligated to provide all of the same benefits that qualifying health care plans provide. It's worth comparing your plan to those in your marketplace to decide which is best for you.

, As of 2014 the PPACA mandates that every American needs to have a health insurance plan in place, get an exemption, or pay a penalty tax. This is a way to make sure that as many Americans as possible get insurance coverage.


If you don't have insurance coverage, you need to sign up for a plan offered by your state marketplace or get an exemption by March 31, 2014. If you don't sign up for a plan before the deadline, you can sign up in any subsequent month. However, for each month you aren't covered, you'll be obligated to pay a penalty.If you already have an insurance plan that qualifies for Obamacare, whether through a private company, COBRA, Medicaid, Medicare or another qualifying plan, there's no action you have to take. Your health insurance company should provide some of the benefits stipulated by PPACA without you having to make a change.
If you have an insurance plan that was ""grandfathered in"" and is not subject to the Obamacare provisions, and you're not happy with your coverage, check into your state marketplace and sign up for a new plan as soon as possible.

, Follow the steps in the next method to sign up for Obamacare before March 31, 2014 to avoid penalties. Whether you're uninsured or you want to find out if your state marketplace provides plans with better coverage than the one you currently have, it's important to have your plan set up as soon as possible. If you miss the deadline and remain uninsured, you can still sign up, but you'll be subject to a penalty tax. Keep reading to find out how to get your new health coverage.

, Visit https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace/b/welcome/, where you'll be prompted to enter your state. Once you enter your state, you'll be redirected to your state healthcare marketplace site.


If you want to speak with someone in person, call 1-800-318-2596, a help hotline staffed 24/7 by people who can guide you through the process.
Note that each state site looks different and has slightly different options.

, Once you're on your state site, you'll be prompted to supply information about where you live, how many people in your family are applying for insurance, and your annual household income. Once you enter this information, you'll be given a list of plans that you're eligible for.


If you'd prefer not to enter this information online, or if you'd like help navigating the marketplace, you can always call your state marketplace contact number to receive live assistance.

, If you think you might qualify for a subsidy or exemption, and you want to know more information, follow the steps offered for obtaining that information. You'll need to enter your social security number and personal tax and income information to get this information.


States determine what subsidies you qualify for based on your household income and other factors.
If you qualify for major subsidies, you might be eligible for Medicaid, which could provide free healthcare for you and your family with all the Obamacare benefits, depending on which state you live in. To find out if you're eligible for Medicaid with Obamacare benefits in your state, see https://www.healthcare.gov/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid/.

, All of the plans will offer the Ten Essential Benefits and all other Obamacare benefits. They are grouped into four different categories according to how much coverage they provide. The plans with the most coverage also have the highest monthly premiums.



Platinum plans have the highest premiums and cover all but 10% of your health care costs.

Gold plans have slightly lower premiums and cover all but 20% of your health care costs.

Silver plans have even lower premiums and cover all but 30% of your health care costs.

Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but you'll have to pay up to 60% of your own health care costs.

, Your state marketplace website will direct you to instructions on how to purchase the plan you have chosen. You can purchase a plan online, through a broker, or directly from the insurance company.


You'll need to submit your payment at least 15 days before your coverage begins. After that, you'll be billed monthly or according to the payment plan you set up.
If you sign up for insurance before March 31, 2014, you won't have to pay the penalty tax. If you sign up after that date, you may have to pay the tax in addition to your first monthly premium., Your insurer is required to have transparency. Your provider must tell you what they spend on administrative costs, and they will have to give you a rebate if their overhead is unusually high. This means your insurance premiums are primarily used for your health coverage, and not for office overhead.


The insurance coverage limits do not have lifetime caps or annual caps.
You cannot be dropped from a policy if you get a serious, long-term illness.

, Early retirees get expanded coverage.The law provides money so that early retirees can continue getting their health care coverage through their former employer until they are eligible for Medicare.

, Low income Americans may qualify for a health insurance premium tax credit. Qualified citizens can take the credit (even if they don’t have a tax liability) and arrange for the tax credit to be paid in advance directly to the insurance company of their choice. This credit will be applied towards the premium. Talk with a broker at your state marketplace for further details.

, Health insurers must provide coverage for preventative health procedures without imposing additional fees or co-pays. Your health insurance plan must include preventative screenings for:


Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
Alcohol misuse (includes counseling)
Aspirin (age restrictions for stroke prevention)
Blood pressure
Cholesterol (age restrictions/higher risk patients)
Colorectal cancer (age restrictions)
Depression
Type 2 Diabetes (for adults with high risk)

HIV (for adults at high risk)
Immunization (Doses and age restrictions vary according to risk. Go to Vaccines.gov for a schedule of adult vaccinations.)
Obesity
STI (sexually transmitted infections, including Syphilis)
Tobacco use (includes cessation treatments)

, The following prevention-related health services must be covered at no additional cost:


Breastfeeding (support, counseling and supplies)
Contraception (methods and sterilization procedures approved by the FDA; does not include abortifacient drugs)
Domestic violence (includes counseling)
Gestational diabetes (for women at high risk)
HIV (includes counseling)
HPV (Human Papillomavirus)
STI (Sexually transmitted infections)
Well-woman physician visits (to get advice on recommended preventative services)

Folic acid (supplements for women who may become pregnant)
Gonorrhea (for women at high risk)
Hepatitis B (first prenatal visit)
Osteoporosis (women over age 60 and for women at high risk)
RH incompatibility (for pregnant women)
Tobacco use
Syphilis (for pregnant women or women at high risk)

, Parents can keep their children on their health insurance policies until they reach the age of 26. This means you will be able to provide health insurance for your child all the way through college, if necessary. These preventative screenings, tests and supplements apply to all children under the age of 18:


Alcohol and drug use
Autism
Behavioral assessments and developmental screening (including depression)
Blood pressure
Congenital hypothyroidism and Dyslipidemia
Fluoride chemoprevention and oral health screenings
Newborn screenings including gonorrhea preventive medication, sickle cell, PKU and hearing screening

Think about getting therapy.,
Consider a possible diagnosis.,
Take medication.,
Investigate alternative medicine for anxiety.",How to Stop Being a Constant Worrier1," If you have trouble stopping anxious thoughts, it may be best to consider seeing a counselor or psychologist. A therapist is educated about the way the brain and emotions work. This enables them to diagnose the source of your anxiety so that you can deal with the cause. For example, a therapist can offer a well-known treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) that can help you train your brain to stop worrying.Find a psychologist by reviewing a list of approved professionals on your health insurance website.
Ask friends who struggle with this same (or a similar) issue who their therapist is.;
, When you see a therapist, they may offer a diagnosis of your worry. The type of worries you experience may have a theme. For example, if you fear crowds and leaving your house, a therapist might diagnose you with agoraphobia. A diagnosis helps the therapist target your treatment directly to these areas of problematic thinking.Other diagnoses include general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and so on.

, You can take prescription medications to deal with anxiety and constant worrying. Many people get prescriptions for immediate relief, such as the medication Xanax. Others try to take the edge off with anti-depressants such as Zoloft. Most people on anti-anxiety medication have access to both. You can generally get a prescription from your primary care physician or a clinical psychologist after diagnosis.

, Herbal alternatives can be effective for treating anxiety, as well as body work like massage.Herbal alternatives include St. John’s wort, Valerian root, chamomile, passionflower, magnesium, or lavender. These herbs are known to have a mild sedative quality, helping users to sleep better. Black tea, for example, has been known to increase the brain's alpha waves, reducing feelings of stress.Herbal supplements and remedies should not be taken in combination with prescription medications unless approved by a doctor.

Treat anxiety at home with exercise.,
Start meditating.,
Practice breathing exercises.",How to Stop Being a Constant Worrier2," Exercise is good for beating constant worrying for two reasons. One, exercise distracts your mind and breaks you out of an obsessive thought process.Two, it acts as an antidote to constant adrenaline rushes. It works a bit like an anti-anxiety medication. The release of endorphins after aerobic exercise calms your body, an effect that lasts about 24 hours. The effects of exercise wears off after 24 hours. If you rely on exercise to keep worrying at bay, develop a routine so that you exercise every day.
Aerobic exercise (as opposed to strength training) has worked best for patients in studies, but the important thing is to find a workout routine that you enjoy. That way you will keep it up.

, Some psychologists suggest acknowledging your anxious thoughts rather than trying to get rid of them. The best scenario for this is in a calm, relaxing meditation session. Instead of preparing to fight anxious thoughts, try to see these thoughts from the perspective of someone outside your head. Don’t react to or criticize these thoughts. Stay focused on the present, and you will notice your worries passing away.To help you stay focused on the moment, observe your physical body during this meditation session. Notice your heartbeat, breathing, and what your emotions are.
This method of dealing with worries takes time and practice. Don’t be discouraged when you aren’t able to let your thoughts go the first few times.

, Abdominal breathing combined with a technique called progressive muscle relaxation can help your body calm down. Since anxious thoughts can trigger a cascade of adrenaline, engaging in breathing exercises can halt the flow. Try breathing with your ab muscles. Make sure you stomach is moving up and down when you breathe rather than just your chest. To make sure you’re using your abdominal muscles, try laying down and placing a small book on your stomach. If the book rises up and down, you are using the correct muscles.
This is the opposite of the way you breathe when you are worried, which is rapid, shallow, and all in your chest.
To combine deep breathing with progressive muscle relaxation, breathe deeply and focus on relaxing one muscle group at a time. Do this for five to 10 minutes.
You can add a mental affirmation. Focus on a positive thought, like “I am ok,” as you breathe and relax.

"
"
Communicate with others.,
Express your emotions.,
Repeat positive words and phrases.,
Worry only at specific times of day.,
Live with uncertainty.,
Write about your worried thoughts.,
Build trust in your ability to handle whatever comes your way.,
Ask “what if” questions.,
Use problem solving strategies.",How to Stop Being a Constant Worrier3," If you never talk about the anxious thoughts in your mind, you may feel isolated. This feeling can lead to more anxiety. Instead, talk about what is in your head. You can also talk about topics other than your worries to keep your mind off of them. Find someone in your daily life you can sit down and chat with on a regular basis.For example, you can ask your best friend if they will call you every Tuesday night at 7 and talk to you for 2 hours.
If none of your friends or family members wants to talk with you, consider seeing a psychologist.
For example, you may want to start getting cognitive-behavior therapy. This type of therapy teaches new ways of thinking to prevent obsessive worry., When you’re expressing your emotions, you’re not worrying. This is because when your brain is focused on worries, the amygdala is restrained. The amygdala is the part of the brain that controls emotions. When you cry or get angry, your worries are then suppressed. If you typically stifle your emotions, try accessing and expressing them to stop worrying so much.Listen to music or watch a movie to help stimulate an emotional response.
Try going to a boxing gym or taking a self-defense class to help you access suppressed anger.

, Develop a mental defense mechanism in your mind. When a worrying thought comes into your head, immediately repeat a positive phrase. Perhaps you choose a phrase that repeats the opposite of your worrying thought. For example, if your worry is “I will fail at work,” repeat the phrase, “I may fail, but it will be an opportunity to learn.”


You can also try asking questions when worries come to mind. Ask yourself, “What is the proof that this thought is true? Where is the proof that this thought it not true?”, Telling yourself not to think particular thoughts is useless because it usually makes you think about them even more. However, assigning a specific time of day to allow worries to run wild is different. Tell yourself that at 5 o’clock, you will allow worries to dominate your mind for one hour. When worries come to mind throughout the day, tell your mind that these thoughts will have to wait until 5 o’clock. After the worry hour is over, postpone any more anxious thoughts until the next day at 5 o’clock.Write down each anxious thought as it pops into your head. This way your mind won’t waste energy struggling to remember all the anxious thoughts throughout the day.
Make your worry time at the same hour every day. Try to make it at least a few hours before bed so that it doesn’t interfere with sleep.
It may take practice to delay worry like this.

, Another way to challenge worrying in your mind is to live with the fact that life is uncertain. Let go of being in control. Seek out the reason why you want to be so certain about the future. Find out why you want answers to every problem right away. The answer is likely that you like to be in control. Talking to a therapist about your need for control is a good place to start., If you are worried about your performance in something, such as a test, try writing about your worries in a journal just before you perform. Studies have shown that test takers improve their scores by journaling about their worries for ten minutes before taking the test.Write down everything you are nervous about, either in a list or paragraph format.


You could apply this principle to any performance task—a presentation, a sports game, acting, singing on stage, making a meal for others, and so on.
If you don’t have access to pen and paper, try telling someone what you’re worried about.

, Remind yourself that you are a capable person who has dealt with difficult situations in the past. By doing this, you may find it easier to face the problem that you are worrying about.


Try making a list of difficult situations that you have faced and what you did to overcome those situations. For example, maybe you had to deal with a life-threatening illness, failing a class in school, or a difficult break-up. Reflect on these situations and what you did to overcome them.

, Asking and answering “what if” questions may help you to examine your worry and feel less concerned about it.This may also help to make the worry seem less frightening.


For example, if you think to yourself, “What if I get into a car wreck?” You might answer the questions with “I might be injured, “I might have to go to the hospital or call 911,” or “I might have to get a new car.” These are things that might be difficult, but you are capable of doing them.
After reasoning through the worst case scenarios, try asking yourself a question that reflects the most likely scenario, such as, ""What if I don't get into a car wreck?"" Then, you might answer, “I will arrive safely at my destination,” “I will have to deal with some traffic,” and “I will feel more confident in my driving abilities.”

, Worrying and problem solving are not the same thing. Worrying does not lead to solutions, but problem solving does.By developing a methodical way to approach your problems, they may start to seem less daunting.


Start by writing down the problem. Be as specific as possible. For example, you might write, “I am worried because I cannot afford to pay rent on time this month.”
Then, make a list of all of the possible solutions to the problem. You might write, “Arrange to pay late by talking to the landlord,” “Borrow money from a friend to pay the rent on time,” and “Send the check late with an apology letter.”
Choose the best solution from the list and take action. For example, you might decide that the best option is to contact your landlord and ask to pay rent on the 15th instead of the 1st.
Reflect on the outcome. Did you get the result you wanted? If not, then what might you do differently next time?

Listen to music.,
Lose yourself in a story.,
Play a game.,
Do something with your hands.",How to Stop Being a Constant Worrier4," If you don’t usually turn on any music, it may help to start doing so. Many times feelings of sadness or anger lie beneath worrying. Music can trigger these emotions so that you are able to process and get rid of them, which can help you stop worrying. Find music that makes you feel strong emotions.Look through your old CDs or digital music player to find music that you used to enjoy.
If you’ve never collected any music, try signing up for internet radio stations like Pandora or Spotify.
You can always tune your car radio or satellite radio, even a radio app on your phone, to a station that you find enjoyable. ITunes even has a radio feature.
There are many things you can do with music. You don’t have to just sit there and listen. Consider singing along, dancing, playing an instrument yourself, and so on.For music that relaxes you, try choosing songs that are slow and have an easily identified pattern.
To identify feelings of sadness, turn on a sad song (such as the Blues). To release anger, try hard rock.

, Stories distract our minds by engaging us in someone else’s problems. Stories usually end with a solid conclusion, something that worriers crave. Stories contain certainty and pleasure, two things that you don’t get when you are obsessing over a fear. When you feel panic coming on, turn on a movie, a TV show, pick up a novel or short story, even a magazine, and start forgetting about your life as you follow a character’s life.

, Getting involved in a game can also help you forget your problems. You can try a physical game like basketball or soccer with neighborhood friends, or you can find a game at home. Try cards or a board game with family members. You could also try a video game on the computer or gaming system. Playing by yourself or online with friends can be fun and distracting.

, Try to lose yourself in the moment with a task that requires your hands and focus. For example, knitting or sewing requires careful attention to detail. Any number of crafts or art activities can do the same thing. The important thing is to lose track of time. When you feel worries coming on, turn to this hobby you have developed.You could also get involved in gardening. If you don’t like getting messy, try rock gardening.

If your phobia doesn’t affect your life in a significant way, then you may not need psychotherapy. However, if your phobia keeps you from doing normal everyday things, then you should seek help.The fear caused by a phobia may affect your day-to-day activities. For example, if you are afraid of dogs, then you might avoid walking around your neighborhood out of fear that you might encounter a dog.
Keep in mind that even if a fear does not affect you on a daily basis, it may still affect you in significant ways. For example, if you live in a large city, and you are afraid of heights, then you might avoid tall buildings out of fear. Therefore, the phobia may limit your job opportunities, social opportunities, and/or living arrangements.;
, Phobias can sometimes lead to panic attacks or panic symptoms. If your phobia ever causes you to experience panic, then you should seek therapy. Some of the symptoms you might have include:difficulty breathing
racing heart and/or tightness in your chest
trembling
dizziness
sweating or feeling hot
turning sensations in your stomach
feeling anxious
feeling detached or unreal
being afraid that you might go crazy, pass out, or die

, Psychotherapy is an effective treatment for phobias.During your therapy sessions, you will talk one-on-one with a mental health professional. Some of the mental health professionals who provide psychotherapy include psychologists, counselors, and psychiatrists. Psychotherapy helps you to confront your phobias and work on developing effective coping skills so that your phobia will be more manageable.Through psychotherapy, you will learn more about your phobias and the circumstances and thoughts that may have caused it.
Psychotherapy includes counseling, talk therapy, psychosocial therapy, and other kinds of therapy.

, Overcoming and confronting your phobias is a process. There is no quick fix. Psychotherapy can help you learn how to stop letting your phobias control your life, but it may take a while. However, some people start to feel better after just a few sessions.Keep in mind that because you are facing your fears and pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, you may feel bad instead of better at first. This is normal and it should not be a reason to quit. Overcoming phobias can be a hard and stressful experience. Just remember, each time you confront your fears, you’re making progress.

, There are lots of different ways to find a therapist, but you should use your resources to help make the process less overwhelming. Some things that you can do to find a therapist include:Asking your doctor for a referral. If you are unsure about how to get treatment for your phobia, then ask your general practitioner for a referral to a therapist.
Checking with your insurance company. Your insurance company may pay for a number of therapy sessions if you see a therapist that is in your network.
Asking friends and family members. If you know someone who sees a therapist, ask how he or she likes the therapist.
Searching for a therapist on the internet. Many mental health services have websites that give bios about therapists and information about their services and practices. You can also search for therapists via professional association websites.

, Before you look for a therapist, you may want to learn about different kinds of mental health professionals and so that you can look for one who will be able to meet your needs.Psychiatrists (M.D., D.O) are medical doctors who can diagnose and treat mental health problems with a combination of medications and psychotherapy.

Psychologists (Ph.D., Psy. D, Ed D.) are mental health professionals with a doctoral degree in psychology. These mental health professionals can treat mental health problems using talk therapy. Psychologists do not usually prescribe medications, but some may work with doctor so that they can prescribe medications.

Licensed clinical social workers (L.C.S.W) can provide talk therapy.

Licensed professional counselors (L.P.C.) can diagnose and treat mental health conditions using talk therapy.

, Make sure that whatever psychotherapist you see has the proper licenses and certifications to practice in your state. Research the psychotherapist’s education, certifications, background, and licenses. Each state has its own certification standards, so check to see if the therapist meets these regulations.You should also check to see whether or not a therapist you are considering has had any complaints.
If you are seriously considering someone to be your therapist, make sure that you call and ask about the therapist's fee structure to make sure that you can afford the fees.

, Before you decide to work with a therapist, you may want to schedule a meeting so that you can meet the therapist and ask questions. While it is important to share your symptoms with your potential therapist, you can also use this appointment to ask questions. Some questions you might want to ask at your first appointment include:How long have you been practicing?
How much experience do you have helping people with phobias?
What types of treatment methods do you use to treat phobias? Are these methods effective?

, Most therapists use a combination of different therapeutic approaches depending on your situation. Some approaches that you therapist may use include:



Cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT helps you confront and address negative thoughts along with the distorted feelings, perceptions, and ideas you have about something. The goal of CBT with phobias is to take control of the way you react to your phobia by working on the thoughts that lead you to feel how you do.Exposure therapy. Avoiding the source of your phobia can make the phobia worse over time. Exposure therapy helps you face your phobia to lessen its control over you.Exposure therapy works in stages. For example, if you are afraid of heights, you may start by looking at photos taken from high places, watch videos, and then look at a tall building in person. After that, you may slowly progress to going up in high buildings.Psychodynamic therapy. Psychodynamic therapy works on gaining insight into your phobia, fears, and anxieties. This therapy works on any unconscious thoughts or reasons for the way you feel. You work on understanding your thoughts and gaining control over how you feel and think.This therapy involves talking with your psychotherapist. You will discuss triggers that cause your phobias, then discuss events or reasons in your life that you may have these phobias.

It is important that you get regular dental care to prevent cavities from forming, and to catch cavities early on if they do develop., If you experience toothache, tooth discoloration or staining, notice any holes or cracks, or have new sensitivity to heat and cold, you might have a cavity. Schedule a dental appointment right away to make sure that the cavity does not worsen., If a cavity is caught very early, it is possible for it to be treated with fluoride. If a cavity has progressed terribly, it is possible that you will need a tooth extraction or a root canal. Most likely, however, your dentist will decide that you require a filling and will ask you to come back in the coming days or weeks to get a filling.

, As you prepare to schedule your filling, you will likely need to know how long the appointment is expected to last, whether or not you will have restrictions immediately following your appointment, whether you are permitted to take medications, whether you will need a ride home, any side effects you should know about, and how you should follow up.Having this information in hand well before your filling will allow you to make the necessary preparations at home. For example, you might need to:


Ask a friend or a taxi service to set up a ride home, depending on what anesthetic will be used.
Purchase soft, lukewarm foods that won't aggravate your filling in the days immediately following your appointment.
Arrange for time off of work to go to your appointment and recover. Note that it might be hard for you to talk normally for a few hours after you get your cavity filled. If your job requires that you speak publicly, you might want to take an extra few hours off.
Consult with your physician about whether your medications might interact with your dental anesthetic.

, Your dentist will have to know about any chronic health problems you have, your medical history, your current medications, allergies to medicines and metals, and whether or not you are pregnant. This information is essential for your dentist to make the right decisions about your dental care.Be sure to answer all questions honestly, and tell your dentist all the relevant details about your dental and physical health.

, Most people have the option of getting an amalgam filling or a composite filling. There are pros and cons to each kind of filling, and the most appropriate option might depend on which tooth requires a filling and how deep your cavity is.An amalgam filling is made up of metals, is silver in color, is usually the cheaper option, is strong and flexible, and sometimes requires the removal of healthy tooth material.Amalgam fillings are more common on the back teeth.A composite filling is made up of a hardened resin, is often tooth-colored, is usually the more expensive option, is not quite as strong or long-lasting as an amalgam filling, and is a bit fussier to do correctly.Composite fillings are more common on teeth that are in the front of the mouth and visible., You do not want your tooth to be injured or your pain to worsen. Try to get in for your filling as soon as you can after your diagnosis.

, Anxious patients do better when they don't have as much time during the day to fret about an upcoming appointment. Try to get it over with first thing in the morning if you have any dental fears or phobias., Costs can vary quite a bit. They depend on factors such as your location, the individual dentist, whether you are getting an amalgam or composite filling, and whether or not you have dental insurance.In general you can expect an amalgam filling to cost between $100-200 and a composite filling to cost between $135-240., Even if you have had previous fillings covered by your dental plan, always double-check what exactly your dental insurance will cover. Sometimes there are restrictions about what kind of filling you can get--some plans might cover an amalgam filling but not a composite filling, for example. Make extra sure that the dentist performing your filling is in-network so that you aren't surprised by out-of-network surcharges. Be prepared for possible co-pays, however.

, If you do not have dental insurance, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for dental care. If you qualify, consider looking for governmental assistance through Medicaid, CHIP, or other national health services.Other possibilities for lower-cost dental care include dental schools, and reduced-cost dental programs through your state or municipality., If you are scared of the dentist, you are not alone. At least 5% of people avoid the dentist because of fear, and many more than that experience anxiety about the dentist.While it is important to your health to see a dentist regularly, do not be embarrassed by your fear. Instead try to face it.

, Some people are embarrassed by how their teeth look; other people fear possible pain; others have a phobia of needles; others don't like the sound of a dental drill.Try to think about where your anxiety is coming from so that you can minimize it during your appointment. Many of these fears can be alleviated through the use of new technologies, good communication from your dentist, relaxation techniques, and alternative medications.

, Many dentists have training in how to treat patients with dental anxieties and fears. Don't hesitate to ask your dentist directly about whether he or she can handle fearful patients.It might take you a few tries to find a good fit, but you should call around or even find recommendations through friends or the internet. There will be a good dentist who can help you. Some ways that dentists can soothe an anxious patient include:Using water-based tools that minimize feelings of heat or vibration.
Using oral or rub-on anesthetics before to provide pain relief before you receive a numbing shot.
Having the option of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) available.
Creating a spa-like environment, with relaxing music, aromatherapy, and a calm space.
Providing noise-canceling headphones so that you do not have to hear the noise of the drill.
Knowing relaxation and hypnosis techniques to help guide your breathing to keep you calm.Telling the patient what will happen so that the patient feels in control and safe.

, If you have a crippling anxiety of the dentist, you might want to look into the possibility of having your cavity filled while you are sedated. There are some extra risks from this option, and not every dentist uses sedative dentistry. However, there are many who will use sedatives to calm down a fearful patient.Be sure that you arrange for a friend or a taxi driver to take you home after the procedure. It is not safe to drive after waking up from sedation., While it might be tempting for you to use calming substances such as anti-anxiety medication or alcohol, you do not want to ingest anything that might interact poorly with dental anesthetics.Always talk to your dentist first about appropriate steps you can take to minimize your anxiety during a filling.

, Some people have dental fears because of bad experiences long ago. However, dentistry is much more sophisticated now. Anesthetics are more effective, drills are quieter, and there is a lot of new technology that can help a patient remain more comfortable. Try to keep an open mind about the dentist, and talk to your dentist about the tools that he or she uses., Keeping yourself distracted is a great way to ensure that you remain calm during your filling.There are a variety of techniques that you can use and discuss with your dentist. For example, you could:


Prepare a soundtrack of your favorite relaxing music that you could listen to during the procedure.Memorize a poem or a mantra that you can recite mentally to keep yourself distracted.
Use deep breathing techniques to minimize anxiety.It might be hard to do these with your mouth open, but some relaxing breathing techniques are still possible, such as breathing in through your nose for five seconds, holding for five seconds, and releasing for five seconds.Ask if you could have your filling done in a room with a television or screen with distracting or relaxing images., Having a friend or family member present can help keep you calm if you have trouble in the dentist's chair.Ask your dentist if she is comfortable with you having a loved one in the room with you to keep you grounded and to make sure that you are all right during the filling procedure.

, Your child will look to you for guidance when she learns that she has cavities.Stay calm, positive, and upbeat in order to keep you child from becoming scared., If the cavity is in a baby tooth that will soon fall out, perhaps your child does not even require a filling. If the tooth is several years away from falling out, or if the filling is in an adult tooth, your child will likely need a filling., Some children do better when all their cavities are filled at once. Other children might do better with several appointments for fillings spaced out over time. Discuss with your dentist what the painkiller and sedative options are for these appointments in order to find the best option for your child.These options might involve laughing gas, an oral sedative, or the same kind of local anesthetic that you get for your own fillings., Be honest with your child about what a filling entails, but use simple and non-scary words to explain what will happen.For example, you could tell her:


""Your tooth has an owie, and a filling will make it feel good and strong. You might feel very sleepy while you are getting the filling, but you will feel a lot healthier afterwards.""
""A filling means that your tooth will be fixed. Sometimes people get scared, but dentists do this all the time, and you'll get medicine so that you feel better.""
Avoid words like ""pain"" or ""hurt."", Some children feel anxious about the numb feelings of oral anesthetic. Sometimes they might engage in dangerous behaviors while numb, such as biting their lips, pinching their gums, or scratching at their mouths. Watch your child carefully to make sure that she is behaving safely, and tell her that what she is experiencing is normal and will be over soon., Having a loved one there in the room can be very helpful to someone who is nervous or scared of the dentist., Let your child choose what he or she will wear to the appointment. If your dentist will let your child hold a toy, let your child choose what toy to bring. This will help your child feel in control of the situation and will help reduce possible fears., Tell your child that you have a special treat in store once your child has recovered from the filling. Maybe you can go see a movie, or go out for ice cream, or go to the zoo. Tell your child in advance of the appointment so that he has something to look forward to for being brave., Depending on what kind of anesthetic was used, you might experience different odd sensations after your appointment. You might feel numb, tingly, and tender in the hours immediately following a filling.You might also have trouble eating, talking, or swallowing for a few hours.While these sensations might feel bizarre, they are totally normal.


Be especially careful about chewing or talking while you are still numb. You might accidentally bite your cheek or your tongue. Pay close attention to the health of your mouth, even if you cannot feel any pain at the moment.

, Some pain and sensitivity is normal for a few days. If you continue to experience sensitivity while biting or chewing, however, that is an indication that your filling was built a little too high and might need to be filed down for your comfort. Talk to your dentist about coming back again for a quick fix., Your dentist might want to check up on you in the days and weeks following your filling to make sure everything is progressing normally. Keep your appointments and follow your dentist's instructions about diet, medication, and hygiene.For example, your dentist might recommend that you stay away from extremely hot, extremely cold, or sugary foods and drinks as you heal. You might also be asked to brush your teeth more often or to use special mouthwashes to keep your mouth clean as your filling sets. Follow all instructions carefully to make sure you don't run into any complications., While complications from dental fillings are rare, they can occur. Pay attention to warning signs such as bleeding, wheezing, excessive pain, fever, infection, and swelling. Call your dentist immediately if you experience these symptoms., Your dentist will be able to monitor your filling to make sure that it remains intact and that it is still doing its job properly. Sometimes fillings need to be replaced, and you will want to catch any issues with your filling as early as possible. Keep up with your dental appointments so that you can keep an eye on any potential filling replacements."

Visit a death café.",How to Overcome the Fear of Death," The first thing to determine when dealing with a fear of death is how – and how much – your fear affects your life. We are not often immediately aware of the environmental triggers or causes of our fears and anxiety. Writing about the situations in which they arise can be a helpful tool for working through these issues.Start by simply asking yourself, “What was going on around me when I started feeling afraid or anxious in that moment?” For a number of reasons, this can be a very difficult question to answer at first. Start with the basics. Think back over the last few days and write down as many details as you can remember about the times you thought about death. Include exactly what you were doing when the thoughts arose.
The fear of death is very common. Throughout human history, people have been concerned and preoccupied with the idea of death and dying. This can happen for several reasons, including your age, your religion, your level of anxiety, the experience of loss, and so on. For example, during certain transitional phases in your life, you may be more prone to having a fear of death. People may have a deeper preoccupation with death in the ages 4-6, 10-12, 17-24, and 35-55.Scholars have long philosophized about the prospect of death. According to the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, death can be a source of fear for people precisely because it is that which “comes to us from the outside and transforms us into the outside.” The process of death, therefore, represents to us the most radical unknown dimension imaginable (or, in a sense, unimaginable). As Sartre points out, death has the potential to transform our living bodies back into the non-human realm from which they initially emerged.;
, Next, write down any of the times you can remember deciding not to do something because you were afraid or anxious. Write down instances even if you aren’t sure about whether or not the emotions were necessarily related in any way to death or dying.

, After you have one list of thoughts of death and one list of anxious moments, look for commonalities between the two. For example, you might notice that every time you see a particular brand of candy you feel some degree of anxiety, but you’re not sure why. Then you realize that you think about death during these same situations. You might remember that the brand of candy in question was served at your grandparent’s funeral. Then you also began feeling some degree of fear at the thought of death in general.


Such connections, between objects, emotions, and situations, can be quite subtle, sometimes even more so than the scenario described above. But writing them down can be a great way to start becoming more aware of them. Then you can better influence how you manage the way you’re affected in such moments.

, Fear is a potent force that can potentially influence just about anything you do. If you can start to look beyond your fear, you may find that the actual event you’re dreading is not as terrible as think it is. Anxiety is usually wrapped up in anticipation about how things will or won’t go. It is an emotion that looks to the future. Keep reminding yourself that fear of death is sometimes worse than death itself. Who knows, your death may not be as unpleasant as you imagine it to be., Be completely honest and fully face the fact of your own mortality. It will eat away at you until you do. Life becomes much more valuable when its temporarily is realized. You know that you will face death sometime, but you don’t have to live life in fear. When you are honest with yourself and face your fear head-on, you will be able to start deconstructing this phobia.

, Death can be an especially frightening thing to think about, primarily because it exposes the limits of life and what we are able to conceive. Learn to focus on what you can actually control while still engaging with what you cannot.


For example, you may be worried about dying from a heart attack. There are certain factors that you can’t control about heart disease, such as family history, race and ethnicity, and age. You will make yourself more anxious by focusing on these things. Instead, it’s far healthier to focus on the things you can control, like quitting smoking, exercising regularly, and eating well. In fact, you are at higher risk for heart disease when you have an unhealthy lifestyle than just by the uncontrollable factors alone., When we want to control the direction of our lives, we are often met with disappointment, frustration and anxiety about things that don’t go as planned. Learn to loosen your grip on how tightly you control the outcomes of your life. You can still make plans, of course. Guide the course of your life. But allow some room for the unexpected.A fitting analogy is the idea of water flowing in a river. Sometimes the river bank will change, the river will curve, and the water will slow down or speed up. The river is still flowing, but you have to let it go where it takes you.

, When you try to predict or imagine the future, you find yourself asking, “What if this happens?” This is an unproductive thought pattern known as catastrophizing.An unproductive thought pattern is a way of thinking about a situation that ultimately causes you to have negative emotions. How we interpret an event will result in the emotion we feel from it. For example, if you are worried that you’re late for work, you might tell yourself, “If I’m late, I will get reprimanded by my boss and I’ll lose my job.” Having unproductive thought patterns can put you on edge if you feel like you want to control the outcome so strongly.


Replace unproductive thinking with positive thinking. Reason through your unproductive thought patterns. For example, say to yourself, ""If I'm late, my boss might get mad. But I can explain that there was more traffic than normal. I'll also offer to stay late after work to make up the time.""

, Devote five minutes during the day when you will allow yourself to worry about something. Do this at the same time every day. Try not to schedule this worry period for bedtime, because you don’t want to lay in bed fretting over things. If you have a worrying thought any other time during the day, save it for your worry time period. , If you are struck with anxieties about death, ask yourself about the chances of dying in certain scenarios. Arm yourself with statistics about dying in a plane crash, for example. You will likely find that your worries are inflated beyond the reality of what could possibly happen. , When other people’s worries start taking over your mind, you’ll think more about risks too. Perhaps you have a friend who is particularly negative about diseases and illnesses. This causes you to feel nervous about getting ill yourself. Limit time you spend with this person so that these thoughts don’t enter into your head so frequently. , We often avoid trying new things and putting ourselves in new situations precisely because of fears regarding what we do not yet know or cannot yet understand.In order to practice letting go of control, pick an activity you’d never consider doing and commit to giving it a try. Start by doing some research on it online. Next, maybe talk to people who have participated in the activity before. As you start to become more comfortable with the idea of it, see if you can’t give it a try once or twice before making an especially long commitment to it.


This method of experimenting with life and new activities can be a great tool for learning how to focus on producing joy in life as opposed to worrying about death and dying.
As you participate in new activities, you will likely learn a lot about yourself, especially in regard to what you can and cannot control.

, When it comes to death, you will likely come to realize that most of the process will be completely out of your control. There’s no way we can ever know for sure exactly when or where we can die, but we can take some steps so as to become more prepared. If you are in coma, for example, how long would you want to remain on life support? Do you prefer to pass in your home or remain in the hospital as long as possible?
It might be uncomfortable talking about these issues with your loved ones at first, but such conversations can be incredibly helpful for both you and them if an unfortunate event arises and you are unable to express your desires in the moment. Such discussions might potentially help you feel a little less anxious towards death.

, Recognize that your own life and death, as well as the lives of other creatures, are all parts of the same cycle or life-process. Life and death, rather than being two completely different events, are actually always occurring at the same time. The cells in our bodies, for example, are continuously dying and regenerating in different ways throughout an individual lifetime. This helps our bodies adapt and grow within the world around us., Our bodies serve as fertile ecosystems for countless different life forms, especially after our own lives come to an end.While we are alive, our gastrointestinal system is home to millions of micro-organisms. These all help our bodies stay healthy enough to support proper immune functioning, and, in certain ways, even complex cognitive processing., On a much larger, macro level, our lives fit together in unique ways to form societies and local communities which depend upon our bodies’ energy and actions in order to sustain some degree of organization.Your own life is composed of the same mechanisms and materials as other lives around you. Understanding this point can help you become more comfortable with the thought of a world without your particular self still being around. , Go on meditative walks in nature. Or, you can simply spend more time outside around many different life forms. These activities can be great ways to become more comfortable with the realization that you’re a part of a larger world. , Try thinking that after you die you will go somewhere happy. Many religions believe in this. If you ascribe to a particular religion, you may find comfort in considering what your religion believes about the afterlife.

, Ultimately, it’s best to avoid spending too much time worrying about death and dying. Instead, fill each day with as much joy as possible. Don't let little things get you down. Go outside, play with friends, or take up a new sport. Just do anything that will take your mind off dying. Instead, focus your mind on living.


Many people with the fear of death think about it daily. It means that you have a lot of things you want to do in life. Let the fear work through and ask yourself, “What is the worst thing that will happen today?” Today you are alive, so go and live.

, Surround yourself with people that make you happy and vice versa. Your time will be well-spent – and well-remembered – when you share yourself with others.


For example, you can rest assured that your memory will live on after you die if you help your grandchildren develop happy memories of you.

, A gratitude journal is a way for you to write down and acknowledge the things you’re thankful for. This will help keep your focus on the good things in your life.Think of good things about your life and cherish them.


Take some time every few days to write down a moment or thing that you’re grateful for. Write in depth, savoring the moment and appreciating the joy you’ve received from it.

, Avoid getting involved in bad situations or doing things that can raise your chances of dying. Avoid unhealthy activities like smoking, drug or alcohol abuse, and texting while driving. Staying healthy removes some of the risk factors that can lead to death.

, If your fear of death has become so intense that it is interfering with your ability to carry out normal activities and enjoy your life, you should seek the help of a licensed mental health therapist. For example, if you start avoiding certain activities due to your fear of impending death, then it is time to get help.Other signs that you may need to seek help include:


feeling disabled, panicky, or depressed because of your fear
feeling like your fear is unreasonable
dealing with the fear for more than 6 months

, A therapist can help you to better understand your fear of death and find ways to minimize it and hopefully overcome it. Keep in mind that dealing with a profound fear takes time and effort. It can take a while before your fears become manageable, but some people see a dramatic improvement in just 8-10 therapy sessions. Some of the strategies that your therapist might use include:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: If you are afraid of dying, you may have certain thought processes that intensify your fear. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a method that therapists use to get you to challenge your thoughts and identify the emotions associated with those thoughts. For example, you may think to yourself, “I can’t fly because I am afraid the plane will crash and I will die.” Your therapist will challenge you to realize that this thought is unrealistic, perhaps by explaining that flying is actually safer than driving. Then, you will be challenge to revise the thought so that it is more realistic, such as, “People fly on planes every day and they are fine. I am sure that I will be fine too.”Exposure Therapy: If you are afraid of dying, you may start avoiding certain situations, activities, and places that intensify your fear. Exposure therapy will force you to confront that fear head on. In this type of therapy, your therapist will either ask you to imagine that you are in the situation you have been avoiding or they will ask you to actually put yourself into the situation. For example, if you have been avoiding flying because you are afraid the plane will crash and you will die, your therapist may ask you to imagine that you are on a plane and describe the way you feel. Later, your therapist may challenge you to actually fly on a plane.Medications: If your fear of dying is so profound that it is causing you to have severe anxiety, your therapist may refer you to a psychiatrist who can prescribe medicine that may help you. Keep in mind that the medicines used to treat anxiety associated with fear will only reduce your anxiety temporarily. They will not take care of the root cause., It's always good to talk to someone about your fears or anxiety. Others may be able to share similar concerns. They may also suggest methods that they’ve used for dealing with the associated stress.Find someone you trust and explain to her what you think and feel about death, and how long you've felt this way.

, Issues related to death and dying can be particularly difficult for people to talk about in general. It is important to find the right group with whom to share your ideas regarding these issues. There are “death cafes,” which are groups of people who meet in cafes specifically to discuss issues around death. These are essentially support groups for people looking to handle their emotions around death. The groups determine together how to best live life in the face of death.


If you cannot find one of these cafes near you, consider starting your own. Odds are there will be lots of people in your area with concerns about death but who haven’t had the opportunity to share their concerns.

Relax.,
Realize how fleeting human time is.,
Understand what is likely driving some of your age angst.,
Beware anyone who insists that there is a ""perfect"" age in your life.,
Make plans for changes in your life.,
Cut loose.,
Connect.,
Adopt a new attitude towards age and aging.,
Help others overcome their age-related worries.",How to Stop Being Desperate About Your Age," Above all, step back and try to put the age worries into perspective. A lot of age worry comes from feeling external pressure, especially for the older person who sees the emphasis on youthful ages strongly reflected in the media. This pressure to be ever youthful can be burdensome depending on how much you allow it to influence you. Sadly, it fails to account for the reality that we all age and change, which is something to celebrate, not bemoan.


Consider calming yourself by talking about what is upsetting you. Talk to a trusted friend.
Disconnect for a while. Take a break and go somewhere that lets you disconnect from networks, be they online, social or otherwise. Give yourself some space to gain perspective and to truly relax. Clear your mind of all future thinking, where worries about aging tend to pop up.;
, Aging is a natural process and it happens as we get on with life. That is often why we wake up one day, look in the mirror and seem shocked to see an older person staring back at us. It can especially unnerving if you feel you have not lived life the way you want to and have much to achieve yet. But all is not lost! You have a chance to make new choices to orient your life back towards achieving the things that you feel have been slipping away with the ordinariness of everyday life.


Accept that you won't be able to move past being upset about your age if you're fixated on wanting to be younger. Turning back the clock is not an option. It's impossible to wish to be younger and suddenly be a child, a teen, a young adult again.

, Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, yet dangerous too. It reminds us of our past and it also embellishes our past; and in the embellishment, we can often convince ourselves that younger days were easier, happier, better, than now. Comparing your past with your present is fraught with danger, as you may sentimentalize a time in your life to the point of thinking that anything after is never as good.
Life is now, and while it is good to remember the past, it is important to take a sensible perspective of it. Moreover, you cannot escape current problems by wishing to be young again (or older, if that is the case). In other words, recognize when you are lamenting the loss of your younger days as an excuse for not facing the difficult issues in front of you right now. Save the energy for fixing current problems rather than imagining your life would be much better if only you were younger.

, There is no such thing. A person insisting on this is most likely wallowing in nostalgia and resentful of how life is right now. Most people experience ups and downs throughout life, there being times when you find things financially easier, more fulfilling, better connected, etc., than perhaps is the case right now. Of course, this can also be said of the future, when things are likely to change again and you may find older age more fulfilling, more stable, etc. You just don't know but you can work on improving the things about your life that you don't like right now.


Remember good memories for what they are––good memories. Be content with knowing that you have had those wonderful experiences without feeling that such events can't be again.

, Feeling desperate about your age often comes with a tinge of having missed out on doing certain things. This is a good opportunity to sit down and ask yourself why you haven't done these things yet and what you're going to do about it from this point onward. Are they still good ideas or are you nursing old dreams that could do with a revamp?


If ill health, a disability or other challenging issues have changed your life's direction, now is a great time to work out what is within your capacity rather than constantly lamenting what is no longer possible. Things are still possible, they're just going to be different things and it might take some more research and self-convincing before you're on a new and more interesting path again.
Realize that there are lots of things still ahead of you. Make the most of the opportunities that still exist.

, Living up to someone else's expectations? Age angst is a good reason to let go of those expectations and start being true to yourself. You may find it helpful to read the book by Bonnie Ware, called Top Five Regrets of the Dying. In this book, you'll learn what people at the end of their lives wish they'd known earlier and acted on to have made life better for themselves; reading stories like these can help you to benefit from their insights and break free from the bonds of others' expectations.

Read biographies of people who lost large chunks of their lives due to imprisonment, political repression or similar challenges but then went on to lead fulfilling lives much later, people such as Nelson Mandela and Václav Havel. Use their stories as inspiration for getting your own life back into gear.
There are also plenty of books about starting over or transitioning at later stages of life; don't feel it's impossible, as many people have managed this successfully.







, You're not alone in worrying about age issues––connect with someone who has either gone through similar experiences as you who is ahead of your time or to someone who is of your own age. Both age groups will help give you some interesting perspectives on how other people feel about aging and age issues.

By talking openly about your age worries with people of your own age, you'll open up a space in which you can all talk freely about a commonplace concern. Not only will this be a cathartic experience but you will also be socializing and being with people is one of the best ways to cheer yourself up.

, Age is a number but it's not something that defines you. Certainly, there are people who equate a specific age with certain unwritten ""rules"" about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable to do, whether it's fashion, hair color, work choices, travel itineraries, where you live, or anything else you care to name. No doubt you've read things like ""40 is the new 30"", ""70 is the new 50"". Such stories might be amusing but they're also superficial, basing how you ""should"" feel on a mere number. So what? That's their choice but that's exactly what it is––a choice. Nothing compels you to join the age-defining conformists out there. As the cliché says, ""you are only as old as you feel""––so how do you feel?


Smile more often and make daily excuses to laugh. Positive emotions will help you move beyond the feelings of desperation and disappointment. Think about what is good about your life right now rather than obsessing about what was so great about the past.

, When you feel more assured about embracing your age, whatever it is, share your confidence with others. In a society obsessed with a very small window of age as being the most relevant, it is easy to feel invisible or even to be discriminated against because of your age. The more people who speak out against ageist notions and who celebrate all ages, the better for us all.

Reduce the amount of “protection” you use when you hide.,
Ask a friend to observe a storm with you.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Get hypnosis.,
Participate in cognitive-behavioral therapy.",How to Overcome the Fear of Thunder," Because a fear can cause you to experience feelings of anxiety and even panic, it is important to learn coping tools before you start exposing yourself to your fear. Choose a coping tool that helps you relax and practice it daily as well as any time you feel anxious. Some good tools to learn include:Deep breathing
Progressive muscle relaxation
Meditation
Listening to soothing music
Wrapping yourself in a security blanket
Retreating to a “safe place” in your house;
, You probably have situations in mind that would cause you to be more fearful and anxious than other situations. Make a list of your fears in order from least frightening to most frightening. Then, use this list to guide you through your exposures.For example, least frightening on your list might be listening to a recording of a thunder storm, while the most frightening on your list might be to stand by a window inside of your home and watch a real thunder storm.

, When you feel ready, you can expose yourself to the lowest ranking item on your list. It is important to choose the least frightening item so that you can gain confidence to move on to the other more frightening items on your list.For example, if your lowest ranked item was listening to a recording of a thunder storm, then you could start by listening to recordings of storms. This exposes you to the thing you fear (the thunder) without actually putting you in direct contact with it.
After you have successfully exposed yourself to one item on your list, you can move on to the next one.

, As you expose yourself to items on your list, make sure that you use your coping tool to help you relax.This will help you to expose yourself for longer and feel more confident in your ability to face other items on your list.


For example, if your coping tool is deep breathing, then make sure that you do some deep breathing as soon as you start to feel any anxiety or fear.

, Drowning out the noise can be a helpful tool, especially in the beginning of your journey. It offers a way to distract yourself and hopefully forget your fear, but it does not necessarily work at the root of the of the problem.You can try turning up the volume on the television, listening to music on your headphones, playing an instrument, or making any other sound that will prevent you from hearing the thunder.

, People who are afraid of thunder often check the weather forecasts obsessively, especially before they leave their house, because they are afraid of being caught off-guard by a storm when they are not at home.If you don’t know when a storm will come, this may cause you to encounter one when you aren’t 100% prepared. This could eventually help you start overcoming your fear of thunder because you’ll get through the fear episode without the safety net of your own home and the memory of that will stick with you.

, If you tend to hide when you hear the sounds of thunder, try to consciously limit the number of things you use to hide with and feel more secure.For example, if you usually use a blanket to cover yourself, try using a smaller blanket that only covers part of your body. Or, if you usually hide in a dark room with the door closed, try leaving the door cracked open.
The key is to make some noticeable effort at using less “protection” so that you will see that you survived without when the fear passes.

, Sometimes we feel safer just being in the presence of someone we love and trust. A good step towards overcoming your fear of thunder would be to ask a friend or family member to help you work on this. At first, your friend might just sit inside with you during a storm. But you might try to progress toward watching the storm through the window with your friend or even standing on the porch with your friend while the storm passes.

, A professional therapist is a great person for you to talk to about your phobia of thunder. Just talking about your fears to a trained professional can be beneficial. But a therapist will also be able to help you figure out exercises that will get you to start moving toward overcoming your fear., Listening to hypnosis tapes while you sleep (those that are geared specifically towards fear of thunder) or getting hypnotized by a professional hypnotist is a great step toward overcoming your fear of thunder. When you sleep, your unconscious mind is more susceptible to reprogramming your associations. So if you associate fear with thunder, it will be easier to change this perception through hypnosis while you sleep.Hypnosis geared towards overcoming the fear of thunder should help you take longer to notice when storms are brewing and to feel calm, rather than panic, at the sound of thunder.

, This kind of therapy specifically focuses on retraining the brain to replace negative thought processes with more positive (and appropriate) ones. Over time, cognitive-behavioral therapy can work to significantly reduce the amount of fear you feel when you hear thunder.With cognitive-behavioral therapy, you will learn self-affirmations to soothe yourself with during storms and visualization exercises to help calm your panic and fear in the moment.

Determine the nature of the problem.,
Consider whether the illness is an emergency or not.,
Do not be afraid of asking the person for more information on how they are doing and feeling, especially in an emergency situation where their life might be in danger.,
Refer to the insurance plan.,
Contact your state's department of mental health and ask for help and referrals.,
Get in touch with any non-profit agencies in your area Try starting with the local United Way or other local umbrella non-profit agency, and ask for referrals from every agency you contact.,
Try university counseling departments and teaching hospitals where you can get information and services.,
Call the intake or social service departments at mental health hospitals for advice and referrals.,
Consider reputable alternative and non-traditional providers, such as pastoral counselors, Osteopaths, acupuncturists and so forth, but be sure these providers are experienced, educated and have practice treating other people with your problem.,
Contact self-help and advocacy organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness.",How to Get Mental Health Care in US," In many cases, physical or biological causes of mental problems need to be ruled out first if this is a new problem. Seeing a physician, nurse, or other primary provider is important to start the process. However, most primary providers have limited knowledge and training in recognizing and treating mental health issues. Doctors who specialize in mental health are called psychiatrists and psychologists. Psychiatrists evaluate the biological causes and prescribe medications. Psychologists will evaluate behavior and suggest the ideal behavior for the given situation.;
, If they are a danger to themselves, others or are gravely disabled then the situation is an emergency. Threats, overdoses (substance abuse suicide), reckless endangerment of self, or jokes about suicide is life threatening, especially if you tried talking the person out of it for up to an hour (and they aren't feeling any better), catch them mid act, or after an attempt. Threats, violence, or troubling jokes about homicide is life threatening to others, so is carelessness or loss of contact with reality to the point it could threaten those they care for (leaving a baby in the bathtub and thinking imaginary friends are watching him or thinking others could hurt their safety). Losing contact with reality such as not listening to facts destroying their delusions, talking to people who aren't there and not coming out of it after trying to reason with them. Gravely disabled to the point where they are no longer able to care for themselves in so severe a way that it puts their life and health in danger. Get this person to an emergency health care facility, a primary health care provider, or call the authorities for assistance as soon as possible. If it is you, go there asap, going to help is more pleasant than help finding you and you'll have more bargaining power if they see you are proactive.

, Understand it is a medical issue, so be calm and caring. Keep someone with the person if possible, if you are seeking help see if someone can escort you to care, such as an ambulance or family member. If you must involve the police carefully brief them both on the phone and in person before they meet the affected person. Some policemen are much better with the mentally ill than others...ask for a supervisor if you think things are not going well. Most medics are better at de-escalating a crisis situation than police, though there are exceptions.

, If the person is insured, most insurance companies have lists of providers who are local who can be contacted for care. Get as many referrals as possible and contact and interview a number of them if possible. Find out if there are any specialists in your problem, and treat these people as resources, asking if there are other special programs or centers they are aware of near you. Most insurance companies have clinical mental health experts on their staff, as opposed to the less trained customer service personnel. Ask to speak to one of these clinicians for information and referrals. Remember to write down the information, names and phone numbers in an easy to find place. These people can be your advocates with the insurance company to make sure you get the care you need and makes sure the care facility get paid for their services through insurance.

, Some states have far better services than others, particularly for the chronically ill. Most states have toll free central hot-line and referral services. It is better to contact a higher level state representative as they often have years of clinical experience and knowledge of local resources, including government and non-profit agencies (many of which receive some measure of local and state funding).

, There are a wide variety of local and national toll free hot-lines and crisis lines.

, They often are running research and trial programs that offer free or sliding scale services. Try to speak, if only briefly, with professors or doctors and ask for advice and referrals.

, Regardless of your finances, tell them that you can pay whatever fees they have, and are thinking of becoming a customer. This is a good source of information and referrals since these professionals jobs are to assess and refer the patient to the local area.

, Ask for references and evidence of success in treatment. Non-traditional providers are often less expensive than mainstream treatment, but be sure it works by studying peer reviewed articles or conducting library research.

, These can be a great source for information, advice, referrals and support (this program is also for the friends and family of the mentally ill). There are a variety of self-help groups for many mental health problems, especially urban areas. Look in the community, classified sections of newspapers, or on the Internet.

Do you have a habit of working really hard for something, only to experience failure? If so, these could be the reasons why you face everything with fear. Acknowledging the possibilities for why you are so afraid is the first step in facing your fears and moving on.


If you can’t figure out what you’re scared of or why on your own, talk to a professional. Speaking to someone who is impartial in your life is a great way to get an outsider’s point of view, which can make you realize what is holding you back.You can also ask a trusted friend or family member who has known you for a long time and seen you go through difficult times. They may have some invaluable insights.;
, There’s great power in writing something down. Just like writing a letter to someone you are upset with and never sending it, writing down your fears is an excellent way to get them off of your chest. Getting your fears out in the open by externalizing them like this can help you to let them go.


For example, you might write down ""I'm so happy in my relationship. I think something bad is bound to happen."" Include any fears you can think of that are currently affecting your life.
Decide what you want to do with this paper. You can carry it around with you and take a look at it whenever you start to worry. Seeing your fear out in the open can make you see how silly it may be. You can also tear it up, crumble it into a ball, or burn it, as a symbolic gesture that you’re destroying your fear and letting it go.The more you see your fear, expressed in writing, the more desensitized your brain may become to it; however, if you find that reading it is keeping you upset, find a meaningful way to let the paper go.

, Break down what it is that makes you so afraid. In order to understand your fear you need to recognize what's driving it. Beside the list of your fears, try to identify some possible reasons you have this fear.With the former scenario, you might analyze what exactly ""is bound to happen?"" Your partner cheats? This might point to trust issues driving the fear. Someone gets hurts? This may indicate fear of abandonment or being alone.

, If you’re contemplating applying for a new job, but you’re too afraid of what might go wrong, ask yourself, “What’s the worst that can happen?” Perhaps you don’t like the job, you aren’t fond of your new boss or co-workers, or it’s not what you expected. Although these scenarios aren’t ideal, they certainly aren’t devastating. If you’re unhappy at the new job, you can always ask for your old job back or find a new one.


Keep in mind that if you were totally satisfied with your situation, you wouldn’t be thinking about changing it. There is a reason why you want to find something new. Staying in a job in which you are unhappy is likely worse than what could happen at a new workplace., Stop wondering about what might happen in the future or what has already happened in the past. Instead, focus on what is happening in your life right now, and stop wondering about what could happen or what already did. Your fear of the future or traumatic past experiences you had can stop you from moving forward in your life.


When you find yourself dwelling on the past or having anxiety about what could be, take a deep breath and bring yourself back to the present. Write down a list of what you love in your life right now and focus on that.
Try grounding yourself with meditation or by practicing mindfulness.
Realize that all of your experiences have led you to these wonderful achievements. This may help you to calm your fears and understand that the risks you took and failures you may have had in the past has led you to your accomplishments today. , One of the best ways to get over your fear of failing is to make your decisions quickly. Rather than obsessing and analyzing every possible outcome of your choice, dive in head first and just go with your gut.


Doing so can help you to move on and possibly see that good things come out of taking a leap and just going for it.The next time you have to make a decision, set a deadline. Give yourself anywhere from 30 minutes to a full day depending on the significance. For example, if you have been dying for a promotion and you are offered one, you might take that full day. Meanwhile, if you must decide between which classes to enroll in college next semester, allow yourself 30 minutes to an hour to consider your options.
Set smaller deadlines for researching your options, gathering information, and getting feedback from others.

, Researchers have noticed that people tend to be influenced by the emotions and moods of those around them. If you don't have supportive friends and/or family — if those closest to you put you down, aren't encouraging, or are negative, you may be picking up on this negativity. This can increase stress and even lead to depression.If you notice some people in your life who are overly negative, make an effort to distance yourself from them. Instead, spend more time with friends who are positive, supportive, and helpful.

If you're not sure if your support group is all that supportive, start noticing how you feel when you're around them. If you feel tense or stressed when around certain people and experience relief when you're away from them, this might indicate a negative environment.

, Sometimes, our fears prevent us from leading full, satisfying lives. If you are having trouble of overcoming your fear of failure or doom, it may help to talk to a professional. There may be a deeper, underlying cause to your worries that are leaving you immobilized and defenseless. Working with a mental health therapist can help you identify the source of your concerns and come up with effective strategies to overcome them.


For example, you keep thinking that something will go wrong in your relationship, so you are putting off making a commitment. This might be a good reason to see a therapist to help you deal with the source of your concerns.

, You’ve already thought about the worst that can happen; in fact, you’ve probably obsessed over it. Instead though, try to think about the best that can happen. Refocus your thoughts to what happens if it works out. You may have to do this multiple times before you start feeling confident.


For instance, if you’re thinking about asking someone at the gym out on a date, don’t think about what happens if they say “No.” Instead, think about what could happen if they say “Yes.” You may have a good time, you may go on new dates, and you may find someone you can have a meaningful relationship with for a long time.
Concentrating on the positives can make you excited about trying something new and may prove to you that things don’t always go wrong., The truth is, your fear of failing may not ever totally disappear. This is a consistent thought for many people as they strive for success. But what you can do is power through anyways. Take the leap and let your fear fuel you. Use that anxiety for good and allow it to help you get to your goal. The more times you do this, the easier it will become.Think about the ways fear can actually be helpful and motivating. If you have a healthy level of fear, you will be more driven to be prepared and conscientious.

, Although failing is never fun, it can create a new beginning. If you are fired from a job or your relationship is over, you now have an opportunity to start over again. That may seem daunting and overwhelming at first, but it’s a chance to do something different.


Reflect on the experience and write down what you have learned. This may help you concretely see how it was a useful experience.
Realize that you’re not alone if you fail. Many successful people didn’t hit their stride until many attempts later. Use them as inspiration to not give up."

Learning requires exploration and creativity, and both of these approaches offer the opportunity to learn what doesn’t work, as well as what does. We can’t explore the depths of what knowledge has to offer until we try. Embracing failure as a learning experience allows you to see it as a gift, not a punishment or sign of weakness.Remember that many others have been in the same situation. Consider Myshkin Ingawale, an Indian inventor who had to test 32 prototypes of his technology before he found the one that worked. He could have given up and characterized himself as a failure after any of those roadblocks, but he kept focused on learning from his mistakes and applying them to the future, and now his invention has cut maternal death rates in rural India by 50%.;
, Often times, when a result doesn't match our expectations, we are tempted to mark the attempt as a failure. This is “all or nothing” thinking, and it’s a distortion of healthy thinking that encourages you to judge everything in absolute terms, rather than examining them in a nuanced way.However, if we view our results as more or less effective, with the aim of improvement, we are able to always make positive changes.Studies show that people who are successful usually don’t encounter fewer or more setbacks than people who aren’t. The key is entirely in how you interpret those setbacks. Don’t let them convince you that success is impossible.Meeting your idealized results takes time and hard work. Success is a process. Don't let any perceived failures prevent you from continuing that process.
Don't run from this process, but embrace it, knowing that it will only yield better results.
Remember that you can’t control or predict everything. View unexpected variations or fluctuation as what they are: external elements beyond your control. Only account for what is in your control.
Make sure your goals are realistic and obtainable.

, Rushing into new ventures without any personal preparation can make things worse. You will need to work through your fear or failure at your own pace, without pushing too far outside your comfort zone all at once.Try to find smaller steps you can take towards your goals that you feel comfortable with.
Think of any long term or large scale goals in terms of these small steps that you know you can accomplish.

, Don't mock your fears, they are there for a reason. Work with your fears, treating yourself sympathetically and with understanding. The more you learn about why you have these fears and what causes them, the better you can work with them.Write your fears down in detail. Don't be afraid to explore exactly why and what you fear.
Accept that these fears are a part of you. Accepting your fears can help you to regain control over them.

, Learning from the past is critical to building a better future for yourself. Keep careful track of what worked, what didn't, and why. Plan any future actions in accordance with what you have learned from past actions.Improving your future plans by keeping track of what works and what doesn't will help ease the fear of failure.
Learn to value failure. Failure is just as informative and valuable as success.
Experiencing failure will allow you to learn from what didn’t work and will help you avoid that setback in future attempts. You will likely still encounter challenges, roadblocks, and setbacks, but you will be better equipped to overcome them with the knowledge you have gained.

, Often times the fear of failure is only a general understanding of what we are truly afraid of. If this fear of failure is examined, it may be discovered that there are other fears underlying it. These specific fears can be addressed and worked with, once identified.Fear of failure is often only a broad level of understanding what the issue is.
We may be afraid to fail, but failure is often tied to other ideas such as self-worth or self-image.
There are links that trace fear of failure to shame.
Examples of more specific fears may include being worried about losing security from a risky investment or being exposed to humiliation from your peers.

, It can be easy to see something that you interpret as a failure and extend that lack of success to yourself. You may also take a single instance of failure and apply it to your whole life and self. You might think, “I’m a loser” or “I’m worthless at this” because your efforts are not having the results you hope for.While this is common, it is not helpful, and it isn’t true, either.Examine the script in your head about this event. We often allow our thoughts to slip into predictable scripts that aren’t helpful. For example, if you’re working on an invention and the 17th try has just bombed, you might experience this script: “Yep, I’m never going to get this right. I’m a failure.” The facts of the situation are simply that this try hasn’t worked. The facts say nothing about you as a person, or about the possibility of future success. Separate the facts from your script.

, Some people believe that perfectionism is the same as healthy ambition or standards of excellence, but on the contrary, perfectionism can actually cause failures. Perfectionists are often obsessed with the fear of failure. Often, they categorize anything that does not meet their unreasonably high standards as a “failure.” This can lead to things such as procrastination, because you are so worried about your work being imperfect that you can never finish it. Set healthy, ambitious standards for yourself and acknowledge that sometimes, your work won’t quite meet them.Studies have shown that professors who are perfectionists produce fewer research studies and papers than professors who are adaptive and open to critique.Perfectionism can also make you more likely to develop mental health conditions such as depression and eating disorders.

, It can be quite easy to focus on past failures and let them prevent you from future success. Instead of focusing exclusively on how badly things seem to have gone, focus on what went well and what was learned..Even if your main goal didn't succeed, you can still have a success if you learn from the experience.
Focusing on only negative aspects will make the situation appear to be just that, entirely negative.
By focusing on successes and positive aspects, you will learn what works and be better prepared for the future.

, If you are fearful of failing at a new task, or are worried about failing a familiar one, you can keep your skills up to date to help with this. By practicing your skills and demonstrating to yourself that you are competent in whatever area you focus on, you will boost your self-confidence. Acknowledge what you do well, as well as the areas in which you can further develop.Reinforce your existing skills. Always keep up to date with any knew best practices that might be employed in that skill set.
Learn new skills. By learning new skills you will enrich your skill set and be better prepared for a wider variety of situations that might arise as you pursue your goals.

, The only true failure is the one that happens when you never even try. Taking the first step is generally the most difficult; however, it is also the most important. It is natural to feel afraid and uncomfortable when trying something new. You can take some steps to help you deal with this discomfort.Give yourself permission to feel uncomfortable. Everyone has moments when they feel uncomfortable or afraid of challenges, even incredibly successful billionaire businessmen. Acknowledge that this fear is natural and okay, and stop fighting it or repressing it. Instead, resolve to work even though you feel afraid.
Remember to break down your larger goals into smaller ones. Having these smaller stages that you know you can accomplish will make the larger goal less intimidating.
Moving forward will give you new information and allow you to adjust your course of action towards success.

, By actively exposing yourself to failure, you will learn that failure is not as frightening as you may believe it to be. This is a technique known as exposure therapy and it can be used to lessen the effects of fear in your life.This type of practice will give you experience in dealing with fear or discomfort and discovering that you can work through it to experience success.


Find a new hobby or activity that you are unskilled at. Start practicing and look forward to the failures you encounter, knowing that they will only increase your success in the future.
For example, start playing a new instrument. Failures along the way to competency with this instrument will be common. These failures will give you many opportunities to get comfortable with failure. They will also show you that failure is not total or debilitating. Just because you fail the first hundred times you try to play the Moonlight Sonata doesn’t mean you’ll never get it right.
You might also try asking strangers for simple things such as a mint or asking for a discount when buying something. Your goal is to fail, reframing failure as success and nullifying the limiting effects fear can have on your behavior., Sometimes, the fear of failing can trigger responses in the body similar to panic or anxiety attacks caused by any other fear. Your first step in stopping such a panic attack is to realize the symptoms at the onset of one. Look for some of the following symptoms:Increased heart rate or irregular heart rhythm.
Difficulty breathing or tightness in throat.
Tingling, shaking, or sweating.
Feeling light-headed, dizzy, or as if you are about to pass out.

, During a panic attack your breathing will likely consist of short, quick breaths that will only help maintain the panicked state. Take control of your breathing and inhale deeply and slowly, to help bring back a normal rhythm to your breath.Breath in slowly, for five seconds, through your nose. Use your diaphragm, not your chest, to breath in. Your stomach should rise with the breath, not your chest.
Exhale at the same slow pace, again, through your nose. Make sure you fully exhale all the air in your lungs while focusing on counting to five.
Repeat this cycle of breathing until you begin to feel calm.

, Your body will likely be very tense during a panic attack and this tension will only add to the feeling of anxiety. Work to release the tension in your muscles by tensing, holding, and releasing those muscles.You can tense and release all the muscles in your body at once, for a quick and full body relaxation technique.
For greater relaxation, start by tensing the muscles in your feet, holding them for a few seconds, and then releasing the tension. Move up your body, tensing and releasing your lower leg, upper leg, stomach, back, chest, shoulders, arms, neck and face.

, This helpful acronym can help you avoid reacting with immediate fear in situations. When you encounter that fear of failure, practice the following:Stop what you are doing. Whatever you’re doing, stop and take a step back from the situation. Give yourself some time to think before reacting.

Take a deep breath. Take a few moments to cleanse yourself with a few deep breaths. This will restore oxygen to your brain and help you make clearer decisions.

Observe what is going on. Ask yourself some questions. What is going on in your mind? What are you feeling? What is the “script” in your head right now? Are you considering the facts? Are you giving more weight to opinions? What are you focusing on?

Pull back for perspective. Try to imagine the situation from the perspective of an impartial observer. What would she see in this situation? Is there another way of approaching this situation? How big is this situation in the grand scheme of things -- will it even matter 6 days or 6 months from now?

Proceed based on your principles. Go forth with what you know and have determined. Practice what is most in line with your values and goals.

, We’re often our own worst critics. You may discover that your inner critic is always dissatisfied with you, telling you things like “I’m not good enough” or “I will never get this right” or “I shouldn’t even bother trying this.” When you discover those types of thoughts, challenge them. They’re unhelpful, and even more, they’re untrue.Think how you’d counsel a friend. Imagine that it is a friend or loved one in your situation. Perhaps your best friend is afraid of leaving her day job to pursue her dream of becoming a musician. What would you tell her? Would you immediately imagine her failure, or would you find ways to support her? Give yourself the same compassion and belief that you would show a loved one.
Think whether you’re generalizing. Are you taking one specific instance and generalizing it to your whole experience? For example, if your science project has not worked, are you extending that failure to every aspect of your life and saying something like “I’m a failure”?

, When you catastrophize, you fall into the trap of assuming that the absolute worst thing that could possibly happen will happen. You allow your fear to send your thoughts spiraling out of control, making logical leaps. You can challenge this by slowing down and asking yourself for evidence for your assumptions.For example, perhaps you are worried that if you change your college major to a subject that you really want to study but find challenging, you will fail. From there, your thoughts could spiral into catastrophizing: “If I fail this major I’ll flunk out of college. I’ll never find a job. I’ll have to live in my parents’ basement for the rest of my life and eat ramen noodles. I’ll never be able to date or get married or have kids.” Obviously, this is an extreme case, but it’s an example of how fear can send your thoughts wildly out into left field.
Try to put your thoughts into perspective. For example, if you’re afraid to change your college major because you’re worried you will fail, consider: what is the worst thing that could really happen, and how likely is it? In this case, the worst thing that happens is that you aren’t good at organic chemistry (or whatever subject attracts you) and fail a few courses. This is not a calamity. There are many actions you can take to help you get past these failures, such as hiring a tutor, studying more, and speaking with professors.
The more likely situation is that you find your new subject difficult at first, but you learn and grow and finish college happy that you pursued your passion.

, The fear of failure may stem from the belief that others are scrutinizing your every move. You may feel like any little slip-up will be noted and spread around. However, the fact is that most people are so engaged with their own issues and worries that they don’t have the time or effort to scrutinize every tiny thing you do.Look for evidence that contradicts your assumptions. For example, you may be worried about going to parties because you’re afraid you may say something foolish or make a joke that bombs. This fear of failure could keep you from enjoying social interactions with others. However, you could consider past experience and others’ experiences to help you get past this fear.
For example, you could think about whether any of your friends or anyone you know has ever made a social faux pas. It’s practically guaranteed that you can think of someone who’s had a social slip-up. Did their mistake result in them being shunned or everyone viewing them as a failure? Probably not.
The next time you find yourself fearing that you will encounter failure and be judged for it, remind yourself: “Everyone makes mistakes. I give myself permission to slip up or look silly. This will not make me a failure.”
If you do encounter people who are are harsh judges or overly critical, recognize that the problem is with them, not with you.

Use positive visualizations.To increase your confidence in the shaky ride of overcoming autophobia, use your mind to envision what you want for yourself.,
Seek counseling.Therapy provides a safe space for you to explore and continue to overcome the root issues that give rise to autophobia.",How to Overcome Autophobia (Fear of Being Alone)," Having a good handle on your symptoms will guide you toward the best methods of treatment, and indicate how much self-work you can do on this phobia without the risk of physical harm. Check for fit with the following specifications, which are present for six months or longer:Strong, out of proportion fear to being alone or the anticipation of being alone
Immediate anxiety response upon being or anticipating being alone, which may take the form of a panic attack
Personal recognition that the fear is disproportionate to the dangers of being alone
Avoidance of being alone or solitude is endured with intense anxiety or distress
Avoidance, anxious anticipation or distress of being alone interferes significantly with your normal routine, work (or academic) functioning, or socializing and relationships
Distress about autophobia itself;
, Is there some negative judgment about being alone that haunts you? For instance, you might fear being seen as a loner, or as anti-social and strange. Some worry about being viewed as selfish and unthoughtful for taking time out for themselves.Thinking about the messages you give yourself while you are alone is a worthwhile project. Doing so will allow you to see over and above the more superficial reasons why you think you do not like to be alone.

, Ask yourself whether or not you feel capable of creating your own happiness and to take care of yourself. Then, push yourself to think about what it is that others do for you that you are unable to do alone. Consider what about being alone creates fear for you. Answering questions like these in your journal can provide insight and clarity into your fear:


How long has this fear been with you?
What was going on when it started?
How has it changed since then?

, People who fear being alone typically perceive their relationships as requiring lots of upkeep.Do you feel you must take care of or devote a large amount of time and energy to the other person?


Try to be realistic about what others need from you by reflecting on their capability to provide for and take care of themselves. You can also think about others who are around to support them, or perhaps the fact that they were doing fine before you met.
This tendency to give others the depth of love and attention that you want for yourself is problematic. This might be one way that you are robbed of the solitude needed to develop your own values and unique personality. In fact, this tendency ironically stops you from being able to direct focus outward onto others in a meaningful way., Try convincing yourself of the value of overcoming this fear. Make a list of advantages and disadvantages to spending time alone. Remember to consider the cost of this fear on your relationships, your own passions, and your self-development.

, This process might take place four times a week.


Make exposure gradual and take into consideration how bad your fear is. This process takes time and should not be rushed. Plan to be alone for short spurts. Little by little, you will want to plan increased amounts of time alone until you don’t feel overcome with panic.
Try making an exposure hierarchy in which you rank feared situations on a scale of 0-100 according to how afraid you anticipate being when exposed to it.For example, you may rank spending an hour alone at home at 100, but going to a movie alone a 70. By ranking you can work up to overcoming gradually greater fears only once fear subsides for the less threatening fears.

, At first you’ll feel incredibly nervous and anxious, and this is normal. In time, your body will relax. After a few highly uncomfortable attempts, this will be a way to signal to yourself that you are capable of spending time alone. Exposing yourself to your fear will also help you think more deeply about the fears behind the initial panic.


Don't become overly preoccupied with how panicked you feel and how stressed your body becomes. Because you are purposely exposing yourself to something you fear, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are normal.
The longer the alone time, the greater the anxiety you will feel. But, with exposure, anxiety is expected and will dissipate with time. Gently push your limits until you are happy with how much alone time you can handle. Imagine you are going swimming--dipping your toes in the water can be exciting, but it won't adjust you to the temperature of the water.Another option is FearFighter, a computerized program of self-help methods that treat phobias.It is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and proven effective.

, Try reciting a few lines of a poem to yourself, doing arithmetic in your head, or whispering encouraging phrases to yourself, like ""this feeling will pass, I have handled it before"".


Remember, the less often you use your crutch, the more intensive the exposure sessions will be.

, During and after your exposure sessions, record your level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 is fully relaxed and 10 is as fearful as you can imagine being. Doing this will show you how desensitized you have become to being alone and how much fear you were safely able to handle.


Note trends in the sessions when anxiety seems especially high or low. Do you see any other factors that affect your fear, like the weather, or who you spent time with earlier in the day?
You can also use the journal to write encouraging thoughts, difficulties, and anything else that ""comes up"" related to the fear. This will help you know yourself and your underlying patterns better.

, Let the people you normally spend time with know that you do not want them to placate your requests for company. Talking to people you are close to about this issue will help both of you understand and respond positively to changes in the relationship that might ensue.


Explain how much you cherish the relationship, and that spending more time alone will actually nurture your ability to connect rather than sabotage it. Express gratitude for their understanding that you need to work on you first.

, Change your habits from blindly reaching out for others to being assertive about what it is that you do need from them. Try talking to individuals in your life about what you need and expect from one another. You will likely find that they do not require constant togetherness or as much connection as you may have thought. Making clear requests will show you that what you want is simple and does not create a very high demand on others.

, Spending time alone is valuable in itself because it teaches you more about yourself and what you like to do. Use alone time productively so that you don't get anxious or afraid. Allow yourself to seek your own interests, passions, talents, wishes, desires, and dreams.


What is it that you need from time alone? Everyone needs time to reflect, embrace self-understanding, and grow from within. Consider how much you learn about yourself when making decisions that don’t need to be negotiated with anyone else.
Do you already have a passion that can only be fostered when you have time alone to express yourself, work out the kinks of what you do, and create to the best of your ability? Consider solitude a gift that you are giving yourself to get your passion going.

, Before you act on your impulses to call someone up, or to plan your day such that people are constantly around, take some time.Write down what it is that you’re feeling that pushes you into a flurry of anxiety that others are not around. Try to understand what you’re feeling, acknowledging it gently, without trying to get rid of it. This will improve your ability to slow down and re-consider the next time you want to flee yourself by being with others.


Other relaxation and stress-relieving techniques will do wonders for your ability to cope.Getting exercise, especially cardiovascular activities, like running and swimming will release endorphins and other chemicals that boost mood.

Meditation, yoga, and intentional breathing are more relaxed ways to reduce anxiety and help control impulses to act out of neediness.

, Imagine yourself going confidently and successfully into situations alone and develop an appreciation for how it feels to be self-reliant. Visualizing a more confident, self-supportive you will make you more inclined to want to become the person who you can see so clearly.

, A specialist can serve as a guide through this journey.


Group support can also help autophobia.Meeting with others who share similar struggles can be an important source of solace and support. Knowing that you are not alone in not wanting to be alone is eye-opening and provides opportunities to share practical advice.

Know the education requirements for your career goals.,
Finish high school.,
Consider starting with a Diploma Program.,
Get an Associate’s Degree.,
Consider a Bachelor’s Degree.,
Choose a school that’s right for you.",How to Get Medical Billing and Coding Certification1," If you know what kind of healthcare setting you want to work in, speak with someone in Human Resources about what they look for when hiring medical billing and coding professionals.This is the best way to begin to decide what degree you need to pursue, and to start thinking about what certification you may want.


Say something like, “I’m pursuing a certification in medical billing and coding, and I’m interested in applying for a job at your hospital once I’m certified. Can you please tell me what level of degree, type of certification, or other qualifications you look for in your candidates?”;
, Every certification for medical billing and coding requires a high school diploma or equivalent. Complete high school, obtain a GED, or get a high school diploma equivalent as the first step towards your certification., If you have finished high school, you can consider a billing and coding Diploma Program. This usually takes 6-9 months and gives the most basic medical and billing training. It’s low cost (usually only several hundred dollars) and is taught at medical billing schools, community colleges, career schools, or even online.Consider, however, that many certifications require or strongly suggest an Associate’s Degree. The Diploma Program may be a good jumping off point, or helpful if you’re highly motivated in teaching yourself content – but for many, it may not get you where you want to go.
If you intend to go to a 4-year college, start with an Associate’s degree rather than a Diploma program.
Be wary of programs or classes offered online, because there are many scams out there. If a website promises you a huge salary, a really short certification course, extremely low fees, or requires lots of money up front, it’s probably not a legitimate program., A 2-year Associate’s Degree provides more in depth training than the Diploma Program, and can start you off towards a 4-year degree. It can cost several thousand dollars, but is probably available at many community colleges at reasonable cost. Some professional organizations, like AHIMA, require this level of degree at a minimum, as do many employers., A Bachelor of Arts in Health Information and Management is another, more extensive way to approach a medical billing and coding career. It’s a 4 year program, but the perk is that in 2010 those with a BA earned $10,000 per year more in salary than someone with an Associate’s degree., As long as you choose an accredited program, what school you attend is a personal choice. Speak to students of different programs to get feedback and opinions. Ask employers in your field if they recommend anywhere in particular. Research what each school requires to apply, what it costs, what their pass rate is for certification exams, and what resources are offered after school to help with job searches.

Ease into driving gradually.",How to Overcome Fear of Driving," Your fear of driving may be a phobia if it is so severe that it causes debilitating symptoms.If you are just a bit frightened by the idea or act of driving, then it is probably not a phobia. For example, a fear of driving might cause you to feel a bit nervous before you start your morning commute, while a phobia might cause you to avoid driving altogether by taking public transportation or riding your bike to work. Phobias may cause emotional and physical symptoms such as:


feeling dizzy
sweating
having chest pain
having difficulty breathing
trembling or shaking
having a racing pulse
feeling anxious
wanting to escape or run away
feeling like you are going crazy or dying
feeling powerless to control your fear;
, The first step toward getting over your fear of driving is to try to pinpoint the reason you are afraid. Many people with this issue experienced a traumatic event at some point in their past that turned them off to the idea of piloting a car; for others, the fear arose gradually.For still others, driving fear has a more indirect source. The following are examples of how some driving fears and phobias start:You were in a serious car accident. This is a big reason some people don't like to drive, and it is especially likely to be problematic if it happened when you were a young, inexperienced driver (or as a child passenger).
You had a negative experience when first learning to drive, such as being yelled at by an impatient teacher or being a victim of another driver's road rage.
You become anxious or feel trapped during traffic jams.
You found yourself driving in bad weather such as deep snow, icy roads, heavy rain or fog, or high winds. Whether or not such an event results in an accident, it can lead to fear of driving if it is a frightening experience.
You are frightened by stories of traffic accidents. Sometimes just knowing what could happen is enough to generate heightened fear of driving.
You are prone to anxiety attacks, which you fear having while driving and losing control as a result.
Stress and anxiety in other aspects of your life has boiled over to affect your driving confidence., Phobias, especially when deep-seated, can be difficult to overcome without assistance. If you cannot seem to overcome your driving phobia or if your phobia is impacting your quality of life, you should think about seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you to address the problem and take steps to overcome your driving phobia.Even if you have a fear of driving and not a phobia, a therapist can help you to identify the source of your fear and become more comfortable with driving.
Search online for therapists in your area and seek out those who specialize in anxiety disorders (the category under which most driving phobias fall)., This means learning to drive defensively and not take on a passive role when behind the wheel. In addition to traditional driver's education (which is usually a mandatory part of getting a license in the first place), you can take defensive driving courses and skill-enhancement courses if need be.Part of learning to be a good driver is knowing the rules of the road. Don't overwhelm yourself with details on traffic laws, but do become familiar with major laws and regulations (such as right-of-way guidelines).
Taking informal lessons from a friend or family member who is a safe, experienced driver can go a long way toward building your confidence, and won't cost you anything but some time and effort.
Before going out on the open road, go to an open lot (such as a store parking lot on days when the business is closed) with a friend and just get used to the feeling of being behind the wheel. Once you feel comfortable enough, practice starting and stopping, turning, and signaling.
If even the idea of driving slowly in an empty parking lot frightens you, begin by just sitting in the driver's seat of your car with the engine off. Eventually, start the car; over time, the basic aspects of driving won't seem so scary.

, These will work differently for different people, but could include things such as meditating, deep breathing, or praying. Find what works for you and do it on a daily basis. If you are naturally prone to panic attacks, this should be part of your daily routine already. If you have suffered a car accident, learning to keep calm when returning to driving is key to regaining self-confidence.If you are in therapy for anxiety already, ask your therapist what you can do to calm yourself down in a situation where you are beginning to panic. Figuring out how to handle your anxiety before you go out on the road will be help your nerves immensely.Keep in mind that it is rare for someone to have an accident while in the midst of a panic attack., A certain degree of anxiety can be relieved by knowing as much as possible about how your car works. If you understand the operations of your vehicle's safety features and how they can protect you in the unlikely event of a crash, you may become less scared to drive.


Know how to properly wear your seatbelt. The single biggest thing you can do to protect yourself from becoming injured during a crash is to wear your seatbelt. Seatbelts are most effective when worn low and tight across the lap and with the shoulder strap across your chest.You may also want to consider a built-in emergency contact system, such as On Star. These systems make it easy for you to get help if you are in an accident and they will automatically send help if you can’t respond.Most vehicle operator's manuals have sections devoted to safety features. Some even provide instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency. Alternatively, you can ask your insurance provider for this information.

, When planning to go out for a drive, make sure you are well-rested. Alertness and quick thinking are critical aspects of driving safely, and you will feel less anxious if you are not tired when you get behind the wheel. Do not rely upon caffeine or other artificial alertness aids to keep you awake.


If you take medications that make you drowsy, do not drive while under their influence.
Contrary to what you might expect, you could be more likely to have an anxiety attack if you try to drive while tired, as you might panic just knowing that you could fall asleep.

, Before you even start the car, you should check that all your mirrors are aligned properly so that you can see to the sides and rear of your car from your forward-facing driving position. It is also important that your seat be adjusted so that you can comfortably reach the steering wheel and pedals.Your side mirrors should give you a decent view of what is behind and slightly to the side of your car. While you will still have blind spots that can only be checked by turning your head, you will feel more comfortable if a quick glance at your mirrors shows you as much as possible.
Avoid scooting your seat too far forward. If you are crowded into the steering wheel when driving, you could begin to feel trapped; additionally, the force of an airbag can injure a person if they are seated too close to it during deployment.
Avoid reclining your seat too much. You don't want to create a gap between the shoulder strap of your seatbelt and your chest, as this will reduce the effectiveness of your seatbelt in the event of a collision.

, Some fear of driving comes from wanting a perfect driving experience without problems and being afraid that this won't happen. You need to get used to the idea that there will always be things to watch out for as you drive; however, if you're alert and expecting potential surprises, you'll be in a much better position to react appropriately.


This does not mean you should anticipate the worst -- doing so will only make your anxiety worse and won't help you get past your fear. Rather, tell yourself that everything will work out fine, even if there's an issue.

, When you first begin driving, avoid becoming overwhelmed by having a clear route planned out for those initial drives. You should choose an area with which you are familiar and visualize your driving route ahead of time on a map or GPS device. This way, you won't be faced with deciding where to go once you're in the car.Just driving around your block is a good way to start, unless your block is crowded or has lots of pedestrians or animals.
Have a friend drive you out to a quiet, secluded location for your first few drives if this sounds less frightening to you. Just be sure to have the specific location planned out before you head out.

, Don't try to conquer Everest in a day. The important thing is that you end up driving eventually. Take small steps in the right direction by doing short trips near home with someone you trust. Gradually lengthen your driving expeditions and work up to trying some without a traveling companion present.It is okay to go back a step if you feel you're progressing too quickly for comfort. In other words, if you went for a short drive with a friend but were terrified the whole time, you can temporarily go back to just sitting in the driver's seat with the engine running.
If you are starting from the ground level (i.e., you were previously not driving at all), don't jump onto a busy freeway or city street without first becoming accustomed to mellow roads with little traffic.

Ask yourself how you define success.,
Question what about success scares you.,
Determine how fear is limiting you.,
Declare defeat of your fear.",How to Overcome a Fear of Success1," Before you can begin to overcome a fear of success, you have to understand what success means to you.Even though it may be tough to pinpoint specifically what being successful means to you, doing this will help you understand exactly what it is you’re fearing.


Be sure to identify your vision for personal and professional success.
Ask yourself, “What does success look and feel like to me? How will I know if I’m successful? What will I do and how will I act when I’m successful?”
Write down as your answers to these questions. Include answers that may not seem to relate to success if they pop into your head. For example, if you think “Success looks like luxury,” write that.
Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing, “If I have a lot of money I’ll know I’m successful,” write something like, “I’ll know I’m successful when I have $10 million in savings.”;
, Sometimes when we are afraid we can recognize the feeling, but not still understand exactly what we’re afraid of. In order to overcome your fear, you have to ask yourself what specifically you are afraid of and where the fear cam from.Once you know what you’re really afraid of, you can work to overcome your fear.


Try asking yourself, “Am I fearful of this because someone put it in my head? Or, is it based on past mistakes or failures?” If the fear is truly unfounded, this may help you let go of it.
Look over your list of definitions of success. Think about each item on the list and how you feel about it. For instance, if success is winning a football championship, how will you feel if you do win?
Write a few words that describe how you feel about each item. For instance, if you wrote “success is graduating,” you might write, “means I’m not a child anymore; makes me nervous about responsibilities.”
Pay attention to signs of success that give you negative feelings. For example, if you listed financial security as a sign of success and you noted it makes you think of loneliness, you may want to explore why this is.

, Being honest with yourself about just how your fear of success is holding you back is one way to overcome it.Take some time to think about specific ways in which your fear of success is limiting your potential and your future success.


Write down examples of how you have sabotaged yourself. For instance, you might write, “I procrastinated on my report.”
Also, write about what might have happened if you hadn’t let your fear hold you back. For example, you may write something like, “I could have gotten the raise and afford the vacation I want.” Take a moment to thoroughly visualize yourself succeeding. Positive visualizations may help to eliminate your fear.

, Writing a short statement declaring that you aren’t going to let fear stop you from succeeding and reaching your goals any more is a concrete way to overcome your fear. Doing this can help you improve your self-confidence, as well as remind you that your fear of success doesn’t control your life.


Write a sentence or two along the lines of, “I am not a victim of my fear. I am not afraid of success. I will be successful and I will enjoy it.”
Read your statement out-loud on a regular basis. For instance, you might read it before work each morning or before a major presentation. You can also read your declaration to an accountability partner who can help keep you focused on your goal. You may be more likely to follow through with things if someone is holding you accountable.

Complete a program accredited by a major organization.,
Pass your exam.,
Become a Certified Coder through AHIMA.,
Become certified through AAPC.,
Consider specializing through the AAPC.",How to Get Medical Billing and Coding Certification2," Whatever level of education you pursue, ensure quality – and that your work will be recognized by employers – by completing a program that is accredited by a major organization.American Health Information Management (AHIMA) and the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC) are the two largest, most well-known organizations. Both of these provide tools on their websites to find credible programs., You will choose between the certification exams provided by AHIMA and AAPC. Whichever organization’s exam you choose is also the professional membership you will obtain. Which specific exam you take will depend on which certification you are getting.


Attending an accredited program and having the recommended work experience will probably enable you to pass your exam. For additional help, both AHIMA and AAPC have online study resources.

, If you choose to pursue your certification and take the exam offered by AHIMA, you will choose one of three levels of Certified Coding. Join AHIMA as a member to be eligible for any of these.


To be a Certified Coding Assistant (CCA), you need your high school diploma and to take the exam. Generally, passing the exam requires 6 months of work experience after completing an accredited certification program.A more popular option is to become a Certified Coding Specialist (CCS). This generally requires 3 years of experience in the workplace, plus additional coursework in pharmacology, anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology in order to pass the exam.Opt to take the exam to be a Certified Coding Specialist - Physician-based (CCS-P) if you plan to work in a physician’s office, group practice, specialty area, or clinic practicing multiple specialties., The American Academy of Professional Coders is the largest professional organization for medical billing and coding workers. To obtain a certification you need to be a member of AAPC, pay an exam fee, and pass the appropriate exam. Once you pass the exam, you will have an Apprentice Certification, and have “-A” after your title. After you obtain 2 years of work experience in the appropriate field, you’ll drop the “-A” and be a full professional.The standard certification is a Certified Professional Coder (CPC). This will be your title once you have your 2 years experience, 2 letters of recommendation that you are proficient with CPT, ICD, HCPCS codes, or proof of 80 hours of education in coding.An off-shoot of CPC is the CPC-H certification, or Certified Professional Coder-Hospital. This is a good choice if you want to work in a clinic, hospital, or outpatient setting.
You can take the exam to be a Certified Professional Coder-Payer (CPC-P) if you have extra skill with insurance payment procedures including Private, Medicare, Medicaid, as well as self-pay by patients., There are over 20 different options for specialization that the AAPC offers – everything from dermatology to pediatrics. This gives you the opportunity to become proficient in basic billing and coding, and then pursue an area that particularly interests you. Each specialty has its own individualized exam. All of the options are available on AAPC’s website.


One of the highest-paying specialties is the position of Certified Interventional Radiology Cardiovascular Coder (CIRCC)."

Start journaling.,
List your strengths.,
Use positive self-talk.,
Reward yourself.",How to Overcome a Fear of Success2," Journaling is a great way to express your feelings, encourage yourself, and overcome your fear of success. Writing in your journal on a regular basis can help you identify specific fears as well as the strategies that help you overcome them. It’s also a way to document your successes and progress you are making in achieving them.


Write about your successes, no matter how large or how small. For instance, if you’re elected to speak for your project group, write about it.
Take it a step further and write a small statement expressing that you had nothing to fear from the success. For example, you might write, “I aced my test. I was afraid of doing well, but it feels good.”
Write about other things going on in your life whether they are good or bad, big or small. Write about how you feel about these things.
Try to write in your journal at least every few days or so.

, One way to improve your self-confidence and remind yourself that you can succeed is to write down all of the good things about yourself.Making a list of your strengths, skills, and talents can help you overcome feelings that you don’t deserve success or can’t achieve it.


Include talents and skills you have such as playing an instrument, sports, cooking, typing, programming, singing, writing, dancing, etc.
Put personality traits on the list as well. For instance, you might write, “my sense of humor, curiosity, empathy, loyalty.”
Ask your close friends and family for strengths you might have overlooked. You might say, for example, “Will you look over my list of strengths and see if there’s anything I left off?”

, Part of your fear of success might be because of feelings that you don’t deserve success.You can overcome these feelings and your fear of success by maintaining a positive, encouraging, and confident opinion of yourself.


Each morning tell yourself, “I’m worthy of success. I can succeed and I deserve to succeed.” Make sure to include these positive affirmations in your journaling!
Stop yourself when negative self-thoughts creep in. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I can’t do this. I’m not good enough,” stop yourself and think, “No, I CAN do this and I AM good enough.”
If you need to, refer to your list of strengths to find things to tell yourself.

, You can boost your self-confidence and begin to overcome a fear of success if you congratulate yourself and celebrate your achievements. Practice getting comfortable with success by telling someone about your achievement, however small. Acknowledge small achievements and any time you make an effort to succeed. This will help you become more comfortable with reaching your goals and realize that you have nothing to fear from success.


Treat yourself to a cupcake and frozen yogurt if you finish the manuscript you’ve been working on even if you haven’t submitted it yet, for example.
Or, for instance, you might reward yourself with a massage if you send your supervisor an email asking to discuss a promotion.

Prioritize your life.,
Chunk your work.,
Consider therapy.,
Avoid procrastination.,
Be mindful.",How to Overcome a Fear of Success3," One reason some people fear success is because they feel that they may lose the important things in their life.For example, you may fear you’ll have less time to spend with your family or that you won’t have time to participate in hobbies. But you can ease some of these fears if you take the time to determine what’s important to you and how to keep those things in your life.Prioritizing can help stop a fear of success by showing that you don’t have to sacrifice the things that are important to you.


Make a list of things that are important to you. For example, you might write, “sailing, my family, kickboxing, the dogs, my career, and volunteering.”
For each thing that you write, rank how important it is to you. For instance, family might come first, followed by the dogs, career, and so forth.
Brainstorm a few ways that you can maintain your priorities. For example, you might write, “If I’m successful I can take more vacation time with my family.” Create a calendar to ensure that time is devoted to each of these priorities. Be flexible and adjust it over time, as you discover what works best for you. Time management is extremely important.

, Instead of thinking of responsibilities and obligations as large tasks, think of them as smaller chunks. Breaking things down into their smaller parts can help you overcome a fear of success by helping you to feel less overwhelmed by the things you have to do. Achieving success at your smaller tasks may seem less daunting than thinking about succeeding at the whole task.


By breaking things down, you are achieving success bit by bit without realizing it.
For example, instead of thinking that you have to complete an in-depth report, think to yourself, “First I just need to draft an outline of what will go into the report.”
Or, for example, you might think “Being promoted doesn’t mean I’m responsible for the success or failure or the company. It means I need to make sure my department is productive as possible.”

, In some cases, the reasons you fear success come from your childhood, trauma, or deeper issues you need to work through. Professional therapists and counselors have experience, strategies, and techniques that can help you address these issues. Attending therapy also help you identify and address any self-destructive behaviors you have that are limiting your success.Talk to your human resources representative, school counselor, or physician about where you can receive therapy. You might say, “I’d like some information on counselors and therapists in my area.”
When you begin therapy you can share your notes about success with them. It might be helpful in showing them what you’ve already thought about, as well as major concerns in your life.

, One of the common ways people block their own success is by putting off doing important tasks until it’s too late. Procrastination is one behavior you’ll need to eliminate as you work to overcome your fear of success. Get organized and put procedures in place to help you stay on task and working towards your goals. Use an accountability partner if you struggle with self-discipline. Meet someone for a few hours of work and encourage this person to prompt you when you get off task.


Use an agenda, calendar, or planner to keep track of your responsibilities and obligations. If possible, use something that you can keep with you, like a planner app on your electronic device.
Set reminders and deadlines for important tasks and meetings. You may want to set several reminders for each task if you know you’re prone to procrastinate.
Organize your physical space and materials so that you don’t have to waste time looking for the things you need.

, This means being aware and accepting how you feel. It also means being aware and present in each moment.Being mindful can help you accept your fear of success and actively overcome it each time it tries to hold you back.


Try to focus on only doing one thing at time. It will be much easier to be mindful of how you’re feeling if you aren’t multitasking.
When you start feeling uncomfortable, take the time to work through it instead of ignoring it or trying to make it stop. Ask yourself what about the situation is making you feel fearful.
For example, if you’re working on a project, don’t watch TV while you’re doing it. That way you’ll notice if you start feeling anxious. And when you notice you can try to figure out why you feel anxious.

Evaluate your FOMO sources.,
Deactivate your social media accounts.,
Choose your friends carefully.,
Declutter your life.,
Learn to say no.,
Say yes to fun plans.,
Embrace and understand opportunity cost.",How to Overcome FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)1," Perhaps you are jealous of your friends for going on vacation when you don’t have the money to do so, or maybe you feel envious when others get married because you don’t have a partner. Work to make peace with these circumstances and to change them if you can.


For instance, you will likely not be able to find a spouse quickly, but you can begin dating and find people whose values align with your own.
Maybe you can’t take an exotic vacation, but perhaps you can make a day trip to a nearby city or spend some time at your local lake or pool.;
, Social media is often what stokes FOMO more than anything else. If you are feeling very down in the dumps from seeing all of the fun that others are having, take a break from your accounts. Deactivate them for a while, and do so permanently if you feel that it helps.You can also choose to unfollow or unfriend certain people.

, Avoid spending a lot of time with braggarts or those who are showy about their wealth or abilities. Instead, surround yourself with kind and compassionate people who will not rub things in your face.

, In addition to ridding yourself of certain friends, apps, or sites, also work to declutter the space surrounding you. Overindulgence in materials might be causing you to feel that you are missing out on other material possessions. Clear out the things in your closet that you don’t wear anymore and take some time to clean up your room, home, and/or office. Work to get back to the basics., Even though you might have FOMO, know that you don’t always have to say yes to everything. Spend your time, energy and money investing in things that you care about and enjoy. Say no to anything that is wasteful, unproductive, or not fun to you., Know that you can also agree to do things that are fun so that you don’t actually have to miss out. If you have the funds and the time, do the things that others invite you to do and have a little fun. Take a few days off of work if you can spare it., Know that with every choice you make, there is also a loss. If you choose to go to bed early, you might miss out on going out with friends. If you spend all night up binge watching a show, you might not be productive at work the next day. Make decisions that align with your priorities and allow you to keep up with your responsibilities."

Identify what scares you about the ride.,
Set a goal for going on the ride.,
Talk to other people.,
Slowly expose yourself to the rides.,
Get in line for the ride.,
Avoid catastrophizing.,
Use relaxation techniques to stay calm.,
Try out the seats.,
Get on the ride.,
Hold on to the bar.,
Keep your eyes open.,
Go a second time.",How to Overcome a Fear of Scary Rides," Consider what about the ride actually scares you, and makes you want to not go on. There can be many reasons why you don’t enjoy or want to go on scary rides. It could be the speed, the turns, or the feeling of falling you’ll get while on it, or even a traumatic experience you had on a ride before.By identifying what it is that makes you scared, you can take more concrete steps to overcome that specific fear.


Look at pictures of the ride, watch where it goes. See if there are particular things about the ride that scare you, like going upside down on a roller coaster. Imagine yourself going through the ride, and how you would feel when you go through it.Study the rides. Look at what they are trying to do to scare you, as well as the safety features. Understanding how the rides work, and how they can keep you safe, will help you feel more comfortable getting on them.
Remember that you are in a safe environment. These rides work because people remember that they are in a safe area, and that nothing bad will actually happen to them. Scary rides are able to create a reaction by overstimulating your senses, like using sudden sounds and weird sensations in a haunted house, but will not put you in real danger.;
, Maybe you just want to say you did it, or are trying to impress someone. It doesn’t need to be an earth-shattering goal, but something manageable like going on the ride once. Having a goal or reason for getting on the ride can help motivate you to actually give it a shot, and smaller goal will make it easier to follow through and have success., Talk to your friends about going on these rides. Make sure they know that you are scared, but that you want to overcome this fear. Good friends will understand, and try to help where they can.When you talk to your friends, ask them why they enjoy going on these rides. It’s not unusual to be a little afraid of scary rides, as the point is to give you a thrill. Ask about how they overcame their fears to enjoy the ride.

, Before jumping on line, spend some time exposing yourself to a scary ride. Look at pictures and video of it online so you can see it in action, and what you would do while on it. If you go to a theme park or carnival, walk by the ride and watch it in action. The more you see of it, the more comfortable you will be around it. This is exposure therapy, a common method for overcoming fears., One way to help push yourself on to the ride is to put yourself in a position where you have to go on one. Maybe tell your friends you’ll definitely ride it, or buy an expensive ticket to the park. Make it very difficult for yourself to back out of going on the ride.Do your best to forget past times where you avoided the ride, or got in line only to back out. Don’t dwell on the past, but instead stay focused on the future, that this time you will go on the ride., This is a common type of negative thinking, where you can only think of a worst-case scenario when you think about going on a scary ride. This could be something like worrying about falling out of a roller coaster each time it goes upside down., Before you get on line, or get on the ride, use some mindfulness techniques to help relax yourself. These simple exercises are great for reducing your stress and tension, which will make you feel better as you approach the ride.Progressive muscle relaxation. This exercise involves you slowly clenching and relaxing the muscles in your body. Tense for about 5 seconds, then relax for 30, thinking not just about moving your muscles, but how it feels when they are relaxed. It can help to start in one part of your body, maybe down at your feet, and work your way up your body, tensing and relaxing all your muscles in succession.
Controlled breathing. Take a normal breath, then a deep breath. Breathe in slowly through your nose, and let the air fill your lungs and abdomen. Exhale slowly--it's best to do so through your mouth, but it can be through your nose, if that is more comfortable., Some rides will have seats available for you to sit in before getting on the ride. These are mostly to make sure you will fit properly, but trying them out can be a good way to get more comfortable with what you are doing., The best way to face your fear is to push past it and get on board. You’ve come this far. You’ve learned about the ride, relaxed yourself, stood in line, and now you are here. Get in the seat, let the attendant strap you in, and get ready to roll., Most rides will have some type of “grab bar” or other restraint that’s meant to help hold you into the ride. It might make you feel more secure to grab hold of the restraint. It won’t actually make you any safer, but can be a pleasant reminder that something is there to hold you in., When the ride takes off, you will be tempted to squeeze your eyes shut until it’s over. Don’t do that. Instead, let your eyes guide you along the track, watching what comes next. Being able to see what follows will help make you feel more in control of what’s coming., Once you’ve gone on the ride, great. Now get back in line and go again. Going on rides more often helps habituate you to it, and will make you even more comfortable as you go along."

Pinpoint your fears.,
Identify small ways you can face your fear.,
Imagine yourself in a distressing situation.,
Use relaxation techniques as needed.,
Do a trial run by attempting one of your fears.",How to Overcome Communication Apprehension1," Before you can learn to overcome your communication apprehension, you must figure out exactly what it is that is scary or nerve-wrecking. Construct an anxiety hierarchy to help you better understand your fears.Constructing an anxiety hierarchy starts with a list of situations where the anxiety is felt. After the list is complete, you then rank them from the lowest level of anxiety all the way to the one situation with the highest level of stress.
The final list would normally contain between 10 and 20 items that begin with something that brings on so little anxiety is almost does not bother you to the one situation that gives you the most anxiety.
For example, an anxiety hierarchy for talking to your boss might look like this:

Saying hi to the boss in the hall
Talking to the boss in her office in a neutral situation
Answering a direct question from the boss when put on the spot
Talking to the boss about a negative situation

;
, While you may hear from some people the best thing to do is to ignore the fear, it is actually better to break down what is actually making you fearful and take small steps to work through that.If you are fearful of being in front of an audience, take a small step like making an effort to speak up at a meeting in front of a small group of other employees. Work your way up to slightly larger groups.
If the fear is more related to speaking in front of strangers, a first small step could be as simple as making a call to a wrong number on purpose simply to force yourself to talk to a stranger. Build from there by starting a conversation with a stranger waiting in line at a coffee shop.

, If you fear speaking up in class, go through the motions of envisioning yourself doing this. Practice how you would handle the situation and prepare as much as you can on the subject so you are ready to speak up without fear of the subject.Practice and role play the situation that is intimidating. Become very familiar with whatever subject you are talking about so it becomes easier and almost second nature to talk about the subject. This will help with your fear of forgetting the topic.
Making sure you feel confident in the subject will also allow you to focus on the topic instead of the audience. You do not want to totally ignore the audience since you need to be aware of their reactions, but focusing on your mastery of the topic will take some of the focus off the audience.

, This would include a combination of deep breathing, visual imagery and other methods discussed in this article. As you are imagining your fears, you are likely to experience anxiety. Use the techniques you have learned to return to a state of calm. Over time, the anxiety-provoking situation won’t affect you as much., Avoid waiting to speak in front of a group until it is critical to your job or school life. Give yourself time to succeed and testing grounds to make mistakes without the worry of messing up the “big speech”.Learn to work with your fear instead of trying to hide it. When you try to hide the fear you may find yourself overcome by internal negative self speak that is almost always far worse than what the audience is actually thinking. You do not need to like public speaking to be good at it and to do it successfully.

Know that you want to be a doctor for sure.,
Ideally, you should start preparing slightly before or during your freshmen year in high school.,
Research the courses in your high school.,
If possible, take as many honors courses as you can in ninth and tenth grade.,
Convert your courses in 11th and 12th grade to AP, if your school offers them.,
If you have any empty slots in your course schedule, take a look at other courses you can take in science.,
Make sure that you are taking biology, chemistry, and physics, making them honors if possible.,
Volunteer at a hospital and do community service.",How to Get Into a Good Pre Medical Program After High School," However, know that pre-medical programs also offer other graduate studies, such as pharmacology. If you want to pursue these fields, pre-med is still for you. Be sure, however, because the time, effort, and commitment put into pre-medical program, plus the preparation to be admitted to one, differs greatly from other fields.;
, All major universities believe that getting into college is indeed a four-year process. At the latest, you must start preparing during the tenth or eleventh grade, as after this, your chances of getting into a good premedical program if you haven't prepared before are close to nothing.

, This can be done by talking to a counselor, or reading a course description book. Information can be found online on the websites of some high schools. Plan out the courses you will be taking for all four years. First, fill in the required core classes, such as English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Science, for all four years in high school. Even if not required by a school, they are critical to success. Try to take at least four years of the same language (Spanish, French, etc.) Several high schools have certain requirements, such as one year of English electives, one year of computer credit, one year of physical education, etc. Fit in these courses next. Attempt to finish most of them within freshmen and sophomore year, so that you can take advanced courses available to only juniors and seniors.

, While AP (advanced placement) is often reserved for upperclassmen, honors courses are available to the majority of high school kids. For example, can you make that, ""Chemistry"", in your tenth year, ""Honors Chemistry?"" Colleges and universities take the difficulty of curriculum into account.

, Aim to have as least normal courses as possible. It will be hard to take honors and AP if you are a lazy student, but you can change that by putting homework and studying first. If you are efficient, you will always have time to relax. However, remember that high school is not the time to socialize only, it is the time to work for your future.

, Take other AP or honors courses in the place of electives, because it will help your college application. Make sure you fill any prerequisites beforehand. Do not hesitate to seek tutoring, often offered in the community or school, if you need it. Talk to your counselor and science teacher about your interests. Maintain good grades and good relationships with teachers who can give you college recommendations.

, Also, take AP biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics. These are crucial. If you can, take English, Social Studies, and math in honors and AP as well. Some schools offer science electives, such as Human Biology, and Human Anatomy. Take as many of these as possible to show your interest in medicine.

, Balance out your college application.

Make a list of what is truly important.,
Invest in what you value.,
Create the fun that you’re missing.",How to Overcome FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)2," One of the best ways to overcome FOMO is to begin to truly appreciate what you value in your life. Make a list of all the things that are important to you, including people, jobs, possessions or experiences. Spend some time reflecting on these things and expressing gratitude for them., After you make this list, develop a plan to do a better job of taking care of and appreciating the things that are important. Become a better parent, spouse, employee and friend. Work to find value in the things you have (like your job), even if they are not what you would like them to be.Reach out to your mom and tell her you love her.
Arrive to work on time and complete all assignments before they are due.
Give your car a good wash and wax.

, Spend some time each day engaging in the activities that you feel you are missing out on in some way. Even if you can’t travel, you can still revisit old pictures of you on vacation, or pictures of you and your spouse when you first met.

Make time for yourself daily.",How to Overcome FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)3," Focus on savoring the moment or experience in everything you do, whether it be eating, driving, reading, or making love. Think completely and only about what you are doing in the here and now.Turn off the music when you drive sometimes and just focus on the drive. Spend some time eating without being on your phone or watching television.

, Though many people pride themselves on being good multitaskers, the reality is that the quality of what you are doing is often degraded when doing more than one thing at once. Try to focus only on one thing at a time and do that to the best of your ability.Make a list of everything you need to do and number them based on what you would like to complete first, second, third and so forth. Do only that one task at a time.

, When you wake up in the morning, spend some time breathing deeply and reflecting on how you’re feeling, rather than simply springing up and getting ready immediately. Meditate in your car on the way to your destination or at night when you return home.


You can start meditating by focusing on a certain word or phrase like “gratefulness” or “I have a good life.”
You can also meditate on a nice, quiet walk after dinner.

, Yoga is a form of exercise that also incorporates meditation. Find some yoga classes or a yoga studio near you, or watch some videos online and do it at home. Yoga will help you become more mindful of yourself as opposed to always thinking outwardly about others and other experiences.

, Spend some time each day doing something small that is just for you. This will help ensure that you have something to look forward to for yourself. It doesn’t have to be something large as long as you do something.Perhaps you will treat yourself to ice cream or watch one of your favorite shows when you get home.
Once per month, you might want to buy yourself something new.

Know that you are not alone.,
Ask yourself what’s the worst that could happen.,
Envision success, not failure.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.",How to Overcome Communication Apprehension2," It is estimated that up to 74% of Americans have some level of speaking anxiety. While that large of a number experiences the fear in differing levels, many of them report that they are more fearful of public speaking than death.CA may start early in life as it is very prevalent in elementary school-aged children.


Communication apprehension may come about as a result of genetics, as a personality trait, or even only in certain circumstances., You may be making a bigger problem out of the “worst case” than it really is. Consider what’s the very worse that you expect to happen. If you have been exaggerating the power of your fear, you may start to notice that the potential repercussions that you have been worried about aren’t all that bad.Regardless of how one interaction goes, for the most part it is not going to make or break anything major. You will probably not lose your job nor will one error ruin your life or health. If you fear speaking in front of strangers, in all reality there is a good chance they will not remember what happens for very long. You may also never see your audience again.

, Redefine what success means to you and acknowledge that using your voice, even with a bump or two in the road, is a win over the fear.Remember that the majority of the people listening to you at any given time also report some level of speaking anxiety. You taking the step to make the speech or communicate with others in any way is brave.

, There is a good chance what you are thinking is far worse than what the audience is thinking. Self-talk like “I’m an idiot” or “I’m going to make a fool of myself” will only make matters worse. Strive to attack these negative thoughts and think thoughts that are realistic and positive. You can challenge your negative thinking with questions like:What would a friend say about my thoughts?
What evidence do I have that this is true? What evidence do I have that this is not true?
How many times has this terrible thing actually happened?
Is my thinking based on how I feel rather than on facts?

Breathe deeply when you feel anxious.,
Learn progressive muscle relaxation.,
Try out guided imagery.,
Recite a calming mantra.,
See a specialist.",How to Overcome Communication Apprehension3," When you have anxiety you may breathe too shallow, focus too much on your breathing or attempt to take on too big of breathes to get oxygen you feel that is missing.If you are feeling like you are going to hyperventilate, try Co2 Rebreathing. While you may think you are having troubles getting enough oxygen, in reality hyperventilating occurs when your Co2 level is low. Cup your hand over your mouth as you breathe normally. Re-breathe the same air in the hand to return the Co2 back into the body.
Deep breathing can be good to self-calm. The easiest exercise starts simply by sitting in a chair with arm rests so you can sit up straight with arms to your side. Take a deep breath in through your nose to the count of 5. Then, slowly over a count of 7 release through your mouth. Repeat for 10 total sets of in and out breathes.

, This exercise is quite simple. You basically sit comfortably in a chair or on a couch, and gradually contract and relax each muscle group in your body. Begin at your toes. Tense your muscles and hold for several seconds, noticing what the tension feels like. Then, relax your toes and take in that feeling of released tension. Next, move up to another set of muscles.


You may prefer to find a more formal exercise to follow.Or, you can do the exercise with music., You can do self-guided imagery by recording yourself reading a sample scenario or you may find a recording that works for you for the exercise.One example of a self-guide imagery you can record to listen to would be focusing on describing your own special place with all of your senses. You would describe this special place in enough detail that just listening to the recording will trigger a visual image. Describe the sensations you feel around this special place and why it makes you feel good.
If coming up with your own script is not easy for you to do, you can download a script to record., This process would first include choosing a simple yet meaningful mantra and then following relaxing techniques as you focus and recite this mantra.Once you have a mantra that seems like a good fit, find an object you can focus on while reciting the mantra.

Allow yourself to feel anger.,
Realize that anger is physiological.,
Seek help for uncontrolled anger.,
Use anger to motivate change.,
Get physical.,
Clean your house.,
Use anger as a substitute emotion.,
Prove someone wrong.,
Fuel societal change with anger.,
Convert anger into power.",How to Use Anger Productively," Some people are taught that any emotion that is not polite or nice should be suppressed. But anger is a normal, healthy emotion that serves an important biological and evolutionary purpose: it prepares you for “fight or flight” against a perceived enemy or danger. You should accept that anger is a normal part of life and allow yourself to experience it, as long as it does not begin to control you., Anger is certainly a psychological emotion, but it is also physiological, involving chemical reactions in your brain. The chemical process that happens when you get angry follows this sequence: Your amygdala, the center for emotional processing, sends a distress signal to your hypothalamus.
Your hypothalamus sends epinephrine along your autonomic nervous system through the path of the sympathetic nervous system to the adrenal glands, which starts pumping epinephrine (adrenaline) throughout your body.
The adrenaline gets your body ready to meet a threat, increasing your heart rate and sharpening your senses.

, While anger is normal, feeling angry all the time or feeling as though you’re constantly fighting or suppressing your own anger is not normal. You may want to seek help for your anger if you frequently experience any of the following: Thoughts of violence in everyday situations
Road rage incidents
Overwhelming negativity
Feeling as though others don’t understand you
Domestic violence or battery
Throwing dishes or other things when angry
Yelling, screaming, or hitting to get your way
Blaming others for getting you angry
Violent behavior in the workplace

, Many people want to make a change in their lives. However, emotions such as fear or complacency get in the way of making change. Anger is a strong emotion that can overpower other emotions, so channeling anger towards making changes in your life can set you on the right path.You should work towards replacing the anger that initially motivated you to action with another emotion, such as passion or enthusiasm. For example, you may be working a dead-end job that you don’t like. If your boss says or does something that really angers you, it may be enough to motivate you to put in the extra work to search for a new job or even go back to school to become qualified for a new career path.

, Physical exercise is a great way to reduce both acute and persistent anger. Your anger may also motivate you to exercise, as it creates a surge of adrenaline. One of the most productive ways to channel anger is to put it towards physical activity. You can exercise your way to emotional health.


Exercise does not have to happen in the gym. You can get physical exercise by tackling a yard project such a mowing or taming an area that is overgrown with weeds. You can go for a jog or run outdoors by yourself.

, Redirect your anger by cleaning your house. Particularly if you do some cleaning that is physically demanding, you can work out your anger while creating a more pleasant environment for yourself.Here are some ideas that combine cleaning with a bit of satisfying physical exertion:


Scrub the grout in tiled areas
Take the rugs outside and beat them to get the dirt out
Vacuum every room, including stairs if you have them
Use the vacuum attachments to clean your couch(es) or upholstered chairs
Scrub the bathtub really well
Take everything out of your closet and only put back items that you really want to keep; donate the rest

, Many times, anger is an emotion that emerges alongside other emotions such as hurt, sadness, grief, depression, or fear.If you are in a vulnerable emotional state, allowing yourself to get angry can serve as a defense mechanism. You can deal with and express your anger rather than another, more hurtful emotion.


This may not be a healthy long-term approach, but it could be effective in temporary situations, such as dealing with the loss of a family member or getting through an extremely stressful time.
You may also want to see a therapist to help cope with difficult emotions.

, If you are angry at someone because they do not believe in your ability to do something, your best recourse is to prove them wrong. Instead of dwelling on the anger you feel towards the person, apply that extra energy to working towards proving yourself.


For example, if you were told by a family member or school counselor that you would not be able to graduate from college, instead of getting angry, use the energy from the anger you feel to stay up late studying and prove that you can thrive in college through your own hard work.

, We usually think of anger as a personal, day-to-day emotion, but it can also be a broader cultural experience that can spur big societal change.For example, the civil rights movement and the women’s suffrage movements were both spurred on with anger about injustices., For better or worse, many politicians and business people rely on anger to make them appear more powerful. Studies have shown that people who express anger (rather than sadness or guilt) are afforded more respect or are viewed by others as having more power.There may be a fine line between appearing powerful and being regarded as a hothead with whom people do not want to do business. If you show a little anger about a business deal, people may think that you are passionate and committed to your work. However, if you blow up and have a tantrum in a business meeting, people may not want to work with you in the future.
An example of showing a little anger or force in a business deal is stating your position assertively and not backing down. An example of a tantrum is slamming your hand on the desk, throwing paperwork, or storming out of the room if someone disagrees with you.

Have a friend or family member come with you.,
Ask the facility what they recommend.,
Hire a home care professional.",How to Get Home After Medical Procedures As a Solo Adult1," Depending on the type of medical procedure you plan to have, you may simply be able to have a friend or taxi pick you up from the hospital. However, if you will be administered anesthesia, the facility may require someone who is able to take you home accompany you to the facility.Aside from the necessity of getting a ride home, a friend or family member can prove invaluable following your procedure.
In fact, many medical professionals recommend that another adult spends time with your for the 24 hours following a medical procedure that involves anesthesia.
Ask someone close by saying something like, ""What are you up to next Thursday? I'm having a medical procedure and I need someone to accompany me. If I schedule the procedure for the afternoon, would you be able to join me, and potentially sleep over at my place to make sure there aren't any complications?"";
, Especially in those cases where you are required to have another adult accompany you to the procedure, the medical professionals you are working with may have some solid recommendations. Since solo adults are more and more common, they may even offer a service to help address this concern.Simply say something like, ""What do you usually recommend for folks in my position?""; or, ""What are my options if I can't find a friend to accompany me?""

, There are many different types of medical home care options. You can even hire an after surgery professional to help you keep track of medical information at the facility, get you home, and even get you started on home treatment and recovery for the first 24 hrs.Ask the facility providing your procedure to provide you with a list of agencies that provide these services.

Recognize the physical signs of defensiveness.,
Take deep breaths.,
Don’t interrupt.,
Ask to have the conversation later.,
Find ways to beat stress.",How to Stop Being Defensive1," A defensive reaction puts you in a fight-or-flight mode: this means that your body will show physical signs and put you in a state of heightened tension. Try to learn to recognize these signs. That way, you’ll be able to nip any defensiveness in the bud when it starts.Ask yourself: is your heart speeding up? Do you feel tense, anxious, or angry? Is your mind racing to come up with counter-arguments? Have you stopped listening to others?
Look at your body language – what is it like? People who are feeling defensive often reflect that in their body language, crossing the arms, turning away, and closing off their body to others.
Do you feel a strong urge to interrupt? Rest assured that one of the biggest giveaways that you’re being defensive is saying, “I am NOT being defensive!”;
, Your body is less able to take in information when it’s in a heightened state of tension. To counteract the body’s fight-or-flight reaction, try to bring your nervous system down by slow, measure breathing. Calm yourself before you do or say anything.Inhale slowly to the count of five and exhale again to the count of five. Make sure to take a long, deep breath after your peers have stopped talking and you start.
Give yourself space to breathe when you talk, as well. Slow down if you are talking too fast and racing through points.

, Interrupting to dispute someone’s point or criticism is another big sign that you’re being defensive. This is not helpful and makes you seem insecure and pigheaded. What’s more, it’s an indication that you still haven’t gotten your emotions under control.Try counting to ten every time you have the urge to butt in. After ten seconds, there’s a good chance the conversation will have moved on and your rebuttal won’t be relevant. Increase the count to twenty or even thirty if you are still tempted.
Catch yourself when you interrupt, as well. Stop speaking mid-sentence and apologize for your rudeness, in order to build up your discipline.

, If your emotions are too heightened to have a reasonable exchange, consider excusing yourself and asking to pick up the conversation later. You won’t get much from a talk with co-workers or family members if you can’t listen to what they have to say. This doesn’t mean avoiding the conversation – it means postponing it.


Say something like, “I’m really sorry Cindy. We need to have this talk, but right now is not a good time for me. Can we do this later in the afternoon?”
Make sure to affirm the importance of the conversation while excusing yourself, i.e. “I know this is an important topic to you and I want to talk about it calmly. But right now I don’t feel so calm. Can we try later?

, When you’re defensive, your body is under elevated levels of stress. To help yourself calm down, find ways to relax and release that tension. This will not only help you manage the extra stress but can also help you improve your wellbeing.Relaxation techniques can help you slow your breathing as well as focus your attention. Try yoga, meditation, or tai chi, for example.
You can also try more active ways to relax. Working out through walking, running, sports, or other forms of exercise can have similar stress-reducing effects.

Ask your medical team what to expect.,
Have someone take notes.,
Ask any questions you have at the facility.,
Ensure you have everything you need before you’re discharged.",How to Get Home After Medical Procedures As a Solo Adult2," If you’re fully cognizant after your procedure, you can likely have this conversation with medical personnel alone. Otherwise, it’s advisable to have whoever is accompanying you in the room after the procedure is complete, if only to keep track of important information.While facility staff will likely offer you information on your procedure without prompting, make sure you know whether the procedure was as successful as expected.
For more information, ask questions like, “Did the procedure have any immediate effects on my condition?”
Don’t be concerned about grogginess or nausea. If you feel hazy, groggy, or nauseous after your procedure, don’t worry. This is entirely normal, and it’s partly why many facilities require another adult to accompany you and ensure you get home safe., Even if you feel fully cognizant after your procedure, anesthesia can sometimes affect your memory. This is one of the reasons it’s worth having someone in the room with you, to help remember and record conversations with medical staff.Most importantly, make sure that you have written information about any ongoing treatment that will be administered at home, such as pain medication you may need to take during recovery.
Ask whoever accompanied you to take detailed notes, especially with regards to any directions, warnings, or recommendations the medical staff provide.

, Before leaving the facility where you got your procedure, feel free to ask about anything you are worried about, or anything that is unclear. This may be easier after resting a while at the facility.Information you want to make sure you have include who to call if you have concerns once you’re home, what you should or shouldn’t be doing on your own, and how much pain or other side effects you can expect.
Good questions to ask include, “How quickly should I expect certain side effects to subside?”; and “How long before I will feel like my old self again?”

, You will likely be inundated with information before and/or after your procedure. Again, this is why it’s highly recommended (and potentially required) to have someone accompany you to the procedure. Before you leave the facility, make sure you have the following:Written guidance on how to care for any wounds associated with the procedure, and the types and dosages of painkillers you should use, if needed.
A list of any equipment you need to care for yourself at home, such as bandages, splints, or crutches.

"

Stock your home for recovery.,
Place everything you’ll need nearby.,
Consider buying or borrowing other helpful items.,
Improve your bathroom’s safety.",How to Get Home After Medical Procedures As a Solo Adult3," Before leaving your home for your procedure, prepare it for your return. This can make recovery much easier, by ensuring you have what you need and have somewhere comfortable to rest. Talk to the medical professionals providing your procedure ahead of time for specific details.Ensure you have any personal items, including food, that you’ll need for the duration of your likely recovery period.
Don't forget things like soap, shampoo, and other bathroom essentials.
In addition to the supplies and medication prescribed by your doctor, get anything else that may help you recover as well. For instance, items such as icy hot can help soothe sore muscles. Just be sure that whatever you use is safe following your procedure.
Your recovery time frame is important. For instance, if you're expected to need a day or two to recover, prepare for three days just in case. If your recovery time may be a week, you'll need to stock your home more carefully.

, More specifically places items you may need in easy to reach locations in the room where you’ll be recovering. In rooms where you'll be standing, place items on surfaces between waist and shoulder height. In areas where you may be lying or sitting, place items on side tables within reach.If your bedroom is upstairs, and you’ve been advised against using the stairs after your procedure, consider preparing and stocking a room on a lower floor.

, There are all sorts of things that can help make your more comfortable. Depending on your procedure, certain movements and activities may be harder than normal, or may even risk reopening an incision, etc. Based on the location and type of the procedure you’re receiving, get items such as the following:A sponge on a long handle to wash yourself more easily in the shower.
A shoe horn with a long handle to help put on and take off your shoes.
A mechanical grabbing arm to reach things without moving or stretching.

, Depending on the extent of the recovery period, as well as the type of procedure you’re getting, your mobility and stability may be greatly hampered. Fortunately, there are a few easy additions to your bathroom to ensure your safety on wet surfaces.Add non-slip mats or decals to the bottom of your tub or shower.
Use a bathmat that has a non-skid surface on the bottom.
Place items in the shower where you will easily be able to reach them.
In some cases, things like support bars or shower chairs may be necessary to use the toilet or shower safely.

Banish the word “but...” When you’re defensive, you want to start a lot of sentences with “but” to prove others wrong.,
Ask for specifics.,
Don’t counter-criticize.,
Try not to take things personally.",How to Stop Being Defensive2," This isn’t just a word, it’s a mental barrier. It conveys that you really don’t care or want to care about the opinions of others – and taking and accepting constructive criticism is precisely about caring.Hold your tongue if you have the urge to say “but,” at least until you have heard the other person out.
Instead of “but,” consider asking questions that force you to think about and express what others are saying to you, i.e. “Just so I understand, you think that my report’s analysis is incorrect?” or “Do I have this right, you want me to run the numbers again?”

, Rather than getting mad, ask questions. Ask others to be more specific about their opinions and their criticisms. This will help you to digest what they’re saying and also show that you aren’t dismissing their perspectives.You might say something along the lines of, “Edwin, can you give me an example of a time you thought I was condescending?” or “What is it specifically that makes you feel I’m not affectionate enough?”
Ask to understand the criticism. Don’t nitpick. Asking a question just so you can poke holes in the answer is another form of defensiveness.Getting specifics will also help you to decide whether to accept the feedback or not. Constructive criticism (e.g. “Your work has analytical weaknesses” or “You don’t express your emotions well”) will have valid reasons behind it, while destructive criticism (e.g. “Your work is trash” or “You’re an awful person”) will not.

, Learning to take criticism takes reflection and openness. It can also take self-control. Avoid the urge to lob your own criticisms, as this will only make it seem like you are lashing out. Instead, withhold your objections for a later time when you can have a legitimate conversation about them.Fight the urge to attack the person who’s criticizing you or their opinions, i.e. “Now you’re just being a jerk, Mom” or “Look who’s talking about being sarcastic!”
Also resist the urge to point out flaws about someone else’s work or behavior, i.e. “Well I don’t know what you’re complaining about. Bill does the same thing!” or “What was wrong with my report? Alex’s report was awful!”

, Giving and receiving feedback is an important skill in the workplace and in families and, ideally, it should create dialogue with a goal of improvement. Try to give others the benefit of the doubt and don’t interpret criticism as a personal attack. Their feedback is probably meant to serve a bigger aim or done with love.


If you feel under attack, ask yourself why. Do you feel offended? Insecure? Do you fear the loss of face, your personal reputation, or your position?Consider who is giving you the criticism. A family member or friend is less likely to attack you personally. In fact, they are probably trying to help you out of love and concern.
Lastly, consider what others are trying to achieve with their feedback – is it to improve a product, good, or service at work? Do they want to improve relationships or communication at home? In these cases, the feedback isn’t just about you as a person.

Listen to what others are saying.,
Try to suspend your judgement.,
Repeat what others say back to them.,
Let others know that you’ve heard them.",How to Stop Being Defensive3," Having empathy means being able to put yourself in another person’s shoes and to understand her state of mind and how she feels. To do this, though, you have to be able to listen. Follow the advice above, but also use active listening techniques.Focus your attention on what the other person is saying. There is no need to say anything at first. In fact, it’s better to just let her talk.
Don’t interrupt to give your opinion. At the same time, though, signal that you’re paying attention by nodding, acknowledging points, or with verbal cues like, “Yes” or “I see.” Do these things without breaking into the flow of conversation.

, To empathize, you’ll need to temporarily push your own opinions and judgments to the side until you hear your peer out. This can be hard. However, the point is to try to understand what the other person is feeling and not to insert your own perspective. This means you should focus on her experience.You don’t ultimately need to accept the other person’s perspective. But you have to let go of your own opinions, value scale, and perspective to gain access to her mental state.
Do not dismiss the other person’s perspective, for one thing. Insisting that the topic isn’t important or telling your peer to “Just get over it” is completely dismissive and defensive.
Avoid comparisons, too. Your experiences may be totally different and miss or minimize what your peer is feeling. For instance, it’s best not to say something like “You know, I used to feel the same way when X happened…”
Don’t try to offer solutions, either. The point of empathy isn’t necessarily to solve a problem, but to hear a person out.

, If you want to really listen to another person and what they have to say, engage them actively but respectfully. Restate points to make sure that you’ve understood – without interrupting. You can also consider asking questions.When your peer has expressed a point, repeat the main point back to her in slightly different words, i.e. “If I understand you, you’re upset because you don’t feel we communicate well.” This not only shows that you’re paying attention, but helps you to grasp the other person’s feelings, whatever they may be.
Ask open-ended questions to draw out further details, too. “You’re pretty frustrated with me, no?” doesn’t add much. However, you can elicit more helpful conversation with a question like, “What is it about our relationship that frustrates you so much?”

, Last, affirm what your peer has said. Let her know that you’ve listened, understood, and appreciated the importance of the conversation, even if you haven’t yet resolved the problem. This communicates that you are being open-minded rather than defensive and leaves room for future dialogue.Say something like, “What you’ve told me isn’t easy to hear, Jack, but I know it’s important to you and I will consider it” or “Thank you for telling me this, Aisha. I’ll think what you’ve said over carefully.”
You still don’t have to agree or accept your peer’s position. However, by being empathetic rather than defensive you can open the way for compromise and a solution.

Leave the area.,
Take deep breaths.,
Use progressive muscle relaxation.,
Speak to yourself positively.,
Distract yourself from the anger.,
Remind yourself that it’s not worth it.,
Limit alcohol consumption.",How to Stop Yourself from Beating Someone You Hate Up1," Get away from the person that you want to beat up. If you feel very angry, it’s better to just walk off (even without telling anyone why) and give yourself time to cool down than to get into a physical altercation.If you are with a friend, decide whether it would be better for you to be alone or to talk through your anger with your friend.;
, To benefit from the potential relaxation of deep breathing, you need to take deep breaths into your abdomen. Place your hand on your diaphragm (between your belly and chest) and breathe so deeply that you hand moves as your belly begins to expand. Then slowly breathe out.Keep your focus on your breath, breathing in and out 8-10 times or until you feel like you have regained control of your emotions.

, Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing your body in progressive stages. Consciously tensing your own muscles can help you redirect the outlet of the anger you’re feeling. To practice progressive muscle relaxation, take a few deep breaths, then do the following: Begin with your face and head muscles. Hold the tension for 20 seconds, then release it.
Work your way down your body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back, hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Take deep breaths, feeling relaxation from your toes all the way up to your head.

, Repeat a helpful mantra such as “I can control my actions” to yourself. Try to reframe your negative thoughts towards the person in a more positive way. Changing your thinking (known as “cognitive restructuring”) from focusing on unreasonably negative or angry thoughts to more realistic, positive thinking may help you resist violent actions. For example, instead of thinking “I hate this person and I want to beat him up,” you can think, “I do not care to spend time with this person, but I am above violent behavior.”

, Finding a pleasant distraction from the person who is making you angry can help you move on and maintain control of your actions. A distracting activity can be something you enjoy such as playing a video game, shopping, going for a walk, engaging in a hobby, or playing a game of pool with a friend.

, Even if you think you may feel some genuine satisfaction from punching someone you hate, it is unlikely to make you feel better the way you think it will. Additionally, you could end up getting arrested or sued for assault, which could be expensive and time-consuming.


You might say to yourself, “This guy, even though he is irritating me, is not worth my time. I cannot afford to lose time at work to be in jail or at a trial, and I am not willing to give this guy power over my walk. I am going to walk away instead of engaging with him.

, If you are going to be in a situation where you may be around someone you don’t like, do not consume alcohol. Alcohol consumption can interfere with reason and hinder your ability to control your actions effectively."

Know when to get counseling.",How to Stop Throwing Tantrums," Exercise regularly, just before a stressful situation, or as a response to anger.Research has shown that exercise tells your body to release helpful endorphins that reduce your body’s stress response and elevate your mood. All of these can help you calm down. Exercise of any kind can have the same helpful effects on anger, so do an activity you typically enjoy (such as running, dancing, or walking).For example, if you know you have a stressful business meeting later in the day, take some time in the morning to go for a run. This will reduce stress and tension, so you are not walking into your meeting wound up.;
, Although it sounds odd, counting can actually help to slow you down when you are tempted to explode or have a tantrum. Focus your thoughts away from the situation and on to your counting and breathing. Count to 10, taking a breath with each count and in between each number. Doing this at a slow pace can help you slow down and become calmer. Continue to count if you still feel angry after reaching 10.When you're angry, your body releases adrenaline which increases your heart rate, makes you feel flushed, and causes other physical signs of anger or arousal.Counting gives you a chance to slow down and calm your reactions so that you don't act impulsively.

, Learn to breathe with your diaphragm, the muscle at the lower part of your lungs. Focus on your breathing and take full, deep breaths that fill the entire lung. Breathe in for 5 seconds, then hold for 5 seconds, and release for 5 seconds. Take 2 normal breaths in between each diaphragm breath, so that you do not hyperventilateand repeat the exercise until you feel calmer.


Breathing signals your body to calm down. It does this by releasing neurotransmitters that tell your brain that you’re ok and safe.When you're angry, adrenaline can increase your breathing rate, making it feel as though breathing is difficult or that you can't get a full breath.

, Meditation can help you concentrate, reduce your stress levels, and enable self-awareness.All of these things can calm you down when facing an emotional outburst. Try to take at least 10 to 20 minutes a day to practice mindfulness, which can improve your overall mental health.There are several forms of meditation you can try, like Tai Chi, yoga, transcendental meditation, and Qi Gong.

, This is an important life skill that can reduce stress and frustration. Recognizing the problem will help you identify a situation which is problematic and learn how to deal with it. Understanding the cause of your frustration can also make you feel more in control of the situation.


For example, if you are in a restaurant and still waiting on your waiter, you can recognize this as a problem because it is making you frustrated and angry., Take a moment to consider several possible actions you could take, such as having a tantrum, not saying anything at all, or removing yourself from the situation. The key to thinking about your options is to consider the consequence of each before acting. Choose an action that will reduce your frustration and change the situation. Once you've decided, put your plan into action in a way that will be well received.For example, instead of having a temper tantrum in the restaurant and regretting it later, you may choose to speak to the manager or move to a different table. These options may ease your frustration and anger.

, Take a moment to make sure you're you're in charge of your emotions. Avoid letting your anger control your actions. You might need to walk away from the situation for a few moments or collect your thoughts before reacting.


Only try to handle the situation once you feel like you're able to engage with other people without throwing a tantrum., If you feel stuck and unable to express your feelings, learn to effectively express your anger. This can make you feel more in control of the situation. If someone is upsetting you, approach the person in a simple and direct way. Express how the situation made you feel and you may even want to request how you'd like the situation to be in the future. Be sure to focus on your feelings.For example, imagine you're in a restaurant and are waiting for your waiter to return. Once you've calmed yourself to prevent an outburst, your next step would be to ask to speak to the manager. Explain your dissatisfaction with the service and request that a change be made. Be sure to focus on yourself while avoiding the urge to yell or make disparaging comments about the waiter, manager or staff (such as name calling).

, Really spend some time thinking about your outlook. Do you frequently have negative thoughts or believe that you're being treated unfairly? If you often think like this, you may be creating stress and setting up situations that make you angry. Start to change the way you look at things. Instead, consider the positive in a situation or don't expect that you should be given preferential treatment.For example, write down 3 positive things that happened to you each day. This can make you more aware of the positive things that already exist in your life.

, Plan a few small positive things that you can do every day. Pick things that aren't harmful and that don't take a lot of time. They should be easy to fit into your schedule, but make you feel happy or relaxed. Incorporating positive moments throughout the day can prevent your anger from building up.For example, give yourself a coffee break in the afternoon, plan on a soothing bubble bath in the evening, or read a chapter from your favorite book during your work break., A temper tantrum, or explosive anger, is an expression of anger that is disproportionate to the situation. You may also feel helpless and out of control. Tantrums can be caused by different things for different people. Some people have extensive shame that leads to outbursts, while others have adopted rage as their coping mechanism for past trauma. People also have different levels of control when it comes to dealing with anger.


Tantrums are usually verbal in natureand can be part of a rage episode, though not all rage is the same.
Some outbursts are less intense but more frequent, while others are more intense and only occur a few times per year.

, Triggers, the things that set off your tantrums, might be easy to identify (like traffic or rude people) or more subtle (like waiting in line or a flippant comment). Try to identify places, people, or situations that directly lead to your outbursts. Think about common themes or what exactly it was about those things that made you angry. Identifying triggers will help you anticipate situations that might set off a tantrum. This allows you to consider how you'll respond without throwing a tantrum.


For example, you might notice that when you feel stuck, disrespected, or belittled, you're more likely to throw a temper tantrum. If you know a certain co-worker often makes you feel this way, understand that you need to consider the situation differently. Calmly address the situation with your co-worker or practice relaxation techniques before interacting with this person.

, This will help you identify triggers and remember how you dealt with the anger. For example, you may find that your family of origin handled anger with outbursts as well and you learned from them. Or you may find that your family did not allow any expression of anger and you learned to bottle it up until you exploded. Once you have a clear idea of your triggers and why they are triggers for you, you can begin to recognize these situations and replace your tantrum behavior with a more productive behavior.


Ask yourself if you remember being angry before an outburst while you were young or growing up. Maybe you had those feelings and held them in? For example, maybe a close family member made you feel unimportant and you are very susceptible to this feeling now. This may still make you angry.

, There are many different reasons why we become angry, and anger is a normal response to frustrating situations. It's not a “bad” emotion. But, anger can lead to unwanted, and often aggressive behavior either verbally or physically. Pay attention to angry thoughts that can lead to tantrums.Try to refocus on something else, remind yourself to calm down, and know that the situation is only temporary.


You may notice instant anger at situations. For example, you might get cut off in traffic and think, “I can’t believe they gave that person a license to drive!!”
Angry thoughts might develop after a period of waiting. For example, if you're waiting for service in a restaurant, you may start to think, ""Where is my waiter? Why is my drink still empty?""

, While you're paying attention to angry thoughts, you should also be able to recognize physical signs of anger. These can also alert you to change your thought process and begin problem solving. Doing so can prevent a tantrum from developing. Physical symptoms of anger can include:


Increased heart rate
Feeling flushed or hot in your cheeks
Muscle tension
Headache

, A counselor can work with you to prevent outbursts and help you calm yourself when you experience a trigger. You'll also work on changing your thoughts and behavior through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

Practice becoming self-aware.,
Work on developing impulse control.,
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Get some moderate exercise.",How to Stop Yourself from Beating Someone You Hate Up2," Knowing when you are going to lose it and possibly turn violent can help you stop yourself before you lose control. Monitor your thoughts and your physical body for signs of oncoming anger. You might be on your way to violence if you begin to feel:


Tense muscles and clenched jaw
Headache or stomachache
Increased heart rate
Sudden sweating or shaking
A dizzy feeling

, Most people do not plan to engage in physical violence; it happens in the moment as a response to strong emotions or as a result of escalating conflict. You can prevent yourself from responding to a trigger with violence if you strengthen your impulse control. Some strategies for developing or strengthening your impulse control include:Practice delayed gratification. Practicing delayed gratification in other areas can actually help you develop impulse control generally. For example, if you always sit down and watch your favorite show as soon as you get home from work, try pushing the habit back an hour and getting a bit of housecleaning done first. Accepting this delay will develop your willpower.
Develop “if-then” scenarios ahead of time.For example, you might decide ahead of time, “if this person insults me or my friends, I will walk away.”
Strengthen your body. Some studies have linked strengthening your muscles and body through regular exercise to increased impulse control and willpower., Accept that you dislike someone and that you feel angry whenever you are around him. Know that that’s okay. You may not be able to change the way that you think or feel about another person, but you can always choose how to act towards him. Each time you speak or act, you are making a choice about what words and actions you use.For example, you can think to yourself, “I do not like this person. The way he is talking to me and my friends makes me want to beat him up. It is normal to feel angry and to dislike people, but I will not let him get the best of me by drawing me into a physical altercation.

, Exercise can help you get your “angry energy” out. It can also help you feel better by triggering endorphins in your brain, which are neurotransmitters that make you feel happier.Consistent exercise can help regulate your emotions and strengthen impulse control over time as well as making you feel better in the moment."

Identify a conflict.,
Focus on maintaining or recovering a relationship.Even if you feel that you dislike or hate the person with whom you are in conflict, it may be the conflict itself that is causing you to feel that way.,
Stay calm and alert.,
Keep your emotions in check.,
Acknowledge the feelings and words of the other party.,
Remain respectful of differences in personality or opinion.,
Find a solution to the conflict between you.",How to Stop Yourself from Beating Someone You Hate Up3," A conflict occurs when a difference in opinion escalates to the point of interfering with an interpersonal relationship. There are often strong emotions associated with conflicts. Conflicts generally don’t go away on their own without specifically dealing with them., Framing your approach to conflict resolution with the idea of helping your relationship with the person

, Staying calm will help you listen and respond reasonably to other people’s perspectives.Remaining calm will also likely keep the conflict from escalating, as the other person involved in the conflict may respond positively to your calm demeanor.

, This can be quite difficult, but it is important to maintain control over your emotions when involved in a conflict. This does not mean that you can’t feel or even express your emotions; it just means that you shouldn’t allow your emotions to inform your actions or demeanor.


Additionally, being aware of your own emotions can help you understand the emotions of other parties involved in conflict. This can help you sympathize with others’ perspectives., Again, this can sometimes be difficult if you are in conflict with someone who you don’t like. However, accepting and allowing for the feelings of the other person involved in a conflict can help you resolve a conflict. It helps you understand why the person may be acting the way he is. Acknowledging another’s feelings aloud can help him see that you understand where he is coming from, which may de-escalate the situation.

, Some conflict arises from a difference of opinion that may not be resolved. It is possible to remain respectful towards someone even if you do not reach an agreement about a specific conflict.

, The key to finding a solution or resolution to your conflict involves working together to identify the specific problems and brainstorming for solutions together. This may involve some flexibility and negotiation, but if both (or all) parties are willing to work together to find a solution, it is likely that you can find one."

Determine whether you have a problem with anger.,
Learn to meditate.,
Take an anger management class.,
Seek therapy.",How to Stop Yourself from Beating Someone You Hate Up4," If you feel inclined to beat someone up, you could have an anger problem. While anger can be healthy, it can also be unhealthy. You may need to deal with an anger problem through self-help or professional help if the following are true: Insignificant things make you very angry.
When you’re angry, you display aggressive behaviors, including yelling, screaming, or hitting.

Address the causes of your anger.",How to Use an Anger Room," Perhaps there is something particularly stressful that you would like to address in the anger room. Maybe you are having a rough time at work or at home and want the anger room to replicate that situation. Ask for any customizations that you would like to be made and see what they are able to do.For instance, during the 2016 US Presidential Election, by popular demand, some anger rooms provided dummies with the candidates’ faces on them.
If your anger is less political and more professional, perhaps you would ask that your boss’s face be put on one of the dummies or that your anger room look more like your office.;
, Most anger rooms will ask that you arrive a bit early so that you can fill out all of the necessary paperwork before entering. You will likely be asked to fill out some basic identification questions as well as an agreement not to sue if you should harm yourself in the room. If it is your first time visiting, you may also have some questions, so be prepared to ask those quickly.For instance, you might want to ask if you could purchase additional time or perhaps even a monthly package so that you can return more frequently.

, Most anger rooms provide you with your own choice of music while you are in the room smashing things. Think beforehand on the genre of music you would like played. Many offer rock or rap as popular options, but others could be available, as well., Anger rooms often have a wide range of different weapons for you to use based on your needs. Many offer baseball bats, golf clubs, or two-by-fours. Choose the weapon that works best for you and will do the damage that you desire., If you would prefer to demolish a room in a group rather than alone, know that many places offer group packages or will allow you to bring in a friend at an extra charge. Consider making this an outing with you and your friends or with someone who you want to release your anger with.

Only do this with people you trust and who trust you in return. This environment has the potential to be very dangerous, so only enter into with people who you know won’t hurt you.

, Once you have made these preparations and selections, now is the time to use the anger room. Most places offer 15-30 minute sessions, so be prepared for this time limit. After putting on the proper protective gear including goggles, gloves, and a helmet, use your weapon to beat and demolish everything in sight. Enjoy your time in the room and let all of your anger out.

When you are finished, simply put all of your tools down, take off your protective gear, and then exit the room. Take a few deep breathes to calm yourself and enjoy the feeling of exhilaration that you might have.
If you feel nervous about beginning, begin to think about all that has made you angry lately, whether that be a person, project, or situation. Use that as an incentive to begin unleashing your anger in the room.

, In order to find the anger rooms closest to you, do a quick google search. The original Anger Room is located in Dallas, Texas, but there are also others located across the world. Find anger rooms close to you or travel to these cities if you are able., In general, the cost is about $20 - $25 for 5 minutes in anger rooms, with the cost going up the longer you are in the room and the more customized you would like your experience to be. For example, for a visit lasting 25 minutes in a room designed to look like the Oval Office, you will pay a minimum of $75 at most anger rooms.Some offer coupons or promo codes. Check those online if you would like to get a discount.

, Most anger rooms provide safety gear free of charge, but see if it is advised that you bring anything in addition, as well. You will likely not be authorized to bring your own tools or weapons, so be sure to ask beforehand or leave those at home., Though you may be very excited about visiting your local anger room, know that some people have to be excluded from participation due to medical reasons. For instance, anger rooms often will not allow anyone who is pregnant or who has any heart issues to enter. Some anger rooms have age requirements, but others allow those who are under age 18 as long as they have parental supervision., After you have successfully found an anger room and done the appropriate amount of research, make a reservation. You can do so online at some places or over the phone. Be sure to book your visit at the most optimal time for you, perhaps on a day that you know you will be stressed and looking for a release., Though anger rooms can certainly serve as an outlet for anger, they may not be accessible to you either geographically or financially. Consider what things you can do at home to replicate anger rooms without destroying your house. Always consult with your parents, spouse, or any other tenants of your home before destroying anything.

For instance, perhaps you have just purchased a new printer and are about to throw out your old one. Before doing that, destroy it instead. You can use a baseball bat or any similar object.
Make sure you wear the proper safety gear including gloves and safety goggles.
Avoid being very loud so that you don’t disturb your neighbors. Destroy the item in a fairly empty space so that cleanup will be easy.

, Recognize that unleashing your anger through destroying rooms is not necessarily the most healthy way to resolve or deal with your rage. One activity that has been proven to help deal with stress, however, is exercise. Rather than unleashing your feelings via deconstruction, consider doing so through being constructive, productive, and healthy.Join the gym or run for a few miles around your neighborhood.
Join a group fitness class or find workout videos online.

, Other more constructive ways of handling stress and wrath are yoga, deep breathing, and meditation. Consider employing one of these into your daily life and then assessing if your overall anger subsides or lessens in any way., A final and perhaps most long lasting way of addressing your rage is to think about what causes your anger, and then work to remedy it. For example, perhaps you are dealing with some issues from your childhood that you have never moved past; therapy might be helpful for you. Or maybe you have serious road rage issues; consider taking a different route to work or taking public transportation."
"
Realize foremost that, as human beings, we all tend to make mistakes in life, both big and small.,
Be aware that most people who make mistakes feel some sense of remorse or conscience twinge about what they've done.,
Seek to understand why the person behaved the way that they did.,
Forgive those people who hurt you.,
Keep in mind that life is too short to hold on to bad memories and thoughts that create pain.,
Create happy and positive thoughts for your own well being.,
Realize that you have a choice of living in the past and creating sad and bad memories.",How to Stop Holding a Grudge," Nobody is perfect and nobody can be certain that they won't make mistakes, even in the things they're very good at doing. Indeed, to hold others to a very high standard is to hold yourself to the same very high standard, which is a recipe for failure at some point and possible deep depression and a sense of futility. Understand that there are times in life when making mistakes, saying things out of turn, doing things that don't reflect the best of us, simply happens. Understanding this will help you to cope better when people knowingly or unknowingly hurt you.;
, However, some people will cover these feelings in defensiveness, for various reasons, and it is possible to make them even less contrite by continuously going on at them about the wrongs they've done. After all, think about whether you'd like to constantly be reminded that you'd done something that negatively impacted your morals, integrity, career and lifestyle? It gets stale after a time and no longer serves any constructive purpose.


If a person is negatively labeled for too long by another person, they may feel that they might as well live up to that label and keep on being the challenging person that they feel boxed into. This is an important reason to let go of a grudge, before your negative opinion of that person becomes a fact in relation to you, because they cannot see any other way of interacting with you.

, Look into their situation, both past and present, to try to understand the root cause of their problematic behaviour. Being in their shoes and looking at the action, words or occurrence from their point of view will help you to understand their situation better. In turn, this may give you a clearer picture of their erratic behaviour or deed.


Understanding the person's psychological reasons, background, and so forth, can give a glimpse into their situation, and their behaviour. It will also help to explain why their action hurt everyone, especially the people who love them. Sometimes it is easier to lash out at those who love us, precisely because the person knows which buttons to press for greatest effect.

, Though it might sound difficult, it is possible and it is good for you. Practice forgiving others, and you will find life feels easier, freer and more fulfilling. You are the embodiment of your thoughts––thoughts that you create affect your mind and body, and in turn, your relations with others and the entire universe. Your well being comes from holding healthy thoughts and letting go of negative past actions that bring you down.


It may seem strange to create positive thoughts for someone who has done bad or harm to you or cheated you. But the reality is that you let go of a grudge for your own self, and your own good––you let go the past, the bad memory, bad feelings, and once you let go, you are free from them, and can move on with your life, and learn to live happily again.

, When reliving the past again and again and again, you tend to open the dark chapters of your life––sorrow, hatred, deceives, and failures––and keep reliving them. Say no to such negative and bad thoughts, stop creating this negative whirlpool for yourself. Remember that you are the creator of your thoughts and you choose which memories to elevate.


Practice meditation in morning; it can be calming and have positive effects on your mind and body.

, Don't nurture negative thoughts which affect your mental state and your physical well being. The most ironic and cruel thing about holding a grudge is that if you do so for too long, it can cause illness and diseases in your body, through the bitterness and anger you've keep alive. Learn to observe and control your thoughts, to see what kind of thoughts you are creating. If any negative thoughts come, immediately change them to ones that are neutral or even positive. Reorienting the story that you tell yourself about a situation and people can help you to live a healthy, happy and long life––a life full of positivity, good health, vitality, and vigour.

, Or, you can choose to live in a life full of happiness, positivity, and good health, with a healthy mind. Create a beautiful world once again for yourself, full of love, happiness, peace, unity and tranquility. Let go. That grudge isn't worth your life.

If you have followed these steps then you can be confident.",How to Get Rid of the Fear of Public Speaking," On the day of your speech, pretend the crowd is just another practice session you are doing with friends or family.;
, You’re probably thinking: “What's the point of this?” Well, the more you talk about the topic, the more you will remember.

, Get a broad idea of what you are talking about so you can wing it if your nerves take control. When a speaker is nervous they tend to stumble and use a lot of umms... and ahhs... This is followed by staring at the ceiling. If you reach this point it might be necessary for you to put away your palm cards and just talk to the crowd about what you know, covering the basics. The problem of doing this is that you might go overboard and talk way too long.

, Palm cards look formal and professional. A symptom of nervousness during a public speech is that some people hide behind an A4 piece of paper; but using palm cards won't give you that temptation. You can make palm cards by cutting an A4 paper into six pieces, write the subtopics and just a few points on each subtopic.

, The more loudly you speak, the more confidence you will show and the more confidence you will gain. This will make you look professional—but don't go overboard, as speaking too loud will make you seem like you don't know how to read English. And speaking too quietly will make you look nervous and vulnerable.

, For many people who fear public speaking, all they need to do is use more hand gestures; this will cure their fear of public speaking. However, moving your hands too much and you will seem overly enthusiastic. Remember, everything you do has to be based on precision.

, You have done everything in your power to prepare to make the ultimate speech, you’ve taken every precaution, and even made backup plans... So why be scared? Just relax and feel as if you are right at home.

Consider how you actually feel on a day to day basis.,
Learn to spot your emotions taking control.,
Find ways to self calm and to pull yourself through emotional minefields.,
Bear in mind that there are many struggles in life.,
Remind yourself of what you gain from struggles.,
Keep a record of your choices made.,
Slow down.,
Learn from your mistakes.,
Maintain your integrity.",How to Make Good Choices Throughout Struggles in Life," Are things always confusing, messy and at crisis point? Do small things set you off? Are you liable to see shades of fluorescent where others see the calm pastels?


For example, when someone asks you ""how is you day?"", what is your response likely to be? Your response may not feel like the real you because you're overtaken with the need to get your emotions outside of you, as a coping mechanism.;
, When you feel in the ways described in the previous step, it's important to ask yourself: ""How will I get a handle on my emotions?"" In fact, it's very simple. You have multiple choices as to the ways in which you'll handle your emotions. You can handle your emotions as you see fit, either by reacting to them and letting them run away with you, or by slowly stepping back (mentally speaking) and viewing them with a neutral perspective, to find a way to calm them and set yourself back on an even keel.


Realize that when you respond to things based purely on your emotional reaction, you are likely to lash out, blame someone for something or do or say something you later regret (such as calling a BFF a bad name, or storming out on your boss).

, There are some good approaches that can help you and you'll always continue to find more as you stay true to this journey of self care, remaining open to letting in the calm. Some of the ways that might work for you to begin with though, include:


Writing: Write about how you feel. For an example: Write yourself a question about how you feel and answer it or write a story. The character need not even be you––if it helps you to distance yourself and see how John or Martha would deal what you're going through, that's cool too.
Talking it through: Sit down with a close friend or family member and talk about it. Often being heard is the most cathartic and freeing thing in the world. The trick is to find someone who is not judgmental and who is not too ready to offer what they'd do in your shoes. Find, and treasure, those who listen and support, who make kindly suggestions only when it's clear that's what you're after.
Confrontation: Discuss your problem with the person or persons causing the issues. Remember that this doesn't need to be done straight away. It is something that you can come back, when the air is cleared and you both feel calmer. An apology is always a good way to get the ball rolling if you lost your temper, then both of you can set down to the business of sorting out things constructively, in a mature manner, together.
Prayer, meditation or reflection: If you are a believer in a faith, you could pray to God or a god, depending on what you follow. If you'd prefer to meditate or think deeply over the matter without involving faith, that's fine too. The reality is that you need a spiritual or self-healing space in which to stand back and work through what is going on and why your emotions get the better of you. In some cases, if religious, you may find it helpful to go to the church/mosque/synagogue/temple and talk to one who has a designated role as a healer, someone willing and able to walk you through the issues.

, They come and go like the waves on the ocean, hitting full force sometimes, receding at others. There is no promise of smooth sailing at any point in life. When you're over one struggle, another may be looming close by or it may be a long way off. But rest assured, struggles have their way of returning. The answer is to find your own inner peace, your inner strength and way of coping when the struggles return. Most of all, do not make it harder than it needs to be; your inner harsh critic and emotional poltergeist does not need feeding or rewarding. In plain words––does it make any difference to the outcome if you worried and beat yourself up or stayed calm and proceeded in a clear and methodical way? To the outcome, no; to you, yes, as you will be far more settled, healthy and resilient if you take the calm route.

, The struggle of today is the gaining of the inner strength you need for tomorrow. Struggles are when your true character has a chance to come forth, and it is often a time to let go of those people who have an unhealthy hold over you because this becomes clear to you. Struggle informs you that you are ultimately personally responsible for standing up for yourself and for understanding what truly matters in your life.


Tell yourself this wonderful saying when it all feels too much: ""A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor.""

, Note what precedes and follows the good and the bad choices. This will allow you to practice more of what results in the good choices and to catch yourself before doing or thinking the things that lead to bad choices. And while only you can know yourself and your modus operandi when it comes to the deep inner thoughts, do listen to other people's comments on how they view your reactions and coping skills––often it is from the outsider's perspective that you can learn to kinder to yourself and to make the most of the good they see in you.

, Make your choices in a calm state, when you aren't pressured or feel confused and pushed about. If you keep ending up in environments where this happens, realize that you're probably amid people with a similar mindset, the ""urgency junkies"" and ""drama makers"", who thrive on last-minute decisions that lack serious consideration. This isn't healthy for you, it isn't healthy for society as a whole and it is a definite source of unneeded struggles.


If you haven't time to think through the consequences of your choice, you haven't got what you need to make a good choice. Sleep on it.

, You often won't learn how bad or good a decision was until the consequences begin to show. That said, it is possible to be sensible, responsible and wise-headed about the decisions you do make. Inform yourself, ask questions of others and be clear about your intentions. These things help you to make a decision that is at least based on the best possible information and understandings at the time. And, when things do go wrong as a result of your decisions, learn from this. Know what should and should not be done next time.

, Have good values, know yourself (the bad, the good, the indifferent) and strive to keep showing your best self to others. It is through your integrity that you will do, as C.S. Lewis once said, ""the right thing, even when no-one is watching.""

Use anger management to identify your triggers.,
Build awareness of physical signs through anger management.,
Learn how to pay attention to emotional signs.,
Get help to correct your thinking.",How to Seek Help for an Anger Problem3," Part of seeking help for anger includes recognizing what sets off your anger. Once you find triggers for your anger, you can begin to work to respond to these situations differently or avoid them.Some examples include going to family functions, talking about finances, or frustration with a child or partner.


Recognize what situations trigger anger and find nonaggressive ways to respond. Especially if you can anticipate potential anger, think about ways to avoid the anger beforehand.
Talk about your triggers in your anger management group or with your counselor.

, Treatment will help you build your awareness around your physical signs of anger. Anger often expresses within the physical body, so if you tune into your physical sensations, you can begin to recognize the triggers of your anger. You may notice that you tighten your muscles, clench your fists, clench your jaw, or experience sweating. You may notice headaches, stomach aches, increased heart rate, feeling hot, or shaking.When you recognize these symptoms, you can say to yourself, “I am feeling angry right now because I can feel my hands clench and notice my increased heart rate. This is one way I know that I am angry.”

, In anger management, you will learn that you may be aggressively and actively angry (by yelling, screaming, or hitting) or passively angry. Passive anger can include sarcasm, disengagement, apathy, or passive-aggressiveness. If you are passively angry, you may not recognize your anger. However, active and passive anger each have emotional signs.


Anger management will teach you how to tell if you feel emotionally engaged or disengaged. You will also learn how to recognize other emotional symptoms including constant irritability, rage, and anxiety.You may also learn to identify emotional signs such as having the feeling that you want to yell at someone or feeling like you’re not saying everything you want to say., Anger management can teach you how to raise your awareness of your thoughts.You will learn to ask yourself, “Am I thinking clearly? Am I approaching this situation rationally? Do I have all of the information? Is my thinking and response logical?” If you find yourself in negative thought patterns leading to anger, stop and ask yourself these questions.


You may learn to take a “time out” from a situation if you notice your anger is rising. For example, you could go for a walk around the block and ask yourself if there’s a way to change your thinking. Say, “This situation is making me start to feel angry. I need a quick break to clear my head, and I’ll be back in 15 minutes.”

Because siren sounds are not inherently problematic, if you have a fear of sirens, there is a decent chance that you have a phobia. That said, it is important to receive an official diagnosis from a qualified medical health professional.;
, Phobic individuals, when exposed to what they are afraid of, tend to have intense physical and psychological reactions that may impede their ability to function day to day.A fear of sirens would fall into the diagnostic category of a specific phobia.

, It makes the most sense to seek treatment for your phobia if it is bothering you and is something you want removed or if it is something that interferes with your normal functioning.Examples of ways that a fear of sirens may interfere with your functioning is if you hide from the sirens and end up being late for work, or if you avoid certain streets or intersections and miss out on eating at restaurants you would otherwise like to.

, Specific phobias such as a fear of sirens involves an irrational and persistent fear of sirens that is out of proportion to the actual danger to you by sirens or the things sirens are associated with. More specifically, symptoms of phobias include: A feeling of panic or dread when exposed to sirens.
A feeling that you must do everything you can to avoid sirens.
Abnormal functioning due to your fear (e.g., missing work because you avoided sirens).
Sweating, rapid heart beat and/or breathing, in response to sirens.
You may know that your fear is irrational but be just as afraid nonetheless.
Sometimes people have more than one specific phobia, so ask yourself if you find yourself to be excessively afraid of things other than sirens - this could be other loud sounds or things totally unrelated.

, Actually, much about what causes phobias is unknown. There may be somewhat of a genetic disposition to acquire phobias, given that they sometimes run in the family (however, shared environments may account for some of this association).Because the causes are mostly unknown, try not to beat yourself up over having your fear. Do not blame yourself or others, but instead seek treatment and ways to overcome your phobia.

, Usually people who are afraid of sirens are the ones who cannot stand loud noises or screeching more broadly. Since sirens out in the world are relatively rare, you may more quickly get over your fear of them if you exposure yourself to other loud sounds that are more common. Go outside looking for loud sounds and, for your comfort, bring a pair of noise canceling headphones. Try to listen to the loud sound you find for 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 3, then 4, then 5, until it no longer scares you. Examples of loud sounds you might seek out include:


A construction site
Traffic noises
A train station
A busy store

, When sirens occur, some people will think a fire is started or someone is hurt. However, try to keep in mind that this danger (while sad) doesn't concern you. Rest assured that there are professionals whose job it is to fix situations in which sirens and speeding vehicles are involved.


To avoid thinking about the dangers associated with sirens, try focusing your mind on something else entirely, such as a calm or soothing word like peace our tranquility.

, Usually hip hop, R&B music has sirens in it; since the sirens are coming from music, and not from out in the world, this can be a good way to gradually exposure yourself to this anxiety-provoking sound.There are plenty of options to stream music for free on the web, including YouTube, Songza, and Spotify.

, This will only increase your fear of sirens because you will never get the chance to learn that sirens actually aren't dangerous.Although easier said than done of course, there are a couple of ways you can stop yourself from avoiding sirens:


Try to remind yourself by saying in your head over and over ""there is nothing to fear, I will never get over my fear if I don't face it.""
Try to ""bind"" yourself so that you can't avoid sirens. Don't literally bind yourself in place, but instead, bring a friend along a path where you will encounter sirens and ask them to encourage you not to run away should you hear a siren.

, Talking to a qualified mental health professional may be beneficial for you. These individuals are trained to deal with those who have phobias and other psychological issues they wish to overcome.


To find a psychologist near you, try this website: http://locator.apa.org/


, The goal of taking medications is to reduce your anxiety and fear so that can function normally despite your phobia. There are a few different relevant medications you might be prescribed: Beta blockers. These medications block the physiological stress response induced by adrenaline (e.g., increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure).
SSRIs. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) work to increase levels of serotonin in some parts of the brain; serotonin is a neurotransmitter thought to affect mood state.
Sedatives. These drugs help you relax and reduce your anxiety levels. However, they should be used with caution because they can be addictive.

, This therapy involves being in the presence of the thing you fear in a controlled environment with a trained professional who will guide you through dealing with your intense emotions. The logic of this therapy is that, once you survive being in the presence of the thing you so fear, without any injury to you whatsoever, you will begin to lose your fear of that thing.


Exposure therapy tends to be done gradually. For example, you may be first asked to merely think about a siren, and then you may be asked to listen to a siren for 1 second, then 2 seconds etc.

, This involves learning different ways to think about sirens. The purpose of this is to try to re-train your brain to see sirens in a new light, so that you do not fear them as much.Remember that there is no need to keep your treatment confined to a single approach; in fact, you may most effectively be treated by combining therapy and medication.

Do not go to sleep.,
Spend time with friends or family.,
Watch something funny.,
Remind yourself that the movie was not real.,
Address your specific fears.,
Do something you enjoy.",How to Get a Scary Movie Off Your Mind1," If you go to sleep right after you watch a scary movie, you are more likely to have nightmares. While you are sleeping, your brain strengthens the memories and fear you experienced while watching the movie. It is best if you do not go to sleep at all that night.However, if you cannot stay up all night, try to sleep as little as possible. The more sleep deprived you are, the less your brain can create those bad memories.


Try not to watch the movie late at night when you tend to be sleepy.
If you cannot physically spend time with another person after the movie, try calling, texting, or video chatting with someone.;
, Your family and friends are a great source of support for you. They can make you feel secure and safe.They can also encourage you, get your mind off the movie, and offer you advice about dealing with the scary movie. If you feel comfortable, discuss your fears with them.


You can also ask them how they handle scary movies. They may have some tips that you have not thought of.
Do not spend time alone with someone who is just as scared as you are. You may actually feel worse and freak each other out.

, Just as scary movies cause you to experience fear and anxiety,watching a funny movie, video, or television show can make you feel happy. Laughing decreases your stress and causes your body to release feel good hormones.Laughter will help you feel good and forget about the scary movie you just watched.


The subject of your funny movie does not matter. As long as it makes you laugh out loud, you will reap the benefits.If you cannot find anything funny to watch, at least watch something that is pleasant or not scary at all. What you watch affects what you dream about and how well you sleep.
Reading jokes and funny stories that make you laugh are also an option.

, While the emotions that you experience during the movie are real, you know that you just watched a fictional story. If the movie you watched had zombies, vampires, werewolves, or some other mythical creature, tell yourself that none of those things are real.


Tell yourself out loud, ""That movie was pretend. ___ are not real. I do not need to worry about this.""If the movie was more realistic, remind yourself that you are in a safe place and those things did not happen to you. The people you watched were actors and were pretending.

, Specific scenes or scenarios in a movie may cause you to become scared. For instance, a burglar breaking into the house, getting attacked in the shower, or something hiding under a bed may really get to you. In these instances, remind yourself that these things happened in the movie, not to you.For example, if you are concerned about the shower, go to the bathroom and see that no one is hiding in there.
If you are worried about someone breaking into your home, double check the locks on the doors and the windows so you feel safe and secure.
Turn the lights on or use a flashlight to look under your bed.
If darkness is scary to you, sleep with a nightlight or keep the lights in the hallway on.

, Read a book, listen to music, play a video game, or go outside. Do anything that makes you feel better.Try to stick to positive distractions. The more positive thoughts and feelings you produce, the less power your scary thoughts will have over you.Taking deep breaths is also a way to relax and calm yourself. Breathe in slowly through your nose and count to four. Hold your breath for seven seconds ,and then exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. You should feel better after a few minutes of deep breathingDoing activities that engage your mind and body are also helpful. Washing dishes or fixing yourself a snack can also get your mind off of the movie.

Avoid watching scary movies at night.,
Watch in a safe environment.,
Identify the scenarios that scare you.",How to Get a Scary Movie Off Your Mind2," Horror movies always seem scarier at night. Watching a scary movie and then walking out into broad daylight will not have the same effect on you as watching a movie at midnight. If you are going to the movie theater, choose a movie that ends before the sun goes down.


If the movie is coming on television, DVR or record the movie and watch it at another time.Watching a scary movie earlier in the day also gives you time to do other activities before you go to bed.

, Knowing that you are in a safe environment causes you to be scared in a fun way instead of experiencing true fear.If you feel safe, your brain recognizes that you are not in true danger and allows you to enjoy the scary movie.Watching a scary movie in a movie theater is usually a better experience than watching the movie at home.After the movie is over, you are able to leave the environment completely.


If you find yourself getting too caught up in the movie, go to the bathroom or get a snack to give your mind a break.
Watch scary movies with other people instead of sitting in the dark by yourself and watching the movie.

, People are afraid of different things. While flesh eating zombies may scare you, a serial killer on the run may terrify someone else. People are often more fearful of movies that they can identify with. Figure out the things that scare you the most and avoid those types of scary movies.


For example, if you babysit a lot, a scary movie about breaking into a home while babysitting may really get to you and cause you to be paranoid the next time you babysit.
When you know your limits, you have greater control over how the movie will affect you."

Acknowledge your fear.,
Face your fears.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Counter your negative thoughts.",How to Get a Scary Movie Off Your Mind3," Sometimes scary movies you watch can leave a lasting impression on you. As a result, you may develop chronic fear that is difficult to get over. If you began watching scary movies as a child or teenager, you are more likely to have long term anxiety and fear.Addressing your fears helps you develop courage and feel safe.Write down exactly what you are afraid and everything that is related to that fear.For example, if you are afraid of the dark, you may write that you are afraid of the dark, afraid of going to sleep, and are scared of having nightmares.

, One way to overcome your fear is to expose yourself to what you are afraid of. You should expose yourself in a safe, controlled environment. This teaches you to move through your fear and allow it to pass.For example, if you are afraid of Freddy Krueger, you may watch the movie every week. To control your environment, you could watch the movie in the daytime with some of your friends.
The more you expose yourself to something, you will develop more control and the movie will have less of an impact on you.
If watching the entire movie is too scary for you, start small and work your way up. Watch the movie for 15 minutes one week and then 30 minutes the next week. Continue to build until you can watch the entire movie.

, You may experience physical symptoms (e.g. racing heart, sweating, difficulty breathing, upset stomach, lightheaded, etc.) when you are afraid or anxious. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, running, dancing, swimming, etc.) can help you feel calm and gain control.Try to find time to do relaxation techniques every day. You will see the best results if relaxation becomes part of your regular routine.
You can practice multiple relaxation techniques or stick to one that you really enjoy.

, Fear can cause you to have negative and irrational thoughts. It is important that you replace these thoughts with positive thoughts. If you do not counter these thoughts, your imagination may take over.If your negative thought is, ""I am afraid dolls and stuffed animals are haunted,"" you may remind yourself that many people sleep near dolls and stuffed animals and are not harmed, and that you have never been attacked by a haunted doll.
If you developed a fear of taking showers when you were home alone, you may remind yourself of all the times you have safely taken a shower, and all of your friends and family members that shower safely. You would also remind yourself that you have never been attacked while you were taking a shower and that you have no evidence that it is unsafe for you to take a shower when you are home alone.

;
, In order to fight your fears, you’ve got to know what scares you. Sit down and draw up a list of things you’re afraid of. What are they? Where do they come from? What are their origins? When do they seem to crop up? When do they seem not so bad? How do they make you feel? Getting away from the fear and away from yourself -- looking at yourself on paper -- will help you be a bit more logical, a bit more objective about your fear.You may want to group similar fears together, especially if you’re afraid of a lot of different things.
It's a good idea to start a fear journal. Whenever you feel overcome with the fear, grab your handy dandy notebook and get to journaling. Not only is it a good outlet, but it can ground you and help you realize that you do have a grip on the situation after all. It can also help you get some distance from the things you’re afraid of., In some situations, it’s perfectly natural to feel some level of fear. A healthy fear response is an evolutionary advantage that’s helped humans survive in a hostile world for thousands of years. However, other fears are more irrational, and it’s often these fears that can cause the most difficulty and distress.For example, if you were hiking and came across a bear, feeling afraid would be a perfectly normal and healthy response, because you’re in a dangerous situation. On the other hand, if you refuse to travel on airplanes because you’re afraid the plane will crash, this fear is largely irrational. Flying is statistically much safer than driving your own car.Understanding when fear makes sense and when it doesn’t can help you conquer your responses.

, Choose one fear that you want to face. At the top of the ladder, write the fear. Then, break the fear up into steps. Begin by writing the least scary action you could take to face this fear at the bottom of the ladder. With each subsequent ""rung,"" choose one action that takes you a bit closer to the top, facing it head on. Break your ladder up into as many rungs as necessary, and don’t try to jump between steps too quickly. Include a wide range of steps you can take.For example: imagine that you’re afraid of flying, and even getting near planes makes you nervous. At the bottom of your ladder, have studying the mechanics behind flying as your step (no more ""the wings are just supported by magic!""). Next, have ""going to the airport."" This is slightly more advanced, but still not too scary: you're just going to go the airport, not actually take a flight. Then, you could book a short, 30-minute flight with a friend. At the very top rung, you'd take a longer flight by yourself.
It’s a good idea to start with something fairly small. Some people make the mistake of jumping straight into fighting the one thing they fear the most, but exposure works best when it’s gradual.
Anxiety BC has a sample fear ladder form, if you aren’t sure what it should look like., Now that you've got your brain wrapped around the fear -- you know where it comes from, you have it broken down into steps -- it's time to wrap your brain around, well, your brain. Remember that your fear is just a way of thinking -- one that you can control. Changing your “internal dialogue,” or how you think about a situation, can change how you respond to your fears.One way to do this is to switch from thinking about the absolute worst-case scenario to the best-case scenario. For example, imagine that you really want to scuba dive but are focused on the worst-case scenarios: you get eaten by a shark, your oxygen cuts out, you drown. While these are possibilities, they’re pretty slim: for example, you have a 1 in 3,700,000 chance of being killed by a shark. (By way of comparison, you have a 1 in 2600 chance of being injured by an air freshener.) In contrast, your chances of having an incredible experience doing this thing you’re afraid of are very high. Why resist doing something that could bring you so much joy and beauty?Arming yourself with statistics can help. While irrational fears are, well, irrational, you can help combat a tendency to catastrophize -- or immediately jump to the absolute worst-case scenario -- by learning some facts about what you’re afraid of. For example, if you learn that out of the 7,000,000 North American flights between 1992-2001, only 30 crashed, your fear of flying may become slightly harder to justify to yourself., Some fears don’t cause a lot of distress in daily life, especially if you can manage to avoid the source of that fear (like staying away from places where you’d find snakes if you have ophidiophobia, or afraid of snakes). However, other fears,such as social phobia, can devastate you on a daily basis. If your fear is routinely causing you distress, or it’s causing a lot of dysfunction in your daily life, see a mental health professional. They can help you figure out why you’re afraid and assist you in taking steps to conquer your fear.There are several different treatment techniques a mental health professional might suggest for you. Prescription medications such as beta blockers and antidepressants can help you manage the anxiety and stress caused by your fear, while cognitive behavioral therapy can help you rewire your thinking so you eventually feel in control of your emotions. Exposure therapy, which is what many of the steps in this article involve, also has a good track record for combating specific fears, especially ones linked to a particular object or experience (riding in elevators, seeing sharks, etc.)., Almost all fears have to be learned. When we're young, we don't know to be afraid. Then we become adults, and we learn that we should be afraid of some things. We're afraid to talk to others. We’re afraid to give a big speech. We're afraid to go on that roller coaster. At one time, we weren't. The trick to conquering fear is remembering that it’s learned -- and it can be unlearned, too.This is particularly apt for social fears, which often stem from a fear of being rejected and a lack of self-compassion. If you wouldn’t reject someone you loved for doing something, chances are that most people won’t reject you either. (And if they do, that says much more about them than it does about you.)

, Visualize yourself confident and utterly lacking fear. Confidence itself doesn't guarantee success, but approaching a situation with confidence can help you try harder.So picture yourself in the situation. Work out the sights, the smells, how you feel, what you can touch. Now take control of it.


This can take practice. At the beginning, start with just 5 minutes of visualization. When it becomes easy, move it to 10. Then, spend as much time as you need to get in the zone.

, Practicing progressive muscle relaxation can help rid your body of anxiety, which will help you feel comfortable when it comes time to face your fear.Lie down in a comfortable, quiet place.
Focus on tensing the muscles in one muscle group, such as your hand or forehead. Maintain the tension for 5 seconds.
Relax. Feel the relaxation spreading throughout that muscle group.
Repeat this process with major muscle groups, such as your facial muscles, hands, upper arms, back, stomach, hips and buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet.

, The sympathetic nervous system is activated when you feel afraid, and this causes physical symptoms like an elevated heart rate and rapid, shallow breathing. Counteract these symptoms by focusing on deep, even, relaxing breathing exercises.Lie on your back and place your hand on your stomach. As you breathe in through your nose, you should feel your stomach expanding. Then, slowly release your breath through your mouth. Repeat this at least 10 times.

, Many fears are about the uncontrollable future. Winston Churchill once said, “When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had never happened.”Practicing mindfulness through meditation can help you stay in the moment and not obsess over things you can’t control anyway.Mindfulness can also improve your concentration and create a deeper sense of well-being and acceptance.

, Being afraid of something can produce a lot of nervous energy, thanks to the working of our sympathetic nervous system (the system responsible for our “flight-or-fight” response). But while you may never be entirely relaxed and calm about doing something you’re afraid of, you may be able to transform how you think about that jittery jolt. Envision your fear energy as enthusiasm instead -- your body can’t actually tell the difference.For example, if you’re terrified of traveling but love going to see your family who lives far away from you, try transforming the nervous energy you feel about getting on the plane or train into excitement about your ultimate goal. You may be a little uncomfortable for a few moments, but you will be so happy when you’ve refused to let your fear keep you from your visit., Thinking about your successes can boost your self-confidence, and that can help you feel strong enough to conquer your fear. What are the awesome things you've done in the face of adversity? What have you done that you weren't sure you'd be able to do? What didn't kill you and only made you better?Don’t belittle your own accomplishments. You’ve probably had more successes than you realize, even if they aren’t gigantic things like being President of the United States. Did you graduate from high school? File your taxes on time? Cook your own dinner? These are all successes.

, Just the next 20 seconds. When you're about to face your fears, think only of the next 20 seconds. That's it. It's not the rest of your life at stake, not even the rest of the afternoon. All you need is the next 20 seconds.20 seconds of embarrassing bravery. 20 seconds of insatiable gusto. 20 seconds of irrepressible awesome. You can manage that, right? You can fake it for 1/3 of ONE minute? Because after that first 20 seconds is over, it's all downhill from there.

, Starting at the very bottom rung of your fear ladder, repeatedly take that step until you begin to feel comfortable doing it. For example, if you’re terrified of public speaking, you could start by simply saying “hi” to the checkout worker at the grocery store. Plan these steps in advance so that you feel in control of the situation.If you’re afraid of a static experience, such as a fear of heights, try to stick with exposure for as long as you can handle it (e.g., looking over the railing from the second floor of the mall). If you’re afraid of an action or object, repeat the action as many times as you can until you feel less anxiety while doing it (e.g., saying hello to everyone you encounter in the supermarket).
The longer you face the situation or thing you’re afraid of, the more likely you are to break the fear cycle. However, if your distress becomes unbearable, don’t feel bad! It’s okay to take a break and begin again another day.

, Don’t rush yourself, but do push yourself. Once you find yourself able to handle the first rung on your fear ladder with less anxiety, move to the next one. Once you begin to get comfortable with facing your fears, don’t stop! You don’t want to lose the progress you’ve made. Keep challenging yourself., Chances are, there are other people in your area who are afraid of the same things you are. By supporting each other, you increase your likelihood of success. There is no shame in asking for help. If you can’t find a formal support group, share your fears with a friend and ask them for help.Tell your family and friends your plan for facing your fears and ask them to be there with you as you experience it. Let them know how you'll probably react and what you need from them. They will probably be glad to support you.

, Talking with others about your fears can help you realize you’re not alone, and can also make them seem more manageable. Your friends may be able to come up with solutions to help you overcome what’s making you afraid. You may even be able to poke some gentle fun at your fears, which can help you feel brave enough to face them.For example, if you have a big speech to make and it scares you, talk with a friend about it. You could even practice giving your speech to a few close people who love you. Practicing in front of people you feel comfortable with several times first may give you the confidence you need to succeed when you give the speech for real.

, “Fake it till you make it” is advice for a reason. Many studies have shown that you can actually become more confident by just appearing to be. If you have a fear of something like public speaking, you are probably far more aware of your shortcomings than anyone else. Approach the situation with confidence, even fake confidence, and you’ll usually find that it isn’t as scary as you thought it would be.You’d be surprised at how easily you can trick your own mind. For example, did you know that making yourself smile can actually make you happier? It’s the same principle behind pretending that you’re confident when you might be feeling really scared inside., Every time you have faced a mini-fear, worked your way up that ladder, reward yourself. Rewarding yourself after you’ve faced a challenge is an example of “operant conditioning,” or presenting a pleasant reward as a consequence of an action, and it’s very effective in changing your behavior.When you hit the end-all-be-all of fears, reward yourself with the end-all-be-all of rewards. The bigger the fear, the bigger your reward. Plan it out for something to look forward to! Everyone needs motivation. When you have rewards, when you have other people who know about your progress, you'll be more pressured to succeed. And if you think positively, you will.

Question whether you need extensive time to make decisions.,
Decide if you have a strong desire for meaningful work.,
Figure out if you are captivated by art.,
Decide if you have a vivid imagination.,
Think about whether you enjoy solitude.",How to Know if You Are a Highly Sensitive Person1," Indecisiveness when making choices is a prominent characteristic of the highly sensitive person. HSPs need ample time to reflect and weigh the potential results of their decisions before moving forward.


HSPs are more in tune with the minute details involved in making a choice—so considering all the options takes longer. If you contemplate restaurant menu items as if it were a life or death choice, this may describe you.;
, Because highly sensitive people are intuitive and introspective, their work is significant to providing satisfaction. However, whereas some people may enjoy their jobs simply because it exposes them to diverse people or deposits an impressive check into their bank accounts, HSPs are more likely to choose careers that align with their values.


Many HSPs change careers several times over a lifespan because the jobs are unfulfilling or compromise their values., Being moved by a song, poem, or other work of art is common for the HSP. You may feel very deeply, so you may pick up on the expressive qualities of art that others do not. Being drawn to aesthetic beauty and creative expression may also explain why many HSPs are artists., HSPs can listen to a song or read a book and evoke a clear picture of the characters and settings in their minds. You may be a valued member of teams at work or school because you consider the many possible options of a problem. Your intense imagination assists you in creative pursuits, as well.Having a vibrant imagination can serve HSPs well. However, your imagination may also lead you to making negative assumptions or developing fears and anxiety.Daydreaming is also common for HSPs, and it can be easy for an HSP to get caught up in their thoughts.

, While your friends and family may want your company nonstop, many HSPs find pleasure in solo downtime. You may use your solitude for creative pursuits, for quiet introspection, or to rest after extended social interaction.You may notice that this trait of the HSP is very similar to the downtime required by introverts. In fact, research shows that more than 70% of HSPs are introverts.
HSPs can easily become overstimulated, so they may prefer lower stimulating people, places, and activities.

Admit to yourself that you are scared:  Fear of failure, fear of inadequacy, even fear of growth.,
Find your hot pad:  A friend of mine, who started his own business a couple of years ago, related his experience as a graduate student.,
Understand that this is a new frame of mind:  Fearing forward is not a one time event .,
Know when to stop thinking and start doing:  Dale Carnegie once said, ""Inaction breeds doubt and fear.",How to Fear Forward," Waves of fear keep coming, and will continue to come. Let them flow by. Damming the flow only results in a lake of fear.;
, He said, ""If you can't take the heat, get out or learn how to deal with the heat. The heat will not stop.""Imagine, does the heat prevent you from taking your carefully prepared secret chocolate chip cookie recipe out of the oven at just the right moment? No, of course not. You grab a couple of hot pads and face the heat with confidence.What is it that you need to face the heat with confidence?

, It is a process that will become refined more and more over time. Giving up is so easy, but fearing forward forces you to expand as a human being.

, Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy."" Pursuing an endeavor without thought and planning is foolhardy, yet thinking and planning without ever getting started will produce no results except regret and more fear.

Recognize generosity and compassion for others.,
Consider whether you have a knack for reading others’ emotions.,
Notice if others often say you are sensitive or overreacting.,
Figure out if you are deeply affected by criticism.",How to Know if You Are a Highly Sensitive Person2," As an HSP, you are the ultimate giver. Highly sensitive people are typically the most caring friends and family members. You are there at the drop of a dime when a friend needs a shoulder to lean on. You would give your loved ones the shirt off your back.


You have trouble saying “no”. Your desire to help others can drain you of energy and push you beyond your resources. Plus, your sensitivity to other’s disappointment makes you give in to requests even when you don’t want to because you fear hurting someone’s feelings. This characteristic can make some HSPs come off as “people-pleasers.”, Emotional sensitivity is the HSPs greatest strength. You can quickly sense when another is hurt or uncomfortable. This makes you an effective communicator because you are able to offer support or change topics to make a conversation more pleasant.


Your empathy also is a double-edged sword. Because you easily pick up on other’s emotions, you are often more distressed. For instance, if a friend is upset, you may find yourself becoming distraught, too., HSPs natural sensitivity makes you more inclined to take minor comments or offenses personally. Your loved ones may frequently accuse you of overreacting or being too emotional.


This strong onset of emotions occurs even when you’re alone. For instance, a negative train of thoughts can escalate into knee-jerk and possibly self-destructive behavior., The depth of emotion you feel and your tendency to take things personally causes you to take criticism to heart. Upon receiving initial feedback, you may become emotional or hurt by another person’s perception of you.


On the flip side, your tendency to think deeply allows you to closely consider criticism and find ways to use it to your advantage. Whereas others might dismiss criticism, after managing the initial emotional reaction, you are more likely to use the feedback for future growth."

Decide if you feel overwhelmed in the midst of chaos.,
Think about your reaction to caffeine.,
Consider whether you have a low pain tolerance.,
Determine your response to excessive stimuli.",How to Know if You Are a Highly Sensitive Person3," A long to-do list, numerous demands on your attention, and too many moving pieces can be too much for the highly sensitive person. You may be extremely vulnerable to emotional overwhelm and dislike spontaneity or uncertainty.If you are easily overwhelmed, it may help to schedule natural breaks in your day to reboot and decompress during chaotic periods. Steal away an hour of two in a more quiet, peaceful environment.

, Because you are naturally prone to anxiety, you may be unusually sensitive to caffeine. Consuming even small amounts of the substance may create an even greater stimulating effect on the HSP than in non-HSPs.If you notice extreme jitters or anxiety after consuming caffeine, limit its consumption in favor of non-caffeinated choices.

, HSPs are found to be quite sensitive to pain. While virtually anyone you meet is probably averse to pain, highly sensitive people may go to lengths to avoid it. Seeing needles in medical offices or witnessing sports injuries upsets HSPs.


This sensitivity to pain extends beyond yourself to others, too, which is why many HSPs may refrain from watching violent or gruesome movies., Highly sensitive people become overstimulated easily. Loud noises, strong smells, and bright lights cause sensory overload. Research shows this happens because your nervous system may receive incoming stimuli differently than non-hypersensitives.


You might find yourself avoiding crowds, noisy bars or restaurants, or boisterous environments in favor of relaxed and quiet atmospheres. Too much stimuli can actually cause fatigue or anxiety for the highly sensitive person."

Be conscious of when you're about to blow.,
Take whatever immediate action you can to cool off.,

Try to understand why people do what they do.,
Try to understand why you feel this way.,
Ask for help.,
Vent your feelings in a healthy way.,
Try not to make important decisions when you're angry.,
Own up to what you've done and forgive yourself.",How to Stop Anger from Getting You into Trouble," Maybe you had a hard day. Maybe someone had been hurting you or irritating you for a long time. Don't test yourself. Try to know how long and how much you can take of something before you're going to act on anger.;
, Whether it is counting to ten or going for a walk, it is best that you put yourself in a state in which you can cool off. Whatever needs doing is better done later than poorly. It is important that you take care of yourself first and foremost.

, Stepping back makes it much easier to avoid acting on impulse, and helps gain another perspective. Try to excuse yourself as politely as possible. Storming out is sometimes worrisome and leaves you on a bad note with someone or something you need to make peace with and makes it more difficult to deal with the situation in a healthy manner. Stepping away is the best way to ensure that you won't do or say something harmful to yourself or others on impulse.

, Like you, others may be struggling to cope with their anger. Sometimes people say mean things or miscommunicate. If someone says or does something mean to you, try to understand why, and then try to resolve the situation when both of you are in a state and position in which you can communicate and listen. As hurt as you may feel, and as reluctant as you may be to see another side, it is better to work through the problem than to let it stew and continue to affect you.You may not think that someone deserves or to tell their side after they have hurt you. You may not think that but still be reluctant to work it out. Don't let problems fester and linger. It not only affects the people around you, but yourself as well.


Agree that you want a conversation. Not an argument.
Avoid talking over each other.
Listen. The point of talking it out is to understand each other.
Avoid making accusations. How you word something is often equally as important as how you say it. Instead of saying ""You do this to me."" try ""When you do... I feel...,"" Not only does it help them receive what you have to say better, but it helps them emphasize and realize that their actions affect you.
Have a plan of what you want to talk about. Writing down what you want to say and resolve prevents tangents and rants. Rants can result in you getting upset, and it will become difficult to keep the conversation from turning into an argument
Own up to what you may have done.
Try to walk away with an agreement or plan of action on how the both of you will work on refraining from or revising what struck up the argument.

, Strong and persistent anger isn't a problem most people face. Maybe someone hurt you very badly and you don't know how else to cope. Maybe you are frustrated with your situation or relationships. It is important to know what is making you so upset so you can try to deal with it in the best way possible and maybe even a solution. It can be from making changes to going back to square one. You might decide things as important as moving or taking a new job. You may end a bad relationship. You may take up a new hobby or try to find a new circle of friends.Taking steps to living a healthier life style will help you control your anger.

, There is no shame in seeking professional help. Whatever diagnosis you may get won't define you, and it will be a step closer to getting better. Seeing a counselor or therapist can help you work through your feelings and have guidance and insight on ways to live with it and cope while you recover.

, You can write it out, talk to a friend, or turn to a hobby. Maybe working out will help relieve you of your frustration. Maybe expressing yourself through an art will. Not only will doing something you love make you feel better, but it is a healthier solution than doing something that could hurt yourself or others.

, When you are angry, you are not thinking clearly. You don't want to make decisions that affect you and your livelihood when you are not in your best state of mind.

, Sometimes you want to look for anything to blame but yourself. The best way to put your wrong doings behind you is to own up to them. Apologize to who you hurt, and take responsibility. Your actions are your own. Apologize because you owe it to them and you acknowledge what you did was wrong and are sincerely sorry. Don't apologize just to be forgiven. Then you need to forgive yourself and move on. Dwelling on every mistake you make is only going to make you more frustrated in loose faith in yourself and your ability to do good. You need to accept the fact that you are going to slip up and make mistakes but you can keep going and you can do better. It takes commitment and hard work, but it's worth it.

Be present in your thoughts.",How to Have No Fear," Fear is an evolutionary adaptation, which alerts us to potential danger or threats. When the fear response is activated, your nervous and adrenal systems become aroused, which produces physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes. When a threat is perceived, your autonomic nervous system is activated. This system is controlled by the amygdala.There are several theories that state that anxiety and fear are different in that fear is the emotional expression of a threat or anxiety response, but how exactly the physiological response is translated into emotion is largely based on several theories which involve amygdala, hypothalamus, and cortex.;
, The fear response is the body’s natural way of dealing with a fearful situation. It also helps you in coping during stressful times. Having this type of reaction or having fear is not bad, because it helps us to adapt during very stressful times. However, when the fear response is activated in a situation where it is not needed, such as taking a test, you may experience physiological changes including muscle tension, restlessness, and increased heart rate. You might also have psychological changes, which can include trouble concentrating, irritability, or diminished judgment.Keep track of things that make you fearful or worried. Do you see themes? For example, are you constantly worried or anxious about your health, or money? Understanding what triggers your fear responses will help you figure out how to overcome them., Having fear is a biological response to an outside stimulus. Therefore, it cannot be taken away completely. Thus, having NO fear at all is not a very attainable goal. However, fear does become a problem when it is disproportionate to what you are experiencing or when it keeps you from trying new things. Make your goal to change how you perceive fearful stimuli, instead of getting rid of your natural fear response.

, It is very easy to listen to thoughts that warn us about danger. Sometimes these thoughts keep us safe. But when these thoughts keep you from living to your fullest, you can test and challenge these fear statements. Your thoughts will be different depending on what makes you afraid. Possible scenarios can include having a test or speech coming up, or being afraid of social situations. You might also be afraid to take a leap such as going back to school or applying for a new job. Test your thoughts to see if your fear is out of proportion to the situation.


For example, you might be afraid to give a speech. You think that you will freeze up during the speech and embarrass yourself. Test out this thought by asking yourself the following questions: “What is the evidence for this thought?”
“Does this thought always hold true for you?”
“Does this thought take into account the positive and negative possibilities of the situation?”



, You can further rationalize by telling yourself that you do not know what the future holds. Reason with yourself to keep your thoughts from making you afraid.Offer yourself soothing supportive statements to calm these fearful thoughts. For example, tell yourself that you’re a capable, strong person who can handle scary circumstances. Remind yourself about how you overcame fear in another situation, and you can overcome your fear now as well.

, Distraction has been shown to be a helpful behavioral response when anxious.Research has shown that using distraction can be a protective factor against anxiety. Although researchers do not know the exact reason why distraction works to defend against anxiety, they think that it is connected to cognitive flexibility in being able to shift focus away from anxious external stimuli or anxious thoughts. In fact, distraction was shown to reduce the risk of developing anxiety, in children. If you are in a new situation, it may be helpful to distract yourself from your fearful thoughts. Your fear thoughts may be keeping you tense and worried in the moment. If you find that you are having trouble addressing and challenging your fear thoughts in the moment, giving yourself a distraction may help temporarily to get through the situation.

For example, if you are giving a speech, distract yourself with your note cards and focus on what you are saying.
If you are in a social situation, start a conversation with someone or focus on what is going on around you, such as music or the smell of food.



, Get a hold of your imagination before it runs wild. Many people who experience fear find that their imaginations work overtime to create catastrophic scenarios. Rope in your imagination and force yourself to envision that same scenario in a positive, successful way.For example, if you are scared of giving a speech, spend a few minutes before the speech imagining yourself stepping up to the podium and speaking clearly and confidently. Imagine the audience listening attentively and clapping for you at the end.

, Overcoming fear isn't going to happen completely overnight. Work on making incremental changes.This way, you will slowly make progress forward.


For example, if you're afraid in social situations, take small steps like saying hello to the grocery store clerk and the mail carrier. If you're scared of public speaking, raise your hand in class to make a quick comment.

, Sometimes it is helpful to know that fear is a normal part of everyday life, and we have all felt afraid at one point or another. Talking with a friend can normalize this feeling as well as reduce stress by offering social support. Talking with friends can also reduce tension and stress by having a place to laugh and talk through fearful situations. In fact, research studies have shown that social support is linked to feelings of security, which can increase feelings of self-worth., If you’re finding that your fears are seriously limiting your ability to interact with others, or you feel restricted from doing things you used to enjoy, consider visiting a mental health professional. This person may be able to help you dig into the roots of your fears and figure out strategies for overcoming those fears.

, In some cases, you may be able to overcome fears by trying exposure therapy. In this type of therapy, a person is exposed to their fear in a safe environment. Then, he or she can “unlearn” the fear. For example, one study reduced participants’ phobias of spiders by allowing the participants spend time with tarantulas. They were taught about the spiders’ biology and behavior, and eventually touched the spiders.Exposure therapy can sometimes be detrimental, especially for people who suffer from PTSD.Consult with a mental health professional before starting exposure therapy.

, Look for a support group in your area where you can share your experiences with other people who experience fear. You might find something that is specific, such as a support group to overcome a fear of flying, for example. Or, you might find a support group that addresses fears and anxieties more generally.

, Because fear is intimately linked to a physiological response such as increased heart rate, increased breathing, and sweating,it is important to have ways to help reduce these responses. It’s especially important because these sensations can be uncomfortable and may actually make you feel more afraid or stressed. Controlling your breathing can trigger a calming response, signaling your body to begin to relax and slow breathing and heart rate.When you notice that your anxiety or fear is heightened, try deep breathing from your diaphragm.


Take a full breath to a count of ten and ensure that you breath expands your abdomen, hold it for five seconds, and then exhale for five seconds.
Be sure to take two normal breaths in between your deep diaphragm breathing., You can access a calming response by using progressive muscle relaxation. This type of relaxation reduces muscle tension, sending a signal your body to begin relaxing. By tensing and then releasing the tension in your muscles, you can slowing bring your body back to a calm state.


Tighten your muscles for six seconds and then release for six seconds. Pay close attention to how each muscle is relaxing.
Work from your head to your toes until you feel your body begin to relax.

, Mindfulness is a way to calm your fearful thoughts by becoming aware of your immediate environment such as your sensations like hearing and body sensations. Similar to challenging unhelpful thoughts, mindfulness can be used to allow your fearful thoughts to move in and out of your awarenesswithout judgment and without allowing these thoughts to evoke an emotional or physical response.


When you notice that your fearful thoughts, or physical fear response is becoming too much, tune into noticing the present moment. Listen to the sounds in the room. Sense the temperature of the room. Notice smells in the room. Keep at it until you produce a calming effect for yourself.In addition to pacifying fear, mindfulness can decrease stress and blood pressure. It can also help you to feel more connected to those around you in the moment."

A study by the University of Georgia suggests that moderate exercise (such as running or riding a bike) during or immediately after an upsetting experience can help you manage the experience of anger. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which are natural ""feel-good"" chemicals that make you feel more positive and happy.If you're unable to run or ride a bike, consider walking, stretching, and other easier forms of exercise.Exercise may also have a preventive effect. A Yale study suggested that prolonged bouts of running before an upsetting experience may dampen the extremity of your emotional reaction.Even if you can't take time for a full exercise routine when you're angry, try take a few moments. Leave the situation that's making you angry if you can, and shake out your limbs vigorously. Even small physical distractions can help you feel better.;
, Breathing deeply from your diaphragm (the large muscle at the base of your lungs that assists with breathing) can help soothe feelings of anger.Deep, controlled breathing slows your heartbeat, stabilizes blood pressure, and relaxes your body.Combine your breathing exercise with a mantra, or calming word or phrase, for added benefit.


Find a quiet place to relax. Make yourself comfortable. Lie down if you like, and loosen any tight or uncomfortable clothing.
Place your hand on your abdomen.
Inhale slowly through your nose. Focus on filling your belly with air as you breathe in. Let your abdomen relax as you inhale; you should be able to feel your stomach expand. Hold this breath for a few seconds.
Breathe out slowly through your mouth. Contract your abdominal muscles to push all the air out of your lungs.
Repeat this process at least ten times.
If you're still having trouble with deep breathing, buy a bottle of children's bubbles from the toy store. Hold the bubble wand in front of your face and breathe slowly through the wand. Focus on exhaling from your lower abdomen, squeezing your breath up and out. Steady, even breathing will produce a flow of bubbles. If your bubbles break or don't appear, alter your breathing until they do., Progressive muscle relaxation requires you to focus on tensing and relaxing particular muscle groups in your body, so it can help distract you from your feelings of anger. Additionally, it is excellent for relieving anxiety and tension, which can also help alleviate angry feelings. This exercise also works to help you sleep when your thoughts are out of control.Go to a quiet, comfortable place if possible, and find a seat.
Focus on a particular muscle group, such as the muscles in one hand. While inhaling deeply and slowly, squeeze the muscles in that group as hard as you possibly can and maintain that tension for 5 seconds. For example, tensing your hand muscles would involve forming a tight fist. Focus on that group of muscles and try not to accidentally tense surrounding muscles.
Exhale and quickly release the tension in the muscle group you just tensed. Focus on the experience of the tension leaving those muscles. Allow yourself to relax for about 15 seconds, then move on to another muscle group.
Other muscle groups to try tensing and relaxing are the foot, lower leg, thigh, buttocks, stomach, chest, neck and shoulders, mouth, eyes, and forehead.
You can also start at your feet and work your way up your body, tensing each group of muscles. As you release each muscle group, imagine the anger leaving your body as you feel the relaxation take over.

, Focused activities may help channel your angry energy into a productive expression so that you can move past your immediate feelings of anger. Research has shown that anger can even temporarily enhance brainstorming and creative thinking.Engage your imagination and mindfully release your anger in a controlled, creative way.For example, find a private place to shake your body and imagine that you are literally shaking off your anger just like a dog shakes off water after a bath.
Another example could be writing down angry thoughts on a piece of paper and then slowly tearing the paper apart, imagining that you are also destroying your feelings of anger.
If you're artistic, try sketching or painting something that expresses how you feel. Focus on moving your feelings out of yourself and into the artwork.

, A stress-relief toy, such as a stress ball, can help in the immediate experience of anger. Because they prompt you to squeeze and release a group of muscles, stress balls can give you some of the benefits of progressive muscle relaxation more immediately. However, they are a stop-gap solution and should be coupled with other techniques for the best long-term results.It's much better to use a stress-relief toy than it is to release anger by punching, kicking, or throwing things. Explosive actions like these can cause harm or damage, and they often increase your anger rather than help it., Silly humor can actually help defuse your anger. A significant root cause of a lot of anger is the feeling that our own ideas about a situation or experience are always right and that things ought to go in the way we expect them to. Using humor to approach and deconstruct these ideas can help calm you down and manage your anger.For example, the American Psychological Association recommends that, if you find yourself calling someone a derogatory name, you imagine it literally. So, if you’re so angry at your boss that you call him a “douchebag,” imagine what it would look like if your boss literally were a douchebag, complete with suit and briefcase. This type of humor may help you feel less tense.
Looking at silly or cute videos online can also help you lighten your mood. Humans are biologically programmed to find things such as large-eyed puppies and tiny fat babies adorable, and we have a chemical reaction of happiness to seeing these things.Avoid sarcastic or cruel humor, as this type of humor is likely to just make your anger worse and can also hurt others.

, Listening to music can be an excellent distraction technique that can help you release your anger. However, it’s important that you listen to calming music. When you’re already feeling angry, music with aggressive beats or angry lyrics may actually make your negative feelings more intense.Find quiet, tranquilizing music to help soothe your anger. Part of what makes you feel so ""revved up"" when you're angry is that your body has entered a ""fight or flight"" state of excitement.The British Academy of Sound Therapy has created a playlist of songs deemed ""relaxing"" by scientific study, including songs by Marconi Union (""Weightless""), Airstream (""Electra"") and Enya (""Watermark"")., Find a statement that is meaningful to you, and try focusing your attention on this statement as you repeat it. You can even repeat a few statements to yourself.Here are a few you could try:


“This situation is only temporary.”
“I can make it through this.”
“I might not like it, but it’s not going to kill me.”
“I will keep my cool about this.”
“This isn’t worth getting upset about.”

"
"
Develop an “anger plan.” Because it can be very hard to come up with ways to reduce your anger in the heat of the moment.,
Restructure your thinking.,
Approach situations with flexibility.,
Learn assertiveness.,
Try meditating.,
Get enough sleep.,
Share your experiences with the person who angered you.,
See a therapist.",How to Release Anger2," try coming up with an advance plan to help you calm yourself in the event that you get angry. Having this plan in mind will help you manage your anger productively.


For example, you might plan to take a “time out” if you feel yourself beginning to grow angry, in which you calmly tell the other person that you’re feeling upset and need to take a break.
If you are in a conversation that’s making you angry -- such as a conversation about a heated issue like politics or religion -- make an effort to shift the conversation to a more neutral and pleasant topic.

, Cognitive restructuring can help you experience anger less frequently. Anger often leads to exaggerating your response to events or experiences and can make you spiral out of control. Changing the way you think about your experiences and goals can help you both avoid feeling angry in the first place and manage your anger when you do experience it.Avoid totalizing words like “never” or “always.” One tendency of anger is that it blots out our memory of other experiences, which can increase frustration. These words also hurt others and make people feel defensive instead of cooperative. Instead of saying things such as “I’m always such an idiot” or “You never remember what’s important,” focus on what is actually occurring. You may find it helpful to make a plain statement of fact to yourself, such as “I forgot my cellphone at the house” or “You forgot our dinner plans,” to help you keep things in perspective.
Remain logical. Of course it’s easier said than done, but reminding yourself that the negative experience encouraging you to feel angry isn’t the only experience you will likely have that day. Remembering that the irritation, no matter how big it may seem, is only temporary will help you overcome your feelings of anger more quickly.

, It’s easy to assume that your first impression of a situation or experience is the “right” one, and it can be very difficult to give up the idea that there is an objective truth to every situation. However, being more flexible with how you approach experiences and events will help you react with less anger to them.


For example, if someone cut in front of you while you were waiting in line at the store, you might assume they don’t care about your needs and were being rude, and that assumption could lead you to feeling angry. While that assumption might be true, it’s not productive. Approaching that experience flexibly, such as imagining that the other person just didn’t see you or may be preoccupied with some stressful issue of their own, will help you let go of the personal feeling of anger.

, Developing an assertive communication style can help you feel more in control of your own life and experience less anxiety and anger. Assertive communication and behavior isn’t about being arrogant or selfish; it’s just about clearly and calmly expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs to others in an open and honest way. If you aren’t honest with others about your needs, they may not be able to meet them, and that experience can result in your feeling angry, depressed, and unvalued.Use “I”-focused statements such as “I’m feeling confused about what you said” or “I would like you to be on time when we go to see a movie together.”
Avoid name-calling, threats, and attacks on the other person.
Use cooperative statements and invite others’ opinions.
Be as direct and clear as possible about your desires and needs. For example, if you’ve been invited to a party that you don’t want to attend, don’t just say something like “Oh, well,I guess I’ll go if I have to.” Instead, state clearly but politely that you don’t want to go: “I would prefer not to attend that party.”

, Meditation not only decreases anxiety and alleviates depression, it also can help you maintain your calm even during upsetting experiences. A recent Harvard study showed that meditation has a positive effect on your brain function, especially in the area of emotional processing.The study examined two forms of meditation: “mindfulness” meditation and “compassionate” meditation. While both reduced participants’ feelings of anxiety and anger, compassionate meditation was even more effective than just mindfulness.


Mindfulness meditation focuses on being completely present in the moment and being aware of and accepting your body’s experiences. This type of meditation is similar to the meditation you might do in a yoga class.
Compassionate meditation, also sometimes called loving-kindness meditation, is based on a set of lo-jong, or Tibetan Buddhist practices, focused on developing your feelings of compassion and love for others.This type of meditation may require you to seek some instruction before you can effectively practice it on your own.

, Sleep deprivation can do a variety of damages to your body, including causing physical stress and increasing your risk of developing a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety. Poor sleep or too little sleep can also cause irritability, mood swings, and a tendency to feel angry more often than usual.Sleep experts recommend that the average adult get an average of at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night, although you may require more or slightly less sleep to feel fully satisfied depending on your own body’s needs.

, Once you have let go of your angry feelings, sharing your feelings and experiences with the person who angered you can be helpful. For example, if someone hurt your feelings by ignoring you at a party, calmly talking to that person and explaining why you felt hurt may help them understand how their behavior affected you. It may also help you feel more in control of the situation.


It is very important to wait until you’ve processed your anger to talk with the other person. If you approach them while you’re angry, you will likely only make the situation worse, and you could end up causing hurt as well. Always use non-violent communication when interacting with others.

, A therapist can help you work through the underlying feelings and motivations behind your anger. This is especially helpful if your feelings and their causes aren’t particularly clear to you. Cognitive therapy, in which therapists help you learn how to think about experiences differently, can be particularly helpful for anger management."

Recognize problematic anger.,
Learn to read your body.,
Examine the anger patterns in your family history.,
Keep an anger journal.,
Learn your triggers.",How to Release Anger3," Most people experience mild anger a few times every week. In some cases, it’s perfectly normal to feel angry, such as if you feel someone has insulted or hurt you. However, you should learn to recognize signs that your anger has verged into the “problem” category.Do you frequently yell, scream, or curse when you’re angry? Do you verbally lash out at others?
Does your anger frequently lead to physical aggression? How severe is the expression of this aggression? Less than 10 percent of normal anger episodes involve physical aggression, so if you’re experiencing it often, that could be a sign that something more serious is at issue.
Do you feel the need to self-medicate when you’re angry, such as by using drugs, alcohol, or food?
Do you feel that your anger negatively affects your personal relationships, your job, or your general health? Have others expressed these concerns to you?

, Anger can cause a variety of physical symptoms, particularly in women, who are often taught by social and cultural pressures to avoid expressing hostility and anger openly.Feelings of physical tension or muscle aches, rapid breathing, feeling jittery, and experiencing headaches are all symptoms that can be linked to anger. Understanding when you’re really feeling angry, rather than trying to repress that knowledge, can help you process your anger.


Anxiety, depression, and insomnia can also be linked to feelings of anger.

, The ways in which your parents and other family members expressed their anger have a significant effect on your own patterns of dealing with it. How did members of your family process and express their anger when you were growing up? Did your parents openly express anger, or was it repressed?, One way to become more in touch with your feelings and why you’re experiencing anger is to write down your emotions in detail. Reflect on not only what happened during an event or experience, but how you reacted and what your train of thought was. Try not to judge these feelings as you write. Just express them so that you can become aware of what you’re feeling. Awareness is a crucial first step to processing and overcoming anger. Ask yourself the following questions for each entry:


What incited your feelings of anger or stress? Were you already feeling stressed before this incident?
What thoughts did you experience during this experience?
On a scale of 0-100, how angry do you think you felt?
Did you lash out at others or internalize your anger?
Did you notice any physical symptoms, such as an elevated heart rate or headache?
What responses did you want to have? Did you want to scream, attack someone, or smash things? What responses did you actually have?
How did you feel after the incident or experience?

, Anger in particular is easily triggered in many people by specific thoughts or incidents.You can use your anger journal to determine patterns in what seems to set off your anger response most often. Trigger thoughts fall broadly into two main categories: feeling that you’re in danger of being harmed, and feeling that you’ve actually been harmed in some way.


A very common trigger thought is that someone has done or not done something you expect them to. For example, if you arranged to meet a friend for dinner and they didn’t show up, you might feel angry that they didn’t do what you’d expected them to.
Another common trigger thought is feeling like something is causing you harm, even in a very general way. For example, being cut off in traffic, having computer issues, and constantly dropping calls on your cellphone happen frequently, but these incidents can carry real, negative consequences that create a worry of experiencing harm. That worry can trigger anger.
Feeling as though you haven’t achieved a personal goal or need can also trigger anger, in this case anger directed at yourself.
Feeling as though you’re being taken advantage of or that people don’t help or care about you are also common triggers, especially at work and in romantic relationships.

Do an intense physical activity.,
Take a nap.,
Use creativity.,
Spend time with close family or friends.,
Avoid dwelling on your problems.,
Problem-solve the issue.,
Challenge negative thinking.,
Gain awareness as to what you’re feeling and why.,
Tune in to your physiological feelings and their relation to your emotions.,
Perform a letting go ritual.",How to Release Negative Emotions," Releasing negative emotions can be done just as effectively with your body as with your mind. If you are hung up on bad vibes, take a timeout and get active. Exercise is naturally good for you at any time. Right now, however, it can provide an outlet for negative feelings and promote a more positive mood state through the generation of feel-good chemicals, called endorphins.


Participate in some type of activity that fully engages your body and allows you to blow off steam. Examples may include running, boxing, swimming, or contact sports. Even a short, 30-minute walk can offer you a much-needed emotional lift.;
, Being chronically stressed by negative emotions can actually place your body in “fight or flight” mode in which you are primed for action around-the-clock. If you have been fighting negative feelings for some time, you may be wrecking your brain about what to do or thinking nonstop about what is going wrong. Doing this for a prolonged period of time can cause mental fatigue.Fatigue can worsen negative emotions or hinder your ability to cope with them in a positive way.


Planning a short nap for approximately 20-30 minutes can help you combat any mental fatigue you may feel. When you wake, you may feel more capable of dealing with negative feelings as short naps can improve alertness and performance., Another way to release negative emotions is through artistic pursuits. With art, you can get out of your head temporarily and channel those feelings into a positive activity. Make a sculpture. Develop a fictional story. Grab some paints, crayons, or markers and create a picture. Direct your feelings into the lyrics of a new song. Turn on some music and express your feelings through dance.


Art allows you to use potentially destructive emotions for a constructive purpose. Such activities can minimize stress and anxiety, and even allow you to find meaning in your emotional pain., A great way to get out of your head when you’re bothered by negative emotions is to hang with people who care about you. Friends and family who are understanding and supportive can help you to cope with and resolve painful feelings. Negative emotions are a necessary part of life, and they often allow us to grow and become stronger.Still, that doesn’t mean you have to carry the burden on your own.


Turn to someone you trust and explain the emotions you are experiencing.Ask for distraction, consolation, or guidance as to how you should cope. Whatever you need, let your loved one give it to you.

, Sometimes, when you feel bad, you may think about an upsetting situation over and over again, a concept referred to as rumination. Perhaps you tell yourself that you are trying to understand it better. Nevertheless, all this does is make you feel worse. Try not to blow things out of proportion by constantly dwelling on your negative feelings. Here is one way to overcome rumination.Schedule a worry period. Instead of letting these negative thoughts and feelings command your entire day, squeeze them into a short window. During this 20-30 minute time period you are allowed to think about what’s going wrong. After the time passes, you must push these concerns away and remind yourself that you have to wait until the next window.

, If you are experiencing a negative emotion, the emotion is unlikely to be the cause but the effect. If you want to shift the way you are thinking and feeling, you must take action against the problem. This type of coping is useful when you have some control over the situation, such as problems at school, work, or in your relationships.For example, you are highly stressed because you are failing your mathematics course. A good way to resolve your negative feelings is to brainstorm what actions you can take to resolve the situation and/or improve how you feel about it.
You may be able to get a tutor, ask the instructor for extra assignments or additional study tools, or, if it is simply bad timing, you may be able to drop the course and take it again later. Think of all the possible avenues you can take and then map out a plan.

, The way you view certain circumstances can have a huge impact on your emotional state. Frequently, you may feel trapped in negative mood states due to the words you are repeating in your head. Changing your self-talk, therefore, can also change the way you feel.


For example, say you are upset because you believe your girlfriend is about to break up with you. You don’t have solid facts, just a hunch. You can overcome negative feelings and resolve the situation by asking yourself some questions.What evidence do I have that this is true? What evidence do I have that this is not true?
Is there another way to interpret this situation?
Have I confused a thought with a fact?
If it did happen, what could I do to cope or handle the situation?
What would a friend say about my thought?



, Considering that negative emotions are an integral factor of life, sometimes, the best method to releasing these emotions is by simply accepting them. When we try to push away or resist such feelings, they worsen. Instead, acknowledge what you are feeling and consider the possible stimulus by practicing a mindfulness technique called body scan.Go into a quiet room or space where you can sit for several minutes without distractions. Take a few deep, cleansing breaths. Notice how you are feeling in your body. Move through different parts of your body, paying attention to how your muscles feel and what sensations you are experiencing there. If your mind starts to wander from this task, return your attention to the given body part as soon as possible.
Certain sensations you get in your body can clue you in on your emotional state. Right now, you are not trying to change anything, but merely bring awareness how different parts of your body feel.

, Learning to identify your emotions is central to gaining acceptance of them. When you are experiencing a certain emotion, physiological, physical, and mental responses may come along with it. You can learn how to identify these emotions by tuning in to your body with a simple technique.



Breathe deeply and try to relax your body and mind. Once your thoughts begin to slow down, ask yourself ""What am I feeling right now?""
Try to pinpoint where in your body this emotion is being expressed. What color would you give this emotion? What name? Start by trying to label what you are feeling from the four basic categories: mad, happy, afraid, or sad.Researchers have determined that most people feel bodily sensations when they experience different emotions. For example, fear may come with heightened sensations in your face and arms in addition to shortness of breath and clenched muscles. On the other hand, happiness may come with electric tingles that radiate throughout the body in addition to a lightness of your movements, or buoyancy., It can be incredibly therapeutic to release negative emotions by engaging in symbolic rituals. Such actions give a tangible, physical presence to intangible, emotional experiences. There are many ways you can release emotion through ritual.Buy some window crayons and write out words or phrases on the shower tiles as you bathe. You might cry or express your emotion during your shower. As you finish, the words will have started to wash away. You may have to rub them a bit, but, in general, once you have finished cleaning your body, you have also cleansed yourself of those painful emotions.
Write a letter—to yourself or to someone else who hurt you. Write down all your thoughts, feelings, and any actions you have wanted to take. Once you are done, read over the letter. Then, use a match to burn the letter. Spread the ashes in the wind, or flush them down the toilet.

Recognize that changes will always happen.,
Expect internal resistance to change.,
Analyze the situation.,
Determine what you can and cannot control.,
Be patient, not passive.",How to Handle Changes in Your Life1," Changes occur in our lives at regular intervals, whether we are aware of them or not. A shop that has been in the area for years may close down, or an old building may be demolished to make way for a new roadway. More directly, you may experience a serious illness, a divorce, or the birth of a child. Life is not static, nor are we meant to be; change is part of our very nature, welcome or not.You’ve probably caught yourself at some point, while watching the sun set over the ocean, seeing your kids giddily open Christmas presents, or experiencing some other joyful setting, thinking “I wish it could be like this forever.” And yet, without changes, those situations could never have occurred. Change is inevitable and essential.;
, Along with accepting that change will and must happen, you also need to accept that you will instinctively be (at least initially) resistant to most changes. This instinct has no bearing on the likelihood of a change being good or bad; it is simply a typical human response to something different.Some changes will be a challenge. You may change your job, or be forced to move far away. These are challenges to which you can either rise or fall. If you follow up your initial hesitancy with fear, you may become a nervous wreck. However, if you can move past your resistance and embrace change as a new adventure, you may end up happier and better off in the end.

, While you can’t emotionally detach yourself from the experience of life changes, you can try to take a step back and look at things from a distance. Grab a pen and paper if it helps and jot down exactly what has changed and how it has impacted you.(Actually, journaling is a great way to work through your feelings whether you are experiencing life changes or not.)


Once you’ve determined precisely what you’re dealing with, you can develop coping strategies that are best suited to deal with the circumstances.
Say, for instance, that your next door neighbors move away, and new people move in. If your relationship with the old neighbors was cordial, you may view the newcomers with trepidation, or even distrust. Viewed rationally, however, it is entirely possible that you’ll get along even better with the new neighbors; as Jim Reeves once sang, “A stranger is just a friend you do not know.""

, Many life changes will be completely beyond your control — from the death of a loved one to corporate downsizing and so on. Even when you do have some amount of control — like trying to choose which house to buy in a new town — you still are not in command of the overall life change occurring. However, you always have the ability to control how you respond to the change.The key to accepting change is to have an open mind and to accept everything as it presents itself. The change will occur, like it or not; you cannot control it. In the face of this change, however, you have the ability to shape your response in a positive manner.

, All this talk of accepting change might make you think that you are supposed to just lie down and let life happen to you. Keep in mind, however, that there is a difference between patience and passivity. You can patiently accept change while at the same time actively pursuing strategies to reorient yourself (emotionally and otherwise) to the new circumstances.Changes will happen. You will be (at least initially) resistant to these changes. You cannot control either the changes or your initial hesitancy. You can control your larger response to the changes. To do so requires your active participation.
Realize that some changes are going to be very unexpected. Accept it as a new chapter in your life; as a fresh opportunity to gain knowledge or experience in some new area, or a chance to discover new people, new places and new skills.

Notice how aggression feels in your body.,
Identify potential triggers.,
Use mindfulness.,
Connect with friends.,
Exercise.,
Practice relaxation.",How to Reduce Aggression During Hot Weather," Especially when it’s hot outside, it’s important to stay hydrated. Dehydration can cause stress (and vice versa), so be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. If you feel nauseous, fatigued, or have a headache, this could be a warning sign that you’re dehydrated.Even mild dehydration can cause changes in mood.It’s recommended that adult men drink 10 cups and adult women drink 8 cups of water each day.If you’re in hot conditions, drink more than the recommended daily amount as you’re likely losing fluids, and don’t wait until you’re thirsty to drink.
If you have a child, common signs of dehydration include cold skin, dry mouth, lethargy, and a blueish tint to the skin.;
, If it’s hot outside, you may struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep due to feeling. Heat can contribute to difficulties in falling asleep and getting enduring, quality sleep.If heat is affecting your sleep, use a fan or open your bedroom windows. Heat rises, so consider sleeping downstairs. Keep rooms cool during the day by using blinds.


It is recommended that adults get 7.5-9 hours of sleep per night. School-aged children need about 10-13 hours of sleep per night., If you’re starting to feel the effects of the heat, cool down with a drink. Having a cold drink can mediate the effects of heat on aggression.Keep some cold water in the fridge, or have some lemonade on hand.


Plan for extremely hot weather by having lots of cold items available, including popsicles, ice cubes, and other frozen treats.
Keep a water bottle with you throughout the day. Keep it full of ice so it stays cold.

, You have a physical response when you feel angry or aggressive. Your stomach might knot up, you may tighten your fists, tense your muscles, or begin to breathe faster.If you start to notice your body making these changes, relax. Focus on loosening your muscles and calming your mind. Just like you notice that you feel hot, become aware of what feelings you have that accompany your elevated temperature.


Your body can give you early warning signs of your aggression. Listen up and aim to relax as quickly as possible to avoid escalating your aggression.

, While you might think that external things trigger your anger (such as people and situations), take a moment and ask yourself how your thoughts contribute. Perhaps you blame the weather or even other people for bad things happening or for the way you feel. Or maybe you feel more frustrated or easily more easily set off when there’s increased heat. It’s possible you overlook positive things while letting negative things mount. Whatever it is, notice how your own thoughts affect your anger and aggression.If you notice negative thought patterns contributing to your aggression, replace the negative thoughts with more positive thoughts For example, if you’re thinking, “If one more person bothers me I’m going to explode!” stop and think to yourself, “I know that heat can make me more on edge. It’s okay if people need help.”

, Using a mindfulness practice can help to reduce anger and aggression.Mindfulness involves attention and focus in the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. Some ways to practice mindfulness are through yoga, meditation, and body scanning. Mindfulness is easy to practice daily, and can be practiced while walking, sitting, and eating.When you notice how hot you feel, bring your attention to the other awareness you experience.


Get a small candy and examine it. Notice the texture, how it feels in your hand, and how it smells. Put it in your mouth and notice what happens. Do you begin to salivate? What do you experience?

, Being with friends can help you feel calm and relaxed.Choose to be around people who make you feel good, encourage you, and are good listeners. Do activities that are fun and that won’t cause stress. Engage in some indoor activities in an air conditioned place to help control multiple tempers.


Go to the pool together or play games indoors in the air conditioning.
If certain people activate your aggression on a normal basis, think about limiting contact with them during hot weather, as this may increase your risk of aggression.

, Exercise can help you boost your mood and help to relieve anxiety, depression, and stress.Additionally, exercise can help to reduce anger.Consider going for a walk or run in the early morning before it heats up, or late at night once it begins to cool down.


If you are a member of a gym, consider going when it’s unbearably hot outside. Many gyms use air conditioning and can give you some relief from the heat.
Make sure you don’t overheat when exercising. Stay hydrated and if you start to feel unwell, stop and take a break.

, If you notice your temper flaring in the heat when you’re already stressed, start a relaxation practice. Start a relaxation practice every day to keep your stress levels low and to calm your aggression. Using relaxation for 30 minutes each day can help to stabilize your moods, cope with stress, and increase your sense of well-being.This can help you cope with any aggression that builds up by handling it daily.


Find relaxation methods that feel good and that you want to do every day. Try yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

Give yourself time to change.,
Focus on small, present things.,
Accept failures and false starts.,
Specify your strategies.,
Increase your sense of control in small ways.,
Avoid making decisions out of fear.",How to Handle Changes in Your Life2," Life changes — like a car accident or winning the lottery — can “happen overnight,” but your adjustment period won’t. Think of a major life change as akin to dipping into a swimming pool. At first, the water feels freezing cold and you want to get right back out. After a bit, though, you get used to the change and can enjoy a relaxing, comfortable wade or swim.Major life changes require a “psychological metamorphosis” on your part. And, like a butterfly, the transformation takes time. Try to visualize the stages of your metamorphosis and imagine the end of the process, when you have adjusted to the new circumstances., While you want to visualize the big picture and see yourself happily adjusted to the major change occurring, you also need to focus your energies on the here and now of the adjustment process. Accept that your are in the midst of your adaptation to the new reality that faces you, and take note of your progress and your roadblocks.For instance, if your beloved pet dog has died, try not to obsess over asking yourself “When am I going to get over this?”. Instead, focus on small steps in your adjustment process: putting away the dish, leash, and chew toys; being able to pass the dog park without tearing up; and, eventually, feeling that urge to check out the puppies at the animal shelter.

, Adjusting to changes is not often a one-way street. Sometimes, you’ll take two steps forward, and one step back. And that’s normal and healthy. Don’t judge yourself too harshly for slip-ups or backslides; rather, keep yourself focused on the positive steps you have made and will make next.For example, if your fiance has run off with someone else and left you shattered, don’t be surprised if your first few attempts to get back into the dating game end up as disasters. And don’t be too hard on yourself if you find yourself in tears, clutching a meaningful item from your relationship. So long as you are also making positive steps in your transition process, you can remind yourself that you’re doing just fine.

, There are general concepts to keep in mind as you face any kind of major life change. There are also more specific strategies you should employ dependent upon the nature of the actual change you are facing. To name a few examples:If you’re starting a new job, try to prioritize completing tasks that complement your existing skills (so you can feel good about doing them well), and allow you to build a rapport with your new co-workers.
If you’re facing a serious illness, allow yourself to grieve for what has been lost (your independence, certain abilities, your long-term future, etc.), and don’t discount the coping powers of a hearty laugh and a shoulder to cry on.
If you’re moving to a new town, view it as an open-ended adventure — do research on your new home, plot out your “visit,” and talk to strangers for advice and tips on how to eat, play, and live like a “local.”

, Looking for opportunities to exert control may also help you to adapt to change. Try thinking of all of the little things that you can control in your daily life, such as what you have for dinner or what you do on your days off from work.


You can also look for ways to feel more in control with the change that is coming your way. For example if you are moving to a new place, then research it as much as possible before you move to find out about the area. Look into little things like what stores are in your neighborhood, what activities are available, and other things that will help you to ease into your new environment.

, Change can be frightening, but it is important to avoid making decisions that are based in fear. Try to address your fears about the changes coming your way rather than avoiding them.For example, if you are feeling fearful about moving to a new city for your dream job, this is normal. However, the fear of the unknown should not prevent you from making this move.
Try making a list of what you fear about the changes you are facing. Then, look over the list and determine if these fears are things that you can do something about. For example, if you are fearful of going to a new city because you think you will be lonely, then start looking into social opportunities, such as a special interest group. For example, you could join a running club if you enjoy running, a knitter’s circle if you like to knit, or a church if you are religious.

Count your blessings.,
Seek familiar comforts.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Manage your stress.,
Get additional help.",How to Handle Changes in Your Life3," It can feel like everything in your life has gone sour when you’re experiencing a major change, like a job loss or the end of a long-term relationship. At times like these, when everything seems to be changing for the worse, it is even more important to pause and take stock of all the good things (and people) in your life.Remember that things could always be worse. Yes, your car has been repossessed, but at least you can still borrow your parents’ clunky Oldsmobile to get around. Sure, your boyfriend cheated on and dumped you, but at least he didn’t dare try to take the cat with him!
Don’t focus solely on the “it could always be worse” element, however. Identify and be grateful for the genuinely good and helpful aspects of your life, regardless of any changes occurring. Things like your good health, awesome apartment, and always-cheerful Aunt Sylvia are worth your thoughts and your thanks.

, When your world is in turmoil, seek out a safe harbor that you know well. Familiar places, people, things, and activities will remind you that not everything has changed. Use them as totems to ground your sense of self as the world around you becomes less familiar.Go for a meal at Grandma’s house. Re-read a favorite book, or leaf through your old baseball card collection. Spend a “sick day” together with your best friend since kindergarten.

, We all face major life changes, and none of us should try to face them alone. When you’re struggling with a life change, writing down your feelings can be very helpful. Often, though, it may be even more beneficial to verbalize your feelings to a sympathetic ear.Call or meet up with a friend or family member who you know is an attentive listener, and to whom you feel comfortable speaking with on personal matters. Say something like “I’ve been struggling a lot with the death of Spot / move to the city / changes at my office. Is it okay if I unburden myself on you for a few minutes?”
You can make it an impromptu talk, but it may be more helpful to plan out a time in advance when you know you can converse without distractions or interruptions.

, Life changes can and will increase your stress levels, and some of us have a more difficult time handling stress than others. While a manageable amount of stress is actually a healthy thing, and can help spur you to adapt successfully to life changes, excessive and/or constant stress can damage your emotional, mental, and physical health. In order to effectively handle changes in your life, you need to be able to handle the accompanying stress.Symptoms of excessive stress can take many forms, from experiencing difficulty concentrating to having heart palpitations. Treatments for stress likewise take numerous forms, ranging from healthy living (via eating, sleeping, and exercising) to meditation to enjoying fun distractions. See Control Stress for a fuller discussion of the signs of and treatments for excessive stress.

, If you simply cannot manage the changes happening in your life — or, more specifically, your emotional response to them — there is absolutely no shame in seeking professional guidance. Mental health professionals are capable of helping you to better evaluate, accept, and adapt to the changes happening to you.If you are feeling overwhelmed and need immediate help, call an emergency mental health hotline like 1‑800‑273‑TALK (8255), which is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (in the U.S.). Or, call 911 or the equivalent emergency services number where you live."

Be mindful of the real source of your annoyance.,
Let go of resentments.,
Consider whether you have unexpressed expectations.,
Develop empathy.,
Practice gratitude.,
Remember to HALT before you speak.",How to Not Get Mad at Someone Even Though You Really Want To1," It can be very easy to become mad at someone needlessly if you have a tendency to displace your anger or your bad mood. Taking your displaced anger out on other people is not a healthy way to manage your emotions or your relationships. To avoid displaced anger, try the following:


Ask yourself, “what is really bothering me?” Then ask yourself, “what is the worst thing about that?” This will help you pinpoint exactly why you feel bothered.Think about why you feel like you need to redirect your anger (for example, if you feel powerless to address a difficult work situation, you may take your anger out on someone at home).
Write down the different things that are causing you to feel negatively or stressed.
Try to deal with each stressor or annoyance separately, rather than rolling them together all into one big stressor.Apologize to someone if you have been short with or rude to her through no fault of her own.

You might say something like, “I’m really sorry that I snapped at you about dinner. I am a bit overwhelmed at work and I’m having trouble dealing with the stress, but that’s not your fault. How can I make it up to you?”

;
, Holding onto resentments for things that happened in the past is a common reason for feeling mad at someone. Resentment is not healthy, and letting go of those feelings is the best way to move on.To move on from resentment, try the following:Acknowledge that your feelings of resentment don’t serve a productive purpose.
Realize that feeling resentment cannot actually change the past.
Accept that you cannot control the actions or feelings of other people.
Forgive if you can forgive or try to forget if you feel that you cannot forgive.

, You might feel mad at another person for doing or not doing something that you expect them to do. However, she may have no idea that you expect her to do that thing! If you feel like someone is not meeting your expectations, try voicing those expectations and having a conversation about whether they are reasonable.For example, you may feel mad at a coworker who never contributes to the daily coffee fund but drinks coffee every day. She may not realize that she is expected to pay into the fund or you might find out that she has a sick child and many medical bills. Having a conversation about your expectations instead of letting yourself feel mad can help strengthen your relationship with her.

, One of the best ways to avoid getting mad at someone is to truly understand where she is coming from through understanding. Getting to know someone better and digging deeper into why she may act a certain way can help you feel empathetic towards her. Compassion will usually override feelings of anger or annoyance.

, Particularly if the person you’re trying not to be mad at is a loved one, try to picture your life without that person in it. Think about all of the things that she contributes to your life and allow yourself to feel grateful for all that she does. Keeping a gratitude journal is a great way to make a habit of practicing gratitude., The acronym HALT stands for “Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.” It is a common recommendation in 12-step programs to tell yourself to halt (stop) and evaluate whether you feel any of those things before you lash out at another person.


For example, if your husband gets home late and you feel mad at him, before you express that anger, think about yourself first. Realize if you feel hungry, angry, lonely, or tired and think about whether those factors are influencing your feelings towards your husband. Eat something, relax on the couch for a few minutes, then ask him about why he is late.

"
Differentiate between ways of communicating.,
Emphasize that both parties’ needs are important.,
Use respect when communicating.,
Be clear and specific with requests.,
Express your feelings.,
Seek a solution to the problem.",How to Not Get Mad at Someone Even Though You Really Want To2," There are three primary ways to communicate emotions (particularly anger); they fall into the categories of “passive,” “aggressive,” or “assertive.” Learning to use assertive communication can help you communicate with others in a healthy way.Passive communication involves becoming progressively angry about something without actually dealing with the problem or confronting the situation in any way. Passive behavior can often lead to secret revenge or other negative behaviors (known as passive-aggressive behavior). Aggressive communication involves becoming so angry that you have an outburst that likely seems like an overreaction to the situation from the outside. Aggressive outbursts can also be paired with violence.
Assertive communication is a healthy, respectful way to address and confront the person or situation that is causing you to become angry.

, Part of assertive communication is acknowledging that your needs as well as the needs of the other person (or people) involved are important. This takes the focus off of you and shows that you are appreciative of the needs of others. For example, if you are about to get mad at your husband because he did not pick up dinner on his way home, you could start your conversation by saying, “I know that you have a lot of different responsibilities that weigh on you” (acknowledging his needs). Then you could say, “I also have a lot going on, and when you forget to pick up dinner, it messes up the schedule that I had planned.”

, Using “please” and “thank you” can go a long way towards seeming respectful of another. Treat the other party with respect, acknowledging that he has a side to the story as well. For example, instead of immediately getting mad at your husband for not picking up dinner, you might say, “do you have an alternate plan for dinner?” He may have come up with another idea. Even if he did just forget, asking with curiosity about an alternate plan is kinder than immediately demanding, “where is the dinner you said you would pick up?!” when he walks in the door.

, Remember to think of any actions you would like the other party to take as requests, not demands. This will help you word your request appropriately. It is important that you are specific and that you do your best to stick to the actual facts. For example, you may say, “I know you just got home, but would you mind going back out for a few minutes to pick up dinner so that we can all eat together at home?”

, While you do want to provide factual information, it is okay to include the way that you feel when you are expressing your anger. You can emphasize words like “I feel like” or “it makes me feel,” which may help prevent the other party from becoming defensive. For example, you could say, “I feel very frustrated that you did not pick up dinner because it makes me feel like I have to come up with an alternative solution on my own. I feel pressured to make everything perfect all the time, and this is stressing me out.”

, Ideally, you and the party to whom you are expressing your feelings can collaborate on a solution to the problem that is making you angry. Unfortunately, you cannot control the actions of others, and you may need to seek a solution on your own.For example, you may ask your husband if he has an idea for providing dinner. You may decide to go out to eat. He could volunteer to go back out and pick something up, or he could give you a break by watching your kids or cleaning up the house while you run out to pick up dinner. Alternatively, he could cook dinner. There are many solutions to this problem, but the important part is coming up with one together that works for everyone.

Give yourself a break.,
Take deep breaths.,
Redirect your anger towards productivity.,
Care for yourself.,
Listen to relaxing music.,
Turn on your positive thoughts.",How to Not Get Mad at Someone Even Though You Really Want To3," If you feel like you’re getting mad at someone, give yourself a little break for some time to cool down and regroup. If you regain control of your feelings before you talk to the person you’re on the verge of being mad at, you’re more likely to avoid conflict. , Deep breaths can help you calm down and avoid getting mad at someone. To benefit from the potential relaxation of deep breathing, you need to take deep breaths into your abdomen. Place your hand on your diaphragm (between your belly and chest) and breathe so deeply that you hand moves as your belly begins to expand. Then slowly breathe out.Keep your focus on your breath, breathing in and out 8-10 times or until you feel like you have regained control of your emotions.

, While displacing your anger towards another person can be bad, redirecting it towards an activity such as cleaning, exercising, or tackling long-overdue items on your “to-do” list can be helpful. You can get out some angry energy while you do something productive!

, If you give yourself time to do something nice for yourself,you get plenty of sleepand exercise, .and you maintain a healthy diet, you will feel better. Feeling better often means having better control over your emotions, which leads to more effective (and kinder) communication with others. Additionally, if you are not getting any time for self-care, you may begin to feel resentful to people whom you perceive as preventing you from getting that time.


You should try to sleep 7-8 hours every night to thrive physically and emotionally.Aim for 20-30 minutes of exercise each day. If you cannot exercise daily, try to do it at least 3-4 times per week.
Include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and protein in your diet.Getting healthy fats can also make you feel full longer. Also avoid fat-free and overly processed foods. These often lack adequate nutrition and may leave you feeling dissatisfied. , Unwinding to some of your favorite singers might calm you down and get you in the mood. Music is proven to make you feel a certain way when you hear it and bring back memories. It can calm people who are angry or agitated, even if they’re not aware of the source of that agitation.Classical music and jazz are particularly helpful for calming people down, but you have to find what works for you.

, You can help reduce your anger by trying to focus more clearly on your positive thoughts. Close your eyes, banish every negative thought that comes your way, and think of at least three positive things.The positive thoughts can be positive aspects of the situation you're worrying about, or just thoughts about something else you have to look forward to or something that makes you happy.
Some examples of positive thoughts include:

This will pass.
I am strong enough to handle this.
Challenging situations are opportunities to grow.
I will not feel angry forever; this is a temporary feeling.

Make a list of things that scare you.,
Start with smaller fears.,
Break bigger fears into smaller steps.,
Create a list of daily actions.,
Get help doing a task from someone you trust.,
Take the challenge with a friend or family member.,
Keep a journal to track your actions.",How to Do One Thing That Scares You Every Day1," Create an anxiety diary. Anxiety diaries can be an effective tool for overcoming fears. Grab a notepad and paper, and set aside some time for self-contemplation free from distractions. Relax, let your thoughts wander freely, think of things that scare you, and write them in your pad. You might think of a few things immediately, but if you give yourself enough time, you might come up with things you hadn't expected.For example, you might immediately write down public speaking and introducing yourself to new people. After some deep introspection, you might realize that both are connected to being afraid of looking foolish or of being rejected.
Try to keep your diary with you as much as you can to write down your fear or anxiety as it occurs. As you write down the fear, also record when it happened, and how it made you feel.
Take a few minutes in the evenings to review and reflect on what you have written. Then, identify some small achievable goals to help you face and overcome these fears in the future.
Create a list of healthy coping skills that help you when you are faced with fear, such as listening to music, talking with someone you trust, and meditating.;
, Try not to avoid your fears. If you avoid things, you’ll likely be missing out on important things in life that you want or need to do. For example, you may have to give a certain amount of presentations at work before you're considered for a promotion, but you may have a terrifying fear of speaking in public. You’ll likely come up with several simpler fears that you can attack with easy actions, like being afraid to try new foods. If you start with smaller, more actionable fears, you'll be more likely to commit to doing something that scares you every day.


For instance, if you’re afraid to try eating fish, it’s relatively simple to go to a restaurant and order a grilled salmon salad.
If you are afraid of public speaking. Take a public speaking class. If you're not ready for that step, start small and join a special interest group, such as a small book club with people you don't know. These groups usually are held in small, intimate settings.
If you're afraid of lakes or oceans because you cannot see what is underneath you. Start small and just try going out onto a boat until you are comfortable. When you're able to go further, get onto a raft. Take your time. Don't rush. If it takes a few times to go from one to another, then that is okay. Listen to your own intuitive instincts, but also try to utilize some healthy coping skills to help you work through your fears. Eventually, maybe you can dip a toe in, or maybe a foot.

, Your other fears might be larger and more complex. Break those complex fears up into smaller actionable steps so they’re not so overwhelming.For example, suppose you’re afraid to ride a bike. It might seem like an overwhelming fear at first, but you can solve it using clear steps: ask someone you trust to help you learn, use training wheels, and start riding on grass before pavement.

, Making a plan ahead of time will help you purposefully put yourself in situations out of your comfort zone. Set clear expectations and hold yourself accountable for completing particular daily actions. Organize your plan using specific dates and times and give yourself a clear path to achieving your goals.For example, start planning your week out Sunday night. Write specific actions such as, “Monday: I will call John and try to resolve our disagreement. Tuesday: I will introduce myself to someone new and have a conversation with them. Wednesday: I will go out for lunch and try sushi for the first time. Thursday: I will start my new group workout class. Friday: I will participate in my weekly team meeting and bring up my new product design idea.”

, Reach out to a trusted friend or family member who’s good at a task that you’re afraid to try. For example, if you’re afraid to ride a bike or drive a car, think of someone you know and trust who’s a great bike rider or driver.


Tell them, “Hey, you’re a great driver. I have a license, but haven’t driven in a while and I’ve been afraid to get back on the road on my own. Do you think you have time two or three times a week to show me some pointers?”

, In addition to helping you learn a task that scares you, a buddy can help you stick to your challenge. Make a pact with someone close to you and agree that you'll both do something scary every day. Spend time together once a week making your lists, then have a chat at the end of each day to talk about what you did.


If you or your buddy feel like backing out of a day's action, you could call each other to provide motivation.
If you can't find someone to take the challenge with you, ask a friend or family member for support and to hold you accountable. You'll be more likely to complete your daily challenges if you have someone to pump you up and tell you to stick to your goals.

, Set aside about 20 minutes a day to write about what you did that day that scared you. Write down how you felt before you did the action, what you did, and how you felt afterward.You can look back on your experiences and use them as examples to help you do things that scare you in the future. For example, you might have written, “Today I finally worked up the courage to talk to Sam. I was really nervous at first and could feel my heart racing! It turned out to be easy, though. I don't know why I was scared in the first place!”

You might find that your frustration is extreme, and if that’s the case, seeking therapy or anger management classes might be a valuable option.Are you usually irritable?
Do you normally respond to frustration by blaming or snapping at others?
Do you self-medicate letdowns with alcohol, drugs and excessive eating?
Do you often hurt others’ feelings when you are responding to frustration?
Do you tend to feel misunderstood after a bout of frustration has passed?
Do you often lose your cool in the middle of a hard day of work or school?
When you get disappointed, do you feel as though life is impossible or that you are unworthy?;
, Spend some time thinking or writing about the potential sources of frustration in your life. Be as specific as possible about what triggers your frustration--maybe it's a co-worker or classmate you find frustrating, or even the way that someone says or does something. Try to consider whether or not this source of frustration is something that you want to control and cannot. For example, you cannot control another person's point of view. But, you can control whether or not you engage this person in conversation.


Doing this will help you understand and accept these things in the long-term, making you more capable of handling them with patience.
Alternately, you might find that you can avoid certain frustrations entirely. For example, if you take a slow, traffic heavy route home from work, you could opt for a slightly longer route that allows you to avoid the

, Frustration is not always misplaced, and it may be a reasonable response to a very real and difficult issue or issues in your life. However, frustration can build if you believe that every problem has a clear solution and there's something wrong with you or with your life for not being able to arrive at it. Instead of trying to solve a difficulty once and for all, try to focus on cultivating a helpful attitude toward it.Understand why it exists in your life and be open to facing and learning from it.


Understanding that the source of frustration may not be clear-cut will keep you open to handling your frustration without acting from it. For example, you might think twice before quitting your office job just because the printer keeps jamming.

, Timing is everything, especially when it comes to warding off frustration. It’s often the case that we are faced with something that you’re totally capable of handling—just not right now. Spend time noticing your energetic shifts throughout the day. You might notice, for example, that mornings tend to be a great time to handle serious issues, but in the afternoons you feel too tired to face bills or make big decisions. Avoid frustration by only doing these things when you know you have the energy level to conquer the task.

, Having a number of routines that you can use to make daily life less impacted with in-the-moment decisions. This reduces frustration by eliminating how much newness you must cope with regularly. Especially if your usual sources of frustration are managing daily tasks, running late, or not having enough time in your day, try sticking to a schedule.


Use the things that you must ""show up"" for, like coming into the office or picking up your child from school as anchors. Then, you can plan things like paying bills, buying groceries, and enjoying a morning workout routine around these commitments.
Don't stress yourself out trying to schedule everything. Instead, organize few hour blocks of the day that are normally unstructured to make these times run more smoothly. You will be less frustrated by little inconveniences like traffic or hassle at the bank knowing that you are making efforts to allot time for these duties.

, When you are about to fly off the handle or request or make a change to get things a little more “how you prefer it”, ask yourself if it will matter tomorrow (or next week, or next year). Chances are the situation is something you can let go of and forget about.


You may want to also ask yourself if you care deeply about the frustrating situation. If it is not somehow linked to your deeper values, you may be trying to get your way just for the sake of it. When this is the case, have a little laugh at yourself and let it go.

, In moments of frustration it is not just you who bears the brunt of the negative thoughts and judgments; those around you also risk getting caught in the middle of your mood. If you're in a conversation in a moment of frustration, try slowing down and thinking through your words. Ask yourself if the first thing that comes to mind, for example, ""why are you so incompetent?"", is really a helpful thing to say. Remarks like these only make frustration mount and spread.


Listen closely to what the other person is saying, and try to get a sense for where they are coming from. Take this into account when you answer, choosing to be understanding rather than making a quick judgment.
For example, if you are frustrated that your roommates never wash the dishes, approach them wondering, without judgment, whether or not they are aware of this shared responsibility and whether or not there is something blocking their ability to help. This will make negotiation much more peaceful than accusing them of being lazy slobs (as your frustration may tell you they are).

, If the peace of acceptance does not come easily—and this does take time to cultivate—go ahead and release your frustration in a way that will not harm yourself or others. Yell into your pillow or punch it until you get tired. Sometimes frustration is more effectively dealt with by expressing anger instead of trying to soothe it. So, trust that your frustration will pass by simply letting it out rather than trying to manipulate or intervene on the frustrating situation itself.


Do this when the frustration is ongoing, or there's little you can do to change the frustrating situation. Make sure that you are in a place where others won't be intimidated or frightened by your release.

, Frustration builds and molehills tend to become mountains when we become frustrated at frustration itself. When you feel frustrated, try to simply observe your frustration without judging it as ""bad"" or a feeling you ""shouldn't"" have. Instead of judging, accept these feelings rather than trying to avoid or change them. Exercising acceptance means letting go of your instinctual responses to frustration and learning to accept whatever you experience.Once you accept your feelings of frustration, you have the self-control to know what (if any) course of action to take toward the source of frustration.
If you try to ignore your frustration, it will only make it worse. Then you’re caught in the vicious cycle of the source of frustration becoming more magnified and feeling all the more important. Tell yourself that unleashing your frustration upon yourself and others will not fix anything, but that it can actually make you feel worse. Anger is like an adult tantrum—instead of making solutions it only works to suggest to others that you’re bothered. This won’t do when it is you who is responsible for soothing yourself.

, We often get frustrated when we are trying to meet unrealistic expectations we have of ourselves and others.There is a strong tendency to have a certain vision of how situations should play out, and then to get frustrated when, time and time again, reality does not or cannot match up. Ask yourself if you are expecting too much or have perfectionist tendencies. This is likely the case if your frustration is tied to feeling let down or dissatisfied with outcomes.


Ask yourself if something is “good enough”. Frustration usually dissipates once you make the conscious decision to stop pushing for things. Let the situation run its course rather than trying to control it, remembering that you can only change your responses and not others' behavior.
Then, change your thinking from expectations to reality by focusing on the good that is happening rather than the things you expected to come to pass that have not.
If there is a specific expectation you’re hung up on, like “the person I date should always be more focused on me than on work”, remind yourself that this is your expectation that might not be realistic for everyone to conform to. Then, you can make the decision to either accept the person as she is or act on your frustration and look for another fish in the sea.

, People who are very frustrated tend to swear or speak in highly intense ways. This reflects exaggerated, catastrophic thoughts that don’t quite match up with the reality of the situation.Try replacing these thoughts with more rational ones that can help you contain and manage feelings of frustration.


For instance, if you're tempted to say, ""oh, this is horrible, now everything is ruined, I must be doomed to fail"" counter this thought by telling yourself, ""this is a frustrating and difficult experience that upsets me now but won't matter much later.""
As much as it sometimes feels true, remember that the world is not out to get you—in fact, the frustrating problem may even stems from the fact that the world seems pretty unconcerned with your expectations and ideals. This can be cause for celebration if you realize that, when things go in different directions, you get the opportunity to learn (or even just stretch yourself in unexpected ways)., The funny thing about frustration is that once you zoom out and get some perspective it’s just that…funny! While you are in the process of accepting the situation as is, perhaps noticing that the issue is not as important as it seems in your mind, take a moment to laugh at yourself. Think about how funny it is that just moments ago you were so concerned with something that now seems pretty trivial.

, Because frustration usually causes you to find fault in everything and focus on what isn’t going your way, gratitude can be a great antidote. When you feel yourself get frustrated, refocus to reminding yourself of everything you appreciate about the person or different aspects of the situation you’re in. This is a very potent way of reducing frustration toward others you care about, because they are presumably in your life because of good qualities that you appreciate already.


With less intimate frustrations, like a long line at the grocery store, focus on how close the store is to your house, what a great selection there is, and that you have access to nourishing food in the first place.
To become gracious, vividly imagine the worst consequences of your frustration. If you want to put the grocery store out of business or permanently part ways with the person frustrating you, you will immediately start to think of all the reasons why you don’t really want either of those things to happen. These reasons are precisely those qualities that you are grateful for.

, It’s difficult to get frustrated if you are amused by all of life’s sweet little offerings instead. Because of how quickly frustration passes when we relinquish control, spend time in the interim appreciating nature, eating a great meal, or listening to relaxing music. Use your favorite sources of distraction to boost your mood as you edge your way out of frustration and into appreciation of the moment.

, Instead of breathing from your chest—taking a breath where your shoulders shrug—try breathing from your diaphragm.Imagine that your breath is coming up from your gut and expanding little air pockets all around your waist. Breathing like this with regularity, and especially in times of stress, can reduce frustration by giving you the calm to help you deal with the actual source of frustration.


Taking up yoga, a practice dedicated to deep breathing and non-strenuous exercise, can be a great way to ensure that you are always able to get a good fix of muscle relaxation and serenity.

, A large factor in becoming easily frustrated is having lots of energy in your body that is practically seeking an opportunity to be released. If your frustration is much greater than whatever triggered it, you may want to adopt an exercise routine. Regular exercise is helpful for boosting your mood and for regulating your body’s energy so that you can broach situations appropriately rather than with too much “charge” from all your pent-up fervor for activity.


Try cardiovascular exercise, like running, swimming, or biking, in addition to light weight lifting.

, Visualization is a relaxation technique that involves forming mental images to induce feelings of journeying to a calm, peaceful place.The key to a relaxing visualization is to involve as many of your senses as possible (sight, sound, touch, and smell). To be able to do this, get into a quiet spot where you won’t be disturbed. Your body should also be in a relaxed position, as if you are meditating.


For example, if you are imagining an open meadow, try to feel the grass underneath your feet, smell the lush woods, and hear the sound of birds chirping as they fly from tree to tree.

, This technique has you gently tensing and then relaxing each of your muscle groups. One way to do progressive muscle relaxation is to work your way up your body, tensing and relaxing all of your muscles from your toes and feet to your head and neck. Tense a muscle group for about 5 seconds and then relax those muscles for about 30 seconds. Repeat this pattern until you’ve moved all the way up your body (or down, depending on your preference).


Doing this will make you able to recognize when your muscles are tensed and when they are relaxed. This is an added bonus because you’ll be able to notice times when you are especially tense and take measures to either relax or rearrange your activities accordingly.

, Much of our frustration in modern life comes from the fact that we spend so much time interfacing with machines that are unable to respond empathically to how we’re feeling.If your life has you on the computer constantly, try to take breaks and reduce your usage where possible.


Especially when it comes to socializing, being face to face rather than online can make communication easier and gratitude almost effortless in comparison. Balance your busy life on social media with some good, old-fashioned togetherness.

, Another source of frustration that can get taken for granted is not having enough time to yourself. At the very least, scheduling some alone time will give you a chance to learn and use relaxation techniques. Look at your agenda and try to find a window of time that will allow you to settle in with yourself. A couple hours is ideal. Spend this time pursuing activities that really feed you—things that you don’t get much of a chance to do within the normal work week.


If you have any artistic or creative hobbies, like drawing, sculpting, making music, or cooking, try to spend this time doing these activities. Creative pursuit help you get in touch with yourself more deeply.

Ask yourself what you love doing, and find time to do it. Follow your passions. If you love playing guitar, devote some time after work to doing so each day, or meet locals with whom you can jam.


Perhaps the skills or talents you possess still lay dormant. In this case, try your hand at a new craft or interest. Libraries and community arts and culture organizations often host free classes or clubs which can help you learn something new. Try volunteering at local nonprofits in order to give back. You might like it.
Be daring! Get active and do something that you've always wanted to do, like taking a hip hop dance class, bungee jumping, or taking a trip to an exotic destination.;
, Don’t measure yourself against people who are younger than you. This leads to obsessive thoughts. For instance, you might compare yourself to a younger coworker. If you begin to do this, you should stop and ask yourself why you feel the need to compare yourself. Let go of comparative thoughts by imagining them as a balloon floating away. Alternatively, distract yourself by working on some homework or engaging in a healthy hobby like playing guitar or writing.If you accept yourself and can honestly see your own strengths and weaknesses, you’ll know that nobody has the exact combination that you do. You’re just as unique and important as any other person, no matter their age.

, Being honest with yourself about these changes will make them less painful and give you an opportunity to honestly dialogue with yourself about why they should be worrisome at all.


Ask yourself why you’re afraid of these physical changes. Is the anxiety you’re feeling about growing older caused by your fear of dying? Are you afraid that you’ll become unattractive? Afraid a partner will leave you? Think carefully about your fear in order to work out a plan to tackle it.
Use positive self-talk in order to remind yourself that your body, like all bodies, is changing and will continue to change. There is no shame or negativity in that.

, Being alone is one of the chief fears people develop as they age.But if you don’t want to conform to the standard of marriage and kids just because you’ve hit thirty, you don’t have to, and you shouldn’t be worried or afraid just because you’re living alone. There are no rules for hitting thirty or any other age. Learn to be comfortable with yourself and enjoy alone time.Learn to enjoy being quiet, silent, and contemplative. Enjoy your alone time as a solution to the stress brought on by your busy day.
Read a book or watch a movie at home.
Make a list of all the people in your life you’re thankful to have and write them notes telling them how important they are to you.
Go for a walk or get some exercise.

, Your responsibilities might be piling up as you grow into your thirties. Perhaps you have to run young children to preschool or soccer practice. Maybe you have a busy work schedule that sees you jetting from city to city on corporate business, or constantly answering calls and emails. Whatever the case, ensure you make time to decompress and clear your mind.


Schedule alone time throughout each day. For instance, perhaps you spend the first thirty minutes when you wake up, thirty minutes of your lunch hour, and the last thirty minutes before you sleep in quiet contemplation, or reading a good book. Integrate regular periods of restful alone time into your daily activities.
Practice tuning out the noise. You can find alone time without being literally alone. If your partner or spouse is nearby, enjoying him or herself quietly, you can do the same.Walk more often. Walking is not only a great form of exercise, but also gives you time to yourself. Put on some headphones and some relaxing music if you want. Walking through a forest or a pleasant meadow is ideal, though a walk around a quiet neighborhood is just as good.

, Instead of wearing a “mask” -- a role, act, style, or attitude you believe people want to see -- be open and honest about your true feelings, ideas, and thoughts. Wear clothes you’re comfortable in which match your personality. Don’t try to fit the ideal mold someone else has cast for you.


If you’re still finding who you are, that’s okay, too. Try new things – go on a vacation with some friends to a new place, learn a new skill, or try a new food at a restaurant. Plumb the depths of your innermost being in order to find out what really excites, motivates, and inspires you.
Recognize your own inherent value, and believe that others will see your value as well.
Jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers are still mainstays outside of work. Don’t let your age determine how you dress.

, The media and society glorify youth and tend to portray growing older – even when you’re only just turning thirty – as a negative or upsetting experience. In fact, many people find their quality of life improves after thirty.Don’t buy into the myth perpetuated by the beauty industry, glossy fashion magazines, and Hollywood movies that you need to be between the ages of 18-25 to have an exciting, fulfilling, beautiful life.


As you grow older, you might begin to have more disposable income. Look forward to the opportunities this will afford you.
Sexual satisfaction tends to increase as we age. As you gain confidence in the bedroom and become more comfortable with your own sexuality, you might feel more willing to experiment. If you’re married or in a long-term relationship, the intimacy you have with your partner can deepen your sexual satisfaction.Celebrate the relationships in your life that really matter. Make the most of one-on-one time with friends and/or your partner.
You now have at least thirty years of experience behind you on which to draw. Wisdom comes as we age. Look back on past mistakes and regrets in order to make better decisions tomorrow.

, In fact, uncertainty and ambiguity are a part of life no matter what your age. While this might scare some people, learning to enjoy the possibilities and opportunities life offers is an important aspect of growing in your 30s. Feel excited and thankful for the spontaneity you’re afforded each day.


In situations of uncertainty, recognize that your information is not complete.If you have an opportunity to improve upon or extend that information, wait to do so, but do not wait to make a decision based on the possibility of new information coming in.
For instance, if you’ve been offered a promotion which requires you move to Germany, read a bit about German culture, society, and life. If possible, converse with American expatriates living in Germany. Discuss the offer with your family. After a few days, accept that you’ll never know if living and working in Germany is the right choice unless you go there and experience it. Let the many wonderful possibilities of life in Germany inspire and excite you.
Don’t hesitate in the face of uncertainty. Just because you don’t know it all doesn’t mean you should let that realization paralyze you.

, Standing up to your fear is a choice.Acknowledge that you are afraid of aging. Try to think about what specifically bothers you with the aging process. The possibility of death? The pressure and expectations to marry or have kids that come with age? Identify these problems and realize that they are only as important as you let them be.


Use positive self-talk to remind yourself that even if you don’t meet social expectations and choose not to become a parent or spouse, you are valuable intrinsically. If you have a job you’re proud of, think of some of the things you’re most proud of having accomplished at work.
When you encounter a fear like “I am less sexually attractive than I once was,” let the idea slip away. Envision a balloon lifting off into the sky. Replace fearful thoughts with positive thoughts like “I have many family members and friends who care about me.”

, Some people turning thirty feel they need to wear metaphorical masks to hide their anxiety about growing older.For instance, you might want to continue partying hard long into your thirties just as you did when you were of college age.You might stay out all night going from bar to bar just like you did when you were in your twenties. Instead of still acting like (or actually believing) you’re a superhuman, invulnerable to sleep and alcohol, accept that your body is changing and can’t bounce back as easily as it once did from neglect, bad diet, or exhaustion.


Wearing a mask such as this is harmful for both you and those around you. The mask will make it difficult for you to accept and come to terms with the fact that you’re aging, and it makes people around you worry when they see your struggles with the aging process. Listen to the concerns of those around you in order to identify if you’re wearing such a mask.

, Each will be effective with different individuals.


Go for a walk or bike ride, hit the gym, take a warm bath, or read a book in bed.
Other tried-and-true de-stressing methods like yoga, deep breathing exercises, and mediation are worth a shot as well.Other methods like regular volunteering at a homeless shelter or soup kitchen could also reduce stress.Try a variety of relaxation and stress relief methods in order to discover which works best for you.

, By the time you get home, you might be tired and not feel like figuring out what to eat and cook. Planning your meals will help save you time thinking about what to cook and scrounging around for ingredients.


Think about your favorite dishes when planning meals. Try to incorporate items you have on hand, and go shopping for items you want but do not have already. Stock up on staples like rice, beans, and flour. Buying only what you need to adhere to your meal plan will save you time and money at the market.
Use a meal plan on a weekly or monthly basis to ensure you have some meals more-or-less ready to eat on short notice.
Mix it up. Don’t eat the same meals week after week or you will get bored. Try something new and different. Involve your family or partner in the meal-making process as well.
Include occasions where you plan to eat out or have snacks between meals in your meal plan. Factor leftovers into your meal plan if you have any so as not to waste food. Being realistic will reduce food waste in your household.

, In order to avoid these unhealthy developments, avoid processed foods and foods loaded with sugar, salt, and fat. A healthy diet consists of mostly fruits and vegetables, fiber, and whole grains with a limited protein intake. Such a diet will reduce your risk of obesity and leave you feeling full longer than a diet which is heavy in salt, sugar, and fat.


For instance, a meal of steamed spinach or broccoli along with brown rice and kidney beans is a good, healthy meal. Instant or microwave dinners, or pasta mixes with lots of salt (like ramen or mac and cheese) are not good choices if you’re aiming for a healthy diet.
An easy way to reduce sugar is to cut out consumption of soda and sugary drinks.
Eat in moderation. Don’t eat when you are full or not hungry. Try to consume smaller portions if you want to lose weight. Avoid snacking throughout the day, or substitute healthy snacks like carrots and celery for unhealthy snacks like cookies.
Eat slowly. Eating quickly is a primary cause of overeating. Chew each bite at least eight times before swallowing.
Drink at least 8 glasses of water each day.
Women in their thirties generally need about 1,800 calories per day, while men in their thirties need about 2,000 calories per day. If you are more active and exercise regularly, you will require slightly more calories.
Don’t try to diet in the traditional sense, eating healthy portions and foods on a temporary basis until you hit your target weight. Instead, change your diet so that you can sustain your health in the long run., As you age, though, it becomes progressively more difficult to go without enough (or any) sleep. Aim to get between seven to eight hours of sleep each night.If you cannot find time to sleep enough, try to adjust your schedule so that you have a regular bedtime.


Get quality sleep by avoiding food or drink for the three hours prior to going to bed.
Ensure your bed is comfortable and your pillows soft.

, Exercise has a wide variety of benefits: it reduces blood pressure, lowers risk for diabetes, maintains your immune system, keeps bones strong, improves breathing, builds muscle, and reduces fat (among other reasons).In order to gain the many benefits of exercise, aim to get at least thirty minutes of exercise each day.Include both cardio and aerobic workouts. For instance, you might run or bike for thirty minutes, then lift weights or do squats for another 15 or twenty minutes for a vigorous 45-50 minute workout.


Strength training with weights is important in your thirties because as your metabolism slows, you become more likely to lose muscle and gain fat.Aim to do 15-20 reps on a bench press and at least 30 push-ups during your workout sessions. Lift weights appropriate for your weight class.
Check with your doctor before engaging in a new workout routine. Get a physical to ensure you don’t have any heart conditions or other medical issues which may make exercise dangerous for you.

, While having a retirement account is important, you’ll need to set up multiple accounts for other potential future expenses like a car, vacations, your kid’s college, and a house. Check your bank’s online interface to see if you can create sub-savings account. If not, talk to a financial manager about opening such accounts in a way to maximize growth.


To save for a house, you will need at least 5% of the total cost of the home you’re interested in buying. For instance, if the home you want to buy costs $100,000, you’ll need to have at least $5,000 in the bank as a down payment.To save for your child’s college, you should aim to have about $40,000 saved by the time they are 18. In other words, if your child is a newborn, you should try to save about $2,200 per year. Determine what percentage to save.

, You’ll be tempted to save more for your kid’s college fund than for your own retirement. This is understandable since your child will probably attend college long before you retire. However, you must continue to place priority on your retirement fund. Even though you have a good thirty or forty years before retirement, it’s not too soon to put yourself on a solid financial footing for the future. If you don’t your child might have to support you in your old age. Stay focused on your own long-term financial health before building your child’s college fund or another savings account.Try to put $100 aside each month for your retirement. If you do this for forty years, you’ll have saved $48,000 -- plus interest!

, All manner of insurance -- life, home, disability, and health -- should be in place for you and your loved ones.Identifying the best insurance plan is difficult due to the often dizzying number of options available, and many people tend to think that any plan will do as well as another. Don’t settle for just any type or level of insurance, though. Check your plan carefully and ask lots of questions to ensure it will be adequate when you need coverage.


For instance, with your health insurance, ask if it will cover strokes, heart attacks, and cancers.
Find out if your home insurance coverage includes deductibles for fire, hurricane (depending on where you live), flood, and other types of accidents.
Ensure your disability insurance covers long-term disabilities. Around one in four people are disabled before retirement, and many people only obtain life insurance without considering the possibility of encountering a situation in which they cannot work.

, Understand the financial background of your partner. What are your respective salaries? If your salaries are both adequate to support each of you separately, you probably don’t need a joint account. However, if one of you requires supplemental income, or takes an extended amount of time off work to care for a child, a joint account could be a useful option to consider. Then, think about each of your spending habits. Are either of you spendthrifts? Or do you and your partner conscientiously scrimp and save?


If you decide to create a joint account, draw up a written agreement about how and when to spend the money in the account. Having a written guide as to how this money is used will reduce likelihood of future money-related problems.
You might not get an honest answer out of your partner about their spending habits. This is not to imply your partner is deliberately lying, but many people overestimate the amount they save and underestimate how much they spend.

, While marriage and the arrival of your firstborn are monumental events, they do no justify sacrificing your long-term financial health for the immediate pleasure you’d get from the expenditure.


Don’t assume that the expenditure is justified simply because you assume you will make more money in the future. This assumption may be well-founded, but it also might not be. It’s better to take the conservative route and assume you won’t increase your earning potential significantly in the future.
Don’t buy a new car unless you really need it. A car should generally last you for at least ten years .
Ensure you have enough in the bank for emergencies. Generally, a financial cushion should cover you for up to six months of living expenses.

Let go of embarrassment.,
Overcome false beliefs and irrational fears.,
Try overcoming one fear gradually.,
Reward yourself for breaking out of your comfort zone.",How to Do One Thing That Scares You Every Day2," Comfort zones typically involve being afraid of embarrassment or looking foolish when trying something new. Remind yourself that no one was born an expert at anything. Even those who have mastered a skill or discipline were once novices who had to take a risk.Tell yourself, “Even well-seasoned Tour de France cyclers take countless tumbles, but they get right back on their bikes and continue on. If they were determined enough to compete in and win races, I can learn how to ride 50 feet without stopping.”

, Overcoming our fears often involves letting go of irrational assumptions that we’ve built over a long period of time. Try to distinguish between fears that have logical foundations and those that are based on irrational beliefs.


For example, if you’re afraid of dogs because you believe every dog will bite you, you might want to take steps to break out of your comfort zone.

, Doing one thing that scares you every day doesn’t necessarily mean you have to do something different every day. If you have a more complex fear that you’ve broken up into actionable goals, you can do little things every day to overcome that fear.For example, if you’re terrified of dogs, start by looking at pictures and videos of people playing with dogs for 15 minutes per day for a week. Ask a nearby friend or family member who owns a dog to hang out with you for a half hour per day for the next few weeks. Have them keep the dog on a leash in the same room as you. Sit or stand closer and closer to the dog until, eventually, you’re comfortable enough to hold your hand out and let it sniff you.

, Come up with a small incentive that will help motivate you to complete a scary task every day. Avoid giving yourself the reward if you didn't complete that day's action. On days you can't give yourself the treat, don't beat yourself up about not doing what you set out to do. Remember to be proud of baby steps you took to conquering your fear.


Think of small pleasures that make you happy. Your daily reward could be a candy bar or ice cream, bubble bath, glass of wine, giving yourself permission to binge watch your favorite show,

Focus on self improvement.,
Be realistic about your abilities.,
Seek therapeutic guidance.,
Don't give up your comfort zone completely.",How to Do One Thing That Scares You Every Day3," Do things that not only scare you, but will help you become the person you want to be. It’s fine to do scary things like watching a horror movie every day, but it’s much more meaningful to do things that involve improving yourself.For instance, if you want to be a better public speaker but have always been afraid in front of crowds, you could try taking a class at a local community college. You could also try something a more informal, like joining a local Toastmasters club., Biting off more than you can chew can leave you feeling discouraged and unmotivated. Set yourself up for success by pursuing realistic goals that match your abilities.If you’ve never climbed a mountain before, you wouldn’t want to try climbing Mount Everest. Try an indoor rock wall first or find a nearby beginner’s hiking trail.

, Sometimes, even with all of your efforts, it is difficult to cope with and overcome fears. These are the times you could benefit from the additional support and guidance of a qualified therapist.

There are some therapists that can combine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with Exposure Therapy. In essence, your therapist can guide you through a CBT session while you are in that fear state of mind. These forms of therapy are very effective for people who have difficulty overcoming their fears on their own. (This is usually through Computerized CBT, which provides a virtual environment that puts clients right into what they are fearful of). Typically individuals that need this level of treatment will have more severe anxiety responses, and sometimes panic attacks associated with their fears.

, Try to incorporate doing things that scare you into your daily routine instead of giving your routine up completely. It’s great to challenge yourself and get out of your comfort zone, but it’s physically and emotionally draining to be uncomfortable at all times.Find the right balance for you by contemplating the meaning behind the mantra “do one thing that scares you every day.” It doesn’t mean live dangerously and impulsively. Rather, it’s about taking risks that challenge you to become the best possible version of yourself.

Seek the comfort of your friends and family.,
Let time pass.,
Talk to the person.,
Be compassionate.,
Recognize that you are not in control of your adversary.,
Understand that forgiveness is up to you.",How to Overcome Deep Seated Desires for Revenge," Revenge comes from feeling diminished by your aggressor and subsequently, you feel ashamed that you allowed this to happen. Such feelings may cause you to feel angry, leading to your desire to seek revenge.Emotions are felt physically, so recognizing the physical signs of each emotion can help you get them under control. For example, when you are angry, your blood pressure rises and heat radiates from your shoulders through the back of your head.Your emotions can drive your decision making by creating a deeper connection to each decision. When you are feeling angry, you might make more rash decisions than if you felt happy.;
, Putting your feelings into words can help you come to terms with them and clarify your thoughts. Writing down your feelings can help reduce the intensity of your feelings, and help lessen your deep-seated desire for revenge.If you do not like to write you feelings down on paper, try talking to someone about your emotions. Find a trusted friend or family member and tell them exactly what is going on: how you feel, who was involved, the reasons for wanting revenge, how you think revenge will make you feel, etc...

, Go to a quiet room, sit on the floor, close your eyes and focus on taking slow, deep breaths. While you are meditating, try to empty your mind of all negative thoughts and concentrate on positive things in your life.


Mediation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress and may be a great coping mechanism for your desires for revenge. It can slow your thoughts and help you feel calm and centered.

, Your emotions may become overwhelming and difficult to handle. At times like these, try repeating positive affirmations to yourself to remind you that even though you aren’t in control of the situation, you are in control of your response.These are some mantras you could try repeating to yourself:


“Things could be worse.”
“I will take charge of my response to this person’s actions.”
“I can make it through this.”
“This is only temporary.”

, Anger and hatred often accompany the desire for revenge. Try finding a healthy outlet for these negative emotions. Try doing an activity that brings you joy or listening to music that matches your feelings. You could also try cooking or writing a poem.


Exercise is a wonderful outlet to negative emotions. Exercise releases hormones that boost your mood and releases stress associated with controlling your desire for revenge., Instead of stooping to your adversary’s level, take the high road and do something that makes you the bigger and more accomplished person. For example, if your enemy mocked you for doing poorly on a test, instead of seeking revenge on this action, study extra hard for the next test to get the best grade. Your enemy will be unable to continue his mockery of you. By taking the high road, you make yourself feel good by accomplishing something great, and you stop the actions of your adversary., Think about all the possible ways, from mild to nasty, to take revenge on your foe. You could ignore someone entirely, block her on social networks, undermine her efforts, send her mean texts anonymously, publicly embarrass her, etc… Reflect on each revenge option, and predict how you will feel afterwards. When you have thought about what you could do, rip up the piece of paper and feel a release.

, We as humans are social creatures, and need interaction and support from others.When you are having an especially difficult time overcoming your desire for revenge, seek the company of others. You do not have to talk about your feelings or desires. Go for coffee or a movie and try to engage with your friends. This will help take your mind off your desires and make you feel happy, instead of stressed or angry.

, Over time, you will process your emotions, and the desire for revenge will become less intense. As time passes, you will lose interest in seeking revenge, and focus on what is important in life.As time passes, things are put into perspective. You will be able to more clearly see what is important in your life, and whether taking revenge is worth the effort and possible consequences.

, If it is possible, open a dialogue with your aggressor to try to learn his point of view. Ask him questions like, “Is there something specific I did to offend you?” or, “What can I do to make things right between us?"" Do not be condescending or argumentative; instead, be understanding and empathetic.It may be difficult to face your adversary, so you could try texting or emailing. However, written words may have a different tone than your true intent, and may be taken the wrong way.

, Show compassion towards your adversary directly and indirectly. She might be going through a difficult time in her life or lack the skills to deal with certain situations appropriately. Recognize that your adversary is human and has feelings.


Try to open your heart to your enemy and put yourself in her shoes to get an idea how she might be feeling., When you choose to forgive someone, recognize that this does not mean your adversary forgives you. You have no control over the actions and feelings of your adversary. Yet, this does not control your decision to forgive.Give up the feeling of control by surrendering yourself and trusting that things will work out. Surrender the grasp you think you have on your adversary to help yourself forgive him.

, Forgiveness and reconciliation differ greatly because reconciliation requires both parties to work together, whereas forgiveness only requires yourself. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean letting her off the hook, it simply means that you accept what happened and you are willing to move on.To “forgive and forget” may not be the best strategy. It is good to remember what your adversary has done to you so that you can learn from the experience and recognize it if it happens again."

Encourage physical activity.,
Teach them to take a break when they start getting worked up.,
Set limits to their anger.,
Teach the child to laugh.",How to Manage Anger in Children1," If your child is dealing with pent-up emotions, one way to let it out is through physical activity. This activity should allow your child to blow off some steam, but in a way that doesn’t hurt others. You may find once they are able to let it out, their behavior improves.


Going outside and playing soccer or basketball may help them feel better. Even punching a pillow or pulling or pounding on clay or play-dough can help. Dancing or going for a walk with you may also fend off those feelings of hostility.;
, Sometimes, all we need is a compassionate ear to stop us from reaching our breaking points. Tell your child to come to you when he feels himself getting upset and tell you what is going on. You may be able to calm him down before he reaches his limit.


When your child reaches out to you, go to a quiet spot and have a seat. Tell them to take deep breaths and talk about what is going on and why it is so upsetting. Having this alone time with you builds trust and lets them know that they always have you to confide in. This feeling of security may be enough to stop an impending explosion., Your child may turn to destruction when they get upset. You will need to let them know, however, that this type of behavior isn’t acceptable. Set limits with them that allow them to express their feelings without taking it to an inappropriate level.


If they yell and begin to hit or break things, you could say, “I understand you are upset. However, I will not allow you to hit me or hurt others. You can be angry, but you can’t be destructive.” This gives them boundaries that allow them to express their emotions, but also makes them practice some self-restraint., Laughter really is the best medicine for just about anything, even anger. Teach your child to look at the humor in the situation. Learning to laugh instead of yell is a skill that can help them their entire life.


For instance, if your child is upset because they spilled a drink down the front of them, teach them to look at how funny it actually is. You may even have to spill the drink on yourself for them to see the humor in it, but eventually, they’ll likely see that even situations that seem dire can actually have a bright side."

Evaluate the way you express anger.,
Realize that stress can trigger passive aggression.,
Beware a denial of anger.,
Look out for passive-aggressive behaviors.,
Consider the reactions of others.",How to Know When You Are Acting Passive Aggressive1," There is a passive-aggressive conflict style that commonly develops in a person with passive-aggressive tendencies. Being able to distinguish the signs of passive aggression in others can help you identify it in yourself as well.;
, Stage one of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is the development of a belief that direct expressions of anger are perilous and should be avoided. Instead of expressing anger clearly when the feelings begin, the passive-aggressive person solves his anger issues by masking the anger with passive-aggressive behaviors., Stage two of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is a stressful situation that triggers irrational thoughts based on the early life experiences that discouraged direct expression of anger., Stage three of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle occurs when the passive-aggressive individual denies his or her anger. This denial can lead to projecting negative feelings onto other people, which results in the building of resentment towards others., Stage four of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is to actually engage in passive-aggressive behavior. This includes (but is not limited to): denying feelings of anger, withdrawing, sulking, pouting, procrastinating, carrying out tasks inefficiently or unacceptably, and exacting hidden revenge. , Stage five of the passive-aggressive conflict cycle is the reactions of others. Most people react negatively to passive-aggressive behavior and, often, this is what the aggressor is hoping for. This reaction then only acts as reinforcement for the behavior and the cycle will begin again.

All of these signs are your body's way of telling you you're feeling angry.Some of the other physical signs of anger you may notice include clenching your jaws or grinding your teeth, headache, stomach ache, increased and rapid heart rate, sweating (especially your palms), feeling hot in the neck/face, shaking or trembling, and dizziness.
Keep in mind that not everyone will show anger in the same way. You may feel some of these things, but you might also feel different things when you get angry.;
, Some people, when they get mad, literally ""see red,"" meaning they notice more redness in their environment.

Other people get a sort of tunnel vision, meaning they have trouble seeing right. Other people feel a tenseness in their bodies, or they may feel like something heavy is on their chest. All of these things could help you realize when you're angry., Some kids don't know how to talk about their anger. When that happens, they just bottle it up inside. That's not good because it can make you feel worse, both in your heart and your body. You may notice that you get headaches, for example, or have a stomachache., It is important to acknowledge how you are feeling and to put a label on it. When you're angry, the first person you need to tell is yourself. That is, you need to be able to admit to yourself what you're feeling. So you could say to yourself (out loud or in your head), ""I'm feeling mad.""It can also help to figure out how angry you are. Think of it like a stoplight. Green is not angry at all. Yellow is getting angry, and red is angry. How angry are you?

, Next, you need to figure out why you are upset. What has happened to make you so mad? You might need to take a few minutes to think about what has you upset, though sometimes you might know immediately.For example, you may be mad because your sister stole your favorite book, or you may be upset because your mom told you can't do something you want to do.

, Often, you may feel angry about a situation, and you don't know why. Sometimes, anger can come from feeling afraid or hurt. Instead of dealing with that emotion, which can be hard, you turn to anger, which may feel easier at the time.Try to see if you can find an underlying feeling. Are you really feeling mad at your best friend who said something mean, or are you feeling hurt?

, The best thing to do when you're mad is to talk about it with the person you're made at or an adult. Taking with someone about how you are feeling can help to make you feel better and to try to find a solution to the problem. The key is to not say mean things or lash out. Instead, try to say why you're mad.For example, if your sister borrows something without asking, you may want to lash out at her. Instead, say what you're feeling, like ""It upsets me when you take things without asking. I like knowing where things are, and it frustrates me if I can't find something. Will you please ask the next time?""
Try not to blame the other person. For example, DON'T say, ""You're always taking my things. You're a bad sister.""
To a parent, you could say, ""I feel frustrated that our trip to the zoo got cancelled.""

, Anger can make you want to throw things, hit people, and say mean things. But, doing those things won't make you feel any better, and it will make the people you're with feel worse. It's best to try to discuss your feelings calmly.Before you say something when you're angry, ask yourself, ""Is it nice? Do I really want to say it? What will happen if I say it?""
Never use violence to resolve your anger. Throwing things or trying to hit people doesn't solve anything.
Remember that it is important to avoid acting on your anger and stay rational.

, You might have heard people say ""Count to 10 when you get angry."" What they really mean is you need to take a moment to breathe and calm down. Counting to 10 gives you the moment you need to breathe. When you feel yourself getting angry, try counting slowly up to 10 in your head, breathing deeply in and out as you do.You don't actually have to count to 10. You can also just take a moment to breathe. Try breathing like Darth Vader does. You just want to take deep, heavy breaths. Take a big, slow breath in through your nose, and then slowly blow it out through your mouth. Keep doing it until you feel yourself calming down., Another way to calm down is to imagine yourself somewhere you like or would like to be. Just close your eyes, and pretend like you're there. Try to use all your senses. What do you see? Smell? Hear? Feel? Taste? Just pretending to be somewhere else can help you calm down.For example, you could pretend to be in your favorite movie, or you could imagine yourself in the last place your family went on vacation.

, Sometimes, when something is making you really mad, you just need to walk away from the problem. Of course, you shouldn't run away from your parents or teachers, but if you feel yourself getting mad at your brother or sister, for example, sometimes it's just best to leave the room instead of getting in a fight.If you are mad at your parents, you can say, ""I'm getting really mad, and I need to be alone for a minute.""

, Sometimes, a good way to let your anger out is to actually just spend some time yelling. However, you don't want to yell at anyone. It's best to use this one in the privacy of your bedroom. Just let the person know you need to go be angry for a minute.Go into your room, and try yelling ""Raw!"" or even just screaming into your pillow.

, Finding an activity that will take your focus away from what is making you angry is a good strategy. Do something that you enjoy, such as reading a book, calling up a friend, going to see a movie, playing a game, or going for a walk.

Exercise is an especially good way to distract yourself because the physical activity will help to get rid of the cortisol in your system. Go outside and do something, such as riding your bike, playing basketball with a friend, or even just walking or running around.

Watch how you respond to an angry situation.,
Think before you react to any situation, including their meltdowns.,
Praise good behavior.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Manage Anger in Children2," Children often mirror the same behaviors they see in their own parents. If you blow up, stomp, hit, or react inappropriately to a situation that angers or frustrates you, your child will likely do the same. Look at your child the next time he gets upset and determine if you react in the same way.


After you have an episode, write down how you behaved. Pay attention to the way your child reacts the next time they are upset and consult your list to see if they behave the same way you did. If so, you likely know why your child acts the way they do., If you yell at a child who is angry, you’re only going to make the situation worse. Instead, take a deep breath and think about what may really get them to calm down. The way you behave to their anger will teach them how to respond.


Ask yourself how you can calm your child down while still displaying the values and behaviors that you hold dear and want to instill. Screaming at or spanking your child probably isn’t what you want. So, take a moment and try to keep your cool while dealing with your child. This peaceful and calm behavior may eventually cause them to change theirs and act more like you., All too often parents tend to focus on what the child does wrong, instead of paying attention to what they do right. By only pointing out their flaws, your child may not know when they react appropriately. Pointing this out shows them this is the behavior you are looking for.


If you notice that your child doesn’t yell when they are upset, tell them how proud you are that they were able to control their emotions. Over time, they will crave this praise and continue to express behavior that you find pleasing., No one ever said parenting was easy. This is especially the case when you have an angry child. In order to be the best parent you can be, you need to find ways that recharge you and allow you to take care of yourself.


Exercise, meditation, yoga, or even getting a break once a week from your child may be all it takes for you to be able to relax and find your inner peace. If you find it hard to find family or friends to watch your child so that you can take this time to yourself, consider hiring a babysitter. The money you spend will be well worth it to both you and your child."
"
Determine if your child has a psychological issue.,
Rule out any physical pain.,
Figure out if something is occurring that you don’t know about.,
Help your child identify their feelings.",How to Manage Anger in Children3," A variety of psychological problems in children reveal themselves through anger. Speaking with your pediatrician or therapist may help you understand if this is why your child seems to experience bouts of anger that aren’t appropriate to you. If you get a diagnosis, medication or therapy may be the answer.


ADHD, depression, anxiety, autism, and sensory processing issues may cause a child to feel a higher level of anger than those without them do. Learning disorders and trauma and neglect are also potential causes of hostility in children., A natural response to pain in anyone, child or adult, is anger. If your child is in pain and you aren’t aware of it, they may become angry sooner or at a more intense level than what you think is necessary. They may not understand the pain or why they are in pain, or it may confuse or scare them. They act out in temper tantrums or fits of rage as a way to manage it.


Chronic headaches, allergies, stomach issues, problematic teeth, or even juvenile arthritis are all common causes of pain in children. Ask them if something hurts, and if they say yes or aren’t at an age where they are able to communicate it well, take them to a doctor for testing. Once the pain subsides, you may see an improvement in their behavior., Children often respond in anger when they feel hurt, threatened, or insecure. Take a good, hard look at what is happening in your child’s life and you may find the answer. You can ask your child if anything is occurring that is upsetting them, but you may have to do some investigating on your own.


Ask your child’s teacher if they are being bullied at school. If so, this may be the reason for the anger. Additionally, consult with your child’s sports coach, the parents of their friends, or other adults in their lives that may know something your child is experiencing that you don’t know about., Sometimes, your child may feel angry, but isn’t exactly sure why. Talking to them about it and helping them to pinpoint why they are upset can help them to fully understand the situation, and then perhaps not become so angered by it. Pull them away from the situation, get down to their eye level, and then ask questions to determine the cause of the rage.


For example, if your child’s friend has to stop playing and go home and your child responds with an outburst, say, “It would be great if your friend could stay here longer, but they can’t. They are needed at home. They can come back another day.”
Or, you could simply ask them if that’s the problem. Both techniques validate your child’s feelings and if you are able to redirect them by telling them what they want will likely happen again in the future, it may buffer their disappointment and anger."

Use a behavior journal.,
Identify incidents in which you acted passive-aggressively.,
Record information about what happened.,
Pinpoint discrepancies between your thoughts and behaviors.,
Avoid temporary compliance.,
Do not be intentionally inefficient.,
Try not to let problems escalate.,
Stay away from hidden but conscious revenge.,
Find patterns in your behavior.,
Accept your emotions.",How to Know When You Are Acting Passive Aggressive2," Journaling is a useful means of identifying, evaluating, and correcting your own behavior. Your journal can help you determine triggers for your behavior and allows you a safe place to be honest about your own reactions and how you would like to act differently in the future., Passive aggression can take on different forms, but the basic idea is that you were upset or angry about something and did not address your emotions directly. Instead, you may have engaged in “revenge” in the form of one of the following: Withdrawing from others
Pouting
Complying temporarily
Being intentionally inefficient
Letting a problem escalate
Taking hidden but conscious revenge
For example, if you are acting passive-aggressively towards a coworker, you may do some of the following: ruin work materials that she needs (hidden revenge), not tell her that you know her client is unhappy (letting a problem escalate), completing your portion of a cooperative project late on purpose (intentional inefficiency), or telling her you will help her on a project but not following through (temporary compliance).

, It is important to identify and eliminate faulty patterns of thought that were developed early in life . To eliminate these thought processes, first identify when and how they are occurring. Look back and try to recall specific details about your behavior. It can be helpful to view the circumstances as a third-party observer would, being as objective as possible. Examine the circumstances and motivations that bring out your passive aggressive actions. Consider the following questions:


How did your family members handle anger when you were a child?
Who triggered your emotions or behavior?
How did you feel during the incident?
When and where did the incident happen?
What outside factors may have influenced your behavior or feelings?
How did the situation play out?
What could you do differently in the future to avoid and/or resolve the conflict?

, Generally, passive-aggressive behaviormanifests as deliberate contradictions between what you say and do (passive) and how you feel (angry/aggressive). The following are common manifestations of passive-aggressive behavior:


offering public support but indirectly resisting, procrastinating or undermining the successful completion of social and occupational tasks
agreeing to do something and not following through or pretending to forget
giving someone the silent treatment but not letting the person know why
pleasing people in public but demeaning them behind their backs
lacking the assertiveness to express your feelings and desires but still expecting others to know what they are
overlaying positive comments with pointed sarcasm or negative body language
complaining of being misunderstood and unappreciated by others
being sullen and argumentative without offering constructive ideas
blaming others for everything while avoiding responsibility
unreasonably criticizing and scorning authority to your peers
responding to unwelcome authority with covert, dishonest actions
repressing emotions in fear of conflict, failure or disappointment
expressing envy and resentment toward those apparently more fortunate
voicing exaggerated and persistent complaints of personal misfortune
alternating between hostile defiance and contrition
predicting negative outcomes before even starting the work

, A passive-aggressive person engages in a specific type of passive aggression called temporary compliance when he agrees to a task and is then intentionally late in completing it.He may be late because of procrastinating, arriving late to meetings or check-ins, or misplacing important documents. People often engage in temporary compliance when they feel underappreciated but don’t know how to appropriately express these feelings., With intentional inefficiency, a person values the opportunity to be hostile more than he values his own competence.An example of this would be an employee who continues to produce the same amount of work with the quality of the work significantly decreasing.People who are confronted about their inefficiency often play the role of a victim. This kind of behavior can be self-destructive as well as inconvenient to others.

, Letting a problem escalate is a passive aggressive behavior whereby an individual refuses to confront or address a problem that he is aware of. Instead, he lets the problem build until it becomes a bigger problem., Hidden but conscious revenge means an individual is secretly undermining the individual who has upset them. This can take place in the form of gossip or other undetected acts of sabotage such as spreading rumors or getting other people to pick your “side.”, When you think about your actions (or read through your journal), try to find patterns in your behavior. Were there specific elements that contributed to your passive-aggressive response in multiple situations? Many people who struggle with anger or passive-aggression experience “triggers,” which can activate a disproportionately emotional response from them. Triggers are usually tied to past emotions or memories (even if you aren’t consciously aware of them). Some common triggers include: Feeling out of control of your own life, another person’s actions, your environment, or your life situation
Believing that someone is trying to manipulate you
Getting mad at yourself for making a mistake

, Denying what you truly feel is part of the problem with passive aggressive tendencies. You don't want others to know that you are angry, hurt, or resentful, so you act as if you aren't. Your feelings only intensify and become more irrational because you haven't provided yourself a healthier outlet for them. Therefore, it is important to allow yourself to feel and acknowledge your emotions so that you can deal with them in a healthier way.

Give yourself time to change.,
Learn about assertive communication.,
Emphasize that both parties’ needs are important.,
Use respect when communicating.,
Be clear and specific with requests.,
Express your feelings.,
Seek a solution to the problem.,
Listen and observe.,
Accept that conflicts are okay.",How to Know When You Are Acting Passive Aggressive3," Changing a behavior you have built up overtime takes a lot of time and persistence. Remember that change is a process that is not always linear. Don’t be afraid to go back to the beginning and re-assess your behavior. At the same time, don’t be hard on yourself if you find yourself unsuccessful on your first attempt. The more you practice and work through your passive aggressive tendencies, the more likely you are to successfully change your behavior. If you find yourself getting off track in your attempts to change passive-aggressive behavior, take a moment to pause and reflect on what is happening. Ask yourself:

, If you want to stop acting passive aggressive, you may be wondering what your other options are. A healthier form of communication is known as “assertive” communication. Assertive communication is a healthy, respectful way to address and confront the person or situation that is causing you to become angry. It involves speaking your mind when you are angry but maintaining respect for the other people around you.

, Part of assertive communication is acknowledging that your needs as well as the needs of the other person (or people) involved are important. This takes the focus off of you and shows that you are appreciative of the needs of others. , Using “please” and “thank you” can go a long way towards seeming respectful of another. Treat the other party with respect, acknowledging that they have a side to the story as well. , Remember to think of any actions you would like the other party to take as requests, not demands. This will help you word your request appropriately. It is important that you are specific and that you do your best to stick to the actual facts. , While you do want to provide factual information, it is okay to include the way that you feel when you are expressing your anger. You can emphasize words like “I feel like” or “it makes me feel,” which may help prevent the other party from becoming defensive. , Ideally, you and the party to whom you are expressing your feelings can collaborate on a solution to the problem that is making you angry. Unfortunately, you cannot control the actions of others, and you may need to seek a solution on your own.For example, you and your neighbor may brainstorm ways to keep the dog in check, such as keeping him on a leash or in a fence. If, however, the neighbor refuses to cooperate, you might have to come up with a solution on your own, such as fencing in your own yard.

, Communication is just as much about listening and reading unspoken messages as it is about speaking openly and directly. Consider what the other person is saying or not saying in response to your own words or actions. Remember that conversations are 2-sided and that you are speaking with another human who also has thoughts and feelings.

, Disagreements are not uncommon. Some of the confrontations you encounter may not be conflicts but rather misunderstandings. You usually are not in any danger if you can defuse your anger and make your discussions constructive and positive. It's possible to agreeably disagree and be able to work out compromises that bring ""win-win"" results to both parties involved. In this way, you are taking control instead of allowing passive aggressive behavior to send issues out of control.

Often people get angry or start drama simply because they are bored. Boredom is a personal problem. Do something about it.
""Idle hands are the devil's playground."" If you are doing nothing, you are a lot more vulnerable to dwelling on angry thoughts and acting on them.
Sublimate (get energy from) your anger such as by practicing a musical instrument, or singing inspiring, happy -- not angry -- songs. Build or make something.;
, If you're not much of a cook, at least consider the barbecue, where it's easy to put together some tasty meat with sweetcorn and potatoes wrapped in foil. So, learn to cook fancy or happy, fun foods. Cook out.

, Some examples include:


Get a hobby like writing, gardening or collecting coins, etc.
Watch a comedy. Laughter can help to quell anger.
Help people rather than fuming at them. You can even help people through the online environment, such as by editing a wiki, sharing experiences with others on a forum or doing a useful project with others around the world.
If you don't feel you have enough drama in your life, watch some inspiring movies.

, Choose a pet such as a cat, dog or a horse if you have the room. While goldfish may be serene, they are not much into active fun with you as a surrogate parent.


Pets can help take your mind off whatever fight you were thinking of starting with someone.
Pets, cats especially, are very peaceful and can teach us humans a thing or two about how to be peaceful.

Enya, or similar Celtic or New Age style music is great. Piano elevator music is good too.
Or, if you are Christian or of another faith, listen to calm worship music.

, It's probably fun.

, Don't overwork yourself, or you will be more likely to get angry at everything and everyone.

, When you notice this happening, it is a good idea to exercise somehow, to release the building tension. Try a walk, a bit of gardening or your favorite workout.


Often, something as simple as house cleaning can help when you are feeling like this. It helps to burn off the extra energy dump that you get when you are angry.
Getting out of the house or the office can sometimes help. By removing yourself from the place where you felt the anger building, it can give you the space needed to gain a calmer perspective.

, Sometimes people start drama because they feel their lives are too boring. Either learn to be okay with the boredom of ordinary things of life, or rise above it.

, The journal doesn't have feelings, and you can say whatever you want to at it, but people do have feelings. By writing it down and getting it out of your system in this quieter way, you are at least giving your anger a channel but you're also working through the anger and thinking about how to get through it.

, Ask a friend or a parent to tell you when you seem to be doing it again, starting drama. When you know that there is someone else to help pull you up, there is more riding on maintaining your pride and trying your hardest not to give in to the anger.

, You can't eat your words -- nor will they warm you when you are cold and lonely.

,, ""It's a case of mind over matter -- and that doesn't matter anymore.""

, Begin to do things for those in need, then your night should turn to day. Visiting people in prison, widows and orphans is a perfect outlet of anger.


You can choose your own destiny/destination. Success and happiness are not destinations. No, they're a never ending process and are usually from making progress, a little at a time. You can have any good thing that you don't use against others.
You are in control of your own future. Whatever worthwhile work is at hand, do it with all your heart, as if it is for good and for loved ones.

, You have heard, ""Be kind to your friends, but consider and be kind to your enemy, and to those that say all manner of things against you wrongly and spitefully."" Volunteer at a hospital, nursing home or at a school. Do tutoring or teacher assistant work for a feeling of accomplishment helping someone who needs your help. Through volunteering, you can find a way to help yourself while helping others."

Don't be an enabler.",How to Identify Passive‐Aggressive Behavior," People who are passive-aggressive enjoy making other people get angry and lose their cool, but the passive-aggressive person will stay calm and act as though he or she is not doing anything wrong. If you feel as though someone is trying to upset you and the person seems friendly and calm, then you may be dealing with someone who is passive-aggressive.For example, perhaps you have noticed that your roommate has been using your makeup even after you have asked her not to. It might be passive-aggression if you confront her about it and your roommate plays dumb. She might pretend that she did not know it bothered you and she may even seem take pleasure in upsetting you.;
, Someone who is passive-aggressive might give back-handed compliments. Back-handed compliments are compliments that are actually insults in disguise. The recipient of a back-handed compliment may not even recognize the insult, but the person delivering it will feel satisfaction from delivering the back-handed compliment.For example, a passive-aggressive person might compliment a rival co-worker who has just been promoted by saying something like, “Congratulations! It must feel pretty good to finally get promoted after trying for so many years.” This compliment suggests that the person who has been promoted is less successful because it took so long to get the promotion.

, Passive-aggressive people often make commitments, but then later go back on their commitment as a form of payback. Someone who is passive-aggressive may often break promises or commitments as a way to frustrate other people.For example, a friend might agree to help you with a chore at your house, but then text you that morning to say she isn't feeling well and can't help. While this might be understandable if it’s a one-time thing, a friend who consistently has excuses for why she can't help may be using passive-aggression.

, Passive-aggressive behavior is marked by a refusal to talk about things that are upsetting. A passive-aggressive person claims to be ok, but is actually fuming on the inside.For example, your passive-aggressive friend might insist, ""I'm not upset!"" when she clearly is, give you the silent treatment during a disagreement, or avoid responding to your calls or messages.On the other hand, some people have trouble discussing their feelings but aren't necessarily passive-aggressive. When a person is truly passive-aggressive, they display sullenness or withdrawal as well as other traits of passive aggression, especially the tendency to lash out or sabotage the relationship later.

, In a new relationship, even an extremely passive-aggressive person might control their unhealthy tendencies toward you at first. But you can get clues to whether this person is a healthy communicator or passive-aggressive by observing how he or she treats others, especially past partners or authority figures like parents or bosses.Does this person talk badly about others but never confront them about what is bothering her? Does she sabotage her relationships with others? Does she string people on and then disappoint them? Does she withhold affection, attention, or use her children as a bargaining tool (for example, in her relationship with an ex-husband or with her parents)? These are features of passive-aggressive personalities.
Remember that even if this friend or partner does not treat you badly, once she becomes more comfortable in the relationship she is more likely to treat you the same way she treats others.

, While many people use sarcasm as a form of humor, someone who is constantly sarcastic might be masking the fact that he has trouble articulating how he actually feels.Remember, passive-aggressive behavior is marked by someone who has trouble saying what he feelings in the moment, so he holds in his frustration or anger and then acts on it later. Frustration and anger might be expressed by little moments of sarcasm, particularly when it is hurtful or biting humor., All of the features of passive-aggressive behavior, including sarcasm, broken promises, giving excuses, avoidance, and a martyr complex, are behaviors that even healthy people might display every now and then.


The problem is when these behaviors form a pattern or interfere with relationships because of their regularity., Tell the person, in direct but not harsh or dramatic terms, how their behavior has affected you. Try to focus on yourself and your feelings rather than the other person. For example, instead of saying, ""You sabotaged our project at work,"" try saying, ""I noticed that our project wasn't the best, and I want us to be sure it is better next time.""When you talk to someone and tell him that his behavior is hurting you, it is likely that he will deny everything (remember, passive-aggressive people don't like to talk about their feelings-- they certainly don't like to be called out about them!). Stick to facts and give examples, but be prepared for resistance and denial., A passive-aggressive person might harbor feelings of low self-worth or issues from his or her childhood that makes it difficult to communicate feelings effectively.Talking together can help you understand the possible roots of the passive-aggressive behavior, if the person is willing to open up a bit and you are willing to suspend judgment and be understanding. Ask questions about his or her childhood, youth, early relationships (especially ones that might have ended badly), or other life scenarios where speaking his or her mind might have backfired. Remember, passive-aggressive behavior is often a coping strategy used by people who have had negative experiences that left them feeling helpless or powerless., Depending on how a person responds when confronted about their passive-aggressive behavior, you might realize that there is a good chance of salvaging the relationship, or that this person is rigid in his or her ways and unlikely to change.Many times, avoidance is the only strategy that can use to avoid being a victim of passive-aggressiveness. But if the other person recognizes the problem and is willing to work on it, there are many ways to improve your relationship by working on your communication strategies.

, Every party in a relationship needs confidence in order to communicate more effectively without resorting to passive-aggressive behavior.



Confidence in the relationship itself: In order to feel secure to communicate your true feelings when you are hurt, offended, or angered, you have to feel confidence that whatever you do or say, you will be accepted and loved. Building confidence in your relationship is a process that takes time, and is accomplished by being consistently reliable and there for each other no matter what.Confidence in his or herself: In order for a person to speak his mind, he has to feel that he has worth and that his ideas and feelings are worth listening to. The passive-aggressive partner, in particular, needs to work on building his confidence level to make this or any other relationship successful. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for tips on how to build self confidence.

, This step is crucial for both people in a relationship marked by passive aggression. Many times people who are passive-aggressive do not recognize and rightly identify their own feelings as they feel them, then later reflect on scenarios and realize they were uncomfortable, hurt, etc.


Learn how anger, sadness, discomfort, or other feelings register in your own physical body. When you experience an emotional response, take an inventory of your body: does your heart race, do your palms sweat, does your chest feel tight? Do you experience difficulty thinking clearly? Do you have trouble forming words? Later, think back on the situation and try to identify how you were feeling. Understanding how you felt physically in the moment and attaching those feelings to emotional responses will help you name your feelings in the moment next time., If a relationship has already suffered damage because of past behaviors like passive aggression, the old spoken or unspoken rules for your relationship clearly were not working. It is important to openly communicate new guidelines for behavior so that everyone knows what the expectations are.


Be respectful. Keep mature, sensible ground rules for disagreements, including no slamming doors, no name-calling, no sarcasm, no insults or threats, or whatever else signifies respect to you.Give each other space. Recognize that some people need a cooling off period after a disagreement before they can discuss the disagreement rationally and come to mutually satisfying solutions.
Speak your mind. It is important to not be ""passive"" and avoid discussing how you feel. At the same time, it can be hard for someone with passive-aggressive tendencies to say what he is feeling. Instead, come up with strategies to ensure that each party can say what they feel and what they need without worrying about negative consequences. One strategy is to let each person write down how they feel. This can take off some of the pressure of the heat of the moment.

, It is common for people to gravitate toward passive-aggressive friends or romantic partners because of some psychological desire to help ""fix"" the person or because the person's pathological behavior feels familiar and safe (for example, if you had passive-aggressive parents growing up, you might seek passive-aggressive partners or friends).You might be contributing to passive-aggressive treatment from a partner or friend if you cover for him or her, making excuses for bad behavior or broken commitments, and ""rescuing"" him or her from poor choices.You might also be enabling the behavior by being a silent victim, not pointing out the behavior and letting him or her get away with mistreating you. This teaches your partner that you will not challenge bad behavior.You might also be encouraging passive aggression if you punish your partner or friend for speaking their mind. Do you get sulky or angry if your friend says they don't want to hang out? That type of behavior might lead to someone making excuses or breaking commitments for fear of angering you. Similarly, if you refuse to engage in discussions about feelings, your partner is less likely to open up to you and more likely to harbor resentment.

Recognize that anger management can be difficult for autistic people.,
Offer your help.,
Respect their boundaries.,
Ask the autistic person what upset them.,
Listen well to understand.,
Help them calm down.,
Offer them choices.,
Speak comfortingly, in a calm tone of voice.,
Offer to help them fix it.,
Recognize your limits.,
Expect them to need some quiet time afterwards.",How to Help an Angry Autistic Person," Many autistic people have trouble recognizing and handling their feelings. The world is a difficult place for them, and it takes strength and patience to handle the routine challenges they face. This makes anger management harder for many autistic people than for non-autistics.;
, Sometimes autistic people would like you to comfort them; other times they prefer to be alone. Ask whether they would like you to stay and talk to them, and respect the answer they give you.


If they are too frustrated or overwhelmed to speak well, help them find AAC or offer to talk it through once they are calmer. You can also ask them yes/no questions so they can give thumbs up or thumbs down.
If they want to be alone, let them know where to find you if they want you. They may only want to be alone for a minute or two, so make it clear you'll still be available.

, Sometimes people forget that autistic people have boundaries too, or that their boundaries may be different. When in doubt, ask first, and always respect the answer they give you. This is key to de-escalating the situation and showing you care about their feelings.


Do not touch them without clear permission. Due to sensory issues, some autistic people may be startled or upset by touch. Ask ""Do you want a hug?"" or ""May I put my arm around you?"" first. If they decline, it simply means they can't handle it now. (They still love you.)

, Are they frustrated about something? Did you or someone else upset them? There are many things that could cause their anger, from the obvious (e.g. a bully at work) to the subtle (e.g. a fly buzzing around the room).

, Even if the cause of their anger seems silly or strange to you, it's important that they know you care about their feelings. Show them that you take their problems seriously by validating their feelings. Here are some examples of validating statements:


""You look really stressed.""
""That sounds upsetting.""
""I see.""
""That would make me angry too.""
""You seem frustrated/mad/disappointed/etc.""
""So you're upset because... (summarize as best as you can)?""

, Once you have evaluated the cause, try to empower them to calm down with their favorite music, their favorite stim toy, their favorite blanket, or whatever comfort item they want.  There are lots of things that you could do. If you know how they prefer to calm down, do everything you can to help set the scene for that.


Some people have a calming down corner or hate box for this purpose.
Offer to help them use calming techniques. If they are a child or teen, teach them how to handle their anger.

, This helps because they feel more in control, and it reminds them that you care about what they want. Here are some examples of choices you can offer:


""Would you like to sit down?"" (""No? Okay, we'll stand."")
""Which stim toy would you like?""
""Would you like me to get you a drink?"" ""We have water, chocolate milk, and soda. Which one do you want?""
""Would it help if we did some relaxation exercises together?""
""Do you want a hug?""

, Sometimes, acceptance and reassurance is what they need most. Let them know that it's okay to be angry, and you aren't judging them for it.


If they wish for you to stay, then do so, and possibly say comforting words like, ""It's all right, we can resolve it."" Avoid minimizing statements like, ""Aw, c'mon, it's not a big deal! Get over it!"" as that will make light of something that is seriously upsetting to them.

, If they want solutions, try to help them come up with their own ideas. Avoid giving unsolicited advice, because it may feel like you're criticizing them for not thinking of different solutions. Instead, present them as options, such as ""Would it help if we _______?"" or ""What do you think could make it better?"" Let them direct the flow of the conversation. If you can develop an action plan together, this will help them feel calmer.


If they say no, that's okay. Maybe they just need to vent or be alone. They'll come to you if they need you.
If this process upsets them, ask if they would like to take a break from brainstorming and do something relaxing.

, Sometimes you might not know how to help them when they're angry, or you might be too stressed to be helpful. You are not responsible for their feelings. It's okay to remove yourself from the situation or say ""I need to take a break"" and come back once you are calmer. You can also call a caregiver or loved one who might know how to handle the situation better.


If they are self-injuring, see if you can redirect it or soften it. (For example, place a pillow between their head and the table, or have them head-butt the couch cushions instead of the wall.) Avoid forcibly grabbing them, because they may panic and lash out at you.
If you live in the United States, do not call the police for help. They may escalate the situation and traumatize or kill the autistic person., This may be doing something relaxing with you, or being alone. It may take a while for them to calm down and feel better. Patience is the key to being an autistic person's friend. Always be prepared for fluctuating ideas and rhythms. Offer your support, and let them do what they need to do.

If you break things, attack people or otherwise get aggressive, this is one of the main warning signs of anger control issues. You will want to seek treatment with a counselor before you hurt yourself or others.Assess whether you often find yourself in arguments with friends, family or acquaintances. Although arguments can be common in relationships, those that escalate quickly and happen very frequently can be signs of an anger control problem.
Go back through your track record with the law. Look into whether you have had frequent problems with the law or driving rage that led to traffic tickets.;
, Not all anger is expressed openly. If you are incited to anger that you hold in, you may have benefit from anger management treatment.


Take note of how you respond to both the more obvious anger-eliciting situations, such as if someone is very rude to you, as well as more every day activities, such as watching television, commuting, driving or working in general.

, Anger is a powerful and highly visceral emotion, often leaving a trace on your body. Take note of how your body feels and pay attention to particular signs of anger.


There are several bodily signs of anger. These include grinding of the teeth, clenching of the fists, headache or stomach ache, an increased heart rate, feeling hot or dizzy, redness of the face, having sweaty palms, or clenching of the fists or general tensing of your body. , People with anger control issues can have trouble concentrating once they feel anger. They may be unable to compromise, feel empathy or accept that other people's views are different from their own.Some people find that they channel this obsession with an angry feeling with sarcasm, pacing and raising their voices. You may find that you lose your sense of humor quickly when anger starts to rise.

, One sign that you may benefit from anger management treatment is if your anger is having a negative impact on others or your relationships with them.Do others end up hurt physically or emotionally after you have an episode of anger? Do you find yourself losing social connections because of your anger? Do you find yourself regretting the way you treated others as a result of your angry outbursts? If so, then the costs of your anger are steep and you may benefit from anger management.Because of their hostility, individuals with anger issues tend to have fewer friends. Social support is an important factor that can help protect from stress and illness., Frequent anger can make you feel bad, and be bad for you.If you find yourself having frequent headaches or other bodily distress and think this may be caused by your anger, you may benefit from anger management.


Keep in mind that some of the negative consequences of anger on your body cannot be felt, but the costs are still real. For example, frequently experiencing anger increases one's risk of heart disease, particularly among men. , Anger causes individuals to lash out and sometimes at objects, by damaging or destroying them. If you find yourself hitting, breaking, or damaging objects, you may benefit from anger management. , Angry people are cynical of others.Cynicism can involve a self-righteous attitude whereby an individual thinks that the things that make her angry are not things she would ever do herself.


For example, if a driver was holding up traffic because he did not realize the light had turned green, she might think, ""only an idiot would do that"" when in reality it is fairly easy to get distracted at a red light. If you think anger is causing you to view the world in a negative way, you may benefit from anger management treatment.

, Individuals with anger issues tend to consume more alcohol and other drugs than individuals without anger issues. Over-consumption of substances can be bad for health and can lead to social and other emotional problems., Ask yourself whether your anger is making you feel bad, either through the consequences of your behavior, or the way it is making you think about the world around you, or both.


If feelings of anger and the situations your anger gets you into is taking a toll on your subjective well-being, it may be time to seek out anger management., There are many different approaches to anger management and many different ways to get treatment for anger issues.


There is no need to restrict yourself to only one approach; if you try one approach and you are not satisfied with the outcome, after you're sure you've given it an honest attempt, try moving on to the next treatment option or try combining multiple techniques.

, Some treatments emphasize changing patterns of thinking or provide techniques to become and remain calm.


One approach focuses on relaxation. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, imagining relaxing imagery, or slow exercises such as yoga; all of these techniques can help to quell anger. Relaxation techniques may be the best fit for you if you enjoy reducing stress primarily through your body. Another approach is called cognitive re-structuring, which just means to change the way that you think. This approach emphasizes the use of logic and avoidance of certain words such as ""never"" or ""always"" to overcome the thoughts that cause or contribute to anger. This approach may be the best fit for you if you often find yourself in your head exacerbating your anger with certain thoughts or ways of thinking., Some treatments emphasize direct, actionable change as a way to reduce actual elicit of anger. These can be used in isolation or in combination with techniques that focus on changing ways of thinking.


One method emphasizes the use of problem solving. Sometimes frequent anger is not necessarily an overreaction to events but reflects an adaptive response to try to overcome real and important problems that have been difficult to surmount. Taking a problem-focused approach may be your best option if you feel this is true of your situation and your relationship with anger. Sometimes it may be best to change your environment. In some cases, there are factors in your environment that contribute to excessive anger and one effective way to manage anger can be to work to change your environment in some way. For example, if your job has many triggers that make you angry, considering applying for a new job that you think would make you happier or less angry. This may be best for you if you have identified a specific environmental factor, just as your job, that is greatly contributing to your anger.

, There are blogs and websites dedicated to helping people accept and overcome anger management problems. This may be a good resource if you are having trouble admitting your problem to others.

, Ask your family doctor for a recommendation to a psychologist or counselor. When you call the counselor or psychologist's office, you may ask for their recommendation on who is most appropriate to see to help you work through your anger management.


For another way to find in-person treatment options, search the internet for “anger management treatment” and your city name or visit http://locator.apa.org/ to find a psychologist near you. , These may contain worksheets that can help you more concretely identify anger elicitors and help you to determine the best treatment approach for you.


For example, a worksheet may help you to determine that you are often in your head and that specific thoughts are contributing to your anger, which might lead you to focus on seeking a cognitive re-structuring approach.

, You'll not only release your anger in a healthy and positive way,but you'll get a great workout."

Consult a doctor who specializes in integrative medicine.,
Ask your doctor and pharmacist to look for any possible drug interactions before you take herbal supplements.,
Consider getting an appointment with an herbalist.,
Start a stress relief routine at the same time as you start taking herbs.",How to Use Herbs for Stress Management1," Using herbs for stress is not likely to be effective if you don't treat the underlying cause of the symptoms. Integrative medicine supports the use of non-traditional treatments, like herbs and acupuncture, along with conventional medicine and behavioral therapy.


You may also look for a doctor who is also trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Chinese medicine often focuses on treating the internal organs to improve outward symptoms and limiting the intake of foods that could increase your symptoms.;
, Although herbs are natural, they can also have potentially harmful interactions with your current medications. It is especially important that you get knowledgeable opinions on potential toxic effects if you are on diabetes, heart or blood thinning medication.

, Although herbal supplements are available in pharmacies and natural food stores, their quality and content is not highly regulated. An herbalist can recommend certain supplements that are known to be high quality.


Most herbal supplements are not just the named herb in a capsule form. Most are combinations of different herbs in a formula that is designed to treat a problem. There are a large number of anti-stress herbal supplements on the market, so seek professional help in choosing a supplement that caters to your stress response.

, Herbs will only provide minimal short-term relief if you do not attempt to treat the causes of your stress. The following are good options, which you can try to fit into your day in small or large quantities:


Try simple meditation. Find a quiet space at home or work. Sit cross legged, breathe deeply and try to think of nothing. Train your mind to quiet down by picturing a relaxing landscape, such as a beach or the countryside. You can also repeat a positive mantra for 5 to 10 minutes.
Start taking yoga. Relaxation yoga can be done in a classroom setting or with a DVD or Internet clip at home. The combination of difficult postures with deep breathing distracts the mind from stressors, while the body releases helpful endorphins. Try different kinds of yoga to see what works best for you.
Discuss cognitive behavioral therapy with a doctor or psychologist. This psychotherapeutic approach to depression, anxiety and addiction uses computer programs, visualization, biofeedback and other methods to help change maladaptive behaviors over time.

Know what worry is.,
Separate what is and is not reality.,
Ask yourself if your thoughts are productive.,
Write down the things you worry about from the past, present and future.",How to Eliminate Worry1," You can't solve a problem if you don't know what it is, so the first thing to do is learn what worry feels like to you.


Write down when you think you are worrying. It may help to start with writing down how you feel and then what is happening around you and the thoughts you are having. Notice how your body is feeling - are your muscles tense or maybe your stomach aches. You can then go back and analyze what led you to feeling the way you did.
Ask people around you to help you identify when you're worrying. Sometimes when people worry, they ask a multitude of questions attempting to feel as though they know what is to come. Usually, people who worry will talk about it and their friends and family will know they are worrying. Having them point it out will help you learn about how you worry.;
, Worrying lies in the unknown. It makes sense because the unknown can be frightening. There are a lot of what ifs wrapped up in the future. The problem with what ifs is that they may never become problems and you'll end up worrying for nothing. This is why worrying is unproductive. It’s important when identifying worry to know if you are concerned about something that is actually happening or something that COULD happen.


Write down what you're worrying about.Circle what is actually happening and cross out what is not happening but could happen. Focus on only what is happening because that's all you can deal with right now.
It is ok to plan and prepare for the future, but once you have done so, accept that you have done all you can do for now.

, When thinking about situations, it can be easy to get off course and start thinking about what could happen. When you’re in a stressful situation, it can be difficult to know if you are on the right path of dealing with it because of your worrying. Asking yourself if what you’re thinking can help you get out of the situation. If it doesn’t, you know you are worrying.


An example of this is dealing with a car that has broken down. You need to get to work, but have no idea how you're going to get there with no car. You immediately start to think about how if you don't get to work, you're going to lose your job. You then think about how you won't have money to pay your rent, and you may lose your apartment. As you can see, you can quickly unravel. However, if you focus on the situation at hand, you won't have to deal with losing your job or apartment. That can be quite a relief since you really don't know if those things are going to happen.
You love your children so much. You don't ever want anything to happen to them, so you take every precaution necessary to ensure they do not get sick. You stay up at night thinking about all of the ways they could have gotten hurt that day. Focusing on them being healthy, safe, and happy will allow you to spend quality time with them that they will benefit from, so bringing yourself back to the present will help you do that and end the downward spiral of worrying.

, Some people worry about the past and how it has affected them. Other people worry about what they do now and how it will affect their future. There are even people who worry about all of them, so their past, present and future. Write down your worries to give you a sense of catharsis and relief in the moment. Use a journal to write down what you worry about each day. You may choose to do this at the end of the day or just jot a worry down every time you have one.
Use your smartphone to type in each one of your worries. You can use the memo app or an app for journaling.

Exercise before a stressful event.",How to Use Stress Beneficially," Between 70 to 80 beats per minute is the average pulse rate for adults. If your pulse rate is higher than 80 beats per minute, this may help you to determine if you are stressed. Take a moment to count your pulse to start assessing your stress level.You can find your pulse by placing your index finger and middle finger on your wrist. Then, look at a clock or set a timer for one minute and count your heartbeats.;
, On average, adults take 12 to 16 breaths per minute. If you are taking more than 16 breaths per minute, then you may be stressed. Set a timer for one minute and count your breaths.Just breath normally as you count your breaths. Another option is to have someone else count your breaths while you take your pulse. This may provide a more accurate respiration rate.

, Stress can also manifest as other bodily symptoms. Consider the other types of physical sensations you are feeling that may indicate that you are stressed.For example, does your stomach feel like it is in knots? Do you have a headache? Do you feel stiffness in your neck or other parts of your body? Do your shoulders feel tense?These types of physical sensations can also help you to tell if you are stressed.

, You may already know that you are stressed and have some sense of how stressed you are. Another way to gauge your stress is to score it on a scale of 1 to 10. Take a minute to think about what you have been dealing with in the past week or month and assign a score to how stressed you have been.


For example, you might decide that based on how you feel and what you have been dealing with recently, your stress level is at an 8. This is a high stress level, so you would need to do something right away to bring it down.
Try to keep your stress level in the 1 to 4 score range. If your stress is in the high range, 7 or above, then you need to reduce it right away.

, Not all stress is bad. In small and moderate doses, stress can help you to perform better and even enhance your immune functioning. Small amounts of stress can also improve heart functioning and buffer infection.Consider what you are stressed about and how much stress you are feeling. Keep in mind that no matter what the situation is, if you scored your stress level as high, then you will need to reduce it. Some situations where a mild to moderate amount of stress might be helpful include:


before or during a test or presentation
when attempting to meet a deadline
before a job interview
before a first date
while studying for an exam or writing a paper

, If your stress levels are high or if you just feel uncomfortable due to stress, then you will need to do something to reduce your stress. Try to include a stress reduction technique in your daily routine to reduce stress to a mild or moderate level. Some good stress reduction techniques include:



Deep Breathing. Taking deep, slow breaths is a quick and easy way to relax and get stress under control.Place one hand on your stomach and another on your chest and inhale slowly through your nose. You should feel your abdomen expand as you do so. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth and feel your abdomen deflate. Repeat this process for about 10 minutes.

Meditation. Meditation can relax you, reduce stress and other negative emotions, and help you to find positive ways to manage the stress that you have.Learning to meditate takes some practice and patience, but you can teach yourself or take a class to learn this skill.

Yoga. Practicing yoga is a good stress reduction technique and it can offer some benefits for your physical health as well.Try taking a yoga class once or twice per week.

, Having the mindset that stress can be a good thing may help to reduce an intense stress response.If you go into a situation with the mindset that you can do well under stress, chances are you will be less negatively impacted by stress and actually benefit from experiencing stress.


People who like to work under pressure practice this principle. Having the pressure of a deadline or expectation can help fuel helpful stress to get the project done.
Consider imposing a deadline for your work, even if no deadline exists. Or, if you have something due in a long time, make progress deadlines, just to make sure you’re working on it steadily.

, A little stress can be helpful, while ongoing stress is damaging to your health and well-being. For example, having a moderate amount of stress before an exam can help you to perform better and recall more information in a short amount of time.Over time, your brain may learn to respond to similar stressors in the same way.You can create situations that are moderately stressful if you need to learn and remember information. For instance, you can work under a close deadline, sit with slight discomfort, or create a challenging to-do list for the day. If you’re studying for an exam, cramming can help you remember immediate information effectively. But remember, you won’t remember it long-term., Moderate and short-lived stress can help you with alertness, performance, and memory.Think about board games you play that have a timer; you try to write down all of your answers before the timer goes off, which creates stress. This pressure can help you remember more items and help you come up with more answers.


Try setting a timer for yourself when you are studying or working on a project. Set a goal to accomplish before the timer goes off. For example, you might set a timer for five minutes and set a goal to write at least one page before the timer goes off.
Stress can also help with memory function. You may be able to access memories that you had no idea you remembered when under moderate or low-level stress. For example, you might be able to recall more of the vocabulary words you studied if you challenge yourself to write them down while a timer is going.

, The stress response functions to help you quickly react when something potentially threatening or dangerous occurs.For example, if you walk near the edge of a cliff, it’s likely your body will begin to experience stress. This response helps you realize that there is a potential danger and that you should be careful. While it may appear obvious, it’s important to acknowledge these responses and be grateful that they are innate, as they likely save many lives of children and adults.


Sometimes people also call this response intuition. If you get a “weird feeling” about a situation and feel like you should avoid it, chances are that the indication comes from a stress response.
A stress response can also alert you to danger and heighten your senses.For example, if you’re in the middle of a conversation and suddenly hear a car horn, you likely jump out of the way to avoid danger. Your stress response helps send chemical signals to alert you to harm, and you rapidly avoid the situation. This response is often triggered by loud noises, sudden movements, or situations that suddenly turn ominous.

, Being exposed to moderate stress as a child can help you to increase resilience against stress in adulthood. Minor stressful events in childhood can help decrease anxiety and increase cognition in adulthood. This is possible because young exposure changes levels of stress hormones in the brain. Young exposure to moderate stress can even prevent against adult bodily inflammation, such as heart disease.For new parents, it can be difficult to separate from your child when he or she is crying and upset that you are leaving. However, these small stressors can be the buffer against higher stress in adulthood. When you’re worried about your child’s well-being, it’s important to remember that a moderate amount of stress is okay.
Don’t try and stress your child on purpose, and don’t try to shield your child from all stress. When your child does encounter stress, help him or her to cope with stress by spending time together or preparing for future stressful situations (like talking about going to the dentist or getting a shot). Talk about what causes your child stress, and ask what may be causing it and what you can do about it., If you don’t perceive stress as affecting your health, you may experience greater longevity in your life. In studies comparing stress, responders who indicated high levels of stress yet little health impact tended to live longer than those who reported high levels of stress and large health impacts.If you find yourself thinking about how stressful your life is and how it’s affecting your health, make some health changes. If you’re overweight, start dieting and exercising; find activities you enjoy and go do them! Don’t allow your thoughts on health to be blamed on stress.

, You may feel like your stress largely originates from your career, your role as a parent or spouse, your busy schedule, or in relation to volunteer positions you hold. Some of these sources of stress may be benefitting you, while others may be harming you. Determine what types of stress help you to function and what types of stress are harming you.For example, maybe you find that your thrive when you have a deadline at work or that you are more productive if you have a lot of housework accomplish in a short amount of time. On the other hand, you may find that your commute home from work or problems in your relationship are causing you negative stress.
Embrace the positive forms of stress in your life and work to eliminate the negative stressors. For example, you might plan one busy housework day per week because you know that you will get more done that way than if you do a little bit each day. However, you might need to find ways to minimize the stress of your commute, such as by listening to books on tape or taking a break halfway through.

, If you perceive stress as catastrophic, you’re much less likely to perceive a stressful situation healthfully than someone who has a positive attitude.If you believe that you can endure the rough patch, it’s likely that you’ll get through it with more ease. Remind yourself that you have what it takes to get through difficult times.


If you find yourself stuck in negative thoughts, acknowledge the negativity, and begin thinking more positive thoughts. You can replace the thoughts with things you are grateful for instead. For instance, if you are caught up in feeling upset that your car needs repair and the repairs are expensive, tell yourself that you are lucky to have a car and to have access to repairs. Remind yourself that it will work out well, even if it means you lose some money.

, Stress may benefit your relationships with family and friends by giving you more opportunities to confide in them and ask for their support. By reaching out when you have something stressful going on, you can invite your friends and family into your life in a more intimate way. Having friends and family to lean on during a stressful period also means that you’re more likely to handle the stress better.If you have a lack of social support in your life, reach out. Get on good terms with your family and go out and make some friends.
One great way to make friends is through starting a new hobby. If you’re interested in quilt making, cake decorating, running, boxing, building, or programming, there’s likely a group of people near you that share those interests.

, Stress can make your health more vulnerable as well. If you experience a major life event, such as a divorce, losing a job, or moving to a new city, it can increase your chances of illness and death. However, one study showed that people having experienced a major stressful event that engaged in helping other people seemed to eliminate this chance of death. The study suggests that helping and giving to others greatly reduces mortality related to stress.Start volunteering at an afterschool club for children, or at your local animal shelter. Giving back makes you feel good and is good for you!Keep in mind that have a high level of stress only increases your risk of illness and death. It does not mean that you are definitely going to get sick and die.

, Moving in response to stress may also help you to respond to it in a more beneficial way. When you start to feel stress, you may notice that you begin to fidget, walk or pace, or feel the need to stand up. It’s common to move as a result of experiencing stress, and the body often responds to stress through movement, which helps it cope in the moment.Let your body move in the way it wants to in response to stress. You may feel the urge to go for a walk or a run, or to leave the house or your workplace. If you feel the need to move, move.

, Exercising before a stressful event can boost immune function, which may make it easier for you to handle the stress. By incorporating regular exercise, you may be better equipped to respond to stress and benefit from it rather than experiencing the negative effects of stress. Studies indicate that exercise before vaccinations or surgery increase immune function and can improve outcomes.Physical activity after a stressful event can also help moderate the effects of stress.People who are active respond to stress better than those who are inactive.If you want to exercise but don’t know where to start, begin with a walk around your neighborhood or with your dog. You can also turn on some music and dance!

Close your eyes and focus on your breathing.,
Focus on how you feel right at that moment and allow yourself to feel peace.,
Stand up slowly.",How to Eliminate Worry5," Studies report that meditation can relieve anxiety in the brain. This is because meditation has a calming effect on the brain. Since worry is rooted in anxiety, getting your nerves under control can help you worry less or not at all.

If you can't cross your legs, sit in any way that is comfortable for you.
You can lie down, but be sure not to get too comfortable or you may fall asleep.

, Taking the time to recharge your batteries will help you be better prepared in times of crisis. Listen to soft, relaxing music. Turn off the computer, TV and phone. Learn to meditate. Meditation helps clear the constant ""chatter"" in your head.

, It is helpful to find a doctor who specializes in that area who can prescribe you the right kinds of treatments.

Take on the other fifty percent of your worries, that you can't settle right away.,
Write your plans for progress.",How to Deal With Worry," Take a deep breath, and exhale it very slowly for as long as you can stretch it out. When you can't wait any longer, breathe in deeply, slowly and steadily. Repeat. It helps to stop tight, shallow breathing and sighing. Do this exercise a couple times and your heartbeat should slow down, and you may yawn! Before doing anything else, let yourself become calm so that you can forget about minor worries, or sit down and decide what to do (instead of worrying). If its worth the worry, then its worth doing something about it, soon you'll know how...


Exercise can help to relieve your worries, as it gets your heart rate up -- it, also, redirects your focus. Listen to music as you run or do fast walking around the block, ride your bike or lift weights. Don't overexercise, or you could hurt yourself, but activity can take your mind off of things for an hour.





;
, Meditation is a method used commonly by many cultures to almost clear your mind, especially of worries. Sit with your legs crossed in a comfortable place, put your hands loosely on your knees and close your eyes. It is soothing to accomplish relaxation, as it helps to remove stress. Read How to Meditate for more information.


Practice mindfulness. Think about something relaxing. Think of a color, a word or a phrase -- something simple and meaningful to you, like being thankful; this way you can choose joyfulness over a worried, bored or angry mind! Thankfulness shows life and love -- but continual worry plays into sarcasm, anger, and it can sour your very existence.






Do some yoga. If meditation is too hard for you, take a class or watch a DVD with some tips for yoga. Put on some light music as well. This helps you do something besides worry. Read How to Do Yoga for more information.







, If you don't want to solve your problem of worry, just do something to get your mind off it:


Work, practice a skill, hang out with some friends, or do something small: Go out for a walk, ride a bike, check your email, edit on wikiHow.






Read so your mind gets off worrying. A calming story is a good idea, but make sure it is not scary. Know that book you always wanted to read, but never had time? Read it!







, Consuming something hot can make your blood pressure decrease and help you to calm down. Coffee, hot chocolate or tea works for this. Slowly drink it and concentrate on the taste.


Have tiny snacks such as one vanilla wafer, three almonds, 2 small saltine crackers, half an apple or one small mint.







, Obviously, some kind of worries is good for us, it adds to safety and well being to your life, and motivates us, in the right balance. It is when the level of worry in your life causes you to put up with things that are harming or distressing you constantly that you risk sliding into being too worried. You might be too worried if: All you do and think about is work, non-stop, be it your own business, a career, a salaried position, a stay-at-home mom or -dad position, or anything else that is soaking up your time and life one hundred percent, and this over-concentration is leaving you passionless, disappointed, unhappy, and unfulfilled, while you feel like it is not enough.


If this takes a few minutes to figure out how worried you are and why -- then do something for a while, like read your book or watch an absorbing movie, until you are ready to detail the problem.







, It's easier said than done, but think of any way whatsoever to make it the least bit better. If it's a person you're worried about, go visit him or her. If it's a test or SATs you're worried for, study extra hard. Do what you can do to solve it.

, Even if you are talking to your pet, say every detail, and fifty percent of the time you'll realize you have nothing to worry about because you can solve it. You might look back and have no idea what you were worrying about. If the other efforts didn't work, talking it out can definitely calm you a bit more.

, Consider getting assistance, a mentor, a tutor or talk to a counselor. Go to a counselor/consultant to draw up a degree plan or a business plan. Of course it will take time to change some things, especially as you are learning, working on plans and making progress.Success is making progress. Success in not reaching a destination; it is being persistent in following your plans; even if, you have to change your mind and renew your purpose. Live and love -- one day at a time.

, Make short term goals, intermediate goals and longer term goals, so that all the lesser events lead toward more progress... Prepare for and do your goals as they come up.

Focus on reducing clutter.,
Employ housecleaning as a money saving tool.,
Listen to music while you clean.,
Approach your housecleaning as a workout routine.,
Embrace housecleaning as a kind of aromatherapy.,
Incorporate other stress-relieving methods into your housecleaning routine.",How to Use Housecleaning to Reduce Stress," It has been well documented that a cluttered home can lead to stress. The simplest and perhaps most effective way to lower stress through housecleaning is by focusing on organizing your clutter. Adjust your cleaning routine so that you always tackle cluttered belongings before tasks like sweeping and vacuuming. This will allow you to maximize the stress-reducing benefit of your cleaning efforts.;
, There are several ways in which regimented housecleaning can save you money, and lowered financial obligations can reduce your stress. For example, a messy kitchen might be leading you to eat out more often than you can afford. You may also find yourself replacing items that are not actually missing because you simply can't find them. Finally, a disorganized home can cause you to be late paying bills - either because you can't find the bills or forgot about them entirely.

, A simple way to turn housecleaning into a more enjoyable and relaxing experience is to listen to music. The music does not have to be calm, quiet, and ""Zen like,"" either. Even if you are listening to loud rock music while cleaning, if you are in a better mood your stress level will decrease.

, Housecleaning, if approached correctly, can provide the stress-reducing benefits of physical activity. While scrubbing floors and trekking up and down stairs can normally seem like drudgery, it can produce a different effect if embraced as exercise. Physical activity releases stress-relieving endorphins in your body, and housecleaning can fill this role as easily as exercise at the gym.

, If you are using cleaning products with strong chemical odors, you may want to stop. Using natural products that are scented botanically can help you to relieve stress as a kind of aromatherapy. Look specifically for a line of cleaning products available in a single, unifying scent.

, If you are having trouble experiencing housecleaning as stress relief in itself, you can try using other stress-reducing tactics while you clean. For example, deliberate and slow breathing is a helpful technique for relieving stress. Drinking mood-boosting beverages like tea during cleaning may also help.

Recognize misuse or manipulative behavior.,
Stay calm when you react.,
Explain how the behavior is affecting you negatively.,
Use ""I""-statements.,
Ask the other person to share their feelings.,
Be the bigger person when someone will not back down.,
Recognize your personal rights.,
Go into the situation with realistic expectations.,
Be direct when laying out boundaries.,
Walk away if the person is not receptive.,
Recognize what traits make you vulnerable.,
Manage your reactions carefully.,
Restate boundaries periodically.,
Refuse to engage with negative behavior.,
Care for yourself.",How to Deal with People That Spitefully Misuse You," Being more aware of certain types of behaviors will help to decrease the chances of you being misused or manipulated by the other person. Some manipulation/misuse behaviors to watch for include:



Rationalizing with you to get what they need. Many people who misuse other people because of their manipulative behaviors will often spend much time doing this. Rationalizing can be used as a way to further draw you into doing something you don't really want to.

Playing the role of the victim and blaming things on the other person. Manipulators will often blame you or others for their problems or issues, and avoid being accountable and taking responsibility for their own actions.

Doing what they can to remain in full control. In conversations, manipulators can be very savvy at changing the subject without you even knowing it and regaining control of the direction of the conversation in their favor. People who often misuse others in this way will only give out partial information or make small changes to the information to further convince you of something for their benefit.

Reacting as if they do not know what you are talking about. Many manipulators will pretend to ignore requests and not listen to suggestions.

Intimidating others by framing situations to make them feel ashamed. Some will even make light of situations or problems and blame you for overreacting. Depending on the manipulator/misuser they may be purposefully insulting and then pass it off as a joke, often leaving the receiver feeling horrible.;
, When dealing with those who misuse you, it can be easy to quickly get emotional in the situation. If you're being used or treated in a spiteful fashion, your first inclination may be to lash out in response. However, those who antagonize others may thrive on the response they get. Try not to react in a way that will encourage their behavior.It is okay to feel what you're feeling. In fact, it's normal to feel anger, frustration, and sadness if someone is spitefully using you. However, try not to let these feelings control your reaction. To best address the situation, remain calm as you express yourself.
You may not be able to immediately manage anger or other negative responses. Therefore, it may be best to walk away from a situation for a few minutes if you're feeling angry and address things later on when you're calm.

, You want to make it clear that being misused is not acceptable. When addressing misuse, make it clear to the other person how their actions affect you. Be respectful and calm, but do not sugar coat the issue.People, especially those with toxic tendencies, may not bother to think about how their actions affect others. Therefore, it's very important you be upfront about your feelings in these situations.
Spell it out as clear as possible for the person. For example, ""When you ask to hang out and then have me drive you around while you run errands, I feel like I'm not important to you. It seems like you just want to use my car and don't really want to see me.""

, When addressing negative behavior head on, you don't want to come off as confrontational. Toxic people who use others may be hostile to criticism and eager for an argument. Use ""I""-statements to express yourself, which minimize objective blame and instead focus on personal feelings. ""I""-statements have three parts. They begin with ""I feel..."", after which you immediately state your feelings. From there, you explain the actions that led to those feelings. Then, you explain why you feel the way you do.For example, do not say something like, ""It's incredibly disrespectful when you blow me off all the time. You only hang out with me when you don't have plans with other people.""
You can rephrase this statement using an ""I""-statement to make it sound less harsh. For example, ""I feel disrespected when you blow me off to hang out with other people because it makes me feel like you only spend time with me as a last resort.""

, Even if the situation is not your fault, you want to make sure the other person feels heard. When addressing negative behaviors, you do not want anyone to feel ambushed or attacked. After expressing yourself clearly, ask the other person to share how they feel in a respectful manner as well.Even if you feel like the situation is mostly the other party's fault, try to be fair. Remember, you're not admitting you're in the wrong simply by asking someone to share their feelings. You're just trying to keep a negative situation as respectful as possible.
Say something like, ""Anyway, that's what I'm feeling right now. Can you tell me how you're feeling?""
Be aware that if someone is purposeful in their manipulative behaviors, you do not want to open the door to their personal feelings. Depending on the person, this could be an invitation for the manipulator to regain control of the situation or conversation and swindle you back into doing something you don't want to do out of guilt and shame. It may give them a chance to make you feel like they are the victim, and in the end they get their way, and you're back at step one.

, Even if you're respectful when you address the situation, a spiteful person may not back down. If the other person remains hostile or negative, you need to be the bigger person. Do not resort to any negative tactics the person uses, such as yelling or name calling. Instead, remain calm and walk away if necessary.Distance yourself from the person. You do not want to end up getting emotional and responding in a way that is not helpful. If someone continues to use you and violate your boundaries, work on seeing them less to avoid your own emotions taking over in a negative fashion.

, If you've been used by someone for a long time, you may forget your feelings and boundaries are important. It's acceptable if you have certain limits and if there are certain boundaries you cannot tolerate. Think about interactions you've had with this person, especially interactions that have been extremely stressful and upsetting. Identify how and why you felt misused and what this says about your personal rights as an individual.It can help to think of negative interactions on a 10 point scale, with 10 being the most upsetting and one being the least. Think of interactions you would rate on a higher end and try to identify what personal limits were tested. For example, maybe your cousin borrowing a large sum of money to pay off their credit card and never returning it was a seven for you.
Think about why this action was a seven. What personal rights were violated? Maybe you feel were taken advantage of, as you are generous by nature. You may also feel your hard work is not appreciated, as you work very hard to make your income and your cousin borrowed it without any regard for this.
A boundary for you may be money. You may not be comfortable lending money to others. As money can easily build up resentment between loved ones, it's well within your right to say lending money to others is a personal limit of yours.

, If interactions with this person have been negative in the past, things are unlikely to change now. It's important to state your boundaries for your own well being and so you feel heard. However, do not have high expectations that this person will listen. Keep in mind that, while it's worth a try, a negative reaction is somewhat likely., You want to get straight to the point when setting boundaries with a difficult, negative person. You're not doing yourself or the other person any favors by not stating yourself clearly. If someone is the type to ignore boundaries, it's especially important to be direct so they understand where you're coming from.For example, do not say something like, ""I just feel kind of uncomfortable lending out money. Could you not keep asking me?""
Instead, be clear about what you feel, why you feel that way, and your limitations. For example, ""I work really hard for my money and I feel lending to family members can build resentment. I'm sorry you're having financial issues, but I can't help you out financially anymore. That's a personal limit for me.""
Remember that no means no, so enforce your limits. Learn to accept that it is okay to say no. You must stay firm and follow through with your boundaries. Many manipulative people (whether it is their conscious intention or not) are highly skilled at swaying others to change their boundaries to fit their needs, and making you feel guilty because they are not getting what they want.

, Remember, someone who spitefully misuses others may not take well to you setting boundaries. Even after you've stated your case respectfully, they may continue to question you or disregard your feelings. For example, they may say something like, ""Don't you think it's kind of petty to be so caught up on money? If I could lend you money, I would."" If the person is simply not listening, it's okay to walk away for now.End the conversation if things are getting hostile. If someone is simply badgering you after you've made your boundaries clear, quickly find a way out of the conversation.
For example, say something like, ""We're not seeing eye to eye on the money issue and I'm not sure we're going to. I think we should drop it."" From there, you can find an excuse to leave. For example, ""I need to meet a friend now so I'm going to leave.""

, While it's never your fault that someone took advantage of you, you may have certain traits that make you vulnerable to toxic people. Becoming aware of these traits can help you recognize and stop the pattern of misuse in the future.Toxic people often target those that are very accommodating to others. Do you frequently try to help others, even at the expense of yourself? If so, try to understand this inclination. This can help you better recognize this urge in the future and allow you to set more reasonable boundaries.
For example, maybe you crave acceptance from others and try to win favor by being agreeable. In the future, remember people should accept you for your personality, generosity, and other positive traits instead of trying to get people to accept you simply for being accommodating.

, After addressing the misuse, it may continue. Toxic people generally continue violating boundaries, even after being confronted. If the person in question is a family member, co-worker, or someone else you have to interact with on occasion, work on keeping your emotions together.Remember, you cannot control another person's actions but you can control your reaction. Do not continue to react in ways that encourage the behavior. Do not, say, get angry, emotional, or become overly accommodating to avoid negative feelings.
Instead, work on remaining calm and emotionally disengaging. You are not to blame for someone else's actions. The best you can do is focus on prioritizing yourself and your own needs.

, People who use others may not listen the first time you state your boundaries. Therefore, it may be necessary to restate them on occasion. A negative person may try to get you to go back on boundaries you've set. If this occurs, remind them of your limitations. For example, ""We already discussed this. I don't lend money to family."", You do not have to engage with someone who is behaving in a negative fashion. If the person who uses you acts out when you refuse to meet their demands, simply disengage. Do not return text and phone calls. Do not be roped into an argument. Minimize interactions as much as possible to avoid being dragged into someone's negativity., If someone is using you and being difficult, it's important to care for yourself.

You must break down these barriers and face your feeling head-on.


Admitting that you have a problem is the first step in the 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous program. While you may not have a drinking problem, this program seeks to help and heal you of issues, and can therefore be broadly applied in life. Admitting you are unhappy will jumpstart your healing process.;
, Start a diary detailing events, conversations, interactions, or times of day that lead to times when you feel most unhappy. (You can even do this in the ""notes"" section of your phone.) By doing this you can begin to see patterns of when unhappy feelings occur. Figuring out “triggers” of your unhappiness will help you avoid situations that lead to unhappy feelings.


For example, if you are in the breakroom at work speaking with a coworker, and leave the room feeling unhappier than when you entered, take out your journal and write down who you were with, what you talked about, who else was there, etc. Doing this for every “unhappy” situation will start to illuminate patterns of triggers of your unhappiness.
Unhappiness is often situational and will dissipate relatively quickly once removed from the scenario. Yet, it can reappear when you are faced with a similar problem. Writing down specific times that make you unhappy will help you avoid such situations in the future. , In each situation that you are presented with that makes you feel unhappy, ask yourself what is, specifically, causing your unhappiness. Write them down. For example, if you are talking with someone who makes you sad, ask yourself, “why does this person make me unhappy?” Or if you are out with friends but you are not feeling upbeat, ask “what about this situation makes me unhappy?” Perhaps it’s because that person is very negative or going out with friends reminds you of a dark time in you past. Some other questions you should ask yourself and explore:


When did I first notice that I'm unhappy?
How long have I been unhappy?
Do I feel unhappy at certain times of the day, or is it all day?
Is there a big event that caused my unhappiness, or is it just little things?

, If you are at a loss for why you might be unhappy, try reaching out to those who love you the most. Ask if they have noticed any changes in your personality. Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to understand your own feelings.


Trusted loved ones might be able to point out an event in your life that you had forgotten about causing your unhappiness.

, Look through your notes and start identifying patterns of situations, people, experiences, and other things that triggered your feelings of unhappiness. But don't just stop there. If you find you are always unhappy after spending time with your sister, ask yourself why? Is it because she is rude or abusive? Or is it something less obvious, like maybe she reminds you of your father who passed away, and it is still painful for you to think of him?


Once you start identifying the root of what is making you feel unhappy, you can figure out your next steps.If your job is making you unhappy, then you can start working on your resume and take steps to find something new. If it's a particular person, you might need to cut ties with them. If your unhappiness stems from reminders of a past trauma, then you can seek professional counseling to work through it.

, Each morning, reflect on the things in your life that make you feel happy. Try to think about good things in your life that you might not be appreciating. For example, a relationship with a friend, your freedom of speech and religion, and even small things like chocolate! Once you recognize and concretely see all the things in your life that bring you happiness, there is no choice but to feel that inside yourself!

, Some things in your day may not have been perfect, and may have made you feel unhappy. That is okay! Think about how you will handle it next time or try to spin the event into a positive one. For example, think about how that was a great learning experience and you can move forward as a stronger person. Also try thinking about things that you are looking forward to doing later in the day or week that will make you happy. You might be excited to watch a movie tonight or make a special dinner. Focus on the good things!

, Find a book, TV show, random topic, etc. that really interests you. Switching your focus to something positive can decrease stress. Stress can contribute to unhappy feelings.Try focusing on something that has interested you in the past, or something entirely new.


If you are unhappy, directing your focus toward something enjoyable, will likely lead to a reduction in your unhappy feelings. Yet, if you still find no solace in such distractions, you might be on the path to depression. , Mindfulness exercises such as this, can help direct attention away from negative things, such as overthinking about your unhappiness, and towards focusing on the present. Focusing on a single object and thinking about all the beautiful things about that object can reduce stress and anxiety, and improve your mood. Engage in a mindfulness exercise daily to maximize their effectiveness.

, When you are feeling especially unhappy, try taking 20 minutes to meditate. Go to a quiet room, sit on the floor, close your eyes and focus on taking slow, deep breaths. While you are meditating, try to empty your mind of all negative thoughts and concentrate on positive things in your life.


Mediation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress and help to cope with certain issues.
Meditation can also promote acceptance, self-awareness, a healthy lifestyle, and even slow the aging process. , Create mental images of yourself at a bar with friends or succeeding in your job so you can see where your life could go. By seeing where your life could be by pushing out unhappiness, you will be more motivated to seek happiness. Visualization may give you a “path” to happiness. If you know where you want to end, you can get a plan to reach that point.

, Staying alone in your house and following a daily routine can lead to the path of isolation and unhappy thoughts. Leave your home and break free of your routine. Fresh air will help clear your mind and sunshine will open the doors to happy thoughts. Getting out of the house will force you to interact with other people, and draw out your happiness!

, Exercise has many physical and emotional benefits. While exercising, your body releases endorphins, the “feel good” hormone, causing you to feel more energized and much happier. Exercise has also been shown to reduce stress and reduce the intensity of depression. The short-term and long-term benefits of exercising are most effective when you exercise three to four times per week. Exercise will also help boost your self esteem by making you look and feel good. A healthy self-esteem will help ward off unhappy thoughts.

, Sleep affects the function of your brain and can have huge impacts on your mood. A good night’s rest helps your brain rejuvenate so you can be more focused, less fatigued, and be in a better mood. Adults typically need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. Teenagers need eight to ten hours of sleep., Smiling has actual physiological benefits to increase our happiness. Smiling initializes our brain to produce endorphins which, in turn, stimulates the “reward center” of our brains. Regardless of whether your smile is real, just using your “smiling” muscles makes you happy. , A core group of friends and family that you can count on will prove priceless when seeking happiness. Your family and friends can offer you a distraction, and know just the way to make you smile and laugh.


Being around your loved ones will also help keep you in check. These are the people who will notice your unhappiness and help you work through it.

, If a friend from work invites you to a party, accept on the spot. Try to make as many connections and friends as possible. Putting yourself in unfamiliar situations might be scary, but can be immensely helpful in building friendships and support.


By accepting any and all invitations to events, you force yourself to get out of the house and socialize with others. This will help stave off the desire to isolate, which can lead to greater unhappiness.

, The internet is a wonderful place to anonymously seek help. You can visit blogs and support groups to realize that you are not alone.

, If your unhappiness continues or worsens towards depression, consider seeking professional medical care. Treatment can provide medical and social benefits that will bring you closer to feeling happyTry visiting a psychologist to talk through your issues. They are trained to help decipher the root of your unhappiness and help you through your negative emotions.

Watch a comedy or read a magazine.,
Try a focused activity like cooking or exercising.,
Talk to a friend or family member.,
Take care of a pet, friend, or child.",How to Distract Yourself from Fear1," You might have noticed that the waiting rooms of dentist and doctor offices are filled with celebrity gossip and fashion magazines. Some therapists theorize that this generic choice is calculated specifically to distract fearful patients from their upcoming procedures: the genre and topic is far-removed from the current situation and fear, so it works particularly well as a distraction.For example, if you start to feel fearful when you are lying in bed at night, turn on your favorite comedy show or pull out your favorite magazine and read through it until you feel less fearful.
If you don’t like magazines, put on a funny podcast, a stand-up comedy special, or a light-hearted comedic film. You’ll be surprised how much the natural response of laughing can distract you from and even directly diminish the fear you’re experiencing.;
, Studies have shown that distraction can be an effective way to get through fear or anxiety, but some distractions are better than others. Rather than letting your mind wander to a variety of other subjects, focus on one thing in particular, such as a physical activity, a good book, cleaning your house, taking a class, or attending to a task from your work.Yoga can be a particularly good physical exercise for distraction, as it helps hone concentration skills and develop mindfulness strategies.
For example, if you start to feel fearful during finals for school, head to your local gym for a yoga class. Or avoid the fear of studying by preparing a meal at home.

, Studies have shown that talking out your fears can help to overcome them. If you don’t feel comfortable explicitly discussing your fears, though, you can distract yourself from the fear by socializing with someone. You’ll have to concentrate on the ongoing conversation, so you won’t have nearly as much mental bandwidth to dedicate to your fear.If you’re afraid at night, have a friend come over and spend the night. Even if you’re not talking through your fears directly, you’ll find the companionship redirects your attention.
If you’re alone and no one can meet you, call a family member or a fun friend on the phone. Even the mundane topics of a casual conversation will distract you from your fears and help you survive the situation.
For example, if you start to feel fearful alone in your apartment, call a friend and ask them to go to dinner with you. Or reach out to a family member and chat with them on the phone to distract you from your fears.

, You might have heard the axiom that the best way to get rid of the blues is to cheer someone else up. A similar principle is at work when you attend to someone else when you’re frightened or anxious: instead of focusing on your internal thoughts, you direct your attention outward.


For example, ask a friend if they need a babysitter, take your dog for a walk, play with your cat, or help a friend talk through a conflict. If you struggle with fear often, consider volunteering for a local charity.
Studies have shown that household pets are particularly effective at reducing anxiety and improving quality of life, even for people with high-stress lifestyles and jobs."

Practice deep breathing.,
Close your eyes and imagine you’re in a safe, serene place.,
Meditate through your fear.,
Think about your positive traits.,
Listen to soothing music or natural sounds.,
Avoid potentially harmful distractions, such as alcohol or drugs.",How to Distract Yourself from Fear2," Some of the more unpleasant physical symptoms of fear include an accelerated heartbeat, perspiration, and a knotted or upset stomach. You can ease these symptoms by breathing deeply and slowly. As you focus on a physical process you can control, you distract yourself from the spiraling mental and emotional processes in your head.You can sit upright or lie flat on your back while practicing deep breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose so that you feel your lungs and abdomen expand, then exhale slowly through your mouth., Your imagination can be a powerful tool against fear. By picturing yourself in a place you associate with happiness and personal security, you distance yourself from current anxiety and replace negative feelings with positive ones.For example, picture a sunset-shouldered beach, your cozy bed at home, a favorite retreat from childhood, or a secluded cabin in the middle of the forest.

, It will take some practice, but meditation is one of the best ways to distract yourself from and eventually overcome fear. It helps you empty your mind of negative or worrying thoughts, focus on present physical sensations, and attain a sense of balance and self-control.


If you’re new to meditation, start by practicing in three to five minute sessions and focus on your breathing and minute-by-minute physical sensations., One of the best ways to get rid of negative thoughts and feelings of dread is to reorient the tone of these thoughts. Instead of worrying about bad things that could happen, focus on the positive aspects of life and yourself that you already have. Not only can this method be effective for surviving and overcoming temporary bouts of fear, but it can have long-term impacts on social confidence and self-control.For example, think about something good you did for someone the previous day or week, appreciate your family members or friends to whom you’re grateful, review an inventory of things you like about yourself, or recall a fun memory.

, While peaceful music might not be sufficiently distracting in high-stress situations or panic attacks, it can be a useful distraction during moments of mild, customary discomfort. For example, switch on some slow-tempo tunes when you’re waiting to board a flight and have a case of pre-flight nerves or you’re on the way to a job interview.Classical, jazz, trance, and blues can all be particularly calming genres of music.

, There’s nothing wrong with sipping a glass of wine when you want to unwind, but you shouldn’t rely on this substance to get you through bouts of fear and anxiety. Not only are drugs and alcohol only temporarily distracting, but they can actually make fears worse and anxiety pattern cyclical."

Acknowledge your fear-based emotions.,
Process your fears.,
Speak to a professional about your fears.",How to Distract Yourself from Fear3," If you find that distracting yourself from your fears is not effective, you may want to consider finding the root cause of your fears. To do this, start by acknowledging your fear-based emotions. Whenever you have a moment of fear, take a deep breath and acknowledge your fear. Say to yourself, “I am feeling fear right now and that is okay.” Try to get in the habit of acknowledging your fear, rather than try to avoid it or distract yourself from it.Rather than respond emotionally to the fear, simply acknowledge that it is there and be more aware of it. View it logically as a feeling you are experiencing and try not to run away from it or avoid it.

, Once you acknowledge your fears, you can then start to process them. Ask yourself, “Why am I feeling fear right now?” Consider the situation you are in, the people around you, if any, and any other external factors. Think about your day and whether certain moments or situations in your day may have contributed to your feelings of fear. Work on processing your fears so you can gain control over them.You may need to take a few deep breaths and sit somewhere quiet to really process your fears. Take your time and meditate on how you are feeling as well as the possible root causes of your fears.

, If you have a specific fear, such as a fear of heights or a fear of crowded places, then you can work with a mental health professional to treat your fear using cognitive behavioral therapy and other techniques. If you are struggling to acknowledge and process your fears on your own, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your fears. Get a recommendation from your primary care doctor for a therapist in your area. Go to a local mental health clinic to talk to a therapist. Reach out to a school counselor if you are student and need professional support.


You can also call a mental health hotline like the SAMSHA Treatment Referral Hotline in the U.S, 1-877-726-4727. Through the hotline, you can get a referral to a mental health professional in your area so you can find a therapist or counselor to talk to."

Ask for support.",How to Avoid Being Scared at Night1," When you stay up late, you wake up tired, not feeling refreshed and, by the middle of the day, craving a nap. However, napping for a long period of time in the middle of the day can make you less able to fall asleep with ease when you go to bed at night. Moreover, when you are tired at night and ready to go to sleep, you have less time and energy to think about being scared.If you feel that you must nap mid-day because you're too zapped to keep going, try taking a ""power nap"" just before lunch.These short naps of 15-20 minutes can give you some great benefits, including a burst of energy and alertness and increased motor performance. These shorter naps are what most people really need to stave off sleepiness and get the energy needed to continue on with their day.;
, Focusing on deepening your breath is one way to invoke the relaxation response to stress. Deep breathing, in which you expand the lungs and abdomen, encourages full oxygen exchange, the trading of incoming fresh oxygen for outgoing carbon dioxide. Deep breathing slows the heartbeat and stabilizes blood pressure.Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take one or two normal breaths to settle yourself. Inhale, or take a deep breath, for 5 counts. Hold for 5 counts. Then exhale, letting all the air out, for 5 counts. Repeat for several cycles until you feel more calm., Meditation is a helpful tool to feel more relaxed. Some people find it especially useful to meditate at the end of the days to help focus and quiet the mind after a busy day. Meditation is one way to become more aware of your surroundings and to achieve a higher level of awareness and inner calm. It is recommended that you meditate an hour before bed.You can meditate anywhere you like and for as long as you like. This basically allows you to access a sense of tranquility and peace no matter what's going on around you.
Sit in a comfortable position. Focus on your breath. Focus on being present and relaxed in your body, and notice every breath you take. Work on clearing your mind of any negative or stressful thoughts; this can be the hardest part. If you find your mind wandering, focus on counting your inhales and exhales.Some people find it helpful to focus on an object in the room, like a candle, or to harness their energy and focus into an audible sound, like ""um""., Writing in a journal can help you understand and better cope with the emotions and fears that arise at night.There is no right or wrong way to journal; you could create a lists or write more narrative entries describe your feelings and emotions at a given time.In general, seeing your thoughts reflected on paper might help you identify some important patterns, which then you can learn to cope with or alleviate.


Try journaling for 10-20 minutes a day about whatever comes to your mind. Do not worry about spelling or grammar. Just let yourself process whatever you need to on paper.Ask yourself some key questions to try to figure out what it is that scares you: What fears come to mind about the night? What feelings are coming up in the night or when you try to go to sleep? Do you avoid any particular places or activities at night?
Listing-making can also be a useful part of journaling, especially if you find worrying a reason you are unable to sleep. Make a ""to-do"" list for tomorrow, make a list of all of the positive things about a day, or make a list of what you look forward to tomorrow.

, The reason a bath helps with sleep is because your body temperature increases while you are in the bath and then lowers after the bath. Lower body temperature helps you to fall asleep.


A bath should be taken about 2 hours before you plan to sleep because of the time needed to first raise and then lower your body temperature to enable easier sleep.To enhance the calming effects of a warm bath, try incorporating some essential oils or scents associated with relaxation. Consider using a bubble bath or soap scented with lavender. Research shows that the herb lavender can produce calming, soothing, and sedative effects when its scent is inhaled. , Avoid eating a heavy meal right before you go to bed. In addition, avoid all stimulants such as coffee, nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and/or sugar within 4 hours of when you plan to go to bed. Stimulants keep your brain awake, which can make it harder to stop worrying and calm down before bed.However, eating a small snack about two hours before bed can be helpful. A good choice would be a banana and low-fat milk or a small handful of almonds., Nightlights are not just for children. It is recommended to have a nightlight in the hallway or bathroom, rather than your bedroom, where it may be distracting for you. Light can impact natural sleep patterns, making it harder for your internal clock to get ready for bed and for you to have a restful sleep.Having some light in your home will also make you more aware of your surroundings and help assuage any fear of the dark you may have.

, White noise, such as a fan or the sound of static, nature and ocean sounds, or other types of instrumental music can be soothing and help block out other noises that can trigger your fear.You can actually purchase white noise machines designed with an array of different sounds to help facilitate more restful sleep. In addition, there are many apps for smartphones to help people sleep that come with relaxation sounds and/or white noise.

, When your fear of the night stems from safety concerns, such as someone breaking into your home, take action steps to make your home safer.


Secure windows with locks.
Put curtains up to provide privacy.
If it make you feel safe, keep an item by your bed that could be used to protect yourself. However, avoid keeping an item near you that you or someone else in your home could accidentally use to hurt themselves or others, such as a gun or knife. Instead opt for a heavy object, such as a book or paperweight. The placement of this object nearby may help you feel safer, but will also not increase any risk or danger in your home.

, The temperature can affect how well and for how long you sleep. Your body temperature drops as you go to sleep and a slightly cooler, rather than too warm, room can help this process along and help you achieve a sounder and easier sleep. But if the room is too cold (or too warm), you are more likely to have trouble settling into sleep and will wake up more often. Though researchers can't say what is an ideal temperature because what is comfortable for one person isn't always the case for another person, a typical recommendation is to make sure your room is between 65-72 degrees Fahrenheit., A healthy amount of distraction is a good way deal with being scared. A ""healthy amount"" means enough distraction to engage your attention and emotions but not enough that you get hyper or overexcited and cannot settle down before bed.Read a book. Avoid anything too exciting or scary. Read something that you're interested in and that immerses you. This will keep you focused on the plot and/or subject, and not on your fear.
Watch TV or go on your computer, tablet or smartphone. The evidence is mixed on the impact of using technology before bed on your sleep patterns. The most recent research suggests that watching TV or using technology before bed in fact hinders healthy sleep patterns. However, if you want to use technology to distract yourself a few hours before you head to bed, this can be helpful in keeping your mind off of your fear. Just make sure you ""unplug"" an hour or two before you actually plan to sleep.Listen to calming music. The music should be anything that relaxes you, and makes you feel comfortable and happy.
Count. Count forwards or backwards as long as you can to keep your mind focus on something other than your fear until you feel yourself dose off.
Tell a story in your head. Play out a fictional scenario in your mind that distracts you from whatever worry you have.

, Some people find praying before bed can be relaxing and help alleviate worries and fears., Think ""happy thoughts"" before you go to bed - about your family, your friends, your favorite activities, so on. Remember all of the good things in your life and all of the people you love and who love you back; you are surrounded by love and protection.


It can also be useful to pause and use your logistical thinking. For example, if you live in an apartment, most of the sounds that scare you are probably just the sounds of other people in your building. Creaky floor sounds, muffled voices, occasional thuds as doors shut, etc., are not indications that anything sinister is going to happen to you, but that you live near other people - and that you are not alone!

, Do not be afraid to ask for support. Sometimes feeling isolated from the rest of the world at night is what intensifies the scary feelings.


If you are new to being alone because you've just moved into your own room, a dorm or a new apartment, maybe support means asking for a friend or relative to spend your first night in your new space with you.
You could have have the phone number of a friend who stays up late readily available in case you wake up from a nightmare or can't doze off and need to talk to someone.

Get moving.,
Find inspiration.,
Lose yourself in another world.,
Go for a drive or a walk.,
Get educated.,
Embrace being by yourself.",How to Cope With Feeling Alone at Night1," There are lots of ways you can get your body moving and get your mind off your feelings of loneliness: try exercising, dancing to your favorite songs, jumping on your bed, or learning karate on YouTube.


Exercise gives you endorphins, which boost your mood and may help improve your feelings of loneliness.Just remember not to exercise too close to bedtime or your body and brain will have a hard time winding down and settling into sleep mode. For some people, evening workouts give them the freedom to sleep in a little later while still maintaining their health.
Doing something fun and funny—like playing great music and dancing in your underwear. This will get you laughing, which is a great way to start feeling good instead of feeling lonely!;
, Nights can be notorious for bringing out your most negative emotions, especially when we are all alone. However, you can counteract that by seeking out positive things to make the loneliness more bearable.


Browse Pinterest or Google for inspirational quotes to paste as a wallpaper on your phone or profile photo on social media. Read an autobiography of a successful person you admire. Or, watch an uplifting and educational TED Talk., Read a great book, watch a favorite movie, binge watch a television show, or surf the internet. All of these options will tune your brain onto a different channel and focus your attention away from the fact of your loneliness. When you feel sleepiness start to creep in, then you can head to bed.

, Sometimes the best thing to do is get out of the house (weather permitting). A little bit of distraction and a change of scenery can go a long way toward making you forget about how lonely you’re feeling. You might even see someone you know and have a quick chat. Or, you may stumble upon something interesting along the way.Consider venturing into unknown territory. For example, take a drive to a part of town you’re not familiar with or walk to a neighborhood you don’t usually visit. Just be sure it's a relatively safe area beforehand. This way you’re experiencing something new as part of curing your loneliness, which may give you an extra dose of distraction.

, One expert suggests reading up on loneliness as a way of feeling less alone. The more you learn about loneliness and how common it is, the less lonely you may feel. When you know that even a difficult, painful feeling you are having is shared by others, it makes that feeling a little less terrible.Look at resources online or check a book out of the library. Keep these resources on hand for when you’re feeling particularly bad. You can always pull up those motivational quotes you like and read over them to give yourself a little pep talk when loneliness strikes. One good example of a practical guide about the subject is Emily White’s Lonely: Learning to Live with Solitude., Realize that you are actually really good company for yourself. You don’t need to be around other people or doing exciting things to be happy. While being with others is great, it's also important to learn to enjoy solitude. Spending time alone can be very valuable. If you can embrace being by yourself—and embrace your loneliness—you may end up feeling less lonely.


When you find yourself feeling lonely, take time to relax and close your eyes. Focus on your breathing and the feelings of each part of your body. Try to be in the moment, just focusing on yourself.
Try reciting this self-compassion verse to remind yourself you are not alone in feeling lonely and to treat yourself gently when you feel this way: This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is a part of life. Let me be kind to myself in this moment. Let me give myself the compassion that I need.This technique might not work for everyone. Some people will find it too difficult to relax while concentrating on themselves in the midst of feeling lonely, preferring a distraction instead. This is completely fine and normal.

, If you're a little wary of talking to the person, you can use text messages or e-mail. If they still can't get it, tell them not to make empty promises or say things like, ""you are not man enough to keep promises, please don't give false hopes.""

, If they don't appreciate it, once they experience, they will soon realize.

But don't force your child to tell you if they're not ready. Keep in mind as well that a child's fear may differ depending on his particular stage of development. For example, younger kids have a harder time telling the difference between what is real and what is imaginary.Never respond by calling your child's fear ""ridiculous"" or ""stupid."" Instead, accept your child's fear and work with them to try to overcome it. Remember that you were once a child and likely had lots of silly fears too! Try talking about your child's fears during the day, when they're not afraid. Discuss strategies regarding how they can be less scared at bedtime. Additionally, build your child's self-confidence during the day; comment on their ""bravery"" and what a ""big boy"" or girl they are. The idea is that if he feels secure and confident during the day, this can help them in the night., Once you know the nature of your child's fear, don't support the fear, even unintentionally, by formally recognizing or acknowledging it. For example, if your child is afraid of monsters, don't pretend to get out the monster repellant spray or to check the room for monsters. Such actions make it seem to your child like you too believe that these monsters exist.


Instead, consider talking to your child about the difference between imagination and reality. For example, if he's afraid of monsters under the bed because he watched the film Monsters, Inc., let your child know that movies are made-up and are not real. You will likely need to have this conversation multiple times as the child develops his mental capacity for logic and reasoning.Constantly reassure your child that he is safe. Communicate the notion of safety repeatedly., Do not allow your child to watch scary TV shows or play scary or violent video games. These may increase your child's fears before he goes to sleep.In general you should try to limit your child's exposure to TV and other electronics before bed as this can keep him from settling into sleep. Instead, try reading a story to him (again, nothing scary!) or reading together. Research has shown that bedtime stories can enhance children's learning and development and also help develop closer bonds between children and parents., The reason a bath helps with sleep is because your body temperature increases while you are in the bath and then lowers after the bath. Lower body temperature helps people fall asleep.


A bath should be taken about 2 hours before bedtime because of the time needed to first raise and then lower body temperature., Make sure the room is tidy before your child goes to sleep and that you put away anything lying around that isn't where it is supposed to be. When it's dark, a child's eyes can play tricks on him. Keeping things in their proper place will help your child avoid seeing things where there really is nothing to be seen. A neatly made bed - before your child gets into it, that is! - can also help facilitate the bedtime routine.

, Have lots of pillows around the child so he feels safe and cozy. Place a treasured item near your child on the bed, like a special blanket, stuffed animal or family photo beside the bed. Not only will these little comforts make him feel cozier, but they can also help your child feel more secure since he is surrounded by things he loves., A nightlight can be used to give your child a sense of calm as he goes to sleep, since many children are afraid of the dark. You can buy nightlights in fun shapes and sizes. Consider bringing your child with you to pick one out and explain to him what it's for. Give him an active role to play in overcoming his own fear.If the light interferes with your child's ability to fall and remain asleep, you should remove it. A dim nightlight is advised only insofar as it does not disrupt the child's sleeping patterns.
You can also leave your child's door open either partially or fully. Keeping the door open will help alleviate any fear associated with the separation from parents during the night., Cuddles with pets can make people feel better.A cat to snuggle around your feet, a dog resting on the floor, or even the soothing sounds of a fish filter or a hamster wheel can be be comforting in the night., If your child is very frightened and cannot be in the room alone at first, it is acceptable to stay by or in his bed with him until he falls asleep. However, only do this occasionally. If it becomes part of the regular bedtime routine (even two nights in a row), it may become a crutch and your child may not be able to sleep without your presence.If your child is afraid of being alone, let him know that you'll check on him.Start by checking in on him after 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 15 minutes, and so on, until he is asleep. Just do a quick check; don't linger, as your child may come to depend on your presence., If your child wakes up in the middle of the night and is afraid to go back to sleep because he is scared, reassure him and tell him that he is safe and okay. If your child comes to your room in the night, take him back to his bed and again reassure him. It's important to not let him get into your bed. Your child needs to learn that his bed is safe and that nothing will happen to him.Letting your child into your bed will not alleviate the fear but instead will support it and your child will not learn to overcome the fear., If your child's nighttime fear continues even after trying all of the above, or if it begins to impact his daily functioning, consider taking him to his doctor, where you can get a recommendation in order to have a formal psychological assessment done."

Connect with someone.,
Go out.,
Join a group or take up a new hobby.,
Give back.",How to Cope With Feeling Alone at Night2," Find someone that you can talk to at any time of night—even 2:30 a.m. This might be your significant other, a sibling, a parent, or your best friend.Roll over and shake your loved one awake, or make a phone call to someone who is willing to talk to you. Maybe, you can connect with your roommate who's only a few doors down. Just reach out to someone if you can.


If it’s not too late, consider calling someone who would really appreciate hearing from you, like an elderly relative. This will not only lift your spirits, but theirs also, which will then lift yours again in return!
When loneliness hits in the middle of the night and it’s too late to call or visit with someone, you can always write an e-mail or a letter to someone special. Though you’re probably used to immediate connection in today’s fast-paced society, writing to a loved one in this situation is actually a really great way to thoughtfully convey your feelings and ideas—and the e-mail or letter will reach them in due time.
You can also invite people over to watch a movie, have dinner, or just hang out. If you’re seeing close friends or family, invite them to stay over; sometimes it’s nice just knowing there’s someone in the other room.

, One way to avoid nighttime loneliness is to get out of the house in the evenings leading up to bedtime. This doesn’t mean you have to stay out until the sun comes up. Simply go out to the movies with friends, have a late dinner with a classmate, or catch drinks with girls from the office.You may not feel like going out if you feel depressed or sad, but that’s exactly when you most need to do so.Plus, once you get home, it will be time to climb under the covers and you won’t have much time to spend feeling lonely.
If you’re really reluctant to go out, try this: instead of committing to the whole evening, tell your friend/the group that you can meet for one drink (or an appetizer, etc.), but then you’ll probably have to get going. Then, you’ll most likely find that things have gone well and you feel much better than you anticipated—and you can stay for another round (or two).

, Adding an activity/class that you look forward to in the evening can take your mind off your feelings of loneliness and give your evenings a sense of structure.Although you might not find many groups that meet at 2 a.m., you can find a host of activities to engage in during the evening hours, such as yoga, tai chi, knitting, and painting.


Look on meetup.com to find people in your area who are interested in similar things and events that are going on around you. Who knows, you might meet someone who has trouble with feeling lonely at night, too. The two of you can spend time together, talk on the phone, or Skype to combat loneliness together.

, When we’re feeling down, it’s easy to focus all of our attention and energy on ourselves, which can lead to increased negativity. If we focus our attention outwards instead, we can often take our minds off our own loneliness and do some good in the meantime.Try volunteering at a local homeless shelter, animal shelter, or another place of need in your area. The hours will fly by as you play with or wash the cute pets, or participate in some other charitable event.
Consider visiting the elderly and sick at a nursing home or a local hospital. If your own relatives are shut-in, pay them a visit and see what joy it brings. Sometimes, when you get the opportunity to recognize how fortunate you are, life feels less bleak. Being able to help others can really uplift your perspective.

, People sleep better at night after having had sunlight exposure throughout the waking hours. Also, limit the amount of light in your bedroom while you sleep, as having lights on can make it harder to fall asleep.If you don’t have blackout curtains (curtains that literally “blackout” all incoming light), consider buying a sleep mask to cover your eyes.

Keep a daily to-do list.,
Use a calendar for scheduling activities.,
Send yourself reminders or alerts.,
Try creating habits.,
Avoid procrastination.,
Identify distractions that lead to forgetting.",How to Avoid Forgetting1," Keep a small notepad where you can write down tasks that need to be done. If you are in the middle of something important and get interrupted, writing down what you need to do later will help you remember.Consider using a notepad on your cell phone, tablet, or computer, where you can type in a short to-do list electronically.;
, If you're busy with school, work, or caring for your family, it can be hard to keep track of all the assignments, meetings, and events going on each day, week, or month. A calendar will help you to avoid forgetting when something is due as well as the exact time and date.Consider using a monthly calendar at your home or office for events that are specific to work or family. An office calendar can help you remember important meetings or a co-worker's birthday. A calendar at home can help you remember upcoming travel, appointments, or special events with family.
Consider having a calendar on your cell phone or in your bag. That way you can update your calendar as you go.

, If you need to do something on a routine basis, such as take your medications at a certain time or wake up at a certain time, there are various ways to make remembering things easier. Consider these ways to alert yourself:


Write a note, and place it in an area where you always look — near your computer screen, on the refrigerator, or on your bathroom mirror.
Set an alarm. If you need to set alarms throughout the day (and not just to wake up), consider using your cell phone's alarm clock, a watch with alarm settings, or another device that has an alert feature.

, If, for example, you always forget to pack your yoga mat for class after work, you can work on making this part of your daily routine and create a new habit. Making something a habit takes time (longer for some than for others), but it can be done. Try forming habits by using the 3 Rs: Reminder, Routine, Reward.Reminder — This is the cue that begins the behavior. Try picking something you already do every day as your reminder. For instance, let's say you pick out your outfit for the next day before you go to bed. Use this as a cue to put your yoga mat with your work bag — piggy back on something that is already an established habit.
Routine — This is the action. Using the above example, the action would be packing your yoga mat. It could also be flossing, putting down the toilet seat, paying your bill, etc.
Reward — This is the payoff for the behavior. If something good happens as a result of your routine, you are more likely to stick with it. You can even congratulate yourself each time you follow through, saying something like, ""Yes! You did it!""

, You may postpone doing something because it will take a long time, isn't fun, makes you stressed, or seems less important. But when that ""something"" is due, suddenly you're scrambling to do it because maybe you forgot about it or kept putting it off.


When you're a procrastinator and you forget something, it's likely combination of active avoidance and forgetfulness.
Identify things that you continue to ""forget"" that may be due to procrastination. When you understand the things or activities that trigger procrastination, you'll be less likely to forget about them, as well as seek ways to address these stressors effectively.

, With a busy and stressful lifestyle, there may be things that you or others do that distract you from getting things done. Distractions can be your own avoidance technique, or they can be external forces that inhibit focus and concentration.Are there people at work or school that regularly consume all your time and energy? They can be external sources of distraction and inhibit your focus.
Do you worry about something regularly that makes it difficult to focus and concentrate? By focusing your time and energy on worries, you may be less able to remember what things you need to do.
Try minimizing distractions at work by disabling notifications for emails and designating a specific time at the beginning and end of each day to respond to them. Put your phone on silent (and turn off the buzz notification as well). If you have your own office, close the door when you need to focus and don't want to be disturbed.

Allow yourself to have time to yourself, so that you aren't overworked and overstressed.If you're a student, make sure that school work and extracurricular activities aren't consuming you. Remember to take breaks, particularly if you're looking at a computer screen for more than two hours.
If you're career-focused, make sure that you set boundaries about what is ""work time"" and ""personal time."" Don't let all your time become ""work time.""
If you're a parent or caring for someone, it's important that each day or week involves something that is specifically for you. Your life may be focused on caregiving, but to avoid burnout or high stress, you need to have ""me time.""
