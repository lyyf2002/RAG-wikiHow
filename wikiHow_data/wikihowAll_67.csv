Remove yourself from a situation that feels dangerous.,
Call for help.,
Take a “time out.” If the situation is tense but not actively dangerous, ask for a time out.",How to Handle People Who Are Angry at You1," You may not always have the option to outright leave an angry situation, such as a customer shouting at you while you’re working. However, if you sense that you are in danger, leave the situation, or try to get as much distance between you and the threat as possible.


If you are dealing with an angry person in your home or workspace, go to a safe, preferably public, place. Avoid places without exits, such as bathrooms. Avoid places that have items that could be used as weapons, such as kitchens.If you are dealing with an angry customer at your job, try to keep physical distance between you and the customer. Stay behind your counter or stay out of arm’s reach.;
, You have the right to remain safe. Depending on the type and severity of the threat, you can call a friend for help. If you feel as though you are in imminent danger, call 911 or emergency services.


At work, call for a person of authority, such as a manager or security guard., Use an “I”-statement, such as “I need to take 15 minutes to cool down before we talk.” During this period, do something calming to get a handle on your own emotions and give the other person time to cool down. Meet back at a specified place and time to discuss the issue.Always use “I”-statements when calling for a time-out, even if you believe the other person is entirely to blame for the situation. Saying “I need a little time to think” may disarm the angry person, rather than putting him or her on the defensive.
Avoid accusative statements, such as “You need to take a time-out” or “Chill out.” Even if you feel these are true, they will put the other person’s defenses up and could make him or her even angrier.
Don’t be afraid to call for another time-out if the other person is still hostile or angry. Ideally, both of you will do something to calm and soothe you during the time-out.
If a few time-outs have still not allowed the other person to calm down, consider suggesting that you wait to discuss the issue until you can have a neutral third party present. This could be a therapist, HR representative, spiritual figure, etc."

Take a deep breath.,
Monitor your emotions.,
Avoid taking it personally.,
Remain calm.,
Watch out for disintegrating communication.",How to Handle People Who Are Angry at You2," Stressful situations, such as when someone is angry with us, can provoke a “fight-or-flight” response that speeds up our heart rate, makes your breathing rapid and shallow, and sends stress hormones surging through your body.Counteract this response with deep breathing to help you remain calm. Remember: two angry people make a tense situation twice as bad.Inhale for a count of 4. You should feel your lungs and abdomen expand as you inhale.Hold for 2 seconds, then slowly release your breath for a count of 4.
As you exhale, focus on relaxing the muscles in your face, neck, and shoulders.

, Reacting calmly to the angry person will help defuse a tense situation. Responding with anger of your own will only escalate the situation and will usually make things worse. Going for a walk, meditating, and counting backwards from 50 are all ways you can calm yourself down., It can be very difficult to disengage personal feelings from a confrontation with an angry person. Remember that anger is often a sign that the other person has not learned to respond in a healthy, assertive way to situations s/he experiences as threatening.Studies have shown that when people remind themselves that they are not responsible for another person’s anger, they are less likely to feel upset by it.Anger escalates because of several factors: insecurity, lack of choices, disrespectful behavior, or aggressive or passive responses to a problem.
People feel insecure when there is a degree of unpredictability in a situation. When a basic degree of order and security are threatened, people may react in anger. People may respond with hostility when they feel choices are limited. This stems from a sense of powerlessness from having little to no options in a situation.When people feel they are being disrespected, they may react in anger. For example, if you speak to someone in an angry tone or are not respectful of someone's time, s/he may become angry with you.People may become angry to make themselves feel better. If someone is angry, consider the possibility that it’s a response to something about his or her own life, not anything you’ve done.If you have wronged the other person, take responsibility for your action and apologize. You are never responsible for the other person’s response; nobody “makes” someone else angry. However, owning up to your own wrong action may help the other person process his or her feelings of anger and hurt.

, Speak in a calm tone of voice. Do not raise your voice or yell in response to the angry person. Use calm but assertive body language.Try to avoid slouching or crossing your arms. These communicate that you are bored or closed off from communication.Keep your body relaxed. Be assertive: plant your feet firmly on the floor, and stand with your shoulders back and chest out. Make eye contact with the other person. This body language shows that you are calm and in control of yourself, but you are not a pushover.Watch for aggressive responses, such as clenching your fist or jaw. Violating the other person’s “personal space” (usually a 3-foot distance) is also a sign that you may be becoming too aggressive.Stand at an angle from the person who is angry, rather than directly across from him or her. This position may feel less confrontational., It can be very hard to keep your cool when someone is angry at you, but it’s important to maintain calm, level-headed communication. If you notice any of the following creeping into your interaction, your communication is lapsing and you need to address it immediately:


Shouting
Threatening
Name-calling
Using dramatic or hyperbolic statements
Hostile questions

"
"
Know when it's not a good time to talk.,
Acknowledge the other person’s anger.,
Refrain from shutting the other person down.,
Listen to the other person.,
Confirm what the other person has said.,
Use “I”-statements to communicate your own needs.,
Empathize with the other person.,
Avoid mentioning your intentions.",How to Handle People Who Are Angry at You3," Some emotional and physical cues are prime indicators of when disintegrating communication will take place. These are described by the acronym H.A.L.T. It stands for hungry, angry, lonely, tired. These conditions can exacerbate an already heated situation, and prevent resolution. Of course, this person is already angry with you. However, if the other person's anger does not diminish (even after a time-out), or if it is coupled with one of the other conditions, it is best to put off the discussion until everyone's physical and emotional needs are met. Briefly, we will discuss why each of these conditions hinder progressive problem-solving and communication.When you are experiencing physical hunger, purposeful, rational thinking goes out the window. Your body is low on fuel and you may say or do just about anything to refill the tank. Research shows that humans and animals that are hungry take more risks. Hunger affects our decision-making skills and behaviors - two things you definitely don't want to be out of your control during a confrontation.Anger is an emotion that few people have learned to display constructively. Typically, anger is displayed with insults, name-calling, ridicule, and even physical violence. What's more, people often exhibit anger, when, in fact, they are feeling hurt, confused, jealous, or rejected. When underlying emotions are playing into the anger, a person is less likely to view the situation objectively and strive for resolution. It is best to give this individual time and space to reel in his feelings before any productive communication can occur.

Loneliness means that a person feels isolated from others. A person who does not glean a sense of community will have difficulty maintaining objectivity during a confrontation.
Feeling tired during an argument can be a recipe for disaster. Sleep deprivation brings with it a poor mood, poor cognitive functioning, and poor performance. Being tired also affects your decision-making abilities. You might be able to clearly see a solution if you were well-rested, but sleepiness can have your argument circling it's tail for hours with no end in sight., When someone is screaming at you, the last thing you may want to do is acknowledge his or her anger. However, anger is often a response to feeling misunderstood or ignored.Acknowledging that the other person is angry isn’t the same as saying s/he is behaving appropriately.Try saying something like, “I understand you are feeling angry. I want to understand what is happening. What is it that you’re feeling angry about?” This shows that you are trying to see things from the other person’s perspective, which may help him or her feel better.
Try to avoid sounding judgmental when you do this. Don’t ask something like “Why are you being such an angry jerk?”
Ask for specifics. Calmly ask for the specific thing that the other person is responding to. For example, “What did you hear me say that has upset you?” This may encourage the other person to slow down and think about why s/he's angry -- and s/he may realize it was all a misunderstanding.

, “Shushing” or otherwise stopping the person from expressing his or her feelings will not help the situation. It may increase the other person’s feelings of anger.Shutting the other person down communicates that you do not view his or her feelings as legitimate. Remember that even if you don’t understand the other person’s experience, it’s very real to that person. Dismissing that will not help you defuse the situation., Be an active listener. Show that you are engaged with the other person by making eye contact, nodding, and using phrases such as “uh huh” or “mmm-hmm.”Don’t get caught up in preparing your defense while the other person is speaking. Focus on what s/he is saying.Listen for reasons given for why the other person is angry. Try to imagine the situation from his or her point of view. If you experienced this situation, would you feel the same way?

, One reason tense situations escalate is because of miscommunication. Once the other person has told you why s/he is angry, confirm what you heard.Use “I”-focused statements. For example, “I heard you say you were angry because this is the third cellphone you have bought from us and it isn’t working. Is that correct?”
Saying things like “It sounds like you are saying ______” or “Is _________ what you mean?” will help you make sure you understand the other person. It may also help the other person feel acknowledged, which can help soothe angry feelings.
Don’t embellish or reword the other person’s statements when you confirm them. For example, if the other person has complained that you have been late to pick him up the last 6 days, don’t say something like, “I heard you say that you’re pissed off because I’m always late.” Instead, focus on what he actually said: “I heard you say that you’re angry because I have been late for the past 6 days.”

, If the other person is continuing to shout or be aggressive with you, use “I”-focused statements to communicate your needs. This will avoid sounding as though you are blaming the other person.


For example, if the other person is shouting at you, you could say something like this: “I want to help you, but I cannot understand what you’re saying when you speak so loudly. Could you repeat what you said in a softer voice?”

, Try to consider the other person’s side of the situation.Doing so can help you keep a handle on your own emotional responses. It can also help you communicate effectively with the other person.Saying something such as “That sounds very frustrating” or “I can see why that would be upsetting” can help defuse anger. In some cases, people just want to have their feelings of frustration validated. Once they feel understood, they may calm down.
You may have to mentally tell yourself that the person is upset and is doing her best to communicate her feelings. This can help you to reframe the situation in your own mind. Don’t make light of the the problem. Even if it seems trivial to you, the other person clearly feels strongly about it., Think about consequences instead. If someone is mad at you, this person feels wronged by you in some way. Your first reaction might be to defend yourself and state your intentions. For example, refrain from saying ""I meant to pick up your suit from the cleaners, I just forgot because I left work late."" While your intentions may have been good, at this point, the other person does not care. The person is dealing with the consequences of your actions, and that's why he/she is upset.Rather than declaring your good intentions, try to step into the other person's shoes and notice how the consequences of your actions have affected this person. Make remarks like, ""I see now that my forgetting your suit has put you in a bind for your meeting tomorrow.""
This concept may feel like you are being disloyal to your own beliefs. You may honestly feel like you did the right thing and have trouble coming to terms with being wrong. If this is the case, try to imagine that the person is not mad at you, but someone/something else. Consider how you would resolve the situation if you weren't the 'wrongdoer'.

Unfortunately you may be the only person who feels this way.,
If you approach your mid forties or early fifties feeling content and without any ' should haves' and ' could haves' - great.,
Take yourself seriously!,
Listen and accept whatever goes through your mind as information.,
Feel your emotions and don't talk them away with ' I have no reason to feel unhappy/ restless/ anxious/etc.,
Trust.,
Change your attitude to the word' crisis'.,
If it feels right, it most likely is right!,
Realize that there is a difference between becoming a selfish prat and fulfilling long harbored dreams and ambitions.",How to Be Friends With Your Midlife Crisis," Whatever 'symptoms' you may experience which point to the oncoming of a mid-life crisis, they are perfectly real. Who could argue the opposite? So your mother didn't have one and twenty years ago she talked your father out of buying that motor bike he always wanted. That doesn't mean they didn't have a crisis. It means they ignored it!;
, Move on to the next stage in your life. If, however, the transition from one decade to the next is accompanied by nagging thoughts, feelings of discontent and growing desire for something which remains undefined and elusive, then its time to be still and listen! Here's what you should do:

, That means, trust that your body and your mind is trying to tell you something.

, No thought needs to be justified.

, If you feel any of those things, there is a reason.

, Trust that your recurring thoughts and persistent feelings and moods are there to teach you something. Until you accept and acknowledge this, they will not disappear!

, A crisis is much like a ' breakdown': It provides a chance to dismantle, to break into smaller components and to reassemble into a new whole. A crisis, scary and unpredictable as it may seem at times, serves a purpose. Don't let the crisis use you, use the crisis as an opportunity to become a bigger, better, happier person.

, That goes for the ' big' stuff as well as the small stuff. Walking out on a long marriage is the hardest thing to do and will cause heartache and grief, but only you will know if it feels right. If you feel drawn to going back to church after an absence of many years and it feels right, do it. If you want to convince your long suffering spouse to sell the nice apartment in the city to go and live on a hobby farm, good luck!

, Nobody should get needlessly hurt while in your pursuit of becoming a new you. A crisis is not a big boulder which rolls down the hill and we run away from it. We create the crisis in that part of our subconscious mind gives that boulder a little push to alert and awaken us to the fact that something- whatever it may be- needs to change. This is why a midlife crisis is a friend. It is an opportunity to let go of old habits, to learn more about the person we are, to become more active participants in our lives. So next time your friends wonder whether you are going a little crazy, say' yes'. Crazy is your new friend.

Recognize the warning signs.,
Allow yourself to feel anxious at first.,
Adopt a neutral attitude.,
Analyze the situation.,
Resolve the situation.,
Accept the unresolvable.",How to Deal With Anxiety and Stress1," Sometimes stress and anxiety arrive with bells and whistles, but sometimes they creep up undetected. Spot the symptoms as they manifest. Look out for the following warning signs in your behavior, which often come with stress and anxiety.A sharp increase or decrease in appetite.
A growing reliance on alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, or other drugs.
Insomnia or trouble remaining asleep.
Mood swings marked by shorter tempers.
Feeling easily distracted and putting off major decisions.
Feeling engulfed by things that seem to be beyond your control.;
, It may seem counter-intuitive, but try to avoid bracing yourself against stress when you feel it building up inside. Remember that anxiety is an emotion and thus temporary. Avoid compounding it further by stressing over feeling stressed. Accept it for what it is and let it wash over you. As it does, keep yourself calm at the same time by:Breathing deeply and slowly with full inhales and exhales.
Counting your breaths to focus your attention on the here and now.
Reassessing yourself after ten breaths and repeating if needed.

, After allowing yourself to ride out the first wave of anxiety, imagine yourself as a scientist or doctor. Take a step back from the situation so that it feels less personal or immediate. Reapproach the situation as if it was a slide under a microscope. Adopt the clinical detachment of a scientist sorting through data out of professional curiosity, rather than personal concern.Be careful to label this outbreak of anxiety and its sources as a “situation,” rather than immediately framing it as a “problem.” Avoid jumping to conclusions and adopting a negative outlook right from the start.

, Identify what triggered your anxiety. Determine whether the source is something that can be resolved. Ask yourself:Whether the situation is a concrete, real-world set of circumstances that can be immediately addressed or merely a hypothetical possibility.
Whether your hypothetical possibility is probable or unlikely to ever actually occur.
Whether the situation can be resolved now and/or prevented from repeating.

, Write down every single thing you can possibly do to deal with the circumstances that triggered your anxiety. Address those aspects of the situation that you are able to directly influence. From your list, choose the most practical actions that you can make. Implement your new plan immediately. For instance, if a bully at school or work triggered your stress:Forget trying to change the bully’s outlook or personality, since this is most likely beyond your control.
Concentrate instead on steps that you can actually take, such as: minimizing your interaction, confronting them, and/or being the bigger person by refusing to be drawn into petty disputes.
Determine whether the trigger is the present set of circumstances (in this case, the bully’s overall bad attitude), or whether it is because it touches on another source of anxiety (such as appearance, social standing, or past instances of bullying). If the latter, create a separate list of steps you can take to improve those circumstances as well.

, Learn to live with those circumstances that are impossible to change. Embrace the fact that some things are simply beyond your control. Allow yourself to feel the negative feelings they cause, without guilt. Once those initial feelings pass, square yourself to the realities. Accept them as factors that you will have to contend with in life.Don’t waste time trying to come up with solutions that resolve situations 100% to your liking.
Concentrate on actionable steps you can take to improve your situation, whether it’s by 99% or just 1%.
Learn to laugh at the circumstances and yourself. Develop a sense of humor regarding your anxieties. Counteract the negative feelings they cause with positive ones.

"
"
Approach the situation with an open mind.,
Offer a solution.,
Ask for alternative options.,
Avoid using “but.” “But” is known as a “verbal eraser,” because it can completely negate what you said before it.,
Thank the other person.,
Give it some time.,
Find a third-party mediator, if necessary.,
Consider getting professional help.",How to Handle People Who Are Angry at You4," Once you have listened to the other person, consider how you can address the situation.If you believe the other person has a valid grievance with you, accept it. Admit your own wrongdoing and ask what you can do to make amends.Don’t make excuses or be defensive. This will often make the other person even angrier, because s/he will feel as though you are dismissing his or her needs., Be reasonable, and communicate calmly and clearly. Try to keep your solution focused on what the other person communicated to you.For example, if the other person is angry because your child threw a ball threw the window, state what you are willing to do. For example: “My daughter threw a ball through your window and broke it. I can have a repairman come out and replace it in two days. Or, you can have your handyman replace it and send me the bill.”

, If the other person is not happy with the solution you suggest, ask him or her to suggest a resolution s/he would be happy with.For example, you could ask something like ""What would you like to see happen in this situation?""


Try to present this as a “we”-focused solution to encourage collaboration. For example, “Okay, if my suggestion isn’t acceptable, I’d still like to see if we can find a way to address this problem. What can we do to address this situation?”If the other person suggests something you find unreasonable, don’t start calling names. Instead, present a counter offer. For example: ""I heard you say that you want me to fix the broken window and pay for carpet cleaning for your entire house. I think it would be fair for me to replace the broken window and pay to have the living room carpet cleaned. How does that sound?""
Trying to find common ground between you and the angry person can help redirect the interaction towards a solution.For example, you could say something such as ""I understand that fairness is important to you. It is to me as well…"" This can help communicate that you are working toward the same goal., When people hear “but,” they tend to stop listening. All they hear is ”You’re wrong.”For example, don't say things like ""I understand what you are saying BUT you need to ________""
Instead, use ""and"" statements such as ""I can see your point AND I can see the need for _______"".

, If you have been able to come to a resolution, wrap up your interaction with a word of thanks for the other person. This shows your respect for the other person and can help him or her feel as though his/her needs have been met.For example, if you have been able to negotiate with an angry customer, you could say: “Thank you for allowing us to make this problem right.”

, In some cases, the person’s anger may not disappear immediately, even if you have done all you can to resolve the situation. This is especially true in situations that carry deeper hurt, such as the other person feeling betrayed or manipulated in some way. Accept that it may take some time for angry feelings to resolve themselves, and don’t push.

, Not all conflicts can be resolved, and not everyone’s anger will dissipate even if you stay cool and respectful all day long. If you have tried the tactics here and have made no progress, it may be time to step away. A third party, such as a therapist, mediator, or HR representative, may be able to help you negotiate the situation., Beyond accessing the services of a mediator, seeing a therapist or psychologist who is trained in conflict resolution or anger management may be helpful. This is especially so if the person who is angry with you is a significant person in your life, such as a spouse, parent, sibling, or child. If the two of you are constantly arguing, or if one person tends to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation, you may need to see a professional who can not only mediate the situation, but also teach you effective problem-solving and communication skills.


A therapist can teach your family member or friend ways to relax and handle stress, methods of overcoming angry feelings, strategies of expressing emotions, and ways to recognize negative thought patterns that cause anger."
"
Think about what you did to anger the other party.,
Express empathy and regret.,
Accept responsibility for your actions.,
Offer a remedy to the situation.",How to Handle People Who Are Angry at You5," If you did something wrong, you may need to remedy the situation by apologizing and making amends. Don't try to make excuses for your behavior. If you did something to wrong the other party, you need to acknowledge your mistake.
Think about whether or not an apology is best during the interaction or later after s/he has calmed down.
Assess whether or not an apology would be heartfelt and meaningful to the situation. You should not apologize if you don't mean it, as this might escalate the problem further.

, You need to show the person that you have remorse for how your words or actions affected him or her.You may not have intended to make this person angry or hurt his or her feelings. Regardless of your intentions, you need to recognize that your behavior had a negative effect on the other person.
Frame your apology first around a statement of remorse. For example, you could start by saying ""I am so sorry. I know I hurt your feelings.""

, Your apology needs to include a statement about responsibility to be effective and diffuse the situation. In other words, you need to state how your actions contributed to the other person’s feelings of hurt or frustration.A statement of responsibility may sound like ""I am sorry. I realize that my being late made us miss the event""
Alternatively you could say ""I am sorry. I know my carelessness caused you to fall""

, An apology is meaningless unless you state how the situation can be fixed or avoided in the future.An offer to remedy the situation can include an offer to help the other person or a means by which you not repeat the same mistake again in the future.
For example, you could say ""I am sorry. I know my being late caused us to miss the event. From now on I will set an alarm on my phone an hour before I need to be ready"".
Another example would be ""I am sorry, I know my carelessness caused you to fall. I will pay better attention to where I put my belongings in the future.""

"
Schedule a daily “worry session.” If you experience anxiety and stress frequently, set aside a portion of each day to face them.,
Make self-care a priority.,
Concentrate on the present.,
Quit thinking in absolutes.,
Give yourself a break.,
Seek professional help.",How to Deal With Anxiety and Stress2," Make it a part of your daily routine of self-care, as you would with meals, hygiene, and exercise. As you face triggers throughout the day, allow yourself the ability to confront the resulting stress later, at a time of your choosing, rather than be overcome by it in the moment.Devote 15 to 20 minutes each day, at the same hour, to create structure. Allow plenty of time between your worry session and your bedtime to avoid bringing your worries to bed with you.
Jot down triggers as they happen. Create a to-do list to go over later, during your session. Assure yourself in the moment that the situation will in fact be addressed.
Keep a journal. Commit your troubles to paper so you don't have to keep them bottled up. Use this time to create lists of steps that you can take to resolve issues.
As your problem-solving skills become more ingrained with repeated practice during your sessions, apply them in the moment to resolve situations that demand immediate attention.

, It can be easy to see certain self-care practices as expendable or put them last on your list. When you're busy, overwhelmed, or tired, it's easy to think ""I'll just skip yoga class today,"" or ""I can shower tomorrow,"" or, ""It's not really that important that I meditate. Getting this other stuff done is more important."" Don't think of your stress-reducing activities as optional. Schedule time to do them daily and stick to it.

Identify things that help reduce your stress, such as yoga, meditation, exercising, deep breathing, and schedule a time to do it every day.
Managing stress is all about balance and prevention (consistent de-stressing) so it's important that it's scheduled and made a priority.

, Understand that stress and anxiety often stems from overthinking the past or the future. Recognize that the past is just that: past. Expect the future to be shaped in part by your current actions. Center your attention on what you can do here, in the moment, to improve your situation.To reorient yourself to the present, quit what you are doing. Breathe deeply and slowly. Expand your senses to note your environment. Observe what is going on around you instead of what’s going on inside your head. Close your eyes if necessary and focus solely on smells and sounds.

, Expect chronic issues to distort your outlook. Determine whether you are viewing situations objectively or if you are perceiving them through a biased point of view. Resist viewing situations as being either black or white. Perceive them as shades of gray instead. Note the positive as well as the negative to ensure a more balanced view of the world.Treat each situation as an isolated incident, rather than one link of an unbreakable chain that is doomed to repeat itself. For example, don't assume that all future relationships are doomed to fail just because your last partner broke up with you.
Break each situation down into separate components and analyze each in turn. For instance, if you are stressing out over your job because it won’t lead to advancement, don’t overlook its positive aspects, such as its proximity to home, your relationships with coworkers, and the skillsets that you can now include in your resume when seeking other employment.
Avoid assuming the worst. Say your boss calls you into their office when it isn’t their habit to do so. Think of ALL the possible topics they might want to discuss, rather than focusing exclusively on negative ones like, “You’re fired!”

, Avoid holding yourself accountable for other people’s choices. Where your own actions are concerned, allow yourself the freedom of choice. Don't try to live your life by a single code of unbreakable rules, since this is often impossible and only creates more stress when you end up breaking those rules. When you do make mistakes, view each one as a single action that you once took, rather than internalizing it as a definition of who you are as a person.When analyzing a situation, use verbs to describe what happened to better identify possible solutions or alternatives.
For example, think, “I missed my last bill payment because I worked three double-shifts in a row and forgot all about it due to exhaustion,” rather than, “I missed my last payment because I’m forgetful.”

, If you find that you are unable to cope with stress and anxiety on your own, seek treatment. Speak with your doctor about a referral, ask trusted friends and families about therapists who may have treated them, or search online for a practice that seems to suit you. Expect counseling to possibly utilize one or more of the following techniques:Discussing your feelings and personal history.
Sharpening problem-solving skills.
Supervised exposure to simulated and real-world triggers of anxiety.
Rebuilding your outlook on life to reduce negative mindsets.
Recognizing and mastering your body’s responses to stress.
Practicing relaxation techniques.

Participate in your community.,
Exercise.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Deal With Anxiety and Stress3," Involve yourself with friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, or even strangers in need. Strengthen your ties with loved ones and acquaintances to form a network that you can rely upon instead of feeling isolated and overwhelmed. At the same time, boost your sense of self-worth with the satisfaction that comes from being a reliable source of support for others. Simple steps that you can take based on your availability include:Making a point of using polite phrases such as “please” and “thank you.”
Asking people, “How are you?” as an actual question instead of a greeting.
Simple acts like holding doors and helping to carry heavy loads.
Regularly calling and planning visits or activities with friends and loved ones.
Offering your assistance with other people’s projects.
Volunteering your services for organizations like churches, hospitals, nursing homes, non-profits, and schools.

, Set aside time each day for some form of physical activity. Bolster your self-esteem by improving your physical health. Set simple, achievable goals for yourself (such as being able to run nonstop for 20 minutes in six weeks from now) to prove that you can overcome challenges: a skillset that you can then transfer to dealing with stress and anxiety. As an added benefit, some studies suggest that exercising can actually boost the bodily chemicals that make us feel more positive. Try one or more of the following:A daily routine of light exercises around the house, such as jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, and pull-ups.
Getting out of the house to run, hike, bike, or swim and enjoy some alone-time.
Joining a gym, team sport, or running/biking/swimming club to connect with other people.

, Stick to a regular meal-schedule as best you can so that your stress or anxiety isn't made worse by hunger or low energy. Abstain from unrefined sugars and high glycemic carbs, which can affect your body chemistry by causing spikes and crashes in energy. Drink plenty of water, since dehydration can make the situation worse.Foods proven to combat stress and anxiety include: acai berries, asparagus, avocados, blueberries, chia seeds, dark chocolate, nuts, oranges, salmon, seaweed, spinach, sunflower seeds, whole grains, and yogurt.
Low to moderate caffeine habits may prove beneficial to those with mild to moderate stress and anxiety. However, those with higher levels should avoid it, since it may trigger or worsen attacks.
Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs.

, Maintain good sleep habits. Aim for seven to nine hours of straight sleep each day with a fixed bedtime. Avoid taking naps, which may make your seven-to-nine hours harder to achieve. Also avoid using your bed and bedroom for any activities other than sleeping. Condition your body to expect sleep when you get into bed. Things to avoid include:Taking stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine in the evening.
Watching TV or staring at a computer screen immediately before bedtime.
Exercising, working, or doing chores right before bed.
Keeping the lights and/or radio on.

Be thankful for what you have.",How to Accept the 30 Year Old Milestone," Feeling anxiety about aging is completely normal, but your fear might be an unrealistic reaction to an experience or your conceptions of getting old. Identifying why you’re scared of turning 30 may help you more quickly accept this milestone.


You might fear turning 30 because some people categorize it as “old.” However, with medical progress and longer life expectancy, thirty is no longer middle age.You might fear turning thirty because it makes you feel like you should be accept more responsibility, act like an adult, or because you haven’t achieved everything you thought you would by this age.Consider writing out your aging fears to help you realize that they’re not rational and accept your milestone.;
, You can’t turn back the proverbial hand of time, so just accept—and welcome-- the fact that you’re turning thirty. Once you let go and recognize the inevitable, you may more easily accept turning 30.Many others people in your life, including your parents and probably some of your friends, have turned 30 and survived. Know you will live through turning 30 and will probably enjoy the decade more than you did your 20s.Take on the attitude that “30 is the new 20.” This behavioral tactic of framing the milestone to minimize its gravity may help you accept it more readily., Consider practicing gentle yoga and meditation to help stretch out your muscles. Doing these exercises can help relax and refocus you, and in turn may help you more readily accept that you’re turning 30.


Try doing gentle forms of yoga, such as restorative and yin yoga. These forms are specifically practiced to help stretch out and repair muscles and relax the body.There are many different health benefits to meditation such as lower blood pressure, decreased anxiety and depression, less stress, and greater feelings of relaxation and general well-being.Meditation can also help liberate your mind and allow you to let go of the attachment to things you can’t control.Talk to your doctor before you begin any yoga practice to make sure you’re healthy enough to practice., This old truism has likely never been more accurate than today. With advances in health care and lifestyles, people are living longer and looker younger for longer periods of time.


If you take care of yourself by exercising, eating healthy, getting plenty of rest, and avoiding stress, your body may be much healthier than that of someone younger than you.Societal pressures in the media often make aging look like a process of aches, feebleness, and inactivity. By keeping in mind Mark Twain’s statement, “age is an issue of mind over matter,” you may be able to not focus on the number of your age but how much you can do and how great you feel., Your twenties are a defining decade of your life that are filled with making life plans and getting settled. Think about what you’ve accomplished already in your twenties and how that can help set you up for another exciting decade in your thirties where plans may come to fruition.You can consider most major milestones in your twenties as accomplishments. For example, maybe you finished your education or started a family. You can use these accomplishments as starting points for goals during your thirties.

, Accept that there is going to be failure in any endeavor. Learning to embrace the failure and then move on can help you to age gracefully and accept the upcoming challenges of the new decade., The inability to accept turning thirty may begins with expectations you had for yourself. Letting go of unrealistic or unfulfilled expectations can help you create a positive environment and start your thirties out on the right foot.


Accept that nothing is perfect. Imperfection adds character and letting go of any expectations of perfection will help you focus on the positive changes in your life., Every person is different and comparing yourself to other people can minimize your self-confidence, especially in an era when there is so much societal pressure to appear young. Focusing on yourself and not comparing yourself to others is essential to accepting your upcoming milestone.


Don’t let societal conceptions of age or aging discourage you. With so much focus on celebrities who seemingly don’t age—mostly with the help of cosmetic procedures-- it’s hard to accept aging., Start off the decade on the right foot and throw yourself a fabulous party. Ushering in your thirties in a positive way can help you remember all of the wonderful things that may happen in the next decade.

, Have confidence in everything you’ve learned during your twenties and believe that you can apply this knowledge to be successful in your thirties.By cultivating and projecting confidence in yourself, you can set yourself on the path for self acceptance and success during your thirties.Confidence comes from many sources, including knowing that you have a good education and training, good relationships, or even that you look good.
For example, if you feel that you took great care of your skin in your 20s, be confidence in the fact that you probably don’t have many wrinkles. You can also be confident if you finished your education or started a good job, or even had healthy children.
It’s important to know that even if you are confident and successful, that failure is a part of the equation.Embrace the fact that most people in their thirties feel much more confident and comfortable in themselves, which can help you enjoy yourself and relax.

, You likely made plans for yourself in your twenties and you should do the same for your thirties. In many cases, your goals or plans may be extension or the culmination of what you set out to do in your twenties. Having plans and goals can help give you a concrete purpose as you move into this new life phase.Set goals for every aspect of your life: personal, professional, and otherwise. For example, you might want to start a family in your thirties or finally get your PhD.
Give yourself short- and long-term goals to achieve and reassess them every year.
Make plans to experience as much of life as you can through travel, education, or even just engaging with your community. Getting involved can help you forget your milestone and help you realize that your thirties are much more fulfilling than your twenties.

, Many people are in stable jobs or stable living situations by the time they are 30. Enjoy any financial independence you’ve achieved by rewarding yourself with travel or buying a home.


You don’t necessarily have to make big purchases to enjoy any financial independence you’ve achieved. Even being able to go to a nice restaurant is a way to enjoy having more money than you did when you were in your twenties.

, Trying new activities that interest you or even that someone invites you to join can make your thirties much more exciting. Even if you don’t enjoy it in the end, you will still be more informed and versatile than you were prior to trying the activity. Nurturing your curiosities by allowing yourself to explore the world around you is one of the best ways to embrace your thirties. At this age, you are more likely to truly appreciate activities such as travel and trying different foods and new hobbies.


You can try artistic activities such as painting, dancing, or making music; do a new sport or even just take part in a pick up game; or engage in hobbies like photography or a book club.Be open-minded to new trying activities even if they don't seem appealing at first.

, Engaging with your community or the local area, such as through politics, will put you in contact with a wide variety of people and opinions. Exposure to different perspectives and people in your community can show you that getting older isn’t such a daunting process.Consider volunteering at a local hospital or soup kitchen. Realizing that you are healthy and have the means to support yourself can help you further embrace your thirties.

, There is an unimaginable amount you can learn from other places, especially foreign countries and cultures. Travel experiences will expose you to different perspectives, histories, and opinions, and in turn can help you embrace your thirties.


Travel will show you that the world, even if it’s a nearby town, is multi-faceted and can add new sides to you, too. As you get older and wiser, you’re more able to recognize and appreciate the diversity around you as well as your role in the world.
Make sure to get off the beaten path when you travel. Hidden gems may surprise and enrich your experiences. Being more confident in yourself during your thirties can allow you to take these kinds of travel opportunities.

, Taking care of your health is an important part of aging gracefully. Being healthy through exercise and diet can also help you more readily embrace aging and any changes.


Eat healthy meals that meet all of your nutritional needs to maintain your health and well-being. For example, you need to make sure you’re getting enough protein, vitamins, and fiber through foods such as lean meats or nuts, and fruits and vegetables.Make sure to allot time for physical activity, such as walking or jogging, for at least thirty minutes a day. You’ll also want to make sure to include time for rest and relaxation, such as reading a book. These will help underscore your healthy eating habits and contribute to your overall well-being.For example, a 3 mile run will give you time to work out personal or professional problems if you need to while providing your body with needed exercise to maintain your health.In a world where you are easily contacted by cell phones, email, and social media, having unplugged alone time is vital to maintaining your health by minimizing how much input you need to process on a daily basis.For example, you can turn off all electronics at 10pm so that you have an hour or two all to yourself or with your family.

, There are many people who weren’t lucky enough to make it to 30. Be thankful for the fact that you are alive and for everything you have, which may help you counteract any negative thoughts that may arise about turning 30.


Make a list of everything for which you’re grateful. In situations where you feel negative, read the list of things for which you’re grateful. This will remind you to stay positive.

Be aware that anxiety-related procrastination is a specific type.,
Improve your decision making skills.,
Become more self-efficacious.,
Head off fears that might lead to procrastination.",How to Beat Anxiety Related Procrastination1," Procrastination is quite common, and there are several different types of procrastination. If you become anxious due to worrying about failing, making the wrong choice, or for other reasons, then you are probably a “worrier procrastinator.” This type of procrastination is often characterized by:Being indecisive.
Lacking confidence.
Relying heavily on other people.
Being afraid to take risks.;
, Having good decision making skills can help you to avoid procrastinating when you have a difficult problem to deal with. Some things you can do to improve your decision making skills include:


Getting into the habit of describing your problem in detail.
Listing all of your alternatives.
Analyzing your options to help you choose the best one.
Carrying out your plan and reflecting on the outcome.

, Being self-efficacious is when you feel confident in your ability to control your life and to get results when you set a goal. Developing this skill can help to make it easier for you to avoid procrastinating. Some ways to build your self-efficacy include:Reflecting on all of the things you have already accomplished in your life, big and small. This can be as simple as speaking your first words as a baby to something more complex like writing a very long paper for an English class.

Setting realistic goals for yourself. By setting goals that are within your reach, you will have a better chance of achieving them. For example, a realistic goal might be something like reading 10 pages in a textbook, applying to three jobs in a week, or writing the introduction paragraph to a paper.

Finding a role model. If you know someone who always seems to accomplish their goals and get things done, then you might consider making this person your role model. Pay attention to their habits and see what you can learn from them.

, Fears about failing can cause some people to procrastinate. By working on this fear, you may be able to reduce the urge to procrastinate.


Try to start thinking like a scientist. Scientists learn by trial and error. If you can change your way of looking at tasks as opportunities to learn, then you might find it easier to get started in the first place.
For example, if you find yourself feeling worried about failing, then you might try asking yourself, “What might I learn from this experience if I am willing to take a risk?” Or, you might ask yourself, “What things could I do to overcome a fear of failing?”"

Understand how anger affects your physical and emotional health.",How to Get Angry," If you want to get angry to get motivated and learn to use your anger for positive change in your life, it's important to go about it the right way. The easiest way to make yourself angry? Sweat the small stuff.


Your boss usually slams you with work last minute, just as you're about to head off shift? If you usually grin and bear it, let some anger creep in.
Your partner sometimes keeps you frozen out, being uncommunicative and cold? Don't sweep it under the rug and make excuses. Get angry.
Your friend talks about your other friends behind their backs, constantly tattling and spreading gossip? Don't ignore bad behavior like this.;
, The next time someone starts a sentence with, ""Don't take this personally, but..."" all you've got to do is refuse. Assume everything is a personal slight, or has an ulterior motive behind it, to let yourself get motivated.


Don't just look at words, look at actions. If someone talks over you constantly, or forgets your name, or decides to ignore you for some reason, assume ill intent.

, If you want to project your anger outward, one way of motivation yourself can be to blame circumstances. If you grew up in a working class home, use that to explain your inability to get ahead, and let it motivate yourself to work harder than those who grew up with silver spoon in mouth.


Also, stay focused on other people's advantages in the world. If someone went to a college you'd never be able to afford, use that to explain their success, instead of their skill. Stay focused on what other people have that you do not have.

, Sometimes all you've got to do to get furious is to pay attention to what's happening around you. Pick up the newspaper, turn on the radio, and stay focused on stories on injustice in the world. It's all around you.


Cue up an investigative documentary online for a quick fix of global fury. Some classics include ""The Act of Killing"" or ""Thin Blue Line.""

, You can't always control the situations that make you angry, all of the time, but you do have power of how you choose to express your anger. Anger is something you can bring out in yourself, and learn to control, and you can start doing it today. Don't cop out and believe that your anger is beyond your ability to control it, or that you can't use anger.

, Anger is like water. Properly harnessed, you can use it for great power and energy, channeling it to propel turbines and create electricity that keeps a whole town running. Uncontrolled, it creates tidal waves that destroys that same town. Learn to build up your anger dams properly, and you can use that anger for good, constructive purposes, not to lay waste to tiny villages.

, Anger doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. You need to adopt a manageable series of goals for yourself to get things under control, but use that anger in a product way. Never attempt to stop getting angry. Don't choose to control your anger, choose to control the way your anger manifests itself.


If you're a yeller, make the goal of not raising your voice when you feel angry. Learn to communicate without shouting as a goal.
If you bottle up your anger and suddenly release it at seemingly little things, make your goal processing the things that make you angry before they turn into rage somewhere down the road.
However your anger manifests itself, the most unhealthy thing that you can do is become violent with yourself or with others. Under no circumstances should you allow yourself to punch things, break things, or hit anyone.

, What is it that sets you off? Try to identify and anticipate the situations, places, and people who get your anger boiling, so you can learn to prepare to address your anger when it arises, and channel that anger into its most productive uses.


Dig slightly below the surface. If you say that ""your boss"" sometimes makes you angry, try an think about when, where, and why that's the case. What does your boss emphasize that makes you feel angry? Try to understand what happens.
Be as honest as possible. If you're feeling angry because you're embarrassed that your boss called you out in front of the other employees, was it warranted? Did you screw up and deserve it, or was it totally out of the blue?

, Psychologist John Riskind suggests that the most dangerous element of anger is the feeling that it's speeding up and quickly moving out of our control.This feeling often makes people do things that might seem helpful in the immediate sense, like yelling at the person who cut you off in traffic, but which have a longer-lasting consequence, of embarrassing your partner, threatening a stranger, and raising your blood pressure. He assigns the values accordingly:


90 miles per hour and above: boiling, explosive, violent
70-85: fuming, outraged, infuriated, enraged  
50-65 miles per hour : bitter, indignant , pissed off , mad, angry 
30-45 : agitated, perturbed , annoyed, irritated, frustrated
Below 30: calm and cool, peaceful, tranquil

, It's important to abruptly snap yourself to attention to avoid a violent outburst and recollect your thoughts. For a lot of people, if you're getting into the 90 mph (140 km/h) + territory on a regular basis, a little pain reminder can be extremely helpful. Put a rubber band around your wrist and snap it every time you feel yourself becoming angry enough to boil over. Let the little pain reminder center your thoughts and focus. You're bigger than your anger.When your anger gets above the normal speed limits, you're going to need progressively more time to decompress and process that anger. Learn to assign a value to your anger, then prepare to process it, and start doing so immediately.

, In some cases, the best way to start processing your anger in the moment is just to leave the room, leave the house, leave the office, and give yourself a chance to decompress for a minute. If anyone looks up, curious about what you're doing, say something outlaid, which can help to reinforce what you're doing to yourself, as well as everyone else. Say something like:


""I'm fine, I just need to get some air.""
""I'm going for a walk, I'm ok, I'll be right back.""
""I'm a little frustrated, so I'm going to go outside for a minute. Everything's fine.""

, It's a cliché for a reason. Deep breathing is proven to reduce stress hormones and calm you down more quickly than anything else.Close your eyes and take five deep breaths, holding it for five seconds, then releasing it slowly.


This might seem corny, but visualize your anger as a black, goopy substance that you breathe out every time you exhale. As you hold your breath, feel it building up and feel the relief as you let it move out of your body.

, It's important to not avoid the things that make you angry, but control your outburst response and return to address things in a calm and collected way. If you've slowed down to a more manageable speed limit, you'll be able to do that.


Head back into the meeting and tell your boss privately why you felt singled out unfairly. Ask what you can do to avoid this situation next time. Use a calm, even tone.

, Anger can be a powerful motivational tool. Michael Jordan used to tack up trash talking quotes from other players in his locker and use it as motivation, which fueled six NBA championships and numerous other accolades. Instead of letting your anger bubble over and break a dish in your kitchen, use it to get things done.If you get angry that another employee constantly gets complimented while you are ignored, put that angry energy into doing more and better work next week. Do so much work you'll have to get noticed.
If you get angry at something more difficult to identify or understand, like feelings of frustration with your relationship, you'll need to focus on communicating your feelings and discussing them with the parties involved. It might take making a big change, like breaking up, if you feel like you're in an unchangeable situation.

, The best way to deal with anger is to get busy with whatever work it is you've got to do. Productive things you can do instead of letting anger drive you into an unproductive mud hole:


Clean the kitchen
Organize your garage
Do homework
Bake something delicious
Hit the heavy bag at the gym
Write

, Remember that it's never wrong to feel anger, it's only wrong to allow your anger to overwhelm your sensibilities and force you to do things you know are wrong, or are inappropriate. The feeling that your anger is wrong will often force angry people to bottle up the rage and make it worse down the line.

, Aside from offering an excellent distraction from whatever it is that's making you angry, getting some exercise can be an excellent way of processing anger and ridding your body of stress, upping the production of endorphins that will relax you in the long run.It's difficult to feel angry too long when you're too busy sweating to care. Do something that will keep you moving:


Play basketball
Try boxing
Go jogging
Try circuit training

, While it may seem like smoking a cigarette or taking a shot of whiskey might be a good anger-reliever, depending on self-destructive externals to help you get through your angry patches won't serve you in the long term. Not to mention the fact that alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs actually increase and amplify the physical effects of anger, like blood pressure and heart disease.

, Everyone gets angry. Properly managed, anger is a motivational tool and a perfectly normal emotion. But for a lot of people, that anger can quickly spiral out of control, which can be harmful to your physical and emotional well being.


High levels of stress and anger come with higher rates of heart disease, cholesterol levels, diabetes, immune system problems, insomnia, and high blood pressure.
People who suffer from frequent outbursts of anger often report clouded thinking, difficulty concentrating, and higher instances of depression.

Break your tasks down.,
Set goals.,
Take a break.,
Reward yourself.,
Forgive yourself.",How to Beat Anxiety Related Procrastination2," Taking large tasks and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable action steps can help you beat your anxiety related procrastination.Breaking the task down can make the task seem less overwhelming, which can help you feel less anxious about getting it done.


For instance, you can break a report for work down into researching it, writing it, and editing it.
Or, you might break a school paper into the introduction, main points, and conclusion. Then work on completing one section rather than the whole thing.

, It can be especially helpful to set goals when you have anxiety because your anxiety can make it difficult for you to focus on and complete activities. Some research suggests that doing things like setting goals and deadlines for your tasks can help you beat procrastination.Setting goals gives you something concrete, self-defined, and manageable that you can do.


Create specific goals with deadlines for the things you need to get done. For instance, you might say, “I will finish cleaning my room by 10 PM.”
Make your goals realistic. For example instead of setting a goal to finish a 10-page report in one day, set a goal to finish the first two pages in one day. Setting goals that are too difficult can actually increase your anxiety rather than reduce it.

, It may seem like a good idea to keep ‘plugging at it’ once you start working so that you don’t lose your steam and start procrastinating. But, taking a break to de-stress, relieve tension, and recharge your brain and body is a better way to address your anxiety and your anxiety related procrastination.Take a five minute break when you complete one of the action steps for your task.
Sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, and just take a few minutes to be still and quiet.

, When you complete a task or reach one of the goals that you have set for yourself, you should congratulate and encourage yourself with a small reward. Incentives can help motivate you as well as give you incentive to meet other goals.


For instance, when you complete one of your action tasks, you might treat yourself to a piece of candy or a 5-minute break to play one of your favorite online games.
Or, for example, you might treat yourself to the new shoes you’ve been eyeing when you finish a major report on time.

, It can be easy to beat yourself up when you procrastinate on doing something. Some evidence suggests, though, that doing this may make it more likely that you will procrastinate again.Instead, give yourself a break and forgive yourself if you procrastinate because of your anxiety.


Remind yourself that procrastinating doesn’t make you a lazy or bad person. You might say, “I procrastinated on this, but it doesn’t mean I’m not a hard worker.”
Reduce some of the pressure on yourself by saying things like, “I didn’t start on time for this assignment, but I’m not going to beat myself up. I can and will do better next time.”

Seek treatment from a professional.,
Develop coping strategies.,
Build a support system.",How to Beat Anxiety Related Procrastination3," If you aren’t currently seeking help for your anxiety, then you should do so. While you can manage anxiety and your anxiety related procrastination on your own, medical and mental health professionals can provide you with effective treatment, support, and information.You can check with your school counselor or the human resources representative at your job for references for professionals.
Talk to your physician about your feelings of anxiety. For example, you could try saying, “Could I schedule an appointment to talk about some anxiety I’ve been having?”
If you are currently receiving treatment, talk to your service provider about techniques you can use to overcome your procrastination. You might ask your therapist, “Are there strategies I can use when my anxiety is causing me to procrastinate?”

, You will be able to handle your anxiety and your anxiety related procrastination if you use strategies to reduce your stress and calm you. There is a respectable amount of research that suggests that using coping techniques like mindfulness meditation and deep breathing can reduce anxiety.Practice taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale slowly and deeply. Hold the breath for a beat or two. Slowly and deeply exhale. Repeat these steps as many times as needed to reduce your anxiety.
Try mindfulness techniques to center yourself and calm down when you feel your anxiety building. Being mindful, or aware of yourself, can help you cope with the physical and emotional symptoms of your anxiety.
Practice doing stretches and other physical activities like yoga to help reduce some of the anxiety you feel.

, One of the best things you can do to cope with your anxiety is to let your friends and family support you.People that care about you can provide support, encouragement, or just a listening ear to help you beat your anxiety related procrastination.

Prioritize your activities.,
Make time for you.,
Nurture your body.",How to Beat Anxiety Related Procrastination4," Having too much on your plate and not enough time to do it can stress anyone. It can be even more stressful when you have anxiety and have to overcome anxiety related procrastination. Prioritizing your activities and tasks will help you keep perspective on what needs to be done and help you feel less overwhelmed.Make a list of all the things you need to get done. Highlight, circle, or put a star beside those things that are time-sensitive or will have serious negative consequences if they aren’t completed.
Make an effort to complete your important/ high priority tasks first.

, With so many things that you need to get done and so many responsibilities and obligations that you are trying to meet, you may not make much time to do things that you enjoy. You can tackle anxiety and beat anxiety related procrastination if you make sure that you are carving some time out to do something fun or relaxing for yourself.


Spend at least a few hours each week doing something like writing, reading, biking, sleeping, or binge watching webisodes.
Take a few minutes each evening to do something that you want to do – not that you need to do.

, Procrastinating can cause you to have to rush to complete tasks and activities. In your rush, you may be sacrificing your health by skipping meals, pulling ‘all-nighters’, and doing other things to try to make more time to finish your tasks.


Make sure you are getting 6 – 8 hours of sleep each night.
Eat balanced meals and nutritious snacks so you have the energy to complete your tasks and activities.
Stop smoking. Research suggests that quitting smoking can help you improve your physical health, as well as reduce your anxiety.Avoid alcohol and substance abuse. Mixing either of these with your anxiety can create more problems for you."

Determine the extent of the damage.,
Don’t hide your mistake.,
Don’t rationalize your bad deed or deeds.,
Plan what you’ll say ahead of time.,
Have a solution ready.,
Be forthright.,
Stay calm and collected.,
Don’t expect forgiveness.,
Give the other person time.,
Ask what you could do to make up for what you did.,
Seek professional help if necessary.,
Prepare for a potentially long process of recovery.",How to Admit You've Done Bad Things," It’s important to understand exactly how bad a mistake is before admitting to it. If you underestimate the damage, you run the risk of coming across as incompetent or uncaring.


You may need to speak with a neutral third party to accomplish this task. This is particularly true if you’ve hurt somebody, whether physically or emotionally. Talking with a mutual friend or relative may help you determine if the person you hurt is even willing to speak with you at all. If the person you’ve hurt is not willing to speak with you, do not attempt to contact them.
If you’ve made a mistake at work, assessing the damage is especially critical. Your boss needs to know that you’re on top of your error. Otherwise, she may not trust you to fix it.;
, The cover-up is often worse than the crime.If you’ve done something bad, admitting it as soon as possible can lessen the damage. This is especially true if you’ve made a serious mistake at work that cost your employer money.If you have bullied someone at school, you need to own up to it. Bullying is much more harmful than you may think. For one thing, bullying victims are far more likely to consider committing suicide than other students.Admitting a mistake may cause other people to be more suspicious of you in the short term. But over the long term, if you establish a reputation as someone who owns up to even the worst errors, other people may trust you more., Human beings often fall back on rationalizing when they do something bad. Common rationalizations include “oh, it wasn’t so bad” or “it’s OK, everybody does it.”People who abuse their spouse and/or children frequently rationalize their actions. People who suffer from addiction to alcohol or drugs tend to do it as well.Many abusers and addicts are not willing to admit that they are wrong at all. But admitting that you have a problem is the first step towards stopping.
There are a variety of different tests available online that you can take to determine if you have a problem with alcohol or other drugs.The key thing to remember is that if your use of alcohol or drugs is causing problems in your life, and you’ve tried to stop but can’t, you may have a problem.Determining if you are an abuser can be a little trickier. But if you often feel resentment towards your partner or children, you may be at risk for abusing them.Other warning signs include high degrees of jealousy, controlling behavior, and quickly resorting to using physical force in an argument., By planning out your assessment of your mistake, you will seem more competent and prepared. If you’ve done something that you fear will sabotage a friendship or marriage, planning out what you’ll say (and even rehearsing it several times) will show how seriously you’re taking the situation.

, The other party may not agree with your proposed solution. But if you don’t have something ready to go, you run the risk of looking like you want someone else to fix your mistake. Proposing a solution is a critical part of owning up to an error., Being as open and honest as possible about your mistake might be the most important thing you can do. By taking full ownership of your error you can show how contrite you are. You can also show how committed you are to fixing the damage that you’ve caused.Beginning with an apology rather than any sort of justification or rationalization can help smooth tensions. For instance, don’t include a statement like “This is partially your fault too.” Simply say “I’m sorry, I know I screwed up and jeopardized our relationship” or “I’m sorry, I know I’ve cost the company money.”
Don’t say “I’m sorry if I offended you.” That may come across as halfhearted or insincere. Saying “I’m sorry for what I did” or “I’m sorry for offending you” will demonstrate that you’re well aware of the full impact of your actions.

, Getting angry or amped up in any way may lead to increased tensions. And if you’re stressed out, you won’t be able to think clearly. Staying calm will help you maintain control of yourself.Try taking a few deep breaths to help calm yourself down. Breathe in through your nose as you count up to five, and then breathe out through your mouth as you count down from five.
You can also try using progressive muscle relaxation before you speak with the person, which is when you tighten and release each of the muscles in your body.

, Forgiveness is up to the other person to give. They may not think you deserve it. If that’s the case, be humble. Understand that there may be serious repercussions in store for you even if you’ve come clean about your mistakes.If the person does no forgive you, then try saying something like, “I understand and you have every right to be mad. Again, I am very sorry, and I'd love to make it up to you when and if you're ready.”

, Some people can forgive sooner than others. If you’ve done something particularly bad, you may need to give the other person weeks or even months before they’ll be willing to talk to you again. If you’ve made a serious mistake at work, your boss may impose increased scrutiny on you in the future, for instance by subjecting you to a probationary period of time during which another mistake could lead to your dismissal.


If the other person doesn't want to see you again, don’t attempt to contact them. This is especially the case if they initiate legal action (like taking out a restraining order) against you. If that happens, read the order carefully and follow its instructions to the letter. Doing otherwise can leave you open to harsh penalties, although these will vary by state.If your mistake costs you your job, don’t dwell on it. Learn from your mistake. Be open about it in the future. Most importantly, do your best to make sure nothing like it ever happens again. Remember that failure can be an excellent teacher. If you never make a mistake, you may never learn much., If something you admitted to doing has affected your relationship with someone, then you might try asking that person what you could do to help rebuild and repair the trust between you. Or, if what you did has affected your own happiness, then committing to change may be a good option.

For example, if you admitted to cheating on your significant other, then asking the person what you can do to regain their trust may help. The person might request more contact with you throughout the day, such as by calling more often to check in.
If you want to commit to change for yourself, then consider what changes would help to restore your faith in yourself. You might decide that seeking help for a drinking problem and getting sober would help to restore your faith in yourself.

, It’s common to feel shame after you’ve done something bad.Don’t let this feeling overwhelm you. If you do, you may be more likely to do something just as bad in the future.


Talk to your doctor about finding a therapist or other specialist if you think you require mental health counseling. You can also call a national referral hotline.The National Institute on Abuse and Alcoholism maintains a 24-hour hotline and other resources to help people with addictions start the recovery process., Sometimes bad actions are rooted in deep-seated behavior that can take years or even decades to unlearn. Addiction and abusiveness are good examples.Don’t let yourself get discouraged if that’s the case. Dealing with your problem is always better than succumbing to it, even if recovery seems too difficult at the outset.

Remember that the United States constitution still holds true.,
Recognize that Congress can keep the president from overstepping.,
Recognize that the judicial branch also can limit the powers of the president.,
Recall that the president has lots of advisers.,
Remember that presidential terms are temporary.",How to Cope with Fears of a Trump Presidency1," People still have their constitutional rights, and no one can undo this. Some of the things that Trump pledges to do violate the Constitution; thus, he can't legally do them.Laws don't go away just because they are inconvenient to someone.


The first amendment includes freedom of religion. This means that Muslims are protected under the constitution.
The first amendment allows a free press and the right to express dissent. It will never be illegal to speak out against Trump, as long as you are honest.
The fifth amendment protects people's right to due process. Family members of terrorists can't legally be attacked simply due to them being related to the wrong person.
The fourteenth amendment states that people need equal protection under the law. This means that targeting people based on race/ethnicity, religion, gender, et cetera is unconstitutional.;
, The system of checks and balances allows the legislative branch to curtail the powers of the president. Congress can...Override presidential vetoes
Approve treaties and presidential appointments
Investigate
Impeach the president if necessary
Furthermore, Congresspeople are up for election every 2 or 6 years, and want to be re-elected (and to be good people). This means that even if they are of the same political party as the president, they won't necessarily follow if the president begins doing ridiculous things.

, The Supreme Court may rule against actions of the president.It can rule that a president's action is unconstitutional (or that a new law is unconstitutional)
The president can't fire the justices, and justices appointed by a certain president are not beholden to agree with the president or the president's party (see David Souter and John Roberts)

, These advisers will speak up if the president is trying to do something ridiculous, unwise, or illegal. They can advise the president on everything from policy to basic manners.


Government officials are required not to follow orders that break laws., Donald Trump will not be president forever, nor will Republicans have control of Congress until the end of time. It may help to think of this election as a temporary thing.


A president is in office for 4 years, and then runs for re-election, in which they may or may not win the seat for another 4 years. The Constitution limits them to 2 terms (8 years total).
Every 2 years, many Congresspeople are up for (re)election. Congress may switch to be in favor or one party or another.
After one bad president, the next president and Congress may work hard to undo some of the damage they did. For example, after Watergate, Congress passed laws to limit spying on opposing parties."

Don't deny it.,
Recognize how your body responds to your anger.,
Control your thoughts.,
Try not to swear the small stuff.,
Develop peace of mind.,
Think of all the pain you might cause others with your anger.,
Start working out.,
Try to funnel your energy into activities you enjoy.,
Check how your body responds.,
Slow down and lower your voice.,
Tell people that you don't want to get angrier.,
Ask questions.,
Know when you're about to explode.,
Practise.",How to Find Productive Outlets for Your Anger Issues," Anger is just another emotion we feel and it's our human nature, so denying it by saying ""I'm not angry,"" ""I'm fine,"" will just make things worse.;
, We usually don't really feel like we're angry perhaps because we're used to it or we're very much into the conversation that we can't feel anything but negative and angry thoughts. Some people respond by gritting their teeth, tensing in muscles, rising in blood pressure or breathing heavily or shorting. Knowing how you feel angry will help you a lot.

, Jealousy, failure or any kind of negative thoughts always makes us angry. Instead of thinking deep in those thoughts. You can make them your motivation. For example, you feel jealous of classmate because he gets good marks or your friend in work because he got a rise. Think of how much work they've done to achieve their goal and work harder.


Sometimes it's not people who are the reason for your anger but your own thoughts like the fear of something or not getting what you want. Be flexible and deal with that fear with a brave heart. Or if you're angry because you can't get what you want, be grateful for what you have and work hard to get it. Even if you think it's out of your hands, there must a part that's related to you and you must try to change the situation.

, We all want thing to be perfect but we're humans not gods and so the idea of perfectionism aren't all the time necessary. Be flexible with life and don't bother your mind with everything someone does wrong or even you. We learn from our mistakes, so it's fine. (The environment is dying, people are dying and life still goes on.)

, Try to hold back your anger (not hold in!) or slow it down. Think how much people would be hurt by your loud voice, hurtful words and by thinking that people aren't perfect. You may be put in their situation someday, so treat them as you'd like to be treated.


You also need to keep in mind that anger won't get you far. You won't be able to argue properly if you're angry as you will think less and feel more\, and may lash out.

, Rejection, hurtful words or aggression are all things that hit us right in the heart. When you get angry, get better instead.

, No one can deny that anger gives us a strong energy and makes us feel fired up. So, instead of hurting people or doing things you'd regret later, join a gym in the neighbourhood or start practising your favourite sport. If you can't afford it or it's too far away, you can save up/buy a boxing bag or even do some simple cardio.


You can also practise Yoga or some breathing techniques, which can help a lot.

, Similar to working out, there are other pursuits that require attention and energy. If you find yourself feeling angry a lot of the time, try a new hobby that takes focus, like writing, model-making, or painting. Making this kind of activity a habit can help channel your emotions, give you time to reflect on what's upsetting you, and provide a productive end result as well.

, After becoming familiar with the physical symptoms of your anger, you will know when you're starting to get angry and so you shall know that you're supposed to calm yourself down.

, Doing this will help you think more and make you feel more calm. It will also encourage the person you're arguing with to stay calm too, rather than escalating the disagreement.

, If the argument is getting heated, tell the other person that you're already angry and you don't like it. Let them know you need some time to cool down; they'll likely appreciate your self-reflection and honesty.

, Lead yourself towards understanding the other person. Use questions like, ""What did I do to make you feel this way?,"" ""How did I make you look stupid when I said that? I want to know my mistake."" This will show that you're a good listener and that you care for that person. It will also help them calm down to think of the an answer.

, You may get to the point that you can't handle it anymore. In this case, you should shift your attention to something else to relax. If that doesn't work, just excuse yourself and leave.

, Yes, even managing anger needs to be practised. You won't be able to get any better at managing your anger by just reading this. Instead, try to honestly change yourself and stop getting mad on the very small things. That way, you'll be able to handle frustrating matters with less intensity.

Dismiss any fears about the president becoming a dictator.,
Recall that many presidents throughout history have not been able to accomplish all their goals.,
Consider Trump's limited popularity among the American people.,
Recognize that the media will be watching Trump.,
Consider the fact that Trump has made enemies.,
Recognize that President Trump will, someday, be running for re-election.,
Remember that people are not going to quietly surrender any human rights.,
Remember that you, and everyone around you, has the right to protest.",How to Cope with Fears of a Trump Presidency2," Unlike 1930s Germany, America is not undergoing a severe economic crisis, nor is the country shrouded in despair. America has not undergone any staggering defeats. Germans had little to lose and, at the time, thought Adolf Hitler was their only hope. Americans as a group do not need to cling to a sole political figure in order to feel positive about the future, because America is doing much better than this. It would be much harder for a would-be dictator to justify their actions.


Some commentators argue that Germany has had a culture focusing on obedience, which made it easier for Hitler to assume power.America has the opposite today: one focused on questioning authority.

, For example, when President Obama tried to pass the Affordable Care Act, the media often discussed how his hands were tied.Many presidents who have tried to pass certain bills have ended up making lots of compromises, or failing completely. Trump will face resistance when he tries to create change, just like all the other presidents.


America has a lot of bureaucracy. This makes it hard to change.
Try researching past presidents and their goals. How effective were they? What actually got done?

, The 2016 race was a very close one, with Clinton winning the popular vote while Trump won the electoral one.Trump's support is limited, and he knows it.

, Trump is a very popular subject to talk about—so people will continue watching him and talking about him. The media will help continue to ensure transparency, so that people know what their president is doing.

, Many members of his own party have withdrawn their support for him. Trump has insulted many people,and done things that some people consider unconscionable, and these people are unlikely to be eager to work together with him.


Trump's campaign is said to have a list of enemies.Recall that politics involves a lot of compromise and working together.

, If he wants to have any chance of winning, he'll need to be a good president. Being a good president is in his best interest.


Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. This means that if he wants a good chance of winning in the future, he'll need to win over more voters.
Trump will most likely want to have a positive legacy and impact on the country.

, Many people believe that all Americans deserve respect and compassion. It is incredibly hard to take away people's rights from them.


Black/African American people are not quiet about racial profiling, nor would they be quiet about any policies that would increase it.
Hispanic/Latino families will not sit quietly if their families are at risk for being torn apart.
People with uteruses are not likely to silently return to the days when desperate pregnant people would throw themselves down stairs or mutilate their bodies with coat hangers and other dangerous tools.LGBT+ people would fight back against a return to the days before marriage equality.

, You can speak out against policies that you feel would harm Americans. You still have a voice, and will always be able to use it.

Knowing how your body feels when you get angry and stressed will help you figure out when you are about to explode. Some physical signs might include:


Your jaws are clenched and your muscles tense.
Your head or stomach hurts.
Your heart starts racing.
You get sweaty, even on the palms of your hands.
Your face flushes.
Your body or your hands shake.
You get dizzy.;
, Your emotions may start to fluctuate, which can bring on feelings of anger. Some emotional signs that you may experience include:


Irritation
Sadness
Depression
Guilt
Resentment
Anxiousness
Defensiveness

, Get your anger under control before you start communicating with someone. Otherwise, you may say something you regret. Take deep breaths to clear your head and to initiate your body’s calming response. Try these steps:


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.

, If you feel yourself getting angry and are experiencing physical and emotional symptoms of anger, tell yourself that you don’t have to react right away. Count to ten to calm yourself down and give yourself a chance to think. Reserve a reaction for the moment and give yourself time to sort out your feelings., If you feel your blood start to boil, leave the situation. Take a walk. Not having the stimulus in front of you, the thing or person you are mad at, will help you calm yourself down., If you find yourself getting angry, calm down and talk through the problem rationally to yourself. Use your reasoning before your body gets out of control. Before anger takes over your mind, you can “talk yourself down.” Even if you might not feel like you can control this process, you can keep the positive dialog going on in your head to help you practice dealing with your anger in a different way.


For example, you can say to yourself: “My boss yells at me every day. I have a hard time dealing with this and it makes me angry. I’m allowed to be angry, but I can’t allow this to take over my life or ruin my day. I can deal with my boss assertively even though he is acting aggressively. I am looking for another job, but in the meantime, every time he yells, I can tell him it’s difficult to understand him when he’s so upset. If there is a problem, let’s sit and talk about it so I can help him come up with a solution. If there is anything that he needs me to do, I can do it if he can manage to tell me what it is without yelling at me. This way, I can keep my cool while teaching him how to behave well.”

, Rating your anger can help you realize what type of events make you angry and the degree they make you angry. Some events might cause mild irritation, while others might trigger you to blow your top. You don’t need an official anger scale. You can make your own; for instance, you can rate your anger on a scale of one to ten, or zero to one hundred.

, If you feel that you’re getting angry pretty regularly, it might help to keep track of the situations that anger you. You can track the degree to which they anger you, and what else was happening at the time. You can also keep track of how you react when you’re angry, as well as how other people react to your anger.Think about the following questions when keeping an anger journal:


What provoked the anger?
Rate your anger.
What thoughts occurred as you got angry?
How did you react? How did others react to you?
What was your mood right before it happened?
What symptoms of anger did you feel in your body?
How did you react? Did you want to leave, or act out (such as bang the door or hit something or someone), or did you say something sarcastic?
What were your emotions immediately after the incident?
What were your feelings a few hours after the episode?
Was the episode resolved?
Keeping track of this information will help you learn what situations and triggers you have to your anger. Then you can work to avoid those situations when possible, or predict when these situations occur if they are unavoidable. It will also help you track the progress you make at handling situations that anger you.

, A trigger is something that happens or that you experience that brings on an emotion or a memory. Some common triggers for anger are:


Not being able to control other’s actions
Other people disappointing you for not meeting your expectations.
Not being able to control daily life events, such as traffic.
Someone trying to manipulate you.
Getting mad at yourself for a mistake.

, Anger can become a big problem if your anger causes you to act aggressively towards other people. When anger is a constant reaction to everyday events and to the people around you, you can lose enjoyment and enrichment in our lives. Anger can interfere with your job, your relationships, and your social life. You can be incarcerated if you assault another person.Anger is a very powerful emotion that needs to be understood clearly to overcome its impact.


Anger can make people feel entitled to the point where they can rationalize reasons to act in a socially irresponsible way. People who experience road rage, for instance, might feel justified when they run someone off the road because that person mistakenly cut them off.

, Some people use anger to avoid dealing with painful emotions. They get a temporary boost to their self-esteem. This also happens with people who have a really good reason to be angry. But when you use anger to avoid painful emotions, the pain still exists, and it isn’t a permanent fix., A person can become accustomed to using anger as a distraction from pain. This is because anger is easier to deal with than pain. It can make you feel more in control. In this way, anger becomes a chronic way of dealing with feelings of vulnerability and fear.
Many times, our automatic reaction to incidences have to do with the painful memories of our past. Your automatic anger reactions could be something you learned from a parent or caregiver. If you had a parent who got angry about everything and one parent who tried to keep that parent from getting angry, you have two models of dealing with anger: passive and aggressive. Both of these models are counterproductive to dealing with anger.
If you were a victim of child abuse and neglect, for example, you had a model of dealing with anger that is counterproductive (aggressive).While examining these feelings can be painful, understanding what you were provided when you were a child will help you understand the ways you learned to cope with stress, difficult life situations, and difficult emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger.

It's important to seek professional help for life traumas such as child abuse and neglect. Sometimes a person can re-traumatize himself without intending to by revisiting painful memories without the support of a clinician.



, In passive anger expression, you don’t actually deal directly with the person who hurt or angered you. Instead, your wish to get even comes out in other ways. For example, you might talk negatively behind the person’s back or insult the person at a later time., Aggressive anger expressions are most problematic because of the possibility of violence and negative consequences for failure to control angry outbursts. This can interfere with everyday functioning if anger happens every day and is out of control.For example, you might shout and yell at someone, or even hit, when you express your anger aggressively.

, Assertive expression of anger is the most constructive way to express your anger. Assertiveness cultivates mutual respect for each other. You can still express your anger, but you do so in a way that doesn’t accuse the other person. You have mutual respect for each other.Assertive communication emphasizes that both people’s needs are important. To communicate assertively, give the facts without making accusations. Simply state how the action made you feel. Stick to what you know and not what you think you know. Then ask the other person if he is willing to talk. For example, you might say: “I was hurt and angry because I felt like you were belittling my project when you laughed during my presentation. Can we talk and work this out?”

, Get a handle on what you’re feeling. Be more specific than “good” and “bad.” Try to pinpoint the emotions that you’re feeling, such as jealousy, guilt, loneliness, hurt, and so on., Talk about your own feelings without placing judgement on the other person. Using “I” statements will increase the likelihood that the other person will not become defensive and will listen to what you’re saying.The “I” statement conveys that you have a problem, not that the other person has a problem. For example, you might say:


“I feel embarrassed when you tell your friends when we have had a fight.”
“I feel hurt that you forgot my birthday.”

, You are the expert on how you are feeling, not on the other person’s shortcomings. Instead of blaming the other person for doing something that makes you feel bad, focus on your own feelings. When you figure out how you’re feeling, convey the real feeling, such as hurt. Keep judgment statements out of it. Stick to things that pertain to you.


For example, instead of saying, “You’re never around at dinnertime anymore,” you can say, “I feel lonely and I miss our talks over dinner.”
For example, you might say: “I feel that you are not being sensitive to my feelings when you read your paper instead of listen to what I’m trying to say.”

, When you are confronting the other person, give specific examples that demonstrate what may have led to you to feel a certain way. Instead of saying, “I feel lonely,” give the reason for why you feel lonely. For example, say, “I feel lonely when you stay at work late every night. I didn’t get to celebrate my birthday with you.”

, Show respect for the other person when you communicate. This can be as simple as using “please” and “thank you” in your conversation. Then you will foster cooperation and reciprocating respect. When you want something, you should convey that in the form of a request, rather than a demand. You can start your communications this way:“When you have the time, could you…”
“It would be a great help if you… Thanks, I appreciate it!”

, Once you acknowledge your emotions and start to communicate assertively, you can also start to offer solutions. With problem solving, you are doing everything in your power to address the problem.


Take a few minutes to calm yourself down. Figure out the emotions that you’re feeling. Start to strategize about ways to approach this problem.
For example, if your child comes home with a bad report card, you might be angry about his bad grades. Approach this situation with solutions rather than simple anger. Talk to your child about spending more time on homework after school, or suggesting that you line up a tutor for him.
Sometimes you might have to accept that there isn’t a solution to the problem. You might not be able to control a problem, but you can control how you react towards it.

, If you hem and haw, or you make general statements that are not specific, everyone involved will get frustrated.For instance, if your coworker is speaking very loudly on the phone and it’s difficult for you to do your work, you can state your request like this:


“I have a request. Would you please lower the volume of your voice on the telephone? It’s making it very difficult to concentrate on my work. I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.” You are directly addressing the person you need to resolve your issue with, and you are making it clear what you would like to see happen, as well as putting it in the form of a request.

, Therapy is a great way to find new ways of dealing and expressing anger productively. Your therapist will most likely use relaxation techniques that will help you calm down in the middle of an anger episode. Your therapist will also help you deal with the thoughts that can trigger anger and find new ways to view your situations. Therapists will also help you with emotional coping skills and assertiveness communication training., Anger management programs have been shown to have a high rate of success. The most successful programs help you understand your anger, give you short-term strategies to deal with your anger, and help you build skills.There are a wide variety of options for anger management programs as well. For example, there are anger management programs available for teens, executives, police officers, and other populations of people who might be experiencing different types of anger for different reasons.

, Anger is often a part of different disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. Drug therapy for anger will depend on the condition the anger is occurring with. Taking the medications for the disorder could help the anger as well.For example, if your anger is accompanied by depression, you can ask your doctor about antidepressants to treat both the depression and the anger. If irritability is occurring as a part of generalized anxiety disorder, benzodiazepines such as klonopin might be used to treat the disorder. In the meantime, it can help with your irritability.
Each drug has side effects. For example, lithium, which is used to treat bipolar disorder, has a very high rate of renal complications. Being aware of the possible side effects will help you monitor for complications. It’s very important to discuss these possibilities openly with your doctor.
Discuss any addiction problems you have with your doctor. Benzodiazepines, for example, are addictive substances. The last thing you need when you are struggling with alcohol, for instance, is to add another addiction. This should be discussed candidly with your doctor to help him decide which medication is best for you.

Remain calm.,
Realize that you can’t control someone else.,
Ask what is upsetting the person.,
Validate the person’s emotions.",How to Deal With an Adult's Temper Tantrum1," If you become angry or defensive yourself, you will likely exacerbate the tantrum that the other person is having. If you can keep yourself calm and rational, it’s likely that you will be able to diffuse the temper of the other person.;
, One of the most difficult parts of dealing with the emotions of another person—particularly someone who is a close friend or family member—is accepting that you cannot change the thoughts or actions of another person. You can offer help and support, but you cannot actually control another person.

, Adults who are prone to temper tantrums are unlikely to be effective communicators. You may have to ask the person what is causing them to be so upset. Be calm and give them time to fully explain themselves.


Remember to be patient and persistent. You could say, “I know you said that there is nothing wrong, but I can tell by the way you’re acting that you are really upset. Please talk to me about why you are upset so that I can help you if I am able to. If you aren’t ready to talk about it now, please remember that I am here when you are ready.”

, It is important to express to the person having the tantrum that it is okay for them to feel the emotions that they are feeling. Even if you do not agree with the way they are expressing their feelings (in a tantrum), you can tell them that what they are feeling is okay. Accepting feelings (such as anger) as a normal part of life can often help people deal with the emotions in a healthier way.


For example, you might say, “It seems to me that you are feeling angry or hurt because of the situation. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way; can we talk about how you feel and how we can make you feel better?”

, Anger can take you to a whole other level and bring out a much different side of you. It can heighten your senses and put your body on alert. Use your senses to come back down and back into your body.


Listen to music, smell something calming (such as lavender), or imagine yourself in your favorite place, like on a beach or in a forest., Your immediate surroundings can contribute to a tense or irritating feeling. If you feel anger coming on, step outside for a minute for some fresh air, play some music, or do something different than what you were in the middle of doing. A quick change can make the difference between an angry outburst and curbing the feelings productively., You may feel like your anger comes out of nowhere, but there are often signs of rising anger. When you get angry, think about what was happening immediately beforehand. Your body, for instance, sends warnings which can include shallow, quickened breathing, “knots” in the stomach, pounding heart or tensed shoulders.Sometimes situations can trigger a stress response, such as weekly work meetings or heavy traffic. Be aware of how your body reacts to these situations. Once you become aware of these triggers, you can begin to identify them and prevent them or at least express them more constructively.

, Remind yourself that anger doesn’t change your situation at all, and won’t affect an outcome. Anger doesn’t follow any logic, so use logic to your benefit to cool off. Nobody is out to get you, your life is not over, and all is not lost.


Avoid polarized statements like “always”and “never”, as in “You always forget to walk the dog” or “you never close the windows when you leave.” Instead, phrase it as a request: “Would you please walk the dog today?” or “I would appreciate you closing the windows when you leave.”
Get rid of demand. Angry people tend to demand things like being appreciated, being treated with respect, and being treated in fairness. While everyone wants these, it’s different to demand them. Remind yourself that you can form requests and not demands."

Apologize for any wrongdoing on your part.,
Use the words “we” and “us.” Using the words “I” and “you” can create a divide between you and the other person.,
Maintain a neutral or positive tone.,
Stick to the facts when possible.,
Encourage rational thinking.",How to Deal With an Adult's Temper Tantrum2," If you were a part of the reason that the other person is upset, apologize to them for what you did. If you do not feel that you did something wrong per se, you can still apologize for making them feel the way that they feel.


For example, if you did something “wrong,” you might say, “I am very sorry that I accidentally downloaded a virus that destroyed your computer. I can understand why that would make you upset, and I will do whatever I can to help repair or replace the computer.”
For example, if you did not do anything “wrong” but still upset someone, you could say, “I am sorry that I upset you by picking out the paint color for the living room myself. I did not know that it was so important to you. I will try to be more considerate of your feelings in the future.”

, This divide may cause the tantrum-throwing party to become defensive or angrier. However, using “we” or “us” implies that you are a team and might reduce some of the other person’s angry feelings.


For example, the following may cause someone to become more defensive: “You should not be so upset about your computer crashing. My computer crashed and I didn’t get upset at all; I just went and got a new one. You should do the same thing.”
A better example of “team” communication would be, “What can we do together to solve this problem? Can we take it to a repair shop, or is it time for us to invest in a newer, better computer? We can get through this together and make the best of the situation.”

, It is important to avoid sounding condescending or frustrated while speaking with someone who is having a temper tantrum. If they think that you are talking down to them, they may become angrier or stop listening to you. It is also important to avoid sounding sarcastic. Keeping your voice at a consistent volume and tone will help you sound more neutral.

, Abandon emotionally charged language or anything that might be interpreted as an accusation and stick to the facts of the events that upset the person. Emphasizing the facts may not cause the temper tantrum to subside, but it is less likely to make the situation any worse.


For example, saying, “I’m sorry that the computer crashed, but you click on links of cat videos, too. You can hardly say that it was entirely my fault,” may cause the person to become angrier.
Instead, the following factual statements may be less inflammatory: “I clicked on the link and the computer crashed. We cannot change those facts. Now we have to decide what to do about the situation. We could either try to have a company repair the computer or we could purchase a new computer.”

, It might be difficult to convince someone who is having a temper tantrum to use rational thought, but if you can get their rational, thinking mind to overcome their emotional response,they’ll likely snap out of the tantrum. This is an approach for which you need to be particularly careful about not sounding condescending or invalidating.


This may not work for everyone, but helping someone understand that being angry will not help solve the problem might kick start their reasoning mind. You might say, “I understand that you are angry right now, and you have a right to be. Let’s talk through some possible solutions together and figure out how to make this better.”
Make sure that you are validate their feelings, to avoid coming off as condescending or uncaring. You can acknowledge their feelings and encourage problem-solving.

"
Give the person space and time.,
Prompt a change of environment.,
Encourage deep breaths or meditation.,
Suggest a solution to the problem.,
Ask the person what they need in order to feel calmer.,
Revisit sensitive topics at a later time.",How to Deal With an Adult's Temper Tantrum3," Someone who is really in a fit of rage may not be willing to have a reasonable conversation with you. Sometimes, the best option is to give the person some space until they calm down and is capable of sustaining a conversation with you.


This can be difficult if it is someone you live with, but you can go outside, run an errand or two, or go to do a chore or activity in another room.

, Many people respond well to a change of environment if they are feeling angry. .Moving from an indoor space to an outdoor space can be particularly effective, as being outdoors can elevate one’s mood. You can either be direct and say, “You’re upset. Let’s go for a walk and talk about what’s bothering you,” or indirect, saying, “I need to go down the street to get something. Do you want to join me for some fresh air for a few minutes?”

, A good way to deal with anger or other overwhelming emotions is to sit quietly and focus on taking very deep breaths. Combining the deep breathing with some meditation exercises, such as visualizing a happy place or picturing negative emotions exiting the body, can make the breathing even more effective. If the person is willing, you can guide them through a meditation exercise. Instruct them to do the following (you can do it too!): Sit comfortably with both feet on the floor and your hands resting comfortably in your lap. Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath in, allowing your belly to expand with the fullness of your breath. Picture a white light entering every corner of your mind and body as you breathe in.
Breathe out slowly and deliberately, allowing yourself to fully exhale. As you exhale, picture negativity leaving your body as dark, muddy colors, leaving only the light behind.
Repeat for 10-20 breaths or until the person feels relaxed and comfortable.



, If the person who is having a temper tantrum is too overcome with emotions to think rationally or is unwilling to brainstorm a reasonable solution with you, try suggesting a few solutions to the problem. Your cooler head is likely to prevail, and you might get through to them.


Don’t be surprised if the person initially rejects your solutions. They may need some time to calm down and process what you suggested. They could very well return to you later and say that they took one of your suggestions to solve the problem.

, If you are really at a loss as to how to handle or help the person having a temper tantrum, you could try asking them what you can do to help. They may tell you that they just need some time, or a hug, or a walk outside. People who are prone to anger problems may be aware of what helps them cool down when they are angry.

, If you were having a conversation that caused the person to go into a temper tantrum, you should probably drop the topic for now if it is not completely time-sensitive. Give the person time to get over their initial anger and return to it later once they seem calm and rational.

Exercise self-control.,
Establish safety.,
Clarify triggers.,
Resolve the problem.,
Get help.",How to Deal With People Who Have Anger Problems1," Remaining calm is one of the first rules to follow when in an emergency situation. If someone is extremely angry, you need to treat the situation as if it is an emergency.Being calm will help you make on-the-spot decisions. This can be difficult, so remember to breathe. Your body will be telling you it’s an emergency, but you need to tell yourself you are going to be okay.
The person is angry, so you need to show him the opposite emotion: calm. If you match his anger with your anger, then negative emotions will escalate. Don’t allow him to antagonize you into a negative reaction.
Take a step back to get some space. Hold both hands up in a peaceful way in front of you to gesture that you do not want any trouble.;
, Determine if the situation is safe. There is no reason why you should put yourself in harm’s way. Many lives have been changed forever due to mistakenly participating in volatile situations. Self-preservation is a primal instinct.Pay attention to it.


At the first sign of a threat to your safety, leave the area as quickly as you can.
If you are forced to stay, or sense that you can handle the situation, you will need to shift into problem solving mode.

, Clarify what situation has triggered the person's outburst. Every situation is going to be different. Anger runs on a spectrum, from irritation to rage.If you are more familiar with the angry person, then you may be more aware of what triggers this person’s outbursts. Clarifying what the person is angry about will allow you to make the next decision on how to handle the situation.


Listen to what the person has to say and do not interrupt him. Interrupting or talking over the person will only escalate the situation.

, It is time to take action to resolve the problem. You need to address four things: define what went wrong; generate alternatives for how it can be fixed; select an alternative; and implement your plan.This is the type of discussion that can take place immediately, or you can make plans to discuss it at a later time.


Be clear and tell the person that you are not going to fight with him.
Assure the person that whatever the problem is, it can be resolved.
You may need to suggest that the person take a break or a walk. Or, you may want to do the same and come back later to discuss the problem. Cooler heads prevail. The goal is to create some distance from the negative emotions.
Apologize if and when appropriate. You will need to use your judgement as to when to say this. If you say it too soon, it may make the person angry.

, Enlist the support of others. If the situation escalates and you have tried unsuccessfully to calm the situation, then you will need to call for reinforcements. It takes courage and strength to admit that help is needed, but it is necessary.


Call the police to restore order or report a crime if one has occurred. It is their job to protect and serve. You need to be willing to ask for their help.
Family members or friends may be able to help resolve the matter at hand.
If you are dealing with this type of behavior in your home, then contact a domestic violence hotline in your area for advice and assistance.If this situation occurs in the workplace, contact your Human Resource Representative to discuss your options.

"
Engage openly with the person who angered you.,
Stay respectful.,
Create an outlet for situations that cannot be confronted.,
Focus on your feelings.,
Let it go.",How to Express Anger2," When you have the opportunity to confront someone, talk it out. Make sure you communicate your needs and feelings, while respecting the needs and feelings of the other person.Allow the conversation to be 50/50, talking and listening. It’s important for the other person to feel understood and heard, just as you want him to understand and hear you.

, When you are engaging with someone else about a situation that made you angry, don’t let yourself call the other person names. It’s not constructive, and often actively works against you. Remember your purpose in discussing the situation: you want to try and patch things up with the other person, not make them more angry.Take turns talking. Don’t interrupt while the other person is speaking.
Know when to let things go if you’ve made your point.Sometimes you have to agree to disagree, and drop the issue instead of allowing an argument to go around in circles. .

, Sometimes you want to express your anger to someone but you cannot. You may be upset with a politician, the person who cut you off in traffic, or the person who stole your bag. In these situations you cannot express your anger directly, so create an outlet that allows you to do so.


You can talk to a friend and share your feelings of upset, frustration, and anger.
Write a letter to the person who angered you, describing your feelings. Once finished, burn it, releasing the anger with it.
Sometimes anger can fuel social action.If you’re upset with climate change, for instance, your anger can fuel you to make changes in your life that show your stand such as becoming a lobbyist, signing petitions, and making lifestyle changes like selling your car and choosing to bike instead.

, If it was something that another person did that made you angry, talk about how it made you feel, not their actions. Be sure to give yourself enough time before you talk to the person that made you angry so that you can collect your thoughts and consider what you might say. Some examples of ways to focus on your feelings are:Instead of saying, “I can’t believe you told Wendy about my ticket!”, say “When you talked to Wendy about me like that, it made me sad and angry. I told you those things in confidence.”
Instead of saying, “You’re a hateful person for talking that way!”, say, “I felt small and angry with the way you talked to me last night. I deserve to be talked to with respect, even when you don’t agree with me.”

, If you hold onto anger, it can eat you on the inside. When you feel angry, try to resolve the anger as quickly as possible. Angry at a person? Talk to him about it. Angry about a situation? Create solutions. Do what you can to express the anger, learn from it, then let it go.


Practice radical acceptance: sometimes there are situations that you strongly dislike but cannot control. Learn to radically accept where you are at, even when it’s unpleasant.Instead of pitying yourself, say, “Even though I am uncomfortable in this situation, I accept that this is my current reality.”
Some situations can be more difficult to let go, such as long-standing anger against a deceased family member. Realize that it’s up to you to let things go, even when the other person isn’t there to discuss it with you. You can’t control people who have rejected you or hurt you in any way; you can only control your response."
"
Gain some perspective.,
Avoid bottling your emotions.,
Shake the urge to lash out.,
Express all of your emotions.",How to Express Anger3," Sometimes anger comes out in funny ways: you may be peeved about traffic on the way to work, then snap at your co-worker when he does something a little irritating. Ask yourself if there is a bigger issue that may be fueling your anger.Look for different ways to approach the situation. How would an outsider respond? How important will this issue be in 6 months?Journal about your anger, and what led up to the feeling and behavior. What did the day look like beforehand? What was the ultimate trigger? What thoughts did you have right before the reaction?
Sometimes you may dislike a person, and find many, many things that irritate you about that person that, had someone else done the same thing, wouldn’t irritate you. Recognize that you may have a deep seeded issue with that person that may need to be resolved.

, For some people, getting angry means pulling inward. This is not a healthy way to deal with or express anger, and can be just as destructive as outwardly exploding. When you bottle in your emotions, you let them sit within you, until the opportunity comes to unleash them, either on yourself or onto someone else. You may think you are ‘resolving’ a situation by bottling your emotions, but this can actually lead to more aggressive behavior.If you aren’t in a position to discuss your anger, journal about it. Release the anger! You may want to go on a walk (or a run) to help calm the tension. Whatever it is, make sure you let the anger out productively.

, While some people bottle their emotions, others express anger by emotionally losing control or sometimes physically lashing out. Even if it might feel good at the time to get that anger out, this is not a positive and constructive way to deal with anger. While it may feel good in the moment to “let it rip”, don’t fall into the trap. The urge to yell, hit or throw things will pass.


Focus on experiencing how anger feels in your body. You may feel a burning sensation in your chest or a tightness in your throat. Allow yourself to experience where anger shows up in your body and stay with that feeling. Focusing in the physical sensation can help alleviate the emotional intensity., Sometimes anger is the most socially acceptable emotion, so you may choose to express multiple emotions as anger. You may feel sad, disconnected, or ignored, then express these as anger through lashing out or blaming others. Recognize that you, like everyone, experience a multitude of emotions each day that deserve to be expressed. Positive and negative emotions are okay to feel. Get back in touch with your feelings, and allow yourself to express each emotion.Recognize each time you have an emotion and try to label it. “I am feeling happy I am drinking this milkshake”, “This movie makes me sad”, “I’m excited to see my brother”, or “I dread going to work today.” Just notice each emotion and do not judge it.

Avoid confusing IED with other disorders.",How to Deal With a Person With IED," Hopefully you won't need to get away, but it's better to be safe than sorry. You should have a place in mind that you can escape to if need be, such as a friend's house. Let your friends and family know about the situation ahead of time so that they can quickly come to your aid.Have an emergency bag packed and ready for a quick exit. This bag can include clothes, money, and other personal items.
If the situation escalates and you feel like you are in danger, don't be afraid to call the police.;
, If a coworker or someone you are not close to has an IED episode, simply remove yourself from the situation. The person's anger likely has nothing to do with you, and you are not responsible for what he or she is feeling. Unless the person is close to you and you want to try to help, consider simply avoiding the person when he or she is having an episode, or avoiding them altogether if the option is available., If the person experiences intense rage, they might try to physically harm you. It may be a good idea to remove any sharp or dangerous objects such as firearms from the location if you know in advance that an episode is about to occur.Find a secure place to lock them away until you're sure it's safe, such as a locked room or even an actual safe.

, Some IED episodes may be unpredictable, but if you are close to the person, try to discover what sort of events typically trigger his or her episodes. This could be driving, doing homework, paying bills, or any other event that has the potential to cause upset. Sometimes it may be particular to the person and not something you would expect, so pay attention to the person's behavior and the situation he or she is in right before an episode occurs.Once you're aware of the triggers, you'll be more prepared to either help the person avoid an episode, by directing them away from the triggers or comforting them to prevent a full on attack, or make your own escape from the situation.

, A great way to keep an IED episode from escalating, especially with you as a target of the anger, is to reflect what the person is saying. This will show him or her that you are interested in what they are feeling and that you are not a threat, but that you are trying to understand.If the person expresses frustration at being ignored by a waiter, you can say ""So you feel angry that the waiter disrespected you by not giving you his attention?""

, IED is not as simple as someone who occasionally gets angry. A person with IED experiences intense anger that seems out of proportion with the triggering event. The person may benefit from professional help. Cognitive-behavioral therapy that includes relaxation training is an effective tool for someone suffering from IED.You can find a mental health treatment center near you by searching on the following website: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/MHTreatmentLocator/

Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves teaching the person how to restructure their thoughts in order to get a handle on the anger. Relaxation training teaches progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and other techniques to help the person learn to relax. These techniques can be very effective in managing the explosive anger that comes with IED. If they are resistant to therapy, you can explain that research shows these methods to be effective., One of the reasons IED shows up is because people have not found positive ways to experience and channel the anger they feel. Anger is not actually a bad thing unless it builds up without any way to turn it into something positive and constructive. Anger is inevitable and needs to be respected and given a way to express itself.Martial arts, exercise, or even a sport like basketball can help people to channel aggression in ways that are less destructive.

, If the person is a friend, family member, or someone you are close to, offer to teach him or her techniques for self-calming. Diaphragmatic breathing is a useful technique to start with. Teach the person to breathe deeply into his or her stomach, hold the breath for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale. This type of breathing will decrease heart rate and activate the ""rest and digest"" part of the nervous system.Progressive muscle relaxation is another good technique, which involves tensing each muscle group in your body and then relaxing them. You can start with the toes and then work your way up to the head.
Visualization can help as well. This involves imagining a calm, peaceful scenario, such as laying out at a beach. You should try to fully enter the situation and imagine what the beach is like for all of your senses., If you aren't close to the person, try to contact a family member or friend that may be able to help him or her out in a crisis situation. You can also do this if you need help calming the person down. Only attempt to help if you are certain of your own safety first., If the person's anger is triggered by a certain event such as traffic, try to remove the person from the location of the triggering event. This can be very helpful in calming his or her nerves and keeping you safe as well.Calmly offer to drive if he or she is experiencing road rage, and then get to a safe location as quickly as possible without breaking any driving laws.

, Many IED episodes will not last more than thirty minutes. The person will usually begin to calm down after a while and may experience remorse or embarrassment afterward. If you want to help the person during a crisis and you are certain of your safety, all you may need to do is try to prevent him or her from getting more heated until the episode wears off., There are several physical indicators of an IED episode you can use to prepare yourself to deal with the situation. If someone you know with IED starts shaking or complains about tingling, chest tightness, or increased energy, these could be signs of an IED episode about to start or having already started., If the person complains to you about sudden irritability, racing thoughts, or raging emotions, these could also be signs of an IED episode and can be used as an early warning system for dealing with the situation to come.The person may have difficulty verbalizing his or her experience in this way, so you shouldn't always rely on this kind of reporting.

, The person doesn't always need to tell you how they feel; sometimes it comes out in the way they act toward you. If you notice the person starting to shout, throwing a tantrum, engaging in heated arguments, or threatening you, these may be indicators of an IED episode.If threats of violence or actual violence come into play, distance yourself from the person and seek out help.

, The cause of IED is a combination of environmental, genetic, and biological factors. Many people who develop IED grew up in families where explosive behavior was the norm for dealing with conflicts and frustrations. It can be helpful to understand why the person is behaving the way they are in order to take their behavior less personally and see it as a way they have learned to cope with life.Additionally, IED typically shows up in late childhood and may persist for a long time., There are several other psychological disorders that may look like IED on the surface. Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and others can exhibit some of the same symptoms. You may want to talk to a psychologist/psychiatrist for more information if you are unsure if the person has IED."

Assess behaviors.,
Mediate.,
Exercise caution.,
Neutralize the anger.,
Maintain self-control.,
Consider consequences.",How to Deal With People Who Have Anger Problems2," Identify the person’s underlying emotion to help you choose which action to take. Anger, is a useful emotion. It is known as a “cover” or secondary emotion that can mask underlying emotions.If we think about it, anger can be used to display all sorts of underlying emotions including but not limited to: hurt, frustration, and fear, with anxiety topping the list as a common driver to anger. You get to discover which is operating during a conflict.


Humans, from an early age, learn to cope with things that happen around them and to them. If they learn to respond in an angry way, then they will use that coping skill over and over. Children carry their coping skills into adulthood. Even though they may cause problems, some people will refuse to change.
Children who grew up in a chaotic home have few childhood coping skills except to become hyper-vigilant – always on guard, always externally focused on others, always on edge waiting to see what is going to happen next. , Serve as your own mediator (a person who intervenes between two parties to bring about an agreement or reconciliation). Do your best to create a mediation-like environment. In the most successful mediation sessions all parties get their emotional needs met, the truth can be revealed, and the conflict can move toward resolution.Make that your goal.


If you sense the person is getting out of control, then find a way to remove yourself from the situation. You may say things like, “I can see that we aren’t going to resolve this today so I’m going to leave now,” or “We can’t resolve this problem if we can’t talk calmly, so I’m going to take a break and we can discuss this later.”
You may be shocked by what is said to you; but maintaining an honest and empathetic stance will help you to understand. Ideally, you can set ground rules from the beginning that there will be no name calling.If the situation doesn't allow that, then you can say, ""We don't have to resort to name calling to get this problem solved. Let's focus on the problem.""Remember that you can take a break from the interaction to allow for a “cooling off period."" This may help the person calm down and approach the situation in a more positive way., Approach each situation carefully. People exhibit varying degrees of anger. Some reactions can be mild, and some extreme. Don’t be the one to escalate the problem.


Anger can be an impulsive reaction to a stimuli rather than a well-thought out response. You will need to investigate what triggers an anger response in the person with whom you interact. In some cases, a person could be diagnosed with a condition such as Intermittent Explosive Disorder.There are times when people just want to vent about a situation and don’t need you to do anything other than listen and say, “I know what you mean.”

, Approach an angry person with the goal of neutralizing his anger. Establish a reliable way to disarm and diffuse the situation. For example, say things like, “I know you’re angry about this and I’m sure we can work it out.” If you are caught in a situation with someone who is angry, then there is definitely a conflict that needs to be resolved. You are basically creating a negotiated solution to the conflict.If someone is having an anger outburst and you are not, then you will be the one in charge of maintaining control. You can say things like, “It sounds to me like we can solve whatever this problem is, peacefully.” Seek first to understand, then to be understood.Listen to the person who is angry by paying attention to what he says. Without interrupting him, say things such as, “I hear what you’re saying. Let me see if I’m on target here. You’re upset because ____.” Be an excellent listener. Everyone likes to be heard. Wait until the person is finished talking before you comment, and do not interrupt the person. This shows the person that you respect him and want to hear what he has to say.

, Respond in a way that shows that you have self-control. You may be the only one exercising self-control. It may be difficult to maintain your composure in difficult circumstances; but focusing on a positive outcome will carry you through.


Be flexible and remain composed even if he is emotionally “all over the place.” This will help you remain focused on identifying the underlying issues and guide the interaction toward a peaceful conclusion.
Get him to buy-in to the idea of resolving the matter. Say things like, “I know this is a difficult situation, but I’m confident we can work together to figure this out.” This sets up a positive outcome simply by letting the other person know that you are a willing and optimistic participant.
Always be positive when an agreement is reached. Tell the person you are happy an agreement was reached. Ask the person if he is happy about how things turned out and if there was anything that could have made it better.

, Remember that you are human and so is the person who is mad. Keep in mind the bigger picture - the consequences of an unsuccessful outcome – and that may be just the thing you need to keep the conversation on a positive path.


For a person to grow and change he needs an environment that fosters genuine interactions (openness and self-disclosure), acceptance (being seen with unconditional positive regard) and empathy (being listened to and understood. This would be your role in the process of helping someone deal with his anger issues. Be realistic about the outcome. You may not be able to resolve every conflict. It doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. It's good to remain guardedly optimistic.
There will be times when you will have to assert yourself to get your point across, or to shut the conversation down. Remaining unruffled will be the key. For example, you may have to say, ""I understand what you're saying, but I'm going to have to stop the conversation for now. What we're doing isn't working. Perhaps we can find a solution later.""

Get educated.,
Express good intentions.,
Expand your emotional vocabulary.,
Demonstrate trustworthy behaviors.",How to Deal With People Who Have Anger Problems3," Take steps to increase your knowledge about anger. The first step in understanding any human behavior is to learn about it. It will give you a strong base of ideas and strategies from which to pull when you are dealing with someone with anger issues.


Access educational material on-line from reputable sources like the American Psychological Associationand the American Psychiatric Association. Subscribe to newsletters from groups that cover subject matter related to anger and other areas of interest.

, Show the other person that you have good intentions by remaining consistent in what you say and do. Many people go through life with a feeling of mistrust toward others. People who guard their emotions are usually those who have been hurt repeatedly in life. It’s not easy to forget when someone violates your trust, but holding onto doubt will likely cause you to suffer.It takes time and effort to build trust. Repeated positive interactions are the goal. Simply asking how someone is doing, or remembering that he has a tough assignment coming up at work or school lets him know you care enough to remember.
Think of ways you can show the person that your actions are inspired by goodness. Be kind. Do things like making the person his favorite meal, or tell the person you appreciate the things he does for you.
It takes courage to be vulnerable. Remember a person with anger issues may struggle with this notion. You can show your vulnerability by sharing your own struggles to help the other person feel more at ease.

, The ability to express emotions varies from person to person. Frustration and anger grow when you can’t find the words to express the emotions you are feeling.


Once you expand your vocabulary you can help others do the same.
Suggest and encourage the person to take classes in non-violent communication. The goal of these classes is to learn to express your feelings and needs with greater clarity and compassion.Gather lists that itemize numerous emotions to help identify the emotions a person is feeling. You can refer to that list to help determine if you or another person's emotional needs are satisfied, and when they are not. Strong emotions like anger are designed to help you respond to and cope with stress in your environment, but can become bad for us if not handled with care.Research has shown that if people have twenty words for anger (irritation, fury, rage, hostility), then they will perceive twenty different states and will better regulate their emotional states as a result., Keep your word, tell the truth, be transparent, and give without strings attached. Use these simple wisdoms to show that you are the type of person who can be trusted. Helping others overcome emotional upheaval can be difficult, but in the end you will find greater happiness.Successfully managing situations with difficult and angry people, builds skills that can be used at home, at work and in public. You will be well-equipped to handle each situation with confidence.

Contact emergency services for help.",How to Cope with Impulsive Aggression1," While it is perfectly normal for someone to occasionally become angry, and even raise their voice, frequent outbursts of sudden, explosive anger are not normal, especially when that anger manifests in violent or abusive behavior. It is important for you to understand that their rage, and the violence it brings with it, is not in their control. Explosive episodes, as opposed to normal expressions of anger, are characterized by being:


Abrupt, seeming to come out of nowhere.
Much more extreme in intensity than is warranted by the event or situation triggering it.
Violent and aggressive, either physically (e.g. screaming, invading personal space, or hitting objects, oneself, or other people) or emotionally (e.g. name-calling, threatening, or use of hurtful, insulting language).
Irrational, and seemingly impossible to calm with words.
Remember: your loved one's issues with anger are not your fault. Violence and abuse is never acceptable, and you have every right to take steps to avoid being harmed.;
, While you can certainly help a loved one dealing with impulsive aggression by supporting them and learning about their condition, it is crucial that they seek the additional, outside help of a trained mental health professional. Encourage them to consult an expert, and remind them that no one should have to deal with a serious medical issue like IED without the help of a doctor., Having a neighbor, friend, or family member close by who understands your loved one's rage issues, and the danger it poses to you, can be of great benefit to you should you ever need help. Let the person know that you'll be relying on them, and make sure they understand your plan of action, and what they may need to do in the event of a violent episode. Be honest with whomever you tell, and resist the urge to sugar-coat your description of the explosive episodes in an effort to save face. A trustworthy confidant will not judge you, and will understand that IED and its effects are complex.
If you are responsible for children, coordinate with trusted friends or family to establish a plan for them, should you need help getting them to safety while you deal with an explosive episode.
If you are experiencing domestic violence, contact a domestic violence hot line, a women's shelter, or emergency services right away.

, Decide where you will go should you need to escape an explosive episode. Remember that episodes can occur at any time, even very late at night, so the place you choose should be accessible to you at all times. If there are children or others living with you, discuss the plan with them, and consider practicing getting safely out of your home with them, so that you are all prepared should the need arise. It is a good idea to prepare a bag of essential items to take with you should you need to escape. Pack any important papers or documents you may wish to have with you, as well as extra clothes, house and car keys, money, and any medications you may need.

, Someone undergoing an episode of explosive anger will be unable to respond rationally to the situation they are in, and will behave unpredictably, and even violently. The best course of action for your safety is to remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible. You should already have prepared a plan, and decided where you will go for safety. Don't worry about explaining yourself to your loved one: you'll have time to do that when they are calm. Removing yourself not only protects you from immediate danger, it also ensures that you won't be tempted to argue with, or retaliate against, your loved one. Retaliation can be a natural response, but can often lead to an escalation of the episode, resulting in increased danger for everyone involved.

, If you or anyone else is in immediate danger, or you are unable to escape a violent episode, contact the police immediately. If someone is hurt, go to the emergency room and explain your situation: the doctors and nurses there will treat your injuries, and help you find resources to keep you out of harms way. If you are frightened of being harmed by your loved one, and need a place to go, contact a domestic violence hotline, or a local women's shelter or crisis center.If you are in the U.S., you can reach the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. The NDVH can connect you with local resources such as counselors, shelters and support groups.

Find a change of scenery.,
Calm your mind with meditation.,
Relax your body with progressive muscle relaxation.,
Give yourself time to respond.",How to Control Your Temper Without Anger Management Courses1," Change to a new location if you are feeling angry. Changing scenery helps in two ways; it allows you a break from the person or situation causing your anger and it gives you something new to focus on that is not your anger. If possible, take a walk outside. Notice any wildlife or nice nature things. Even if the weather is poor, a walk in the rain might “cool off” your anger. Being outdoors can improve your mood.;
, Meditation helps you control your emotions both in the moment of anger and in the long term. To meditate in the moment of anger, first remove yourself from the situation causing the anger.Take slow, deep breaths. Maintaining this breathing will likely bring down your elevated heart rate. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends on the “in” breath.
Visualize a golden-white light filling your body as you breathe in, relaxing your mind. When you breathe out, visualize muddy or dark colors leaving your body.
Once you are calm from your meditation, think about your emotions and decide how to deal with the situation that angered you.
Daily meditation in your own home may also help you control your anger later in the day, which can help you avoid having to take a “meditation escape” midday.

, Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing your body in progressive stages. Consciously tensing your own muscles can help you redirect the outlet of the anger you’re feeling. To practice progressive muscle relaxation, take a few deep breaths, then do the following: Begin with your face and head muscles. Hold the tension for 20 seconds, then release it.
Work your way down your body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back, hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Take deep breaths, feeling relaxation from your toes all the way up to your head.

, If the situation or person that angered you is one that you cannot avoid in the future, give yourself a break before you respond if you feel angry. Waiting until you have calmed your mind and body to return to the stressful situation can allow you to return with a more rational response.If you cannot physically leave, you can still give yourself a delay by stopping to count to 10 (or 20, or 50, or 100) before you respond.

Collect your thoughts before speaking in order to prevent yourself from saying something you may regret or that may hurt your partner.If you feel like reacting to something your partner did or said, this is a good time to take a step back and collect your thoughts.;
, Focusing on your breath can help calm both your body and your mind. Using deep breathing can separate you from the situation and your feelings of immediate anger and help you focus inward.


Practice deep breathing when you are in a naturally calm state. Then, try it when you are angry or upset, and notice how it helps you achieve calm.
Once you start feeling anger come, take a moment to do some breathing to calm yourself before exploding.
In order for breathing to calm you, you must breathe from your diaphragm, not your chest.When you breathe from your diaphragm, you should be able to feel your stomach rising and falling (not your shoulders). When practicing, you can place your hand on your stomach to feel the movement.

, Using a word or phrase can help keep you on track and not let your emotions get the best of you.


Say to yourself, “relax,” or “I am calm,” or “chill.”
Especially if you feel your anger rising, use a word to keep it at bay.

, It’s possible to express what you’re feeling calmly, even when you feel angry. Aim to focus on expressing your own wants, needs, and feelings without assigning blame, guilt, or hurt to your partner. Use your opportunities to speak by expressing yourself and not attacking your partner.Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.For instance, instead of saying, “You make me so angry” say, “I feel really angry when you say that.” Owning your own feelings empowers you and doesn’t place blame on your partner.

, If you’re having a difficult time controlling your anger, tell your partner you need some time to yourself. If you fear you may say something hurtful or you need some time to collect your thoughts and feelings, tell your partner that the discussion is important, but you need a break. Go outside, splash water on your face, or take a walk. Do whatever it takes to help calm the temper.Say, “This is important to discuss, however, I’m having a hard time handling my anger. Can we talk about this again in 10 minutes or perhaps later tonight?”
Don’t use a timeout to avoid the situation. Use it to gain emotional composure.

, While you may perceive your anger as coming out of nowhere, there are some warning signs of rising anger. Your body communicates anger to you before your emotional reaction. Keep an eye out for some of the following signs:Clenched hands or jaw, muscle tension (like shoulders)
Feeling flushed
Faster breathing
Headache
Pacing, increased need for movement
Pounding heart

, Anger is a reflection of how you feel, not how someone is “making” you feel. Your anger belongs to you and not to your partner.Avoid blaming your partner and accept that your anger is your responsibility to deal with appropriately.


If your anger is your own, then it is also within your control.

, Recognize whether outside factors contribute to or worsen your anger. This can include not getting enough rest, being hungry, feeling stressed out at work or school, or other external factors. If you notice your anger in the relationship increases when you have outside stressors (like work deadlines or when the kids are sick), realize that you may be mismanaging your anger and taking it out on your partner or the relationship.


Look at your regular routine and distinguish events or situations that tend to trigger anger. These situations may include commuting, dealing with rowdy children, or routinely not getting enough sleep each night.Address these factors and find healthy outlets for your anger that don’t involve your partner.

, Often, anger is a secondary emotion to other deeper emotions, such as sadness, guilt, shame, fear, hurt, or rejection. Think about whether anger is your primary emotion, or if it is the way you are expressing a different emotion. Anger may be expressed if the other emotions make you feel vulnerable or weak, as anger can act as a defense that makes you feel more powerful.Ask yourself whether you are truly angry, or if you are responding to feeling vulnerable, weak, sad, or shameful. Are you being triggered and responding to the trigger through anger?
If anger is the only feeling you experience regularly, it may be shielding other emotions that make you feel vulnerable.
You may feel fear in experiencing other emotions such as vulnerability, sadness, guilt, shame, or defeat. Ask yourself what blocks you from these emotions, and practice expressing them, even if it’s only in a secret journal. If it’s difficult for your to access emotions other than anger, talk to a therapist. He or she can help you access and experience your emotions in a safe, non-threatening way.

, Nothing “causes” your anger aside from your own perceptions of situations. Anger has more to do with your interpretations than what actually happens. Acknowledge how your thoughts affect your anger, then address their validity and truth. Especially in relationships, your partner can trigger you and set off your anger. Some common destructive thought patterns include:Generalizing- Saying that your partner ALWAYS does something, or NEVER does something. (“You NEVER take out the trash” or “You ALWAYS cut me off when I’m speaking”).

Blaming- Your first reaction is to externalize blame when something goes wrong. You may blame your partner for things that happen to you instead of taking responsibility. (If you leave your phone on a bus, you blame your partner for distracting you).

Mind reading- Assuming that your partner is purposefully hurting you, ignoring you, or upsetting you. (If your partner doesn’t do the dishes, you assume that he or she is avoiding them as a way to get back at you).

Looking for the final straw- Actively looking for things to be upset about or only focusing on negative things. Often, this occurs one small thing at a time, until you reach the “final straw” and explode.

, Once you’ve identified your thought patterns, learn how to rationally respond to them. When you start to accuse your partner of wrongdoing or feel defensive, start paying attention to the thoughts influencing these feelings. Then, ask yourself some questions.”Is my perception an accurate and valid approach to the situation?”
”Is there something I can do about this?”
”Is this ruining the rest of my day? Is this something worthy of pursuing?”
”How important is this in the grand scheme of things? Is this something that greatly influences our relationship?”
Think of whether this is an issue deserving of your emotional energy and anger. If not, say to yourself, “This upsets me, but I can move past it.”

, If “winning” is your priority, think about how this is hurting the relationship, and if you want to continue prioritizing this mindset. Chances are, your partner may pick up on this and not appreciate playing second to your need to be right.

, When you’re angry, it may feel good to bring up the past to make a point. This a great way to throw blame in the mix. If you’d rather avoid blaming your partner, keep to the present and don’t get derailed onto other problems in the relationship. Focus on solving the current problem.If the discussion does derail, gently bring it back to what’s at hand. Say, “Let’s stick to discussing what’s in front of us.”

, Avoid cutting off your partner while he or she is speaking. Allow your partner to finish speaking, then reflect back what you’ve heard. That way, you can reflect your understanding while affirming your partner.

Say, “I hear you saying that you want me to consider your feelings more and not assume you want something. Is that right?”

, Be willing to admit that you make mistakes. Recognize any assumptions or misunderstandings you’ve engaged, and take responsibility for your words and actions. You don’t have to take on the blame for everything, but do own your part. Say sorry with a sincere apology to your partner.

, Don’t hold onto resentments toward your partner. Be forgiving and don’t withhold forgiveness as a way to punish your partner. Instead, see forgiveness as a road to freedom and a way to let go of any negative feelings toward your partner.


Whether you choose to say “I forgive you” to your partner or not, forgiveness is often more about personal freedom and freeing the other person from blame. It doesn’t mean you take full responsibility or even that you accept what happened as okay. It just means you’re willing to let it go.

, Keep yourself accountable for the changes you want to make. Take your accountability inward and ask yourself why you want to change your anger patterns and how you’re doing each week in accomplishing this goal.Ask yourself why you want to control your anger, and what benefits it will have for you, your partner, and your relationship. You may even consider writing down your goals and putting them in a place you’ll see regularly.


You may choose to have an accountability partner, or someone you can talk to openly about making changes around your anger. This is someone you can talk to about when and why you get angry and how you handle your anger.

, If your anger interferes with your relationship and causes you to hurt people, say or do things you regret, or is completely out of control, consider seeking therapy.You can work one-on-one with a therapist, or check out anger management groups, which unite people over wanting to gain better control of their anger. It’s important to know when your anger is destructive, and that it’s okay to reach out for help for your sake and for the sake of your relationship.

Avoid recreational drugs, including alcohol.",How to Cope with Impulsive Aggression2," Episodes of impulsive aggression are overwhelming, making it feel impossible to think or behave calmly or rationally. They strain personal relationships, and put you, and those closest to you, in danger of harm. You deserve, and will benefit from, the help of a professional while dealing with this difficult problem. Your therapist will help you to understand the root causes of your anger, and learn to recognize and control it.


If you aren't sure how to find a therapist, talk to your doctor about getting a referral. If you are on a medical insurance plan, you can contact your insurance provider for help finding a therapist.
No specific medication is prescribed for suffers of intermittent explosive disorder, your doctor may prescribe medication to help with some of the psychological symptoms of the disease, such as depression

, When an explosive episode begins, you may feel a mounting sense of physical tension. While this tension can be very unpleasant, learning to recognize them will provide you with advance warning of an impending episode. Once you learn to recognize these precursors of rage episodes, you can begin taking steps to control them.Symptoms at the onset of an explosive episode can include:


Fast, shallow breathing.
Involuntarily clenched fists, or jaw.
Rapid heart rate.
Racing, difficult to control thoughts, often of an aggressive or violent nature.
Feelings of tightness in the chest.

, While episodes of rage are sometimes unpredictable, others may be associated with specific sources of stress at home, in school, or at work. Avoiding triggering situations will allow you to begin taking control of your explosive episodes. Frustration and stress of any variety can be the trigger for an explosive episode. Think about when you tend to experience moments or episodes of rage. Common examples of triggering events include:


Relatively minor arguments with your spouse, parents, or loved ones.
Feeling misunderstood, or that you aren't able to communicate your feelings effectively.
Feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities at work, at school, or with your family and friends.
Stress or pain from coping with another physical or mental illness.
Excessive use of alcohol or other mind-altering substance.

, Do this with the help of your therapist, who has the experience and expertise to help you decide what actions to take when you feel the onset of an explosive episode. The simplest method of dealing with an episode of rage is simply to walk away from the situation causing it. Go somewhere you can feel safe, and focus on breathing deeply, and calming down.Some find it helpful to focus their mind on counting slowly to ten, or repeating a soothing word or phrase to themselves. This helps take the sufferer's mind off of the situation triggering their rage, and gives them time to calm down.
Remember that your explosive episodes are unpredictable, and can happen at any time. Think about how you will deal with your anger if an episode is triggered in public, or at work or school, not just what you will do if an episode occurs at home.

, Rage is an overwhelming feeling, and you may display violent behavior towards those closest to you while undergoing an episode. For their safety, as well as your own, it is essential that you talk to your family and friends about what you're going through. Be honest with them, and warn them that, despite the fact that you love them, your impulsive aggression could lead you to harm them. This will better prepare them for dealing with any episodes they may experience in the future. Understanding your condition will also help them lend more effective support to your efforts to control your anger.

, Mind-altering substances can have unpredictable effects on the mood of someone suffering from impulsive aggression, increasing the risk that they may experience an episode of rage. If you are finding it difficult to give up using drugs, including alcohol, then you should seek help from your therapist, or another medical professional."

Identify IED risk factors.,
Learn to differentiate rage from normal anger.,
Recognize episodes of abrupt, unexpected anger.,
Judge the extremity and violence of any anger-related behavior.,
Determine the length and after effects of episodes of anger.,
Seek the assistance of a mental health professional.",How to Cope with Impulsive Aggression3," Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel.Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern.

, Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else., Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior.While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places.

, Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved.Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include:


Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice.
Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting ""in the face"" of those nearby.
Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects.
Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others.
Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc.
Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others.
Threatening others with violence.
While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or ""way over the top"", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode.

, A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally. After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removedAn IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily ""snap"" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal.
Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between.

, Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment.

Recognize the ways that people communicate their anger.,
Emphasize that both parties’ needs are important.,
Use respect when communicating.,
Be clear and specific with requests.,
Express your feelings.,
Seek a solution to the problem.",How to Control Your Temper Without Anger Management Courses2," There are three primary ways to communicate anger; they fall into the categories of “passive,” “aggressive,” or “assertive.” Learning to use assertive communication can help you communicate about your anger in a healthy way.Passive communication involves becoming progressively angry about something without actually dealing with the problem or confronting the situation in any way. Passive people usually internalize their behavior which is anger that is ""unexpressed.""People who become angry outwardly and have learned that is not socially desirable may ""suppress"" their anger instead of dealing with it assertively. They may eventually have an outburst, the outcome of externalizing behavior being suppressed.
Aggressive communication involves becoming so angry that you have an outburst that likely seems like an overreaction to the situation from the outside. Aggressive outbursts can also be paired with violence.
Assertive communication is a healthy, respectful way to address and confront the person or situation that is causing you to become angry.
For example, you may be angry that your neighbor’s dog constantly runs into your yard unattended. A passive response would be to never speak to your neighbor about it, but become more and more angry. An aggressive response would be to call the pound, harm the dog, or do something mean to your neighbor in retaliation. An assertive response would be to communicate about the problem with your neighbor.

, Part of assertive communication is acknowledging that your needs as well as the needs of the other person (or people) involved are important. This takes the focus off of you and shows that you are appreciative of the needs of others. For example, you might tell your neighbor, “I understand that your dog needs to spend some time outdoors. However, I have very young children, and I’m not comfortable with a dog being around them without its owner.”

, Using “please” and “thank you” can go a long way towards seeming respectful of another. Treat the other party with respect, acknowledging that they have a side to the story as well. For example, you might begin a conversation with your neighbor by saying “Hey! How are you today? I have something I would like to speak with you about.”

, Remember to think of any actions you would like the other party to take as requests, not demands. This will help you word your request appropriately. It is important that you are specific and that you do your best to stick to the actual facts. For example, you may say to your neighbor, “I’d like to request that you keep your dog on a leash or in a pen when he is outside. He came into my yard 3 times yesterday while my 1- and 3- year-old children were outside playing.”

, While you do want to provide factual information, it is okay to include the way that you feel when you are expressing your anger. You can emphasize words like “I feel like” or “it makes me feel,” which may help prevent the other party from becoming defensive. For example, you might tell your neighbor, “It makes me feel frightened and frustrated when I see a dog I don’t know well run right up to my 1-year-old. Even though your dog is sweet, I feel afraid that something bad could happen on my own property, which should be safe for my children.”

, Ideally, you and the party to whom you are expressing your feelings can collaborate on a solution to the problem that is making you angry. Unfortunately, you cannot control the actions of others, and you may need to seek a solution on your own.For example, you and your neighbor may brainstorm ways to keep the dog in check, such as keeping him on a leash or in a fence. If, however, the neighbor refuses to cooperate, you might have to come up with a solution on your own, such as fencing in your own yard.

Rely on friends and family.,
Ask your physician about medications to help with anger control.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Control Your Temper Without Anger Management Courses3," Disclose your feelings about anger to your loved ones. Talk to them about the strategies you’re using to minimize angry outbursts and use effective assertive communication. You might be able to develop a system with those close to you (particularly your partner) whereby if you feel as though you are losing your temper, you can use a code word or signal that lets them know you need a break from the conversation or situation you’re in.

, Medication alone may not be the best approach to solving an anger problem, but combining medication with other methods to regulate your emotions might help you gain control over your anger. Medications are often prescribed when the anger problem accompanies another disorder, such as bipolar disorder or depression. The specific medicines used to treat anger depend on the source of the anger. If the anger accompanies generalized anxiety, likely medications may include SSRIs and SNRIs. If the anger accompanies depression, an antidepressant such as Prozac may be prescribed.If you have a problem with addiction, be sure to discuss your history with your physician. Some mood-altering drugs are addictive and should be avoided in cases of past substance abuse.

, If you want to avoid anger management courses, working one-on-one with a qualified therapist who specializes in anger issues can be the best route to anger management success. A therapist can give you additional relaxation techniques to use in situations that make you feel angry. She can help you develop emotional coping skills and communication training. Additionally, a psychotherapist who specializes in helping resolve problems from someone’s past (such as neglect or abuse from childhood) can help mitigate anger tied to past events. You can search for a therapist specializing in anger management in North America here and in the United Kingdom here.

Don’t respond with anger.,
Maintain emotional distance.,
Speak calmly and slowly.,
Use non-threatening body language.,
Don’t provoke the angry person.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person1," When someone else is angry, especially at you, it can be easy to get angry as well. But when you are trying to communicate with an angry person, it’s better for you to keep your own anger out of it.


Calm yourself down before you respond. Force yourself to stop and take a few deep breaths. Maybe even count to five (or 10 if you need more time). Remember that the other person's anger likely has nothing to do with you.;
, Don’t take this person’s anger personally. Instead, step outside of the direct line by transforming your feelings into curiosity about the person’s anger. Ask yourself questions like: “This person is really angry. I wonder what got them so upset?”, Don’t raise your voice or speak in a tone that conveys anger. Take a couple of deep breaths if you need to, and speak with a level, calm voice with a normal volume.

, Having open, welcoming body language can help diffuse another person’s anger. They will see that you are not being antagonistic. Some positive body language includes:Maintaining eye contact (but not staring the person down)
Standing or sit with your arms at your sides, not crossed in front of you
Standing at a slight angle, instead of facing the other person straight on
Becoming aware of the distance between yourself and the angry person. Avoid encroaching on the other person's personal space as a way to avoid making them uncomfortable or angrier. Giving them space also means that, should they try to strike you, you will be able to move out of the way.
Gently touching the other person’s shoulder, if they will allow it. Keep in mind that touch isn't always appropriate. If the angry person is a spouse or close friend, then a touch may be appropriate. If the angry person is a customer or client, it would not be appropriate.

, When you know a person’s anger triggers, you might push their buttons to provoke them to anger. This may or may not be deliberate. But when someone is angry, try not to do things that you know will make them angrier or feel less respected."
"
Assess the situation before making suggestions.,
Tell the person to take deep breaths.,
Ask the person to count to 10.,
Distract the person.,
Suggest taking a walk.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person2," Making suggestions to calm someone down may not be appropriate for someone who clearly doesn't want help; however, it can be appropriate if the angry person is seeking help in calming down. It can also help when conversation is not productive or is escalating and a break is warranted.

, Breathing deeply can be effective in regulating emotions. Give the person these instructions:


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure they are breathing with their diaphragm rather than with their chest. When the person breathes with their diaphragm, their belly extends out (they should be able to feel it with their hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until the person starts feeling calmer.

, Tell the other person that they don't need to react right away. Counting can help put off angry feelings for the moment. Suggest that the other person gives themselves time to sort out feelings by counting to 10., Help the person take their mind off the anger by distracting them. You can tell a joke or watch a video. You can reassure the person that you care about their anger, but you can also say that it may be a good idea to change their focus for a few minutes to help them cool off., Removing the person from a situation will help them calm down. Suggest going for a walk, getting outdoors, or otherwise removing themselves from the situation.

Let the other person speak.,
Show empathy.,
Keep asking questions.,
Paraphrase the other person for clarification.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person3," It’s important to make sure that the other person feels like you’re taking them seriously. Let the person speak and listen to what they are saying.


Don’t interrupt or correct the other person while they are speaking.

, You don’t necessarily have to agree with the other person, but you can show that you understand why they might feel the way they do. For example, you might say, “If I felt like I wasn’t getting equal treatment, I’d probably feel upset too.”Agreeing with the angry person might help diffuse the angry feelings. It helps the angry person feel like they are right in some manner.

, Use “open-ended” questions to probe for more information. Open-ended questions ask for more than a simple answer like yes or no. These types of questions require more information. Then you can get to the root of the problem.For example, you might say, “What happened at the meeting this morning?”


Use the word “exactly” to get more information. For example, “What exactly do you mean when you say nobody listened to you?”

, Show that you want to understand what the other person is talking about. Paraphrase what they say so that you are sure you understand correctly.For example, you can say, “Let me see if I have this right. You went to the meeting and were asked to give a last-minute presentation, which made you feel stressed. Then, your boss checked his phone the whole time, which made you feel ignored. Do I have that right?”

Find a good time to work on problem-solving.,
Apologize if needed.,
Help the person find a solution to the problem.,
Use “We.” Using this language will help show that you are cooperating with the person to resolve the issue in partnership.,
Stick to the issue at hand.,
Be prepared for no resolution yet.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person4," A person’s emotional defenses can be down if they are feeling tired or hungry. Find a good time when the person is rested and can approach a problem without getting mired in negative emotion., If you did something wrong or if you unintentionally hurt another person, apologizing is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you care that you hurt another person, no matter if it was intended or not.

, Work towards problem solving. Ask what the person would like to see happen as a resolution. If you can’t meet the person’s expectations or if the person is being unreasonable, see what you can negotiate.

, For example, you can say, “How can I help you to the point where we can resolve this issue?”, If you are trying to come to a compromise, stick with the issue that is immediately happening. Don’t bring up past fights or problems. Don’t use old grudges to get what you want out of a situation., It may be that you can’t arrive at a solution until the person has calmed down. This may take a while, and solving the problem will be delayed until the other person can respond without being too angry."

Teach kids mutual respect.,
Stay calm and relaxed.,
Do not tolerate violent behavior.,
Acknowledge kids’ right to be angry.,
Help your child calm down.,
Use distraction.,
Listen really well and provide acknowledgment.,
Brainstorm how to solve the problem.,
Be consistent and patient.,
Help your child handle difficult situations.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person5," Kids need some direction in terms of how to deal with their own anger. Not many people know how to instruct their kids on how to deal with anger, so many are left to themselves to deal with it on their own. This can lead to poor impulse control, a history of violent behaviors, and fighting in relationships in school and at home. Children learn their behavioral patterns from their parents and other adults with whom they spend a lot of time. In order to teach your child mutual respect, you must try your best to communicate respectfully with your child.


Instruct your kids to treat others with kindness. They shouldn’t be sarcastic toward other people. Model this for your child by doing the same — if you don't treat others with kindness and respect, don't expect your child to do so.
Don’t yell or shake your finger at them. Don’t shame your kids, call them nasty names, or put down their actions even if they didn’t exhibit the best of judgment. Do not use guilt trips on your kids.
If your kids stray from communicating respectfully, don’t accuse them of disrespecting you. It will hurt their feelings. If your kids are young, they probably don’t even realize they are acting in a disrespectful manner. If it’s your teen, let them know in an assertive way that their tone sounds angry and ask them what is going on. In other words, just make the observation without getting upset. Use a non-accusatory tone. Give them a chance to explain.

, Make sure your face is relaxed. Use a tone of voice that does not sound angry or tense.

, Behavior such as throwing things or hitting should not be allowed. If it’s a one-time occurrence, talk with your child after the incident to let them know that hitting is not allowed. Tell your child that this action was a mistake. Tell them that you forgive them, but that they will lose a privilege the next time this happens.

, Just like adults, kids have the right to feel angry. An older child or teenager may respond well to a statement like this: “I notice you seem angry. It’s okay, you’re allowed to be angry, and people do get angry sometimes. You might be feeling other feelings along with anger too, and that’s okay also.”


For younger kids, a shorter, more direct reflection statement is more helpful. Reflection can help children learn to name the emotion and learn how to deal with feelings appropriately. Try saying, ""You are angry that you did not get to eat the cookie before dinner."" Don't worry that it might not be the right emotion — they will correct you. The key is just getting them to refocus on how they are feeling.
Help your kid identify more feelings if it’s possible, since anger almost always occurs with other feelings specific to the situation. For example, your kid could be angry that their little brother entered their room without permission. Your kid can also feel a little violated.

, What works for adults works for kids too. If you notice your teen or kid stewing for a while, sit down with them. Count out loud for them, taking a few deep breaths with them. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.


Be willing to allow your child to blow off some steam for a little while and calm themselves down. They will need this skill throughout their life. In addition, some kids really prefer to calm themselves down.

, With some kids, it’s possible to distract them long enough to get them to move on from something they are focused on. This is easy for young kids. Distraction is a way to deal with emotions to calm them down.


Change the scenery and bring your kid out to the garage to help you with something small. A small task like this can help take the focus away from what’s upsetting them. Then you can discuss the issue later with them.

, As your kid discusses their issue and what caused them to be angry, listen to them carefully. Paraphrase and summarize what you think they have said. This will show that you are following their story.


For children, it is key to teach them the difference between feelings and behaviors. It is perfectly fine to be angry or upset, but we have to show that in the right way. This is especially true for children who externalize their anger and hit, kick, or destroy things.
Ask questions. Your child still might be upset and jump around in their story. By asking questions, you can help your child organize their thoughts too.
For instance, if something at school upset your child, try to sum up what they are saying: “Let me see if I’m following your story. Billy pushed you during lunch time. You told the teacher, but the teacher just told him to stop, but you felt that the teacher should have punished him. Did I get this right?”
For instance, if your kid has a falling out with friends, acknowledge that your kid has a right to be angry and upset. Your child might be feeling hurt. It might take a while for these feelings to resolve, but assure your child that the feelings eventually will fade away.

, This will shift the focus away from the anger and focus on problem-solving. Encourage your kid to think of solutions where everyone wins, which will ensure cooperation in the house.


You can offer some suggestions too, but it is also effective to let your child come up with solutions. Your child may feel more in control when he gets to determine how to solve the problem. He is also learning how to resolve his own problems, which is a skill he will need throughout life.

, You are teaching your kids major life skills, so following these steps each and every time will help this lesson sink in.

, In some cases, your child might be angry because they have been wronged. Whether it’s bullying or because of unkind treatment from peers, your kid might have a really good reason to be angry.


If there are situations where your child needs protection, like a bullying situation, demonstrate how this situation should be handled assertively. Go to your school’s principal for help and alert your child’s teachers. Keep going up the chain of command until you reach a positive solution.
Being patient in tough situations will help show your child what it’s like to work out problems.

Forgive yourself.",How to Stop Feeling Guilty for No Reason," Sometimes you may feel guilty because you contemplated doing something that violates your personal morals. Even if you didn’t act on it, you may feel guilty for even considering it. If you’re feeling guilty for no obvious reason, you might have considered doing something you believe is wrong, but quickly pushed it out of your mind. The guilt might have stayed even though the thought left.You might have forgotten the immoral thing you considered doing, such as cheating on your spouse or stealing from your friend. Sit and think about it to recall if you did want to do something like this.
If you did have a thought like this, take a moment to forgive yourself. Then ask the person you thought about doing wrong against to forgive you.
After you have made amends, let it go by not blaming yourself and focusing on the present.;
, Sometimes we feel guilty for thinking we did something wrong when we didn’t actually do anything. For example, maybe you wished something bad would happen to your ex’s new partner, and then they got in a car accident. Even though you didn’t actually do anything, you can feel like you caused their accident. If you feel guilt for no apparent reason, perhaps you thought you did something wrong and then forgot about it.Try to remember if you have ever wished bad would happen to someone and then it did.
If you can’t talk to that person, take measures to forgive yourself.
Keep in mind that you may also be judging yourself too harshly. For example, you might be thinking that you said something rude or did something insulting, when in reality the other person does not think that at all.

, You might feel guilty because you survived a traumatic event that affected someone else negatively. Even if this is not something you think about every day, it can be a cause of constant guilt. Identify survivor’s guilt by noticing if you feel sad when you perceive that you are doing better in life than others.For example, if you survived an armed robbery, then you might have guilt when hearing about someone who was killed in an armed robbery. If you feel guilty for surviving the robbery because someone else did not, then you might have survivor's guilt.
If you identify survivor’s guilt in yourself, you need to take some time to process your negative emotions and forgive yourself.
Talk to someone about what happened, such as a psychologist.

, You may have been traumatized as a child, whether abused over a long period of time or because of a specific event. You may also have been treated unfairly while growing up. All of these events can have lasting effects on you as an adult, even giving you feelings of guilt that seem to have no source. Think about your childhood to determine if something that happened then is causing your guilt.If you can identify something from your childhood that leads to guilt, such as abuse or a traumatic event, seek the help of a professional psychologist.

, Sometimes you feel guilty for no reason because you have neurotic guilt, or guilt that is much stronger than a situation calls for. You might feel guilty for things you have no control over. Neurotic guilt might occur because you feel bad for not being better at something.You might also feel neurotic guilt because you don’t want to do something others believe you should.
Neurotic guilt can also arise from self-doubt.
If you have neurotic guilt, you should take measures to forgive yourself. You also might to seek out a psychologist for counseling to help you cope and overcome the guilt.

, Knowing the cause of guilt can help you resolve it. If you’ve looked at these techniques and you still feel guilty, maybe you need to admit there is a real reason you feel guilty. You may have forgotten about what you did. Sit down and think about your actions over the last few weeks and months to discover if you have done something wrong. This can explain why you feel guilty.You may need to verbalize your thoughts through writing or talking to help you remember committing any wrongful acts. Write down your actions in a bullet list, or talk to a friend to help you remember.
Maybe ask people who are close to you if they can remember you doing anything you should feel guilty about.
If you can’t think of anything you did wrong, then you can stop giving in to the guilty feelings. Tell yourself that you did nothing wrong and focus on the present.If you did do something wrong, go apologize and ask for forgiveness.

, Depression can cause you to feel guilty for no reason as well. Think about whether or not you might be depressed. Depression can take many forms, but you will likely have had ongoing feelings of sadness, loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, changes in your eating and sleeping, and feelings of hopelessness and/or helplessness.Consider feelings of guilt along with these symptoms and talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you think you might be depressed.
Feelings of guilt may take many forms in depression. For example, you might feel guilty about not meeting your monthly sales quota at work, even if no one else in your office was able to meet their target either. Or, you might feel guilty for not washing the dishes before going to bed, even if you did lots of other housework and you were too exhausted to do anything else.

, Verbally or visually processing your feelings can help you get to the source of them. For example, you can identify if your guilt is out of proportion to your actions by writing out the situation in a journal.Journaling or talking about your guilty feelings with someone else can help you recognize whether they are valid or not.


Developing a regular habit of journaling or talking to someone can help you process feelings of guilt so that you stop feeling this way.
Journaling also gives you something to look back on to help you see your progress.Find a psychologist to discuss your feelings with if nothing you do at home is making these feelings go away.

, The reality is often that you are not at fault, especially when you truly do not know the source of your guilt. It is helpful to take a moment and do a reality check when you’re feeling mysterious guilt. The truth about what is happening around you can show you that it’s not your fault. In these cases, give yourself permission to let go of the guilt.Perform a reality check by sitting down and considering what is truly happening, not what you imagine is happening. You might need the help of a friend or family member to help you see things the way they truly are. Ask someone to sit down with you and give their perspective.
For example, if you usually are very organized and one day you miss an appointment, you should not feel guilty. You are allowed to make mistakes.
Let go of guilt by recognizing your responsibility, expressing your sadness that the situation occurred, and focusing on the present., One technique for processing guilt is to look at guilt as a judgement against yourself. To help yourself stop feeling guilty, take a moment to release yourself from your own judgements.Make a list of all the things you feel guilty about or recognize that you have judged yourself for. It could be as broad as telling yourself that you are a bad person, or as specific as telling yourself you are stupid for dropping your coffee this morning.
Sit down and say out loud, ""I release myself from the judgement that I am a bad person,"" or ""I release myself from the judgement that I am stupid for dropping my coffee.""

, Visualizing your guilt may also help you to acknowledge it, assess whether it is worth worrying about, and move forward. Try imagining that you are driving a car on a highway, and whenever you feel guilty, your car begins to drag to the left or right. When that happens, imagine that you are pulling your car to the side of the road, identifying the source of the problem or guilt, and figuring out what you can do to fix it.For example, if you feel guilt over something that you can fix, such as by apologizing to someone, then take some time to fix it.
If there is nothing you can do to fix your car, then imagine yourself getting back on the road and driving straight ahead.

, Guilt can take a toll on your physical body. Since guilt usually indicates that you need punishment, you may be caught in a vicious cycle of internal punishment. When you don’t know why you feel guilty, self-punishment can feel especially exhausting. Take time to relax and push the feelings of guilt out of your mind. This will also reduce your stress level.Help yourself get out of the punishment mode by thinking about something you did correctly that day.
For example, congratulate yourself for making it to the gym, making a healthy food choice, or spending time with your family when you didn’t have to.
There are many ways to relax, such as practicing breathing exercises, meditating, visualization techniques, and so on., To stop feeling guilty for no reason, you need to let go of your feelings of guilt. Identify any wrongdoing you might have committed, seek forgiveness from yourself and others, and then stop giving yourself permission to feel this way. Accept that there is no way to change what has already happened.Remember that letting go can be choosing to stop blaming others or yourself as well as forgiving yourself and others., Sometimes you may have a constant sense of guilt because you expect perfection from yourself. Consider that you may be demanding something from yourself that you can never have. No one on Earth is perfect. When you expect yourself to be perfect, you set yourself up for failure. A sense of failure can make you maintain feelings of guilt. Instead, tell yourself that you are only human.When you make mistakes, correct them and then stop thinking about it.

, Find a solution for your guilt by avoiding situations that give you guilty feelings. You may feel guilt for no reason, but some situations make you feel worse than others. Identify these situations and avoid them.Start by keeping a planner and writing down each of your daily activities in it. After each activity is over, write down how you felt, such as “good,” “happy,” “sad,” or “guilty.”
Later, look at your list of emotions and group the activities that make you feel guilty into one list. It might help to categorize them as a type of situation, such as “performance” when you have to do something for someone else.
Take measures to reduce or stop these activities.

, If you are guilty about something, then you may need to forgive yourself to move on. Forgiving yourself can help you to release your feelings of guilt and feel okay with yourself again. This can be an ongoing process, but with time you may start to feel better.

Inability to let go of past failures or mistakes in your life.;
, Forgive yourself for the specific thing you did wrong, so that you can repair your sense of self and move on with life. You should make sure you have stopped doing whatever it is that you feel guilty or shameful about. Then, forgive yourself for the specific thing that you feel bad about.If you have harmed someone important in your life, experienced failure or made a mistake at your workplace, you would benefit from forgiving yourself.If you forgive yourself before stopping the behavior you feel bad about, you may simply be letting yourself down. For example, forgiving yourself for smoking can be a way of excusing a bad habit that is negatively impacting your life. Instead, quit smoking and then forgive yourself for being a former smoker., In your journal or a notebook, write down three good things in your life. Write about something good that happened in your day, how it happened and why you feel grateful. It is helpful to write down three things you are grateful for on a daily basis, perhaps at the end of your day.If you were able to catch up with an old friend on the phone, you could write: “Got a chance to catch up with John. It was so nice to hear from him. I ran into him at the party the other week and suggested we catch up on the phone. I’m happy we were able to reconnect.”
If you made time in your day for a nice breakfast in the morning, you could write: “I woke up a bit earlier this morning and enjoyed a really delicious breakfast. I had time for a second cup of coffee at home before going to work, which was lovely.”
If your kids were well behaved after school, you could note: “Sara and Dave got their homework done after school. They didn’t tease or fight today. Feel grateful for some signs of improved behavior.”

, Every once in a while, such as once a week, you should review the list of positive things in your life.This practice will allow you to turn your attention away from self-criticism and towards gratitude, which is very important for self-esteem and a positive outlook on life.Practicing gratitude can increase your sense of well-being and has multiple mental health benefits.If you wrote about being grateful for the friends in your life on Monday, about a nice meal on Wednesday and about a good sleep on Saturday, think about how lucky you are to have friends, rest and delicious food in your life.

, Allow yourself to move on from past mistakes and failures. Instead of focusing on the past, turn your attention towards your future goals or ambitions. Consider what kinds of relationships and career advancements you want to achieve in the next year.If you want to make a career transition in the next year, think about a manageable goal that would allow you to start making this transition such as enrolling in a relevant course or talking to a friend in the field.
If you want to move up in your field, consider writing down a goal that would help with your career advancement.
If there is a certification that you need to advance in your field, consider how you could make room in your life to work on it.

, Recognize the value in your ideas and share them with the world. If you find yourself discounting your own ideas in relationships or at the workplace, you could stop being self-depreciating and start sharing ideas in small ways.Try sharing your ideas as a suggestion. You could say: “I just had a thought about how this might work. What if we did it this way.”
Try saying: “I wrote some ideas down about our project last night. I thought I would share a few of the key ideas I wrote down and get your feedback on them.”

, Instead of refusing compliments from people in your life, you should try to accept them. If someone gives you a compliment, try to smile and say “thank you.”Try accepting a compliment with one of these phrases:“Thanks so much, it means a lot to me.”
“That is so sweet of you. I really appreciate it and will also pass your compliment along to my colleague Jen, who helped me with the project.”
You should avoid trying to give a better compliment to them. For example, avoid saying: “That’s nice of you but you put way more work into it than I did.”

Keep yourself and children safe.,
Let a trusted friend or family member know your situation.,
Know where your escape route is.,
Have a phone with you at all times.,
Call a domestic violence hotline.",How to Communicate With an Angry Person6," Your personal physical safety should be your number one concern when you are with someone who is angry most or all the time.If you have children in the house and they experience harm to their physical, emotional, and mental safety, or they witness violence in the household, you need to ensure your own safety and the safety of your children.


Have a plan so you know what to do if your safety is at risk.
If it’s possible, obtain an alternate place to stay or stay in a safehouse to ensure your safety.
Use a code word with your children that can be used if anyone is in danger. Teach them what to do in case you use the code word (for example, they should leave the house and run to a specific friend’s house).

, If you are able, talk with your friend, neighbor or family member about your safety plan. Talk over visual cues that you might use if you are in danger., Identify the nearest exits. If you can’t get out of your house, identify safe areas of the house where there are no weapons or other instruments that can be used to hurt you.Always park your car face out in your driveway and keep the gas tank full.

, Carry your phone with you and program in important phone numbers.

, If you are having trouble getting away from your situation, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline. This hotline is staffed with people who can help you come up with a plan. They can also provide you with a shelter to go to.

Express your opinion without assigning blame.,
Get creative when expressing your enthusiasm.,
Be careful with criticism.,
Respond carefully when you’re hurt.,
Know when NOT to respond.",How to Be Passionate Without Being Angry1," Even the appearance of attacking someone or their beliefs in the course of expressing your own can make you seem hostile and angry. Ask others about their own opinions in a judgment-free manner as much as you can.


Use phrases such as: “I”m curious about…” “What did you mean when you said…” or “I want to understand how you feel about…”
Avoid rigid categorizations when addressing someone: “You should,” “You always/never,” “You’re just,” and so on.;
, Finding innovative ways to express your passions is a great way to spread your fervor without appearing strident or overbearing.


Join a group of like-minded people. There are innumerable options here, from churches, to volunteer groups, to recreational sports leagues, and so on. Find one that’s right for you, and don’t be afraid to “shop around.”
Art can be a great outlet for passion. Drawing, sculpture, poetry, dance, and photography are just a few options for a constructive outlet.
When all else fails, exercise. It’s a great stress reducer and helps release intense, pent up emotion., Sometimes we all get the urge to critique something or someone that has aroused our passions. It’s best to criticize judiciously and positively, if you must.


People take criticism personally, so tread carefully. Avoid being insulting or mean, and focus on actions or things rather than the person.
Remember that tone is hard to convey in writing, so be especially careful in giving a written critique. Avoid sarcasm.
Try to offer suggestions rather than merely pointing out what is wrong. “This is a terrible idea” is far less helpful than “Perhaps we should finish our cigarettes, then gas up the car.”, Sometimes you may be deeply offended, perhaps inadvertently, regarding an issue you’re passionate about. Lashing out at such times is a natural response, but you’ll appear angry and you may exacerbate the situation.


Let the other person know that they’ve hurt you by writing them a letter. The act of writing forces you to verbalize your emotions, and think things through. You also have the opportunity to hold on to the message for a few days, to see if your feelings have moderated in that time.
If you’re normally talkative and gregarious, you can demonstrate your pain by clamming up. Don’t take this too far, of course - you want the other person to notice that your feelings are wounded, but you don’t want to alienate them or make them guess as to what’s wrong.
Be prepared to be more direct if they don’t pick up on your cues. Cancel a regular social engagement to get their attention, or use a fictionalized version of what’s bothering you to engage them. If they’re prepared to sympathize with how a fictional “Suzy” was hurt by an insensitive remark about her weight, you can reveal yourself to be Suzy if you need to drive the point home., Sometimes the best response to a misunderstanding, especially on a subject you feel strongly about, is no response at all. This is particularly true if the other person has misunderstood your feelings or opinions on the matter.Remember that you are not obligated to respond to a misunderstanding.
Your beliefs have value, regardless of what others may think of them. Keep this in mind to help you resist the urge to respond needlessly to provocation.
Take a breather. Sometimes taking time away before deciding to respond is all you need to do. The issue may seem less urgent or upsetting once you revisit it, obviating the need to do anything.

Recognize your inner critic.,
Use affirmative self-talk.,
Practice meditation.,
Seek professional help.",How to Stop Being Too Hard on Yourself2," You should learn to recognize your “inner critic” or, in other words, the voice in your head that says mean things. If you hear yourself saying things to yourself that you would never say to a friend, it is your inner critic. If you hear this critic, take a deep breath and let the thought pass. When you feel more relaxed, notice that things aren’t as bad as your inner critic may have described them. Try to think about the topic you were considering in a more grounded and reasonable way.If you hear yourself saying things in black and white terms, in an irrational but persistent tone, you may also be experiencing your inner critic., Remember that the things we say about ourselves, even when they aren’t expressed to someone else, make a difference in our lives. Try using affirmative statements such as the following:“I can get through this situation.”
“I am a basically good human being.”
“I love myself.”
“I have something to contribute.”
“My work matters.”

, Find a relaxing and relatively quiet room in your home. Find someplace to sit such as a chair or a cushion. Sit up straight, with a straight back and an open chest. Imagine a string pulling you up from the base of your spine to the top of your head. Notice that you are breathing. If you find your mind is wandering, simply turn your attention back to your breath. By meditating, you can learn to listen to your own experience and be more mindful of your life.Use an application such as Headspace, Buddhify, Calm or the Mindfulness App. With a meditation application, you can follow a guided meditation. You can also customize meditation sessions with different start and end bells or gongs.

Avoid dwelling on your mistakes.,
Put failure in perspective.,
Talk to a friend.",How to Stop Being Too Hard on Yourself3," Try to avoid mulling over your mistakes or failures. It is important to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Although you may feel bad about how things have turned out in some area of your life, it is necessary to learn from them and move on with future projects and goals.If you find yourself ruminating on all of the mistakes you made in a failed romantic relationship, you may want to stop chewing over or repeating these mistakes in your mind. Repeating negative thoughts about yourself or a relationship can be a way to get stuck. If you find you are not getting any new insights into why the relationship failed or about yourself, you may be better off shifting your attention to your current life circumstances and future plans., Think about your life in the future such as two, five or ten years. Imagine your future life and the things you hope to have achieved in your work and relationships. From the perspective of your future self, consider whether the event or experience you are currently struggling with will still matter. Perhaps you are being too hard on yourself.For example, perhaps you missed an important meeting and lost a client to another company. Perhaps you will be able to find new clients in the coming year or two and this event will only look like a minor setback in a few years.

, It may help to talk to a friend about the things you are struggling with or being hard on yourself for. If you find it difficult to gain perspective on things, they may be able to help. You can lighten the burden by sharing your difficulties. Your friendship may even bring some laughter into your life, which also helps to lighten the load.You could invite a friend for a coffee or drink. Tell them about your struggles and see if they can offer a different perspective. Perhaps they will be able to see the situation in a different light.
You could go see some standup comedy or a film with a friend. Before or after the event, you could open up to your friend about your current situation. See if they can offer some perspective.

Be cordial.,
Seek points of agreement.,
Appeal to your opponent’s sense of morality.,
Let them have their say.,
Respect their point of view.",How to Be Passionate Without Being Angry2," Sometimes an argument or debate on a topic you’re passionate about will be unavoidable. An argument or debate necessarily contains a point of disagreement, and if the topic is something you’re passionate about then strong emotion is likely to be involved. Stay pleasant, especially at the outset, and you’ll have more opportunity to express your beliefs to a receptive ear.


Self-control is critical to maintaining a pleasant demeanor, even if you are seething on the inside. Use slow, steady breathing to help keep yourself calm.
If you tend to wear your heart on your sleeve, practice controlling your facial expressions ahead of time. Giving a scornful look as the other person speaks is a great way to turn disagreement into anger.

, Identifying common ground gives you a mutual starting place, so that your disagreements will seem less stark.


Some easy starting places are appeals to family, generosity, and other generally positive things that most people can support.
Use phrases like, “Wouldn’t you agree that…” or “I think we share the same feelings on…”

, Where facts may fail to convince, a moral argument may succeed. Even if you don’t win the person over to your point of view, appealing to their sense of right and wrong can assuage hard feelings.


The idea is to appear righteous, rather than shrill, in the other person’s eyes.
You must appeal to their moral standards, rather than trying to convert them to your own. A study found that conservatives could make their arguments appealing to liberals, and vice-versa, more effectively by framing them carefully.
For example, liberals found military spending more acceptable when the egalitarian nature of the armed forces was emphasized, as well as its ability to raise people out of poverty., Allow your debating partner to speak their piece with limited interruption. This shows that you respect their views enough to give them your full attention, and it allows you analyze their position for weaknesses.


Listen attentively. You want to appear engaged and interested, with a positive demeanor. Make occasional eye contact, and don’t fall prey to distractions like looking at your phone or watch. That can make you appear impatient or disrespectful.
Make a mental note, as they speak, of points of agreement that you can also use as a point of departure for a counter-argument. You’ll appear friendlier by using phrases like, “I think we both agree that ….. However, …..,” and so on., Even if you wholeheartedly disagree with what your opponent says, give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming their views are honestly held, with good intentions.


This is particularly important if you are talking politics. Political views are often deeply ingrained, and studies show people are inclined to maintain their beliefs even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
You are unlikely to overcome this cognitive dissonance in a brief encounter, so be prepared to accept the difference in opinion graciously."

Volunteer for a cause.,
Rally others to your cause.,
Find simple, everyday ways to promote your passions.,
Start a nonprofit.",How to Be Passionate Without Being Angry3," There are thousands of groups, in almost every conceivable field, that want volunteers. It is likely you can find something that fits your interests and your schedule.


Large, national groups are an easy place to start. If conservation is your passion, you can try the Sierra Club, or a niche group like Trout Unlimited. The Red Cross is another versatile option that always needs volunteers and donations.Athletic groups and competitions frequently require volunteers as well - everything from triathlons and marathons, to youth sports, to the Special Olympics.If you want a little adventure, try volunteering abroad. College spring break volunteer trips are often available through universities, while a huge variety of organization offer opportunities from church missions, to conservation projects, to volunteering on an organic farm., By being an energetic, effective leader you can inspire like-minded people to join you in supporting your passions.Enthusiasm is contagious. Project excitement about your cause and you’ll draw positive attention and even participation from others.
Harness that excitement into constructive action. Organize a volunteer event, raise money for a charity, or evangelize for your chosen cause, and with a little luck you’ll bring others along for the ride.

, There are many ways to do this, from choosing certain websites when shopping online, to choosing travel destinations based on sustainability or “voluntourism” opportunities.Take advantage of matching-gift policies. Many charitable groups have partners that offer to match donations dollar-for-dollar, so find those if you want to maximize your charitable impact.
You can donate your computer’s idle processing time to support research through groups like SETI, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC), or Folding@Home. This can affect your utility bill, however.
Buy products that associate with or support your favored cause. Companies partner with charities and groups of every description, so check to see if there’s a way to support your passion while purchasing what you need.

, If volunteering or creative outlets aren’t enough for you, you can build a career out of your passion by starting a nonprofit group.


While this requires substantial resources that may be too much for some, you can devote your time fully to a cause by creating your own nonprofit group.Check to make sure that there is no existing group that adequately meets the need you hope to fill. If one exists, consider whether a new group is necessary, or if it would needlessly divide fundraising and advocacy for your chosen cause.
There are often substantial regulatory requirements for starting such a group that are location-specific, so check with the appropriate agencies where you live. Regulations may also be specific to certain types of organization. Political nonprofits, for example, have restrictions on certain activities related to advertising and fundraising that charity nonprofits do not."

Unchecked anger can actually trigger or worsen depression.
Justified anger that drives you toward positive change can be a positive emotion, but oftentimes, people who struggle with depression find themselves dragged down by anger instead of helped by it. This anger is typically explosive, but for some individuals, it can be so deeply rooted that you barely recognize it.
If your bouts of anger leave you feeling guilty, they're only feeding into your depression, no matter how good they feel initially. You'll need to control this type of anger before you can learn to control your depression.;
, Before you can control your anger, you need to identify it. You'll also need to identify your depression and learn to distinguish one internal state from the other.By intentionally labeling your emotional state, whether it's anger or depression, you can capture your feelings and help prevent them from running unchecked.
If you habitually suppress your anger, you may have trouble labeling it for what it is. Anger can masquerade itself as motivation by driving you to perform some immediate form of action. When the action you feel inclined to perform involves causing pain (emotional or physical) to yourself or others, the underlying state is likely anger.

, Anger is often symptomatic of a much deeper issue. To control your anger, you'll need to address the cause of it.


The anger might be connected to the root of your depression. Past traumas, for instance, can trigger or worsen depression and may also cause bouts of anger to emerge when memory of that trauma threatens to resurface.
Even if you can't connect anger to any past trauma, it still has a present day cause. You'll need to find a solution to that cause if you want to control the anger it evokes.

, As soon as your temper flairs, you need to work on calming yourself down. Anger can be useful when harnessed properly, but if you let it run wild, it can quickly overwhelm you. The reactions that follow could also lead to depression.


Some immediate steps you can take to calm yourself include deep breathing and positive self-talk.Try taking a few deep breaths from your diaphragm. Once you've steadied your breathing, repeat a calming word or phrase like ""breathe,"" ""relax,"" or ""it'll be okay."" These actions cut your angry thoughts off before they can build to a heightened state.

, Step away from the cause of your anger and take some time to calm down. Distracting yourself and releasing the powerful burst of energy in a controlled, healthy manner can take the edge off your anger and help you control it more effectively.Consider exercising to expel excess energy. Go for fast-paced walk or jog. Jump rope or do jumping jacks. Any form of exercise that gets your blood pumping can help.
Alternatively, do something that relaxes and distracts you. Listen to soothing music. Take a bubble bath. Hang out with friends. Doing things that create positive energy may help you balance out the negative emotions you currently feel.

, Turn to someone you trust and talk to them about your feelings. Make sure that you vent your anger without inflicting it upon your confidant. In other words, talk to him or her about your anger and its source without getting angry at the individual listening to you.


Wait until you're calm enough to control your emotions around other people. If you lash out at your confidant, you may damage your relationship and create feelings of guilt that could feed into depression.
As you talk through things, be open to constructive criticism and feedback. If your confidant has advice on how you can compromise or change for the better, consider it as rationally as possible.

, An alternate way to process your emotions is through writing. Consider keeping a record of your angry thoughts and experiences. Doing so can calm you down and help you understand your anger better in the long run.


Periodically read through your journal. Ideally, you'll eventually gather insights regarding the things that trigger your anger and your usual method of reacting to it. You may also notice patterns that connect anger to depression.

, It might seem impossible to find humor in a situation that initially causes nothing but rage, but finding humor in the crazy, chaotic happenings of life can make it easier to confront those circumstances.


Some circumstances are too serious to laugh about, of course, and you don't need to push yourself to find humor in a truly humorless situation.
If you can't find humor in the situation responsible for your anger, try looking for humor elsewhere. Doing so can distract your mind away from your angry thoughts and balance your emotional state.

, Ideally, you should try wishing your opponent well by hoping for a positive resolution that satisfies you both. When this is impossible, though, try focusing your thoughts, wishes, and prayers outside of your own situation and on someone else you can care about more easily.Try to look at the situation from your opponent's perspective to garner compassion for him or her. Even if you still feel that your opponent was in the wrong, the intensity of your feelings may soften as compassion builds. This can also make it easier to forgive the person who wronged you.
If you aren't able to wish your opponent well right now, focus on wishing happiness on someone uninvolved. Thinking positive, healing thoughts toward anyone can help shift your mind out of its enraged state and may prevent you from lashing out at others.

, When you're angry or depressed, it can be tempting to turn to alcohol or other substances that help numb the anger and pain you feel. Doing so will ultimately result in more harm than good, though.


Alcohol and drugs can increase the risk of acting on impulse, and if you're still enraged over your situation, that might have profoundly negative consequences.
Moreover, relying on drugs and alcohol can create unhealthy behavioral patterns that could result in future difficulties.

, Before taking any action, you need to make sure that you are able to stop yourself from doing something you'll come to regret later on. If you regret the things you did when you were angry, those regrets will likely feed into a deeper sense of depression.

, Anger can have a positive or negative purpose. When anger is connected to depression, however, it can be easy for even healthy bouts of anger to devolve into something negative.


Anger that serves a positive purpose pushes you toward growth and resolution. On the other hand, anger that serves a negative purpose is blindly driven by a sense of loss or inadequacy.
When anger has a positive purpose, it usually won't feed into depression. Anger driven by some negative force must be consciously addressed, though, if you want to prevent it from causing or worsening your next depressive episode.

, This is easier said than done, of course, but it's essential that you accept the circumstances surrounding your anger and stop obsessing over the wrongness of it all.


Consider whether or not you may have any unreasonable demands that prevent you from letting things go.
One common example is the expectation that life must be fair. This would be true in an ideal world, but the world is far from ideal, and injustice affects everyone in varying degrees. The sooner you can accept the truth of the matter, the sooner you'll be able to accept your unfair circumstances without obsessing about how unfair they seem.

, As your anger drives you to complain about your circumstances, pay close attention to the nature of your complaints and determine whether or not they're doing you any good.


Overt complaints hassle other people. If they allow you to work toward a solution, they might be beneficial. Oftentimes, though, they exist only as a means of pushing negativity onto others and prevent resolution from occurring.
Covert complaining causes you to hassle yourself. This type of complaining almost always builds into depression by causing you to become passive and encouraging guilt.

, Once you calm down and evaluate your anger, you can use whatever anger remains to help fuel you toward resolution. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean fighting the injustice causing your anger or moving on in spite of that injustice.


Whenever possible, focus on finding ways to deal with the issue so that it no longer creates the sensation of rage. Remind yourself that your anger won't actually fix the matter at hand; you'll need to take action if you want to remedy the problem.

, Suppressing your anger can cause you to turn it inward, which may only worsen your depression. You'll need to express your anger to the involved parties, but you'll need to do it in a way that helps rather than hurts. This will be easier to manage if you've gone through the process of calming down and evaluating your emotional state.


Your depression may build if you allow yourself to be stepped on, so submission isn't the answer. The key is to assert yourself without becoming defensive or hostile. Stand up for your own interests without attempting to squash the interests of everyone else involved.

, Don't be afraid of seeking professional medical or psychological help for your anger and depression. It might be a necessary step in controlling both emotional states.


If your issues with anger and depression are quickly spiraling out of control, or if you find yourself unable to control them alone, it's time to seek the wisdom of professionals. Your doctor may recommend using medication to control your depression. Counseling, like cognitive behavioral therapy, can also be used to help you manage your emotional state.

Cut yourself some slack.,
Forgive yourself.,
Care for yourself and those around you.,
Move forward.",How to Not Feel Bad Because of a Mistake," You’ll never be able to get past a mistake if you cannot bring yourself to confront it. You need to clearly identify the mistake, what caused it, and your culpability.This is not the time to make excuses. Maybe you were distracted or overburdened, but these don’t change the reality of the result. Don’t try to share the blame, even if you can. You can only control your role in any mistake, and you need to accept it as your mistake.We can sometimes use our guilt as a barrier to prevent us from accepting the consequences. If we’re already punishing ourselves with guilt, then maybe the other person won’t punish us, too. If you want to move on, you must accept that there are consequences, and punishing yourself will not remove those consequences.;
, You may think it’s embarrassing enough to admit a mistake to yourself, let alone telling others all about it. However, as awkward as it may be at first, sharing your mistake and how you feel about it is often a key step towards letting go and moving on.The time to share with any person(s) you’ve wronged with your mistake will come, but first you may want to confide in a friend, therapist, spiritual guide, or someone else you can trust.
It may seem silly, but verbally admitting your mistake, especially to someone else, can often be important in the process of accepting it.
Sharing your mistakes also reminds you that we all make them, and that none of us are perfect. We all know these truths, and yet they are easy to forget when dealing with a mistake.

, Once you have admitted your mistake to yourself and to anyone who may have been harmed by it, the next step is to do your best to make things right. In doing so, you may discover your error was not such a big deal to begin with. And, if it was a big deal, working to make amends will help you to bring the matter to a close and move past it.


Generally speaking, the sooner you make amends for a mistake, the better. For instance, if you make a mistake at work that costs your company a client and/or some money, it is best to inform your boss quickly — but give yourself some time to develop some ways you can make up for the error. Don’t let a mistake fester by not addressing it, which will only increase your guilt and the distress or anger in those you have wronged.There will be times when your mistake does not harm any particular person, or harms a person that is no longer around for an apology and amends. For example, perhaps you deemed yourself too busy to visit your grandmother, and now she has passed on. In such cases, consider “paying it forward” by helping others in similar circumstances, or just doing good deeds in general. Maybe, for instance, you could volunteer at an assisted-living facility, or make a point of spending more time with your remaining elderly relatives.

, It may seem like unnecessary punishment to delve into the details of your error, but a close examination of it is the best way to turn a mistake into a learning experience. Most mistakes can become worthwhile if you learn and improve because of them.Delve into the root causes of your mistake, such as jealousy (in saying something rude) or impatience (in getting a speeding ticket). Categorize the mistake in terms like jealousy or impatience so that you can more easily identify solutions.Remember: choosing to learn from a mistake is the path to growth; living in self-condemnation and contempt leads to personal stagnation., Identifying the cause(s) of your mistake is only the first step towards actually learning from it, of course. It's not enough to simply say ""I won't do that again"" without determining actionable changes that will prevent you from repeating the same or similar mistake.


You don't magically learn from a mistake just by analyzing the details of it and admitting your fault, although these are essential steps. Think about what specifically you could have done differently in that situation, and lay out what specifically you will do differently the next time you face a similar scenario.Take time to actually write down an ""action plan"" for next time. It really can help you visualize and prepare for avoiding the same mistake.
For instance, say that you forgot to pick up your friend from the airport because you stretched yourself too thin with so many responsibilities that you couldn't keep track of them all. Once you've identified this problem (and apologized to your buddy!), create a plan of action for better organizing and prioritizing your responsibilities when things get hectic. And also think about ways to say ""no"" when you are stretched too thin.

, Many of our most common mistakes, from overeating to yelling at a spouse for no good reason, can be attributed to bad habits. To prevent repetition of the mistake, you need to identify and address the habits that cause it.It can be tempting to try to identify and correct all your bad habits at once in order to create a ""new you,"" but it is best to take it easy and focus on one habit at a time. After all, what are the odds that you can quit smoking and spend more time with your mother at the same time? Instead, try focusing on breaking one bad habit, then consider your readiness to tackle another.
Make the changes as simple as possible. The more complex your plan is to break a bad habit, the more likely it is to fail. If you want to wake up earlier because you're regularly late to work and important appointments, go to bed earlier and/or set your bedroom clock ahead ten minutes.
Find ways to fill the void created by your former habit. Make it something positive, like exercising, spending more time with your kids, or volunteering.

, Many people who have trouble moving beyond mistakes suffer from unrealistic expectations for themselves. It is laudable to hold yourself to a high standard of behavior, but demanding perfection of yourself will only cause pain for you and those close to you.Ask yourself, “Is this mistake really as bad as I’m making it out to be?” If you examine it honestly, more often than not the answer will be “no.” When the answer is “yes,” all you can do is insist upon yourself that you learn even more from this mistake.Show compassion for yourself, as you would for others. Consider whether you would treat your best friend so harshly if he or she made the exact same mistake. In almost all cases, you would show compassion and support. In this case, remember that you should really be your own best friend, and act accordingly with compassion., Forgiving others for their transgressions can be very difficult sometimes, and yet it is so often still easier than forgiving ourselves for even small mistakes. If, as the old saying goes, “forgiveness begins at home,” then you need to be able to start with yourself.


You may see it as a foolish task, but it may help you to verbally forgive yourself — as in, literally saying “I forgive myself for spending the rent money on a night out on the town.” Some people may find writing down the mistake and a self-forgiveness on a piece of paper, then crumpling and discarding it, to be equally effective.Forgiving yourself serves as a self-reminder that you are not your mistakes. You are not a mistake, an error, or somehow defective. Instead, you are an imperfect being who makes mistakes like everyone else, and grows because of them., If you are struggling with letting go of a mistake, it is good to remind yourself that holding on may well be bad for your own health and detrimental to the well-being of those closest to you as well. You owe it to your body and to your loved ones to find a way to get past your error.


When you experience guilt, chemicals are released in your body that can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, and disrupt proper digestion, muscle relaxation, and critical thinking skills. Excessive guilt can thus be literally harmful to your health.
The saying “misery has company” has real merit, because someone who doesn't allow himself a break from guilt tends to drag down all those around him as well. You will likely be more withdrawn and more critical of others because of guilt over your mistake, and your spouse, children, friends, and even pets will suffer part of the price for it.

, Once you have owned up to your mistake, done your best to make amends, and forgiven yourself for it, you need to be able to let it go and worry about it no longer. It should exist only in the form of the lesson learned that will benefit you going forward.


When you find your mind drifting back to your mistake and the guilt you felt over it, remind yourself that you have been forgiven. Say it out loud if necessary to remind yourself that the case is closed.Some people find help in the process by using the Positive Emotion Refocusing Technique, or PERT. To do it, close your eyes and take two deep, long, purposeful breaths. On the third breath, start to picture either someone you love deeply or an image of natural beauty and serenity. As you keep breathing, explore this “happy place” and bring your guilt in with you. Find your path to letting go and finding peace within this space, then open your eyes and leave your guilt behind.
Moving forward from mistakes will help you to live your life without regrets. Remember, it is better to learn from mistakes than regret not trying. What is true for toddlers trying to walk or children trying to ride a bike is true for adults dealing with a mistake: falling down is practice, and getting up to try again is progress."

You’re more likely to give the person a productive response (and less likely to be mean) if you allow yourself to cool down first. You might need to make up an excuse, but tell the person that you will have to get back to her in a little while. If you can’t think of anything else to say, you can just say “excuse me for a few minutes,” then step outside and get your temper under control before you respond.;
, Though they can be difficult to separate at times, your thoughts affect your feelings. Your feelings, in turn, affect your actions. Thus, if you want to change your actions, you can start by changing your thoughts (which will change your feelings.)For example, if you think, “My life sucks!” then you may feel depressed or angry and you can in turn act out in a negative way, by sulking or by slamming doors. If, however, you change your thought to “this is challenging, but I can handle it,” you will feel less angry, and your actions will improve accordingly.
However, realize that even though thoughts and feelings relate to actions, you can always choose to act (or not act) a certain way. You may not always be able to choose your thoughts or feelings.Know that it may take time to change the way that you choose to act, and you might not always make the best decision in the moment. That's okay; being mindful and trying to change is heading in the right direction.

, Take a break on a bench outdoors or take a little nature walk to calm yourself down. Finding a change of scenery from what made you angry and enjoying the gifts of nature can help you get your anger under control so that you can be nicer to others.If possible, take a brisk walk. The exercise can help calm you down, and being outdoors may improve your mood., This may seem difficult when you’re really anger, but if you can find a reason to laugh, the humor will overcome the anger in your body. A good laugh can help you break out of your angry mindset and make you more pleasant for others to be around. Trying to find humor in a situation, or getting yourself laughing about something else, can diffuse the situation by actually changing your body’s chemical reaction from anger to humor.If someone accidentally shreds an important document, your first reaction may be to yell at them out of anger. However, you may be able to stop yourself and think of a humorous scene in your favorite TV show about a misunderstanding that led to someone shredding the wrong document. Laughing about that can keep you from becoming too angry.

, Meditation can help you regulate your emotions, which can help you communicate with others in a nicer way. Therefore, if you are feeling as though you might be unkind to someone due to feeling angry, give yourself a little mental refresher through meditation. Find a private, quiet place, then follow the following sequence: Breathe deeply and slowly. Deep breaths can slow your heart rate and make you feel calmer. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends outwards on the “in” breath.
Picture a golden-white light filling your body as you breathe in. Picture that light filling and relaxing your mind. When you breathe out, visualize dark, muddy colors leaving your body.
Once you are calm from your meditation, you should feel more ready to speak to others in a kind way.

, It is important to respect others when you are making a choice about how to act in (or react to) a given situation. Having empathyfor the way that others feel can go a long way to helping you maintain positive communication with others. Think about how you would feel if someone lashed out at you because she was angry—whether or not you were the source of anger—and try to use that to inform your own communication.


Unfortunately, many people find that they inadvertently direct their anger towards their children. If you are angry or irritated about something and your child asks you “why is the sky blue” for the 1,000th time or asks you to help them finish a 3-week project hours before it is due, it is all too easy to snap at them. However, remembering that you respect them and would not want them to snap or yell at you might help you interact more kindly with them.

, Rather than expressing yourself passively (being angry without saying anything) or aggressively (exploding in a way that may seem disproportionate to the stressor), try assertive communication. To practice assertive expression, use the facts involved (not exaggerated by emotion) to communicate requests (rather than demands) of others in a respectful way. Communicate clearly and express your feelings effectively so that everyone’s needs are met.


For example, if your carpool ride is late every day, instead of never saying anything but feeling angry (passive) or exploding at the driver and calling her names (aggressive), try to communicate your frustration with assertive expression.

You might say, “I really enjoy carpooling with you, Jane, but I feel frustrated that you are 5-10 minutes late most days. I know that it may not seem like a big deal, but it causes me to feel stressed and behind schedule before my day begins, and I would really appreciate it if you could try to leave a little earlier in the future.”



, Communication is not all about words. Your words can be completely polite while your body language or actions are communicating anger. When angry, you may find that your muscles are tight and rigid. This may send a signal to others that you are not approachable.


You may want to try using progressive muscle relaxation—a process by which you tense and then release all of the muscles in your body—to try to get the anger out of your body as well as your mind. , You need to get plenty of sleep every night to thrive.Being sleep deprived can contribute to a wide range of health problems, including the inability to manage emotions properly. Getting adequate sleep can help you have the patience and understanding to maintain relationships with others regardless of your emotional state.


If you have chronic sleep problems, consult your physician. You may be able to make dietary or lifestyle changes to improve your sleep. You may also be able to try herbal or medicinal supplements to sleep more.

, Exercise can help you feel less angry in the moment by releasing endorphins into your body. Regular exercise can also help you regulate your emotions in general. You may find that getting regular exercise gives you more energy throughout the day, which can help you be productive and patient without getting irritated with other people.

, Choosing foods that are more nutritious and lower in sugar and fat can boost your energy, improve your overall health, and contribute to a happier mood in general.Choose whole foods that are minimally processed. Eat more fruits, veggies, lean meats, and legumes. Think of them as all-day energy and abundant nutrition for your body that can leave you more equipped to be nice to other people!
Avoid foods such as candy bars, soda, cake, doughnuts, and pastries, which lead to massive energy crashes and offer no nutrition and added calories.

Accept the past.,
Remember that things happen for a reason.,
Take stock of your failures and successes.,
Don't announce that you are starting over.,
Discover your purpose.,
Set goals and make decisions.,
Take a new route.,
Make Sense your new motto.,
Get over yourself.,
Rely on others and ask for help.,
Prepare for moments of weakness.,
Celebrate your progress.,
Keep moving.",How to Start Over in Life," You can't start over in your life if you're still holding onto the past. Whether be a relationship, job, family or other situation, you need to accept what has happened.


Acceptance doesn't necessarily mean forgiveness or understanding. It just means that you have realized something has happened, you acknowledged it, and you are ready to move on from it.
Remember that pain and suffering aren't the same thing. You will feel pain and hurt when you're life isn't going in the direction you want, but you don't have to suffer. Suffering is a choice. Nothing last forever, including pain. So acknowledge it, experience it, and move on from it. Don't center your life around the hurt and the failures; get out of that story and avoid the drama (e.g., ""I will never find love again"" or ""I will never be able to get another job"").;
, This is not to say that you are powerless and that things are just ""fated"" to be a certain way. Rather, nothing has meaning besides the meaning you assign to it. It’s up to you to make every event, incident, and moment in your life empowering or disempowering.


The lessons you are to learn won't be obvious; you instead have to discover what your life is telling you. For example, what if you are asked to step down from a position in your career because your ideas for the business are too big or you are taking things in a different direction than what management envisions for the company? Instead of reading this as a failure on your part, think of it as confirmation that you and your boss have fundamentally different visions and that perhaps it's time to part ways so you can realize your vision elsewhere., You can't ""quit life"", so instead of getting down when things aren't work out as planned, ask yourself, ""What is or was working in my situation or circumstance?""Write it all down. Keep notes to yourself about your successes, even the small ones. Write every night about something that went well that day. Focusing on the positive helps attract more of it!Then think about how can promoting what is or was working for you even more. For example, maybe you realize that in you were great at talking with customers but that the location wasn't right for your business and that you need to change venues to an area with more foot traffic. Think about what works or worked for you and how you could improve on that even further., Just do it.You don't need to validate your choices to make a change in your life. You don't need to tell other people or ask them what they think you should do; often when we feel insecure, we consult others so that we feel better about our plan or to prepare them for the transformation. But your life is YOUR life. Move on and people will grow with you. Those that don't perhaps aren't meant to be in your life in the first place.Your next steps in life aren't about anyone else but you. Ignore what everyone else says. A lot of their resistance will be about them and not you because it makes them question their own lives. Remember that only you need to feel comfortable with your choices and decisions., Thinking about the meaning of your life is one of the first major steps toward making big changes.


What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? What are you passionate about? What makes you feel like you matter? Answering these questions is key to figuring out what will make you happy and give you a fulfilling life.
Say, you love yoga and have been going to yoga classes 3 times a week for 5 years. Maybe it's not your hobby, but your passion! Maybe you'd like to shift from being the student to the teacher. Think about what truly satisfies your life and makes you feel like you are making a difference and make that the core of your new life.Life is only worth living if you are really living. If you've always wanted to teach yoga, why not go for it? You get one one life, so make sure you are doing the right things with it. Don't wait around for a reason to start living your life the way you want., Once you have determined your general purpose and big life goals, decide specifically how you will reach these goals and then make the needed changes. Are you going to break up with your current partner? Are you going to move to a new city? Are you going back to school?


Set short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals for yourself. Write them down and put them somewhere where you can see them daily (e.g., a refrigerator door or stuck to your bedroom mirror).
Organize your life. You can't change your life if you're living a crazy unorganized way. Once you know exactly what change you want to effect and what goals you want to reach, you can begin to plan to make the necessary changes.

, Do something different and surprise yourself; you'll probably learn something you didn't know about who you are and what you can do.One of the best ways to jolt yourself out of a life you're not satisfied with is to do something completely different. Go on a trip to some place you've never been. Start learning a language. Take up a new sport or exercise, whether it be gymnastics, kick boxing or cycling.
Even if you think you might be terrible at it, give something new a try. Trying something new things mentally and physically challenges us and also gives us a fresh excitement for life as we can see the endless possibilities of the next day.Yes, the unknown is scary, but it is also equally scary to do what you know and continue down a disappointing and unsatisfying path. You might feel nervous or insecure about starting over but you need to think about whether this is worse than the disappoint and lack of fulfillment you feel with your life as it stands., Live in the moment and know that’s the only moment that really matters. Give it your full attention. It’s your reality. And when that moment is over, move to the next moment. Are you still breathing? Yes. Then, consider that moment handled successfully! Move on to the next moment that will bring you one step closer to engaging in your life again.Take one day at a time. This may sound clichéd, but that doesn't make it less true. Do what needs to be done TODAY—not tomorrow, not next week. This is what makes starting over manageable. Trying to face the next 365 days can seem impossible, but trying to face the single day ahead seems possible! , You don't know everything. You make mistakes. Knowing how to change your own oil, cook a fancy French dinner, or understand the ins-and-outs of macro-economics does not make you a better person. It just makes you more knowledgeable about some things. Is it knowledge you desire or the ability to prove something to others? Ask yourself why it matters. Does it make you happy? If the answer is no, stop it! You can't do everything and you don't have to.If you're actually interested in learning how to do something, go for it! But if you're doing something to prove to others that you can do it or that you're an everyman or every woman, then knock it off. You're enough in and of yourself. You don't need to prove anything to anyone., Once you are comfortable with the idea of not needing to know everything, take a look at what you're doing that's not your expertise, skill set or something that you simply have no interest in doing. Hire it out; pay someone to change your oil or to wash the windows. Make decisions about how you want to spend your time and what you can afford to do.


Ask for help when you need it and rely on those with expertise in a certain area when you're unsure of how to do something. Needing, asking for and hiring help doesn't make you weak but instead makes you smart and resourceful. Everyone has different skills and no man is an island., Sometimes you will feel like your new plan is not working and you will want to revert to your old life. Plan for these moments.


This might mean deleting the numbers of people you call or text when you're down and need validation, like an old ex-boyfriend or girlfriend. It might mean not buying junk food for the house if you know you're a stress eater.
Having moments of weakness is common. We all stumble and vacillate between what is best for us in the FUTURE and what is easy RIGHT NOW. Challenge your ""now"" and replace it with your vision for your life in the long term., Remember to acknowledge all progress toward your new goal. Some of your milestones might be in the very long term and sometimes you can lose sight of what you're working towards. Instead, remember that the long run is a bunch of shorter runs and celebrate your successes along the way. Feel good about each step you take towards that new life, whether it be ending a relationship with a toxic person, sending out resumes, or joining a class in something you've never tried before. All of these small pieces are helping you create and realize the new life you've imagined for yourself., Life is always evolving and so should you. Stopping to smell the roses and embrace the moment is one thing, but simply stopping and standing still is another. You don't want your life to become stagnant again. There are always new people, new opportunities, and new experiences waiting for you and you should seek them out! "

See a doctor or psychiatrist.,
Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Try interpersonal therapy.,
Take antidepressant drugs.",How to Treat Clinical Depression1," The first step towards curing major depressive disorder is to receive a definite diagnosis. Many people who suffer from depression are reluctant to seek help, but it is important to be aware that depression is a condition that rarely goes away on its own. Therefore, seeking medical and psychiatric attention is the first step on the path to recovery.



See your doctor: If you've been experiencing symptoms associated with depression, such as insomnia or oversleeping, trouble with concentrating or remembering things, changes in appetite, weight gain or weight loss, and unexplained physical pain (such as headaches or back pain), it's important to see a doctor in order to rule out any physical conditions that could be causing the symptoms, such as hypothyroidism, hormonal imbalances or taking certain medications. If your doctor determines that there is nothing physically wrong with you, he/she may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist.

See a psychiatrist: A psychiatrist (or psychologist) will help you to work through the mental symptoms of depression, such as feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, grief, worthlessness and emptiness. Depending on the cause of your depression, your therapist will use different forms of psychotherapy to help you work through your issues, while prescribing antidepressant medications to correct any hormonal imbalances.;
, Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the most commonly used therapies for treating patients with major depressive disorder. It is based on the belief that negative thoughts lead to negative actions, and that these negative thoughts need to be understood and eliminated before the depression can be cured.


When you begin CBT, your therapist will ask you questions in order to identify the specific causes of your negative thoughts, actions and emotions. They might ask you to describe a time when you were feeling very low, then work backwards from that time to identify the thoughts or actions that led you to that point.
Once you have identified the causes of your negative emotions, you can work on correcting them. Your therapist will help you to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. For example, rather than thinking ""I am worthless and I can't do anything right"", you will learn to tell yourself something like have many great qualities such as creativity and compassion. My friends and family love and appreciate those qualities and so should I”.
CBT is a process, it will not cure depression overnight. It requires being open and honest with your therapist, and a genuine commitment to getting better. Combined with antidepressant medications, CBT can be a very effective way of treating and even curing depression.

, Interpersonal therapy is a short-term treatment (12 to 16 weeks) that was designed specifically to combat major depressive disorder. It focuses on understanding and improving your relationships with other people, as problems with interpersonal relationships are one of the major causes of depression.


IPT is split into four main areas — complicated grief due to loss, interpersonal disputes, role transitions and interpersonal deficits. Your therapist will help you to work through each of these areas in turn.

Complicated grief due to loss: Although grief is a completely normal reaction to the loss of a loved one (regardless of the specific circumstances), complicated grief occurs when you are unable to move on and neglect all other aspects of your life. IPT will help you to work through the grief and accept the loss.

Interpersonal disputes: An argument or falling out with an important person in your life can lead to depressions. IPT will help you to understand the dispute, see the other person's point of view and allow you to either make amends or accept the new situation.

Role transitions: Depression often comes on abruptly following a period of change or after a major transition in your life, which you have difficulty in getting used to or feel overwhelmed by. This could be caused by something like moving to a new location or becoming a new parent. IPT will help you to accept your new role.

Interpersonal deficits: Interpersonal deficits relate to problematic relationships and methods of interaction that have developed over the course of your life, leading to depression. IPT will help you to change the way you interact with others and see your relationships in a new light.

, In most cases, therapy is not enough to cure major depressive disorder — it needs to be combined with antidepressant medications which address the hormonal imbalances that cause or exacerbate feelings of depression.


The type of antidepressant medication you need to take will vary according to your specific case, but some commonly prescribed medications include Zoloft, Prozac, Seroxat and Lexapro. When taken properly, these drugs should improve symptoms of depression within 2 to 3 weeks.
According to data from the magazine European Psychiatry, reports from several European countries suggest that the increase in the prescription of antidepressants is one of the main factors reducing the rate of suicide."

Come up with what you are going to say.,
Decide who you are comfortable sharing with.,
Be ready for any reaction.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Bipolar Depression1," Before you get your family together to tell them about your bipolar depression, figure out exactly what you want to say. This will make you more prepared, which will help you feel less stressed and worried while you are telling them.


Try making a list of all the points you want cover when you talk with them. Even if you don't use all the points when you talk with them, you will feel more prepared and ready to discuss your disorder.For example, put together a list of when your symptoms first started, why you sought out for treatment, how long you've been in treatment, etc.;
, When you are telling your family about your disorder, you may not want to tell every member of your family. You may be comfortable telling your whole immediate family, such as your mom, dad, and siblings, but you may want to hold off telling others.


You can start off small and then gradually tell the rest of your family. If you are not close with parts of your immediate family, you may not be comfortable telling all of them either.
You can tell whomever you want. There is no right or wrong answer when deciding who to tell.
Mental illness is a very personal part of you life, so you may not feel comfortable telling everyone until you have told those closest to you first., You need to be ready to accept any way your family may react to the news of your bipolar depression. Your family may react with love and support. However, there may be some family members who will not be the most supportive about your bipolar depression. They may try to convince you that your mental illness is not real or valid or that you are fine and don't need help.


Unfortunately, this is still a common stigma attached to bipolar depression and many other mental illnesses.For example, your family may tell you, ""You're fine. You just need to snap out of his funk and you'll be fine."" or ""This is just an excuse to act in whatever way you want whenever you want. Just get a grip and act normal.""
If this happens, look to friends or other family members who will hopefully be more accepting.

Seek to understand what’s going on.,
Watch with compassion.,
Learn to go with the emotional flow.,
Unfold.,
Keep working on this.,
Ask yourself what you have learned from the wounding?",How to Heal Painful Wounds and Charges from the Past," You were wounded in some way and you created a set of beliefs. These are the beliefs that you can now explore by looking at the story you tell yourself about your wounding. When young and/or inexperienced, you would have had limited understanding of life and your environment, and survival was paramount. As such, you lacked the experience and knowledge needed to interpret the events that you would likely be able to deal with in a reasoned way now. So, you can use the person you are now, the person seeking to understand better, to look back on the story you tell yourself, so as to work out how to change it.


What are your beliefs around the particular issue or event? It’s important to understand this so that you can start to get some space from the past event the next time your wound is triggered in the present, and the emotional charge comes up. The charge may still overwhelm you, but now, there is a little, but growing part of you that is watching.;
, Everyone has stories, beliefs and emotional charges wrought from the pain that accompanies them. You were young and you created these beliefs to help you to survive, to protect yourself. There’s nothing wrong with that response, as it’s a normal human thing all human beings do to self protect. Have self-compassion and accept that the reaction to the pain was a form of your self-care. And now you are in a position to be kind to yourself, to undo the wounds and to become stronger, to be healed.

, When an emotional charge comes up, don’t push it away with your thoughts, don’t resist. Just feel the energy in your body. Be with it. Get out of your head where the story about your pain is going on. You have been telling yourself a pain story to keep you safe in your head and to protect you from actually feeling the pain. You also do it to remind yourself that you don’t want another similar wound happen again. What’s really going on, though, is that the story is perpetuating the pain, leaving you vulnerable, and even attracting similar events. So, it’s not working, is it?


Remember that the story about your pain is not in the present moment. The story is about your past or how it will affect your future. ‘Now’ is the place of power, the place where you have the power to heal. So, feel the energy in your body and this brings you into the present moment. Without the story, it’s just energy, it’s not pain. Be with it. Breathe. It’s okay, because magic is going to happen and every wound has an amazing gift. You want to heal and find out what that is.

, As you get out of your head, breathe, and feel the energy of your wound, something amazing happens. You are giving yourself the love and attention you really needed when you were young, the tender love that would have prevented the wound in the first place and has the power to heal it now. Through the power of your awareness and your love, the energy will start to dissolve. The charge will lose some power and you will feel a shift. Now you are the one loving and healing, not the victim.

, These emotional charges contain a lot of energy that has been fed sometimes for years and years, so repeat this process as necessary. It’s not how many times you fall down that counts, but how many times you get up. Each time you do, you dissolve it some more and your healing, loving, present moment awareness increases. It may take time, or it may happen in an instant, but your awareness and love will set you free.

, There is always a gift. Is it compassion? Strength? Love? A shift in perception? That is for you to discover and enjoy. The ultimate gift is freedom! To be able to see the world as it is, and to see yourself as you truly are.

Get more exercise.,
Eat healthily.,
Get enough sleep.,
Interact with other people.,
Experiment with herbal remedies, such as hypericum.",How to Treat Clinical Depression2," Exercise can be highly effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder (when combined with therapy and medications), as physical activity stimulates the production of neurotransmitters which are responsible for feelings of happiness and pleasure. Exercise has also been proven to stimulate the growth of new brain cells.


Find a physical activity that you enjoy doing, as this will make you much more inclined to exercise on a regular basis. This could be running, rowing, rock climbing, dancing or kickboxing — anything that gets your heart rate up!
Aim to exercise for 30 minutes, five times a week. Consistency is important when it comes to exercise, so you're better off exercising for shorter periods more frequently, than exercising in a single large chunk at the weekends.

, Many of the symptoms of depression coincide with a lack of certain nutrients, therefore changing your diet and becoming healthier can help you to tackle depression and gain more energy.



Eat more B vitamins: People who suffer from depression are likely to suffer from a B vitamin deficiency. Therefore, it's important to increase your intake of B vitamins, including B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folacin) and B12 ( obalamin). The best natural sources of B vitamins are yeast, liver, whole grains, rice, nuts, milk, eggs, meat, fish, fruits and leafy green vegetables.Increase your intake of Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for proper brain function, and have even been shown to encourage the growth of grey matter in the brains of people suffering from depression. You can increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids by eating more oily fish like mackerel, tuna, salmon, herring and sardines., Getting enough good quality sleep is essential for your overall health — it improves your mood, boosts brain function, gives you more energy and ensures the proper function of your immune system.


Aim to get 8 hours sleep per night, and try to follow a consistent schedule, so you are going to bed and waking up at the same time each night.

, People who have lots of friends and regularly interact with people are likely to be much happier and to live longer than those who don't. Therefore, when tackling depression, it's important that you make an effort to see your family and friends and generally be as sociable as possible.


If you find it difficult to meet new people, consider enrolling in a group, joining a class or volunteering for a charity organization.

, Hypericum is an herb which is believed to improve mood by boosting the production of hormones such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, which are responsible for feelings of happiness and pleasure.


Hypericum can be taken in one of two ways, you can drink it as a tea, or buy supplements which contain hypericum extract.
Hypericum produces no adverse side effects, and can be taken in combination with antidepressant medications. However, it is still a good idea to speak to your doctor before starting any new treatment.

Discuss bipolar symptoms.,
Explain the realities of your particular situation.,
Let your family know it's not their fault.,
Ask them for help.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Bipolar Depression2," When you tell your family about your bipolar depression, you need to explain exactly what bipolar depression is. Explain that bipolar depression is a mood disorder that causes extreme mood swings, from emotional highs, also known as mania, to depressive lows.


Tell them that these moods shift back and forth will little to no pattern.For example, tell your family ""There will be times when I am extremely happy or excited about things. There may also be days where I can't get out of bed or that I'll lash out at you because I can't deal with anyone else.""

, Each person's bipolar depression manifests in different ways. When you tell your family about your condition, you should explain what they can expect from your particular situation. This may be hard to explain, but you will likely understand at least the general outline of how your condition works since you have been diagnosed and are likely working with your doctor or therapist.


Let your family know if you tend more toward mania or depressive episodes and how you are likely to act during each.Also let them know this will change and may be unpredictable. Just let them know the basics of what to expect from your particular case.For example, say ""I tend to have longer bouts of depression where it is really hard for me to leave my house. If I don't call you back for days at a time, it is not because I don't care. I just can't.""

, When you tell your family about your bipolar depression, make it clear that it isn't their fault. Many family members may not understand the way you act during these episodes and may take it as a personal affront to them. They may also think that your behaviors were caused by something they said or did to you.


Do your best to explain that you may do or say things during these episodes that may upset them, but that it has nothing to do with them in most cases.Let your family know ""When I lash out at you or ignore you for days on end, it isn't because you did something to me. I am likely dealing with a depressive episode and I can't help the way I feel.""

, When you are going through a manic or depressive episode, you need someone you can call on to help you. Once your family knows about your bipolar disorder, they can help you in ways that they were not able to before they knew about your disorder.


You can designate family members you can call if you have a particularly hard depressive episode or someone who can deal with you if you are in a manic episode.
There are some people with bipolar disorder that may suffer from suicidal thoughts during depressive episodes. If you suffer from major depressive episodes, especially severe ones, make sure you have a family member that will look in on you and help talk you back from these thoughts. Have them check in on you and make sure you are in the right head space.Ask your family, ""If you don't hear from me after three phone calls or texts, could you come and check up on me? Maybe drop by my apartment and see if I'm alright?""

Do it some place private.,
Listen to what your family has to say.,
Let them know you are getting treatment.,
Provide them with resources.",How to Tell Your Family About Your Bipolar Depression3," Talking about mental illness is not an easy topic anywhere you do it. Given the personal nature of the topic, try to do it someplace private, like your home or at one of your family member's homes. This will give you all the privacy you need to deal with the tough discussion.


This will prevent you from getting interrupted while discussing it.

, Even though you are the one with bipolar disorder, it affects those around you as well. Listen to your family express any worries or concerns they have about your condition and how it affects them.


This may be hard to do since you are the one with bipolar depression disorder. However, make sure you keep your mind open and really hear their concerns., Explain to your family that the treatment for bipolar depression is long term. Even when you feel better, you will need to continue treatment. You should also explain each part of your treatment to your family so they truly understand what you are doing to help.This will likely be some combination of therapy, lifestyle changes, and medication.
For example, tell you family, ""I am working with a therapist to work through my issues, I am on medication to help level out my moods, and I am working on changing my though patterns and life choices to bring me a better, more stable life.""

, A good way to help your family understand is to give them places they can look for support. Tell them about support groups they can join, online education resources they can read, or offer to go to a family therapy session with them.


Organizations such as Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, National Institute of Mental Health, and the Mayo Clinic have a plethora of online resources your family can use to better understand your condition.
There are online support groups locators for the United State and other countries that your family can use to find a bipolar support group near you.

Consider the most likely things, such as a coworker annoying you, too much work, or not enough money.
Think about less-than-obvious stressors. Such stressors could include a souring relationship, poor health, or general dissatisfaction with your work life.;
, Talking to someone about your stress or anxiety might better help you identify what’s going on in your life. This is important, as whoever you talk to will be able to offer you a different perspective on your problems.


Ask a friend for advice. Say something like: ""I've been really stressed lately, would you mind hearing my concerns? I could really use some advice.""
Contact a mental health specialist. A psychologist or psychiatrist might be able to help you identify your stressors.
A possible outcome of your talking to someone might be that you’ll feel better or less stressed about whatever is bothering you. In other words, sometimes it helps just to talk to someone., After you’ve made a list, you need to narrow it down and identify your biggest stressor. This might be challenging, as some stress factors might be similar or might be intertwined with each other. Ultimately, though, in order to turn bad stress into good stress, you need to be sure of what is stressing you the most.


Think about which items on your list provide you with the most stress. Rank them accordingly.
Try identify small stresses that can easily be resolved. For example, if you have a laptop that constantly freezes up when you’re typing something up for work, this is a small issue that may be fixed with reboot, a reinstallation, or upgrading of equipment.
Figure out what stressors are created by no fault or no action of your own. These are the ones you’ll have to cope with the most, as stresses created by your own actions can often more easily be resolved., Whenever you feel stress or the anxiety associated with it, think of it as a warning of problems you need to solve or tasks you need to accomplish. By conceptualizing stress as a warning sign (rather than as something to panic about), you’ll be able to let your stress serve as a motivator.


When you feel anxiety, try to associate it with something you need to accomplish. For example, try to identify the source of work-related stress. You might be really worried about a new project you're about to start on. Your stress is just a sign that your subconscious is preoccupied with this new problem.
After you’ve identified the problem you need to resolve, tell yourself that your stressed feeling is simply a reminder.
Try to calmly solve the problem. After you've connected your work-related stress to a new project, start work on that project., After you’ve identified your stressors, you should begin to set goals based on them. By setting goals, you’ll both help calm yourself and you’ll motivate yourself. Consider:


Making a list of tasks you need to complete. For example, write down daily tasks you need to accomplish like submitting invoices, meeting with coworkers, or finishing a project.
Set time-based goals to resolve your stress factors. Give yourself a realistic amount of time to accomplish a given goal. If it usually takes you 30 minutes to complete a task, give yourself 30 minutes, not 20.
If you can’t resolve a stress factor, set a goal for an amount of time in which you want to be able to cope with the stressor., One great way to turn negative stress into positive stress is to see things that stress you as challenges to overcome. By seeing them as challenges – or even opportunities – you’ll not only calm yourself, but also motivate yourself.


Whenever something happens that stresses you out, get to work to resolve the problem.
See stress as an opportunity to improve something in your life. For instance, if you get stressed because you failed to qualify in a tournament of some sort, see it as an opportunity to improve your abilities so you can qualify next time., While stress might bog you down, throw you off, or otherwise fluster you, you can use it as an opportunity to practice mental discipline. To do this, use stress as an opportunity to focus your mind. When you’re stressed:


Breathe deeply. Focus on your breathing, on inhaling and exhaling.
Tell yourself that everything is going to be okay. Keep calm and remind yourself that you’ll be fine.
Live in the moment, not in the future. By focusing on the moment and overcoming challenges and solving problems in the here-and-now, you’ll help develop your mental discipline., A way of turning stress around is to see it as an opportunity to self-reflect and to grow. By reflecting upon yourself, your existence, and your goals in life, you’ll put yourself on a path to personal growth.


Think about where you want to go in life and what you want to achieve. Remind yourself that what you’re going through is part of achieving personal growth and your long-term goals.
If you’re experiencing a one-time stressor, like the death of a loved one, remind yourself that such incidents are part of life and will equip you with emotional tools and experience for the future.
If you're stressed out about work, ask yourself why. It is that you're overworked? Is it because you're not fulfilled in your job? You may need to consider drastic action like finding a new job., After self-reflecting, you’ll have learned a lot about yourself and what stresses you out. Use this information to restructure your life and your routine. By improving your routine, you’ll likely reduce stress factors in your future. You’ll also become more efficient and effective in your daily tasks.


If you notice that you get stressed out every day because of certain encounters with individuals at work, take steps to improve those encounters. Either engage in discussions with the people who stress you (so that they won’t stress you anymore), or avoid those people altogether.
If you get stressed out at work because your organization system is inefficient, take steps to improve your organization system.
If you get stressed out because of the traffic on your way to work, find a new way to work., Short term stress can be a good thing. When you’re stressed, your body releases certain chemicals, your heart rate jumps, and your brain becomes more alert. This is a healthy response that helps you solve problems.


Short-term stress can energize you and wake you up. This is especially helpful when you’re stressed, overworked, and exhausted.
Stress becomes unhealthy when you are stressed for long periods of time."

Understand that yelling is not eternal.,
Do not speak, cry or whimper during the session of yelling.,
Breathe.,
Let yourself disengage a little.,
Do a good deed for your parents.,
Keep listening.,
Think before responding .This includes stopping yourself from yelling back, throwing things, or slamming doors.,
Leave the room politely if yelling seems excessive.,
Do not apologize if you were not wrong.,
Respond.,
Accept your parents' feelings.,
Seek a compromise.,
Discuss your feelings.,
Get help if yelling becomes dangerous.",How to Stay Calm when Your Parents Yell at You," It may seem like your parents are yelling for two or three hours, but if you look at the clock, you will see that very few parents have the stamina to do so. If you respond correctly to the yelling, you will see that the yelling is not prolonged.


This will help encourage you--to let yourself know that you're strong enough to endure the yelling stint.;
, Remain silent. If you speak, even if your words and voice are polite, your parents will, being angry, most likely take it as backtalk, rudeness, or lack of filial piety.

, Try to pay attention to how your body feels while you're being yelled at. Chances are you are feeling tense and tightly wound. If this is the case, taking deep, measured breaths will help you remain calmer and looser.


Breathe in for at least four beats and out for as long as you can. Make sure that the air you take in travels all the way down to your belly and makes your abdomen expand., Sometimes detaching from harsh treatment is a good way to make sure that you don’t take the yelling too personally.It's important not to take yelling personally because when parents are dealing with problems in other parts of life, they can end up angered by relatively minor things. This is not your fault.


The best way to disengage while listening is to focus on your parents' faces. Notice the details of their features and the strain from yelling.
Rather than trying to make sense of what your parent is saying, look at the desperation and frustration you see them experiencing.
This way you will remember that even though you're the one being yelled at, your parents are going through a rough moment, too. Again, this may even be due to stress that you did not directly cause.

, For example, get them a glass of water while they are yelling and say, ""I hope your voice hasn't been harmed in any way"" without being sarcastic, mean or impolite. This will, especially if you were not wrong, bring them to be remorseful and feel that they have done wrong by yelling.

, Make sure you don't have your head in the clouds completely--otherwise you won't know why your parent is upset. If the yelling subsides for long enough to step in, try paraphrasing or re-stating what your parents said to show that you are listening. An added perk is that your parents will have the chance to hear what they are yelling reflected back to them.


Send signals to your parent that you are hearing them, like nodding your head, raising your eyebrows, saying ""I see what you mean by that"".
Try to pick up on key words that will clue you in to where your parents' disappointment is coming from. If they're yelling about a particular instance, try to pick up on details that they seem to dwell on. If it's a long stream of moments, try to pick out the theme the runs through them.

, Be aware that strong reactions on your part will simply escalate the tension and cause the yelling to continue and perhaps even grow in intensity. Your parent is angry for one reason or another, even if he/she is wrong in doing so, and the yelling is a sign of frustration and a desire to be heard by you. Respond with aggression will make them feel misunderstood, so more yelling will be likely in the future.


Sometimes parents even take subtle signs of dissent as aggression (rolling your eyes, sarcasm, slightly mocking faces).So, these should also be reconsidered.
Think about the reactions that you know from past experience that your parents can't stand. Even if you're tempted to get back at them for making you feel uncomfortable and inferior, do not engage in behavior you know triggers more anger in them.

, If the yelling continues to the point where you absolutely cannot respond calmly, resort to leaving the room.Ask if you can talk about the problem later, and briefly explain that the yelling is making it difficult to think clearly about the issue. Try not to sound accusatory by saying things like ""your yelling is so annoying that it's driving me crazy.""


Instead, say something like ""I want to clear up this problem, but I'm too flustered to be able to have a good discussion. I'd like to go to my room to think.""
Leaving the room can be difficult, as some parents may interpret it as a sign of disrespect. Do your best to make it clear that you still want to discuss the matter.
Avoid suggesting that your parents need to calm down as well. This can come off as rude.

, Stand your ground. If you apologize when you are not wrong, you would be giving yourself an injustice. If you know that you are not wrong but still feel remorseful for infuriating your parent, it is, in most situations, acceptable to say, ""Mom/Dad, I am sorry you were angry and hope that you will feel better very soon.""


It can help to make a plan to release any lingering aggression by doing something active once you are able. For example, you could clean your room or go for a jog in the neighborhood.

, Keep your responses simple, polite and in a measured tone of voice. Don't allow any sarcasm or anger come out in how you sound because your parents might think that you are being resistant or passive aggressive.Also, avoid trying to give your opinion or account of what happened during the yelling. You can always do that when you are all calm.


Instead, try using a simple affirmative statement, like ""I understand"" or ""I see"".
It's okay if you don't agree with or completely understand what your parents are saying. These are things to talk about once everyone is calm enough to be able to express themselves kindly.

, Be sure to let your parents know that you can see that they're upset about whatever you did. Even if you do not feel at fault for whatever it is, do not fight about the fact that your parents are upset. Whatever the facts are, acknowledging your parents' feelings does not mean conceding that they are right or wrong.Apologize if you were wrong. Be sincere. If you were wrong, expressing repentance for what you did is a good thing to do.

, Ask your parent what you can do to improve the situation. However, remember to stand your ground if you were right!It's possible that you can enact a quick fix to make sure that your parents don't stay in sour moods that might make them more likely to yell about other things.


The more you can resolve about the incident, the better. If you still have thoughts to express beyond what you think your parent will understand, write it down! It is important to clear lingering anger so that you don't snap unexpectedly at the parent later on.

, Once you and your parents have cooled off a little, try bringing your side of the story to light. In a clear and respectful tone, tell your parents why you did what you did. The better you can explain your thoughts and feelings at the time(s) of the incident(s), the more inclined your parents will be to understand and forgive promptly.


Make sure that you are not trying to convince your parents that you are right--this will just add fuel to the fire. Especially if your actions were not justified, show the difference between your understanding of the issue then versus now.
You also might take this opportunity to let your parents know that being yelled at is hard for you. Explain how being yelled at makes you feel and the fact that it cuts off other ways of communicating. Then, if you were severely hurt by the yelling, firmly yet politely request a sincere apology from your parents.

, Does it seem like your parent cannot cool down? Does he have a history of anger problems or domestic violence? If you sense that the yelling will escalate into physical abuse, do not hesitate to contact emergency services. If danger is immediate, you can call 911.The Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is active 24/7 and staffs professional crisis counselors who have access to a database of support resources and emergency services. The telephone number is 1.800.4.A.CHILD (1.800.422.4453)."
"
Be aware that cats can get stressed out very easily.,
Understand that cats respond to what is happening around them.,
Consider any changes that have been made to your cat’s routine.,
Keep less than five cats in your house.,
Provide your cat(s) with plenty of resources.,
Choose appropriate locations for your cat’s food and water.,
Keep your cat’s litter box away from things that could cause her stress.,
Give your cat her own space.,
Use scent as a way to prepare your cat for the arrival of a new cat.,
Give your cat places to hide.",How to Stop Stress Induced over Grooming in Cats1," Cats are creatures of habit and anything that interferes with their daily routine, or makes them feel vulnerable, is classed as stress.


These stressors can be simple things like if you spend the day away from your house, the arrival of a new baby, or a neighborhood cat lurking around your cat’s territory.;
, Cats are also very sensitive to atmosphere so if there is disquiet, shouting, or arguments happening around your cat, she may become very stressed out and begin to overgroom.

, Minimize your cat’s stress whenever possible. If you are not sure what is causing your cat stress, consider anything that has changed recently.


Have you gotten a new kitten? Did you and your partner just have a baby?

, To a certain extent this step depends on the size of the house. For example, a one-bedroomed flat should not have more than two cats in it, but a mansion could certainly house five cats. Statistically a house with five or more cats in it will have at least one cat that exhibits signs of stress, such as inappropriate urination or excessive grooming.When you have multiple cats living in the same house, stress can be created over a pressure for resources like food and water, even if there is plenty of those resources to go around. Cats naturally get territorial, and their individual feline personalities can clash if they have to deal with too many other cats.

, To a cat, resources are those things which she needs for a comfortable life. These resources include access to food, water, toilet facilities, and a safe place to sleep. As a general rule, provide one of each for every cat in your house, plus one extra.


Giving each cat their own resources will help to relieve tension created when cats have to share a space with one another.

, Think about where you put your cat’s resources. For instance, in a multi-cat household, place the food bowls in different rooms. This way the top-cat will not bogart all of the food bowls, which makes it easier for all of the other cats to eat without pressure or stress.

, If you place your cat’s litter tray next to something like a washing machine or dryer, your cat may become stressed out whenever she needs to use the litter box while the machine is on. Your cat will then begin to associate going to the bathroom with fear, which puts her into a state of conflict each time she needs to urinate or defecate.


To combat this fear, place litter trays in quiet corners where your cat is not likely to be disturbed.

, As mentioned above, cats can feel stressed if they feel like another cat is invading their territory. When another cat, particularly an unfamiliar one, wanders into your cat’s space, your cat may begin to feel insecure and stressed.


To prevent territory invasion use a programmable cat flap that is triggered by your cat's microchip to stop strays from gaining access to your cat's territory.

, Another invasion of territory is the arrival of a new cat or kitten into your home. To avoid this stress, introduce the new cat gradually using scent as a first introduction. Keep the kitten in a separate room where he cannot accidentally bump into the established cat, and give him his own food, water, toys, and tray. Stroke the kitten, then transfer his smell to the established cat by stroking her. By doing this, your cat will gradually get used to the idea of a new cat being around.


The first time the cat meets the kitten, have the kitten in a cat box so that the cat can choose to investigate without getting chased or pounced on by the kitten. Again, this is all about getting the cat used to the idea and learning that the kitten is no threat to her resources.

, Even a solo cat who has plenty of resources may begin to feel stressed if she feels like she has nowhere to hide. Cats that are constantly ""on display"", meaning they have nowhere to escape to for solitude, are generally stressed.


Provide your cat with cardboard boxes, a gap behind the sofa, or a climbing tree with hidey holes to make your cat feel like she has somewhere to slink off to.

Use Feliway to calm your cat.,
Give your cat Zylkene.,
Try herbal remedies.,
Take your cat to get prescription medication if the above methods do not work.,
Get a prescription for Clomipramine (Clomicalm).",How to Stop Stress Induced over Grooming in Cats2," A mother cat gives off pheromones (or chemical messengers) that make her kittens feel safe. Feliway is a synthetic version of the feline pheromone that makes kittens feel safe and secure. It is available as a room diffuser, or as a spray for pet bedding. This scent will slowly reassure your cat, and make her feel like your home is a safe place. This is especially helpful if you have moved to a new home and your cat is having a hard time adjusting.


Feliway is not a quick fix; in fact, it may take two weeks to see any sign that your cat is feeling less stressed.

, Zylkene is a nutraceutical that acts on the same region of the brain as diazepam. A nutraceutical is a food supplement that has a pharmaceutical-like activity, but is not a drug. Scientists have identified a milk protein that stimulates the same part of the brain that diazepam acts on in order to calm a cat; Zylkene is made up of this milk protein.


With Zylkene, you may see a change in your cat within seven days. Generally, Zylkene will be given to the cat over the course of four to six weeks to ensure that the over-grooming habit is broken.

, Skullcap and Valerian is an herbal remedy that is anecdotally reported to reduce stress and anxiety in cats and dogs. The mode of action is unproven and unknown however, so talk to your vet before giving your cat this herbal remedy.

, If the above measures have been tried and the cat remains stressed and continues to over-groom, then prescription medications may be necessary. Of these, clomipramine is the only licensed product available for use in cats (it is described in the following step).

, Clomipramine is a drug used for the treatment of cat’s with obsessive-compulsive behaviors, such as over-grooming. It belongs to a family of drugs called tricyclic antidepressants and the exact mode of action is not completely understood. It is believed that it primarily acts by preventing the reuptake of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin.The dose of clomipramine is 0.5 mg/kg once daily by mouth. It is available in veterinary formulation as clomicalm and comes in 5 mg tablets. A 5 kg cat requires half a tablet once a day.

Watch what you say around your child.,
Be aware of your own demeanor.,
Provide yourself with cool-off time.,
Use relaxation exercises to work through your stress.,
Create a schedule.,
Avoid overcommitting yourself.,
See a mental health professional.,
Explain your stress to your child.,
Apologize if you are short with your child.,
Teach your children stress management.",How to Stop Your Stress from Harming Your Child," Children are constantly learning from their parents. Thus, you need to be very cognizant of everything you say when you’re around your child. Pay attention to the volume of your voice and your tone as well. Even if your child is too young to understand what you mean, they can still understand when you are angry by the volume and tone of your voice. If you let stress or anxiety get the better of you, your child will learn bad habits and non-constructive ways of responding to stress.


Avoid having arguments or tense-filled work conversations in front of your child. If you think you’re going to have a stressful work phone call, excuse yourself from the room and then take your call. Don’t ask your child to leave the room – they might think you’re mad at them or punishing them.
Always speak to people in a positive and respectful way. Avoid being rude to people or cursing under your breath, your child will see that and may learn to repeat your behavior.;
, Even though you might be stressed, you should try to avoid showing it to children. Children are very sensitive and might think that they’re the reason you are stressed or unhappy.


When around your child, refocus your thoughts and actions on your child.
Try to smile and act positively when interacting with your child.
Always be conscious of how you carry yourself and react to people when you are stressed. Ultimately, children will sense your negative energy and internalize it.This can result in them being less likely to come to you when they need help or more likely to lie or withhold things to avoid upsetting you.

, By giving yourself time to cool off, you'll make sure that your stress and negative energy dissipate somewhat before you interact with your child.


If you’re headed home or to pick up your child, provide yourself with a couple of minutes just to relax and think. In the end, it’s better to be a few minutes late than to have negative interactions with your child.
If work stresses you out, build cool-off time into your schedule. For instance, choose a longer but more relaxing route home from work so you have time to relax.
If you’re stressed out and are running errands with your child, take a few minutes to do something fun together. For instance, stop at a park and spend time at a playground, get some ice cream, or sing some fun songs in the car together., There are a variety of relaxation exercises you can do to lower your stress level. By lowering your stress level, you’ll be happier, healthier, and your child will be better insulated from your stress. Use relaxation exercises not only when you feel stressed, but daily for best results and to help ward off anxiety before it starts. Consider:


Practicing yoga.
Exercising regularly.
Breathing deeply and counting to ten when you are stressed out., By putting together a schedule, you'll be able to balance your life and lower your stress level. As a result, you'll be able to better prevent your stress from harming your child.


Divide your day up and plan all your activities, if possible.
Use a day planner to organize your schedule. You can also use electronic weekly/monthly calendars. These can be accessed by all family members and relieve you of the responsibility of informing and reminding everyone.
Build time into your schedule for your child.
Set aside fun time. Make sure you have time for enjoyable activities like games, family time, watching movies, and doing things like laughing and having a good time., One of the easiest ways to avoid stress is to avoid overcommitting yourself. Start by under-committing yourself and slowly build from there if you feel you have extra time. By taking on too many responsibilities, you'll stress yourself out. As a result, this stress will likely influence the way you treat your child.


Don’t overcommit yourself to social activities. Depending on your schedule, you may not want to commit to more than one social activity per week.
Think twice before taking leadership roles in too many of your children's activities.
Reserve time for your children., If you are plagued by stress that negatively impacts your family, you may wish to set an appointment with a mental health professional. A professional will talk to you, evaluate your stresses and anxieties, and help you work through your concerns. Mental health professionals include psychologists, psychiatrists, or counselors.


A psychiatrist might prescribe you medication to deal with your stress and anxiety.
A mental health professional will likely ask you to talk about your problems and stressors.
You can also locate a support group where you'll be able to talk about your stresses with others who understand., Spend some time talking to your child about why you are stressed. This will put your words and mood into perspective for them and help them to cope with your stress. However, be careful not to use your child as your therapist. Only discuss your stress with them if you feel it may be obvious to your child, and then ensure that the focus of the conversation is on reassuring them. Let them walk away feeling confident that you have it under control and are taking steps to address it, such as by taking good care of yourself.


Let them know that you’re not mad with them, but with other things. Explain you had demands at work or in other aspects of your life, and that these things are causing you to feel anxiety.
Explain some of the responsibilities you have and that sometimes they seem unmanageable to you. Put this in terms they understand. For instance, say “You know how you feel when you need to clean your room but there seems to be so much to do? That’s how I feel sometimes, too.”Your explanation and discussion will depend on your child’s age. While for an 8-year-old you may relate your stress to cleaning their room, you’ll have to use other examples like school and homework for a 16-year-old.

, Whenever your stress results in you being mean to or snapping at your child, you should apologize. By apologizing, you’ll let them know that it’s not their fault and is simply a result of your stress.


Whenever you are mean or short with your child, you should apologize as soon as you can. For instance, say “I’m sorry I was mean to you. It’s not your fault and I need to manage my stress better.”
Always wait until you’ve had time to calm down before apologizing.
By apologizing, and doing so sincerely, you’ll teach your child a good habit., Like you, your child needs to manage their own stress. The best way to do this is to instruct them and lead them by example.


Explain that stress is never a legitimate reason to be rude or mean to anyone.
Talk to your child about tactics you use for dealing with stress. For instance, teach them to breathe and think before they react to something.
Teach your child to provide themselves with cool-off time before or after stressful activities."

Set a time limit on worry.,
Delay your worrying.,
Make a list of your worries.,
Find a way to relax.,
Learn to accept uncertainty.,
Gather the evidence.,
Consider probability.,
Determine how helpful this worry is.,
Consider whether the issue will matter in the long-term.,
Find a more positive way of thinking of the situation.,
Consider any possible solutions.,
Spend less time with people who cause you stress.,
Confide in those you trust.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Stop Worrying About Things You Cannot Control," When you begin to worry about something, rather than simply trying to put it away from your mind, set a time limit on how long you will think about it. Actively trying to forget something often makes you think of that thing even more intensely, so don’t try to ignore your feelings. Allow yourself five or ten minutes to think, and then move on to more productive tasks., Another way to place a limit or parameter on your worrying is to find ways to delay it. Perhaps you are in the middle of a very important project but then you start worrying about your children or husband. Commit to finishing at least a portion more of the work that you have to do before you check in or give in to fear.Perhaps you have a presentation to create by tomorrow. Commit to at least creating an outline and some introductory slides before you check in with your family.

, When you are on the job or at school, you will need to be as focused as possible so that you can complete the task at hand. You might have some legitimate worries that you will need to attend to later, but if it can wait, consider making a list instead. Once you are finished with all of your work for the day, you can take a look at this list and address anything that is necessary.You might find that your worries have subsided by the end of the day and you may not even need to check this list.

, Though some of your worries may be solvable, the bulk of them may not be. When you are feeling particularly stressed about things you cannot control, focus on doing things that you can control. Exercise and yoga are both great opportunities to destress and improve your health. You will often feel less worried after completing these life enriching activities., Work to incorporate more opportunities for spontaneity into your life. If your friends ask to go out tonight, go with them rather than saying you need more time to prepare. Try to be okay with plans or experiences that happen on the fly.Try a new hobby or food. Pick out one fear that you have and then try to conquer it. For instance, perhaps you are afraid of heights. Try going to an indoor skydiving area.

, When a worry comes to your mind, consider what evidence you have that would lead you to believe that this worry is real. This will help you assess whether or not your worry is even worth spending time thinking about.For instance, if you call your husband and he doesn’t answer the phone, you might worry that he is cheating. Consider factors like his character, past history with cheating, where he is supposed to be at the moment, and any other information that could negate this notion.

, After gathering evidence, consider the likelihood of this action occurring. Often times, the fears that you have may be a bit far fetched or unrealistic. Think about how often this has happened in the past, especially to you.Perhaps your children are currently on a plane to go visit your parents. You might be concerned about a plane crash. However, statistically speaking, planes are highly unlikely to crash and are one of the safest forms of travel.

, Take some time to consider what worries you are having and then deem them either as constructive or an unconstructive. This will allow you to know whether or not you should problem solve or let it go.For instance, you might be nervous about a presentation you have coming up. This is good stress because you can use this as an incentive to prepare more.
However, you might be worried that you will be a victim of a terrorist attack. Though this concern is real, there is little that you can do in the realm of preventing it. Worrying about it only adds bad stress and fear to your life.

, When you are worrying about a particular issue, take a moment to think about whether or not you will care about this issue in a week, month or year. If you will not, try your best to let it go. If it is something that will persist, try to find a way to solve or move past your worry., Rather than catastrophizing ordinary situations, consider all the of the alternatives to your worry. Perhaps your significant other did not answer your phone call and you have not heard from them in an hour or two. Rather than assuming that they have been hurt, consider whether they might be working, napping, or busy at the moment.Call back in a few hours to check in if you are still worried.

, After you have taken some time to deescalate the worry in your mind, determine if your worry is at all solvable. You cannot control every situation, but you can control some things, including yourself.For instance, you might be worried that you will be fired soon. Though you cannot prevent this, you can ensure that you are a good employee, that you arrive to work on time, and that you complete all of your assignments with diligence and thoroughness.
An example of something you cannot necessarily control is your children’s driving habits. Though you can tell them not to speed, you cannot be with them at all times. Trust them and continue to impart lessons of wisdom to them.
Prepare for your worries as much as possible.

, Your stress and worry about things you cannot control might be triggered by other people. Maybe you have a friend who is a worrywart about her children and she has pushed some of her negative thinking off on you. Though you can still be friends with people like this, try to spend less alone time with them.If you normally go to lunch once a week, cut it back to once every two weeks.

, Another way to combat your worry is talk to people who you trust and who you know have your best interests at heart. Talk about your worries to others and try not to keep this stress locked inside you. Other people can often serve as the voice of reason when you have worries that are unsubstantiated or uncontrollable., Rather than spending so much time in your head, fretting over the future or worrying about what could happen, take some time each day to be present in the moment. When you feel yourself becoming worried, take some time to reflect on how you’re feeling. Notice your surroundings and how you feel in your body. Actively engage in conversations with others rather than drifting away. Focus on living in the now.You might also try sitting quietly and breathing in and out slowly. You might also want to reflect on a single word or idea like “peace.”

Fight the cold.,
Pamper yourself.,
Plan things in advance.,
Get some sunshine or at the least, light.,
Treat yourself.,
Exercise.",How to Relieve Winter Stress," It is a proven fact that if you're cold, you get irritated and stressed more easily. Wrap up warm when you go out; wear lots of layers, get a warm scarf and a hat. Thick socks and warm boots are a definite must.;
, Whenever you're stressed, take a long, hot bath to warm you all the way through. Use scented bubble bath if you like. And remember: just because it's winter and you need to wrap up, it doesn't mean you can't look nice! Invest in a stylish winter coat to keep the cold at bay and make you look nice.

, When December starts rolling in, you need to get cracking to avoid Christmas stress. Even if you don't like to start shopping until a couple of weeks before Christmas, make a list of who you need to send presents to and what you might get them. If you're going away, make sure your flights/travel arrangements and accommodation are all booked in advance.

, Being in the sunshine stimulates the release of a hormone in your body that relieves stress, and no amount of unnatural light can create this. In winter, it is especially hard as the sunlight hours are limited. But try to get out in the sun at least once a day, even if only for a few minutes.

, Give yourself one thing that will relax you, so that when you're stressed you can leave the room and do that thing. Maybe it's eating chocolate, or taking 5 minutes to yourself. It will train your brain to relax whenever you do that thing.

, It gets your heart pumping and keeps you fit. In winter it can be hard to motivate yourself to get to the gym or go outside, but even a 10 minute walk every day is something to get you started. If exercise isn't your thing, try yoga or pilates.

Get plenty of exercise.,
Develop a regular sleep routine.,
Meditate regularly.,
Spend time outdoors.,
Write in a journal every day.",How to Stop Stress Before It Strikes1," Physical activity helps reduce stress in the moment and prevent it in the long-term. Do your best to get at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. Try going to the gym, riding your bike, jogging around the neighborhood, taking a martial arts class, or doing yoga.Be sure to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise routine, especially if you have any issues like an existing heart condition or joint problem.
Keep in mind that your exercise routine does not have to be strenuous or extreme. It is more important to exercise regularly.;
, Stress interrupts sleep and a lack of sleep causes stress. Break that vicious cycle and avoid further stress by getting your sleeping habits in check. It can be difficult to get enough sleep when you’re stressed, but there are steps you can take to ensure a full night’s sleep.Try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day.
Swap your mobile device for a good book when you’re relaxing before bed.
Avoid eating a big meal before going to bed.
Try to reduce your exposure to bright lights an hour or two before bedtime.
Go outside once per day to help with your circadian clock.
Develop a bedtime routine to start training your brain when to get sleepy.

, Like exercise, meditation can alleviate stress in the moment and in the long run. Try to set aside about 20 minutes a day for meditation, quiet reflection, or mindful prayer.If you struggle with anxiety, then meditating in the morning may help to set the tone for a calm day. If you struggle with insomnia, then meditating before bed may help you to sleep.


Listen to calming music if it helps put you in a meditative state.
Try to meditate in a place that’s free of noise or other external distractions.
Wear comfortable clothing if possible.
Consider using a meditation app or looking up guided meditations on Youtube.

, Natural environments can put us at ease, encourage mindfulness, and reduce stress. Find a nearby beach, park, or hiking trail and take regular strolls. Spend time reading or just hanging out in your backyard., Journaling prevents and manages stress by helping you process and release emotions. Take about 20 minutes per day to write about your day, including things that might have been stressful. Take some time every few weeks to regularly read back your entries."

Stick to your routine.,
Give yourself time to plan ahead.,
Manage and fulfill your responsibilities.,
Take a break from your stressor.,
Practice positive thinking and self-talk.",How to Stop Stress Before It Strikes2," Once you’ve created a positive lifestyle routine, stick to it to avoid unforeseen stressors. Regularity and consistency are also natural stress preventatives themselves.However, if you get out of your routine, don’t panic. Just return to your routine the following day.


Studies show staying busy by keeping up with a daily routine encourages happiness, promotes resiliency, and helps keep emotions in check., Putting things off until the last minute is a common cause of unnecessary stress. Prioritize all of your tasks, from homework to planning a party, and give yourself enough time to complete them.Try to give yourself more time than you think you will need to avoid any surprises.


Consider using a calendar or daily planner. Use paper versions if that’s what you’re comfortable with, or go for apps if you prefer to use your mobile device.
Take time at the start of the week to plan it out. Write down appointments, meetings, and the week’s assignments or projects. If you know you have an event or plans with a friend, give yourself enough time to get ready and arrive punctually.

, In addition to planning ahead, make sure you actually follow through on your obligations. Saying you’ll do something and not doing it increases stress and decreases self esteem.Break down projects into smaller, more easily doable steps. For example, write, “Monday - start outline for report due Friday. Tuesday - complete report’s introduction and evidence sections. Wednesday - complete first draft. Thursday - make revisions and clean up a final copy.”
You can also find an accountability partner or set up little rewards for yourself to increase your chances of following through.

, Try to find a balance between procrastination and obsessing over your stressor. It’s not good to put off your responsibilities, but you need to take a break from them in order avoid getting stressed out or overwhelmed.Give yourself permission to step away from a potential stressor, even for a matter of minutes, before it causes stress. Go for a breather outside, meditate, take a bath, or some other activity that will help you keep calm, then go back to the task at hand.

, Do your best to be gentle, encouraging, and balanced when you think or talk to yourself. It can be tempting to focus on negatives or view a problem like it’s a catastrophe. However, you should avoid negative or polarized thinking and try to focus on positive, productive solutions instead.For example, instead of getting frustrated and telling yourself, “I don’t know how to do this,” say, “This gives me the opportunity to learn something new.”
If you are having trouble putting things into perspective, you can also try calling a trusted friend to help put you into a positive mindset.
If something seems like it’s the end of the world or too much to deal with, try to break it up into smaller steps. For example, if you’re stressed out about losing weight, don’t think about the total weight you want to lose. Think about healthy meals you can prepare today and what you can do tomorrow, and break your goals up into smaller, realistic goals.

Surround yourself with positive people.,
Talk to a friend or family member.,
Set aside time to volunteer.,
Find a counselor or support group.",How to Stop Stress Before It Strikes3," Sometimes specific people cause stress, whether it’s because of the nature of your relationship with them or because of their personality traits. Try to limit the time you spend with negative people, whether they’re friends who always focus on negatives or family members who constantly criticize you.Try to surround yourself with people with optimistic outlooks who support you and your goals. If they offer you advice or criticism, it should be constructive, productive, and meant to help you instead of simply insult or overwhelm you.
This can include spending more time with friends or finding new friends by joining a church or club.

, A regular chat with a trusted friend or family member can go a long way toward stress management and prevention. Find someone you can have a weekly vent session with to help order your thoughts before they become major stressors.Be sure to return the favor by letting them get things off their chest, too.

, Volunteering helps reduce stress and anxiety, and even lowers blood pressure. It can improve self-esteem, and can help prevent and manage depression in addition to relieving stress.Try to find a cause that you find especially meaningful. For example, if you love animals, call your local shelter to find out how can you donate your time. Evidence suggests that the more genuine your interests are, the more health benefits you’ll see.

, Talking to a counselor or going to a support group isn’t only beneficial when you’re actually experiencing stress or anxiety. Seeing a mental health professional can help you develop stress prevention techniques and vent about stressors before they become overwhelming.


A great listener is one of the best stress preventatives, and a mental health professional can be a solution if your friends or family aren’t the best options."

It can seem like a pain to take the time and trouble to get rid of it, but you'll be glad you did once the task is finished.


Get rid of everything you haven't used in a year or more, unless it was either terribly expensive or a family heirloom. Have a garage sale, use eBay, or simply donate your extra dishes, clothes, toys, books, movies, games, and other items to a charity.

Expensive and/or heirloom items you haven't used in a long time should be gently boxed up and stored in an attic, a basement, a garage, or even a rarely-used bedroom closet.


;
, One of the most common prescriptions psychologists give for curing insomnia is to set aside the bedroom for sex and sleeping only. By creating a dedicated, assigned space for specific activities, you convince your brain to engage in those activities whenever you enter that space. Take this method to heart as much as your space allows:


Remove TVs, desks, computers, and other such distractions from the bedroom. Store clothes and books there instead. Only spend time in the bedroom when you're changing clothes, grabbing a book, going to sleep, or getting it on. Don't read in bed.
Clean the clutter off of your dining room/breakfast nook table. If you don't have a dining room or a breakfast nook, but you do have a table, clean it up. Only use the table for eating and paperwork (bills, studying, writing, and so on). Make a commitment to washing your dishes after every meal.
Maintain your kitchen. It's rare that you'll ever make so many dishes in a single day that you can't get them all washed within 30 minutes in the evening. Clean up every day so you can continue to use the kitchen for cooking and not have to worry about the mess.
Put time-consuming activities in an office or the living room. Keep computers, TVs, video game consoles, and other such activity items in general areas. Train your brain to associate these areas with leisure activities and hobbies. You'll be able to get things done in the other, utilitarian areas of the house with much greater efficiency.

, It's a drastic step for some people, but TV's scheduled programming can disrupt an otherwise-adequate daily schedule. Most people find that they don't miss TV service as much as they thought they would after a few days without it. Invest in a paid video streaming service instead, so that you can watch TV shows when it's convenient for you.


DVR sets that record shows for you to watch later are also a viable option if you can't stand the thought of waiting 8 months to see the new season of your favorite show, but be sure to resist the temptation to turn on the TV just because it's there. Once you start watching, you typically spend more time than you'd intended to, which cramps the rest of your day and makes you feel rushed.
Reduced Internet usage is also a good idea if you can manage it, but since most people also use the Internet for practical daily business, this can be much more difficult. Start with TV and see how that works out first.

, One of the simplest and most effective steps you can take to reduce worry caused by your complex life is to budget your expenses. There's nothing mysterious or difficult about it:


Track your expenditures for a week or two. Don't worry about controlling it yet; just spend as you normally do. You can keep track on your phone or with a pad of paper.
Divide up your expenditures according to general type of purchase. For example, many typical budgets have categories for gas, food, entertainment, and impulse buys. Take each category and multiply it so you have a monthly spending estimate.
Add another category for bill payments, and yet another for savings (if you're saving money). That's your budget. Try your best to stick to it in order to avoid having to worry about how much money you can afford to spend in one place or another.
Your budget will also be useful in helping you make changes to save more money or purchase less in a given category. Just lower the amount in one category, and raise it in whichever other one you like. Stick to that budget to effect the change.
Budget flexibly. Different days call for different approaches. Maybe you eat take-out every Monday night, or have a standing date with friends on Saturday afternoon. Be cognizant of that fact and mentally double-check your basic plan every morning. Add time to take care of whatever you need to take care of that day, with a little flex room on either side.


, You can set a budget for your time just as you can set a budget for your money. Since you're trying to reduce worry rather than increase it, go into this process with a focus on maximizing your personal time, rather than cramming as much as you can into each day.


Set a sleep schedule. Stick to it, even on weekends. Give yourself a one-hour target window for bedtime in the evening, and set a strict time to get up in the morning. Be sure that the space between your bedtime and the start of your day gives you roughly an hour more than the amount of sleep you actually need, so you won't lay down and start worrying about whether or not you'll fall asleep on time.
Take care of tasks at the same time every day. Plan time for daily hygiene, commuting, work, shopping, eating, and chores. Add in time for anything else you do most days, such as homework, exercise, or an active hobby. Put them in a specific order that works for you. All the time left over is your free time, to use for relaxation or whatever else you want.
To maximize your free time, try to combine trips outside the home. For example, you might plan to go shopping on your way home from work, to save the extra trip.
For many people, an irregular work schedule makes this kind of budgeting difficult, but you can still plan to work around your schedule in the same order every day, and just shuffle the times.

, It's easy to fill every waking moment of your free time with smartphone apps, social media browsing, TV, books, hobbies, and more, but it isn't always a good idea. Sometimes what you need isn't a distraction, it's a moment to yourself. There isn't a lot of free time in the day, for most people, but it isn't hard to find a couple of five-minute windows where you can drop everything and be alone with your thoughts.


Use your empty time to think about whatever you want, or just lay back and look at the patterns on your ceiling or the leaves on a tree near your window. Don't fill it with anything that requires your attention to be enjoyed, such as a book or a smartphone.

, Even the most overworked adult can find half an hour once a week to set aside for quiet meditation and reflection. Meditation is a powerful technique for organizing your thoughts and feelings, and all it requires is a quiet spot without many distractions. Sit comfortably and focus on your breathing until the rest of your thoughts become quiet. That way, you can go over them without feeling overwhelmed by them.


This is also a great time to set weekly goals or remind yourself of tasks that need to be completed soon, such as shopping trips and yard work. Feel free to keep a pad of paper and a pen or pencil close at hand when you meditate, so you can list and organize everything that comes up. You can use your notes to help guide the week ahead, reducing chaos.

, Often, people worry about things they have limited control over, such as whether or not they got a new job (after an interview) or what a new acquaintance really thought of them. These worries are hard to help completely, even though it's obvious that worrying won't change their outcomes. However, that doesn't mean you can't do your best to remind yourself not to worry. Make a conscious effort to focus your attention elsewhere, and let events take their course as best you can.


Try to respect yourself. If something doesn't work out the way you'd hoped, review the course of events in your head and try to focus on what you did right or how hard you tried, rather than “where you messed up.” Chances are, the results had little to do with your actions, and more to do with those of others. If you endlessly self-criticize, you'll only worry more the next time a similar situation comes up (and be more likely to make a nervous mistake). Believe that you did your best, and that you'll do your best next time as well. There's no good reason to fret over things that have already come and gone.

, A lot of the time, your worries will revolve around whether or not you can successfully do something. Despite some things being largely up to the winds of chance (as mentioned above), you can compensate nicely by undertaking other endeavors on your own. Pick anything you've always wanted to do, want to do better, or want to start doing again, and give it a shot.


Remember, there's nothing to lose from trying something for your own enjoyment. Therefore, there's no good reason to worry about how well you'll do. Just compete against yourself and do your best not to worry what others might think.
Keep trying and working on things that interest you. You'll succeed more often than you might think, and begin to worry a lot less as you realize that 75% of success is just getting out there and trying. People who seem successful and happy are people just like you, except that they never let their worries stop them from giving things another shot.
The things you try don't have to be flashy, or significant to anyone except you. You could take up a new hobby, such as knitting or martial arts, or you could just make a commitment to smile more often at work. The goals you set are yours to attempt and achieve. Pursue anything you've ever wanted to pursue. You'll be delighted with the results more often than not.


, Don't obsess about the future; instead, focus on living in the present. It's fine to plan ahead sensibly and set goals, but the important thing is living your life as it is now, and not worry about what is already past or what the distant future might hold.


Practice self-acceptance. As mentioned previously, excessive self-criticism is a major source of worry. A part of us listens to what we say about ourselves, whether we want it to or not. If you're always down on yourself, you won't be able to enjoy anything. Telling yourself you'll do better in the future is one thing; refusing to feel proud of yourself and happy with the steps you've taken to make your life enjoyable right now is a different beast.
Remember that people are essentially self-centered. When you make an embarrassing mistake or scene, it can cause all your worries to spring back to life with a vengeance, making you half-catatonic with fear and self-doubt. The fact is, everybody has such gaffes now and again, and most people aside from the person who slipped up either forget about it completely or disregard it soon thereafter. Nobody is obsessively watching your every move; in fact, most people won't even remember what you said to them a month ago unless you say it to them again. There's no reason to carry the shame and embarrassment with you after the fact.

, Like most old adages and proverbs, this one gets repeated ad infinitum because it's actually very wise advice. Set aside your resistance to clichés for a moment and think about all the advantages you have. You're reading this article on the Internet, which means you either have or can borrow Internet access. It also means you can read, which is something not everybody can do. All but the most hopeless and pitiable lives have an abundance of good in them. Find yours, and remind yourself to be grateful for it every day.


Put your life in context. If you live in a building with a roof and walls, be grateful for that instead of worrying that it's too humble or too run-down. If you don't have a home, be grateful for the clothes on your back. If you live somewhere with harsh weather, be grateful that it sometimes passes and becomes pleasant. Be grateful that you can think for yourself, comprehend beauty, and dream of better things.
No matter your situation, if you're reading this article, you can find things to appreciate about your life. Think of them whenever you find yourself sitting and worrying instead of acting and enjoying life.


, There are some people who worry because they are trying to take care of everyone and everything around them, or because they read about problems elsewhere in the world and feel as though they are never doing enough to help. It's good to be supportive and charitable, but taking it too far will turn you into a used-up mess of nerves and frustration. Make a conscious effort to remind yourself that other people, like you, are more capable than they realize, and that you don't always need to be there for everyone at every turn.


People who have everything taken care of for them, such as coddled children, end up ill-equipped to function in the adult world, which means that sometimes not helping is actually the best help you can give.
It's also important to remind yourself that others care just as much as you do about social issues and charitable causes. It's okay to let them share the burden of responsibility; often it's the only way to make it bearable. This doesn't mean you should stop caring; rather, it means you should take pride in what you do and stop worrying that it isn't good enough. It is.
Set a limit for yourself. This could be a limit to the amount of time you spend helping others, a limit to the money you spend to support them, or just a limit to how much time you spend worrying about the world's problems. Design a limit based around the type of caring you engage in that causes your worry.
Remember that worrying never fixed anything, and there are some things you can't fix no matter how badly you might want to. Force yourself to set your worries aside past a certain point, and do whatever you have to do to enforce that limit.

, At the end of the day, there are some things that nobody can really control: weather, death, natural disasters, and other such unstoppable forces are a part of life on Earth. Learn to place faith in your own ability to handle them. You can't change the way such things behave, so all you can really do is to prepare for them, and to trust in yourself to do what you can when faced with them.


For example, thousands of people get into car accidents every year, but people continue to use cars because they trust themselves to do everything they can to avoid such an eventuality: driving safely, wearing seatbelts, learning from past mistakes, and responding quickly to changes on the road ahead of them. Take the same attitude with every uncontrollable force in your life.
It's sensible to prepare for misfortune. Things like emergency food and water, first-aid kits, and fire extinguishers are wise investments in your continued safety. However, be sure when you prepare that your preparations are easing your worries rather than fueling them. Don't give in to urges to buy and prepare more and more. The goal is to find a reasonable balance, say ""this is enough,"" and get on with your daily life.

When a difficult situation arises, pause and think to yourself, ""What opportunities are there for growth here?"" Try not to think of the situation as inherently negative.For example, say you're trying to meet a major deadline for work when your cat gets sick. You have to deal with caring for a sick animal while trying to complete a large report.
Think of this in the positives. You will learn from this. You will develop better time management skills and learn how to work under pressure.
These skills can be applied to a variety of situations. You're being given a great opportunity to develop positive skills you can use for life.;
, During a tough situation, you may experience a range of negative thoughts. You may catastrophize the situation, unnecessarily viewing a setback as a disaster. You may also internalized things that are beyond your control. Be more aware of what you're thinking during difficult moments. If you catch yourself indulging negative thoughts, adjust them. Instead of beating yourself up, ask what you can learn.Instead of thinking, ""I can't believe I was so lazy during my workout,"" think about how to change the situation. Ask yourself questions like, ""Am I getting enough sleep? Am I eating enough before my workout?""
Catch irrational thoughts as well. For example, you do poorly on a test and think to yourself, ""There goes my semester. It's all downhill from here."" However, you can't predict the future. Pause and reframe, thinking something like, ""I did poorly, but there's a chance I can turn it around if I work harder."", If you start to panic, work on reframing actively in a way that helps you stay calm. Remember that you are okay, even if things are hectic at the moment. Remind yourself this is a chance to learn, and you can channel the pressure into energy. Lastly, keep the big picture in mind. Think something like, ""Will this really matter a week from now? A year from now?"", Humor can help you cope in a variety of trying situations. Oftentimes, people look back at negative situations and laugh. However, with some self-awareness, you may be able to laugh in the moment.It can often help to invite others to laugh. If something negative happens to you, post it on Facebook as an amusing anecdote. Other people may respond positively, allowing you to feel better about the situation yourself.
Look for aspects of your situation that are simply absurd. These often provide the best fodder for humor.

, When you're struggling with something, be kind to yourself. How you treat yourself affects how you view a situation. If you want to be able to reframe things in a positive manner, your internal monologue must be positive.Think about how you would talk to someone else in your situation. Then, compare that to how you're talking to yourself. For example, you miss a deadline at work and you think to yourself, ""I'm so stupid for screwing that up."" Would you tell someone else that?
You would probably tell another person something like, ""Everyone makes mistakes. It's not a reflection of your whole life."" Give yourself this kind of kindness. Make sure you're as kind to yourself as you are to others.
Try to remind yourself that how you are feeling is temporary by saying things like, ""This will be over soon,"" ""This won't last forever,"" or ""This project will conclude in three months. I just need to manage until then and I know I can make it through.""

, Having a bank of positivity can help you be prepared to reframe things in the positive. Spend each morning reading positive media, looking at inspirational quotes, or seeking advice from people you admire. When a difficult situation presents itself, have something in mind to bring yourself up.You can write down inspirational quotes, poems, and other things in a notebook and carry it with you throughout the day. You can also write things down in your phone. If music inspires you, have an upbeat playlist saved on your iPod or M33 player.
When you start to face something difficult, fall back on your inspirational media. This will help bring you up and allow you to see things in a positive light.

, Remember, difficulties can be viewed as an opportunity. When you find yourself facing a trying situation, the first thing you can do is see where you can take action. Think to yourself, ""I don't have to succumb to pressure. Now is the time to take action.""For example, you're late for work because you can't find your car keys. Your apartment is generally messy and cluttered.
Instead of beating yourself up for being late, realize you've identified a way to make your life go smoother. You need to clean up your apartment. While today was hectic, taking this action now will make for a better future.

, If you want to be more positive by nature, look for role models. Do not spend time with people who whine and complain and tend to see things very negatively. Instead, look to people who seem to have a positive outlook overall These people will help you reframe situations in a positive light.When facing a difficult situation, don't ask your notoriously pessimistic brother for advice. Instead, call up your mom, who always seems to have a positive outlook.
Make friends with co-workers who seem upbeat and cheery. Make a coffee date with the secretary who always has a smile on her face.
Pay attention to how positive people view the world and how they frame difficult or trying situations.

, If you want to empower yourself to reframe things in the positive, listen to how you talk and think. If your vocabulary is negative or neutral overall, this can subtly affect your mentality. Tweaking your vocabulary to include more positives can make a profound impact on your outlook.Look for negative absolutes you use. For example, ""I can't finish this report in time. It's impossible."" This is not likely, and you're just putting more pressure on yourself. Instead, think something like, ""I can do this, even if it will be a challenge.""
Be positive when talking to others. If someone says, ""How are you doing?"", do not reply, ""I'm all right."" Instead, say something like, ""I'm doing great.""
Try to see negativity through the most positive lens possible. For example, don't think, ""This is a disaster."" Instead think, ""This is a little rough, but I can cope.""

, See pressure as a means to examine your current obligations. There's a good chance you're taking on too much if you're busy all the time. Try to see where you can cut back.Being busy can be fulfilling, but if you're over-focused on the wrong tasks it can be detrimental. If you're busy with tasks that aren't of personal importance to you, you may want to cut these obligations out of your life.
Take an overview of your current workload. What matters to you most and what does not matter? Identify areas where you're unnecessarily committed and not gaining anything from these commitments. Cut out these obligations.

, Instead of feeling frustrated when you're overwhelmed, see trying situations as a chance to learn life lessons. A major life lesson is learning to accept what one cannot control. If you're worried, and you've done everything you can to deal with the situation, it may be time to acknowledge you cannot control everything. Instead of beating yourself up when you don't complete everything to your liking, take this as a chance to be more accepting of life's hurdles.For example, you're working on a group project at school. Despite trying your best to keep your group members on track, certain people are not taking on a fair load of work.
At this point, you've done everything you can. Take this as a chance to accept you cannot change or control others rather than reveling in the pressure.

, Having good problem solving skills can also help you to stay positive and look at solutions when you are dealing with a stressful situation. Some things you can do to improve your problem solving skills include:Identifying the problem in detail.
Listing your options for solving the problem.
Considering each alternative carefully.
Choosing the best option and making a plan to follow through.

, How do you typically view stress? Many people see it as an emotionally draining, exhausting experience. However, stress is just a form of energy. Stress can get your blood pumping and your heart racing. Instead of thinking of this as negative, think of it as invigorating.Stress gets your body pumped for action. It puts on defense and provides a boost of energy. Do not think of stress as negative energy. Just think of it as your body's natural response to situations that require a lot of attention and care.
People who view their body's natural stress response as helpful, rather than harmful, are generally able to handle stress in a more productive fashion.

, People who are more engaged with the world around them tend to experience heightened levels of stress. Therefore, the fact you are stressed out may not be a bad thing. It shows that you are engaged and that you care.People who view their lives and work as meaningful tend to experience more stress. This is likely because a failure or setback matters more to them.
When you feel stressed, pause and consider why you're stressed. Chances are, you're stressed because you care about a situation. This is a good thing.
For example, say you're stressed because you can't find a good birthday present for your friend. Why does this matter? It's because you care about your friend and want her to have the best birthday possible. This is actually a positive.

, Instead of thinking of stress as showing you your limitations, think of it as an opportunity to embrace them. If you're feeling stressed because you can't get something done, do not think, ""I am a failure."" Instead, think, ""This is a chance to embrace I can't be perfect all the time.""It's important to acknowledge your imperfections. When you're up against a lot of stress, sometimes you won't cope as well as you would like.
This can be a good thing. When you realize you're at the end of your emotional limit, take this as a chance to accept your imperfections. You now have a better sense of what you can and cannot handle as an individual.

, Oftentimes, people allow themselves to become alienated by stress. You may view stress as an inherently negative thing and feel weak for experiencing it. However, everyone has stress in their lives. Embracing this fact can help you better cope.When you find yourself weighed down with stress, remember that life is complicated. No one feels happy and together all the time.
Remind yourself you're likely not the only one experiencing stress. Everyone feels this way from time to time.
This can help you think of stress less as something that's annoying or cumbersome and more as a natural part of being human.

Figure out what's holding you back.,
Think about your history with this obstacle.,
Find similarities to previous obstacles.,
Determine what you control.,
Analyze interpersonal issues.",How to Overcome Obstacles1," Sit down and work out exactly what stands in the way of your goals. Get as specific as possible about what your goals are, and exactly why you are having trouble meeting them. You'll need plenty of self-awareness to chart out a course of action. Try not to dredge up your usual list of complaints, as this often falls apart into excuses.If you said ""I don't have enough time,"" think about how you prioritize your time and energy. The real obstacle could be procrastination, careerism, or external events.
If you said ""I don't have enough money,"" this is also often about priorities. The more immediate obstacle might be a lack of time or a lack of motivation, or you might need to learn how to make money and save what you have.;
, How long has the obstacle been in your path? What behaviors or negative thoughts keep the obstacle alive, or prevent you from working through it?Answering these questions may help you identify the changes you need to make.


For example, if you've felt ""stuck"" ever since you moved to a new home, there could be something in your new environment or lifestyle that's affecting you. For instance, your distance from friends and family could be sapping your motivation.

, Take a minute to think about other obstacles you've encountered in your life. Whether or not your approach worked then, learn from your experience as you approach the next challenge.


For example, if you previously burned out after an overambitious New Year's resolution, try to ramp up more slowly this time.

, Some obstacles seem beyond your control, so daunting that you have no idea how to get through them. This experience is often paired with fear or another strong emotional reaction. Take a deep breath, put pen to paper, and ask yourself what you can control.You can control your attitude.
You can control how much effort you put in.
You can control your decision when an opportunity is offered to you.
You can control your diet, exercise, and sleep schedule, which can improve your mood and alertness.

, Some of the most frustrating obstacles are the ones that involve other people. Emotions or gut reactions can cloud your judgement and make the obstacle seem more impossible than it is. Try to break the problem down and discover what actually stands in your way:Often, it takes both people to contribute to the obstacle. Rein in your own reaction with mental ""stoppers,"" such as a deep breath, or counting to ten in your head.
Listen to the other person's problems, or try to think of them from his perspective. Solve what the other person sees as an obstacle, and you may solve your own problems.
In the worst case scenario, restructure your interactions to avoid situations where disagreements arise.

Try to put relatively insignificant events like a flat tire in perspective. Flat tires happen. Just make sure to deal with the consequences and move on.
View setbacks in your career as part of normal life. Most people have to switch jobs a few times before they find an organization they're happy working for.
See romantic setbacks as a regular part of life. Breaking up with a significant other or getting turned down for a date are just life events that everybody goes through.;
, Always live in the present. If you don't live in the present, you'll be fretting about what happened yesterday or what will happen next. Ultimately, by living in the present, you'll be able to stop yourself from getting stressed out.


Don't live in the past. Focusing on what happened yesterday may just lead you to regret your actions. For instance, if you're worried about an opportunity to make money that passed you by last week, you'll stress yourself out and you might miss opportunities today.
Stop yourself from living in the future. If you’re constantly thinking about what comes next, you’ll likely stress yourself out., Another way of putting your mind at rest is by having realistic expectations. When you don't have realistic expectations, you set yourself up for disappointment or stress.


When it comes to studying for a test, make sure to gather enough knowledge about what you need to do. This way, you can prepare properly without freaking out.
If you have a big project due soon for work or school, make sure your expectations aren’t much higher than that of the people you are completing the project for.
When applying for a new job, don't expect that it'll be a walk in the park or the pay will be the best. You might need to adjust to your new work or you might need to work your way up to your desired pay., By putting some time aside for yourself, you’ll make sure that you have time for self-reflection, time for mental rest, and time to think about any problems you have going on in your life.


Put aside 10 to 20 minutes a day for alone time.
Avoid any distractions during your quiet time.
If you have a busy schedule, you may just be able to take advantage of commute time to work, time in the shower, or simply the ten or fifteen minutes before you fall asleep., There are many things you can do to manage stress in your daily life. Try to include a stress relief technique as part of your daily routine, just like brushing your teeth or putting on clean clothes in the morning. Make relaxing for at least 15 minutes every day a priority. Some techniques you can try include:


Deep breathing.

Meditation.

Yoga.

Progressive muscle relaxation.

Drawing or journaling.

Taking a bath.

, Take action to create balance in your life. Balancing family, work, and recreation will help stop you from being stressed out.


Don’t overcommit. If your schedule is already packed with work, family, and social obligations, don’t volunteer yourself for anything else. While coaching little league might seem like a good idea, it might put you over the edge and cause you a lot of stress.
Figure out how much you should work. While you might need to work sixty hour weeks at some stages of your career, it’s certainly not healthy to do this for years at a time. Such a commitment to work will definitely hurt your family life – and cause you a lot of stress.
Reserve time for recreation and family. If you don’t have fun and if you don’t spend time with your family, you’ll likely stress yourself out., Sleep is a very important part of having a healthy life. Without sleep, you won’t be able to function at your highest level. As a result, you need to make sure you regularly get enough sleep.


Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep. This varies based on age, health, and other factors.
Teenagers may need 9 or more hours of sleep.
Consult your physician if you are concerned about sleep related issues., Try to exercise whenever you can. By exercising, you’ll improve your health and provide yourself with a positive outlet for tension and stress.


Try to find at least 20 minutes a day to exercise.
You’ll find that exercise will help relieve short-term stress and will prevent stress in the future.
Think about running or cycling. Both of these are great ways to relieve your stress., Prioritizing is the process of deciding what is most important in your life and managing your daily tasks according to these priorities. For example, if your education is more important to you than anything else, then you might prioritize homework and studying over things like watching a television program or going to a party.

Make a list of what you value most to help you decide what your priorities are, then rank the things you have listed from most to least important.
You can also prioritize by identifying what tasks are the most pressing on a daily basis. For example, you might prioritize work on a presentation over studying for a final exam if the presentation is coming up in a few days and the exam is a month away. Or, you might prioritize answering emails over completing something that is less time-sensitive. Think about what you need to get done today to help you decide how to prioritize your daily tasks. Then add other tasks in the order of their importance.

, Procrastination is a problem for many people. You might put off an important project because it seems too difficult or because you simply don’t feel like working on it. However, procrastinating can lead to stress and it may also result in shoddy work.Try to stop yourself from procrastinating if this is a habit of yours.

Try using visualization to stop procrastinating.
If you are a college student, then doing things like making to-do lists, removing distractions, and rewarding yourself may help.

, Spend a little time to develop a schedule. Use your schedule to balance all of your responsibilities. This will help you to predict what you have to do on a daily basis.


Buy a day planner and use it to schedule appointments, meetings, and other obligations.
Always provide a little bit more time than you might need for scheduled activities. By providing extra time, you’ll reduce potential stress if something unexpected happens.
Remember, sometimes things go wrong and you won’t be able to follow your schedule. This should be expected and should not be a cause of stress., Try to be as proactive as possible when it comes to solving problems in your life. By solving problems before they happen, you’ll save yourself from dealing with a bigger problem down the road.


To solve problems, start by identifying the problem and defining it. One example might be that your rent is due and you do not have enough money to pay it.
Then, make a list of your choices for dealing with the problem. You could deal with being short on money for rent by paying late without asking, calling your landlord and asking if you can pay late, or by borrowing money from a friend or family member to pay on time.
Next, evaluate these choices and decide which one is most likely to get you the result you want. Calling your landlord and asking to pay late will probably give you the best result. If your landlord is not okay with your paying late, then you can ask a friend or family member to lend you some money to pay on time. Sending in your rent late without asking will probably result in an angry landlord and possibly a poor reference when you look for your next apartment.
Then, put your plan into action.After you have decided what to do, then do it. See how it turns out and use this information to help you when you have to make a similar decision in the future.

, Spend some time thinking about things you can do to improve your efficiency. By improving your efficiency, you’ll make sure all aspects of your life run more smoothly.


Think about your effectiveness at work. Are there any things you can do to improve your efficiency at work? Consider redoing your organizational or filing system, organizing your desk, or moving daily tasks to different parts of your workday.
Consider reorganizing the way you manage domestic chores and activities. If you know that you need to take your children to little league practice every Saturday, don’t plan to have a BBQ the same afternoon. You’ll likely be tired, and if practice runs late, you’ll be stressed out."

Break your goals into smaller chunks.,
Consider creative solutions.,
Keep an active plan.,
Track your progress.,
Seek advice and support.,
Break bad habits.,
Visualize your goal for motivation.,
Hone your problem-solving skills.",How to Overcome Obstacles2," No one can leap to the top of Mount Everest in one step. Shrink that daunting mountain into a series of more manageable goals.Write a checklist, then ask yourself what obstacles prevent you from achieving the first box.


For instance, if your goal is to become a doctor, one looming obstacle might be getting a college education. After breaking it down, your new first goal becomes filling out a college application form. Overcome your first obstacle by picking up a pen!

, Once you've listed your obstacles, take a moment to think of alternate paths to your goals. Is there any way to reach your goal while avoiding the obstacles entirely? These shortcuts don't happen often, but it's worth taking the time to brainstorm.


Talk to someone who's already attained the goal you're aiming for. She may be familiar with routes you've never heard of.
For example, many companies prefer job candidates from inside the company.Maybe you can get hired at your dream company for a less competitive position, and work your way up the ladder, or transfer to a different department.

, Put your plan in writing, starting with what you'll do today and ending with achieving your goal. Now recognize that your plan will change. This is just the first stage, which will set your feet on the road. As you learn, grow, and encounter new obstacles, adapt your plan to find the best path forward at each moment., As you work toward your goal, keep a journal or chart of your progress and your setbacks.Set yourself several milestones along the way, and make sure to reward yourself for each one.

, Find people with similar goals, or encouraging friends. Make yourself accountable by sharing your goals and milestones. Seek advice from people with more experience than you, who may have overcome the exact same obstacles.


There are thousands of people who share your career, hobby, bad habit, or relationship struggle. Look for local organizations and online forums where you can talk about your experiences and trade advice.

, Even if they aren't the obstacles you are trying to avoid, bad habits can set anyone back. Treat these as a whole new obstacle, overcoming the habit with goals and milestones just like any other.

, When you get discouraged, close your eyes and picture yourself after you've overcome the obstacle. Remind yourself frequently why you're putting in the hard work and making the sacrifices. It will all be worth it when you shatter the last obstacle at your feet.

, If you tend to make decisions based on gut instinct, try a more analytic approach. Here are a few possible approaches when you're trying to make a decision:


Cost-benefit analysis: Write down what you would gain from a decision, and what you would lose. Decide whether the benefits worth the drawbacks.
Worst case scenario: If you attempt something and it fails completely, where do you end up? Come up with a backup plan for this scenario.
Write a list of all your concerns, and treat each as a separate problem. Anxiety over a long-distance move might include finances, losing touch with friends, and your child transitioning schools. Solve each problem separately.

Practice calm biology.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Do something physical and positive that has tangible results.,
Look to your diet.,
Use Progressive Muscle Relaxation.,
Have a relaxing bath or shower.",How to Calm Your Fear Reactions1," When your body senses stress, it responds with a “fight or flight” stress response.To short-circuit fear and turn off this stress response, you'll need to train your brain to send chemicals to counteract them. Otherwise, fear and its hormones will keep you feeling crazed. In contrast, with a calm biology it's easier to find courage. Many of the following techniques are aimed at providing a method by which you can quieten your system by encouraging the endorphins to take over from the cortisol and other fear-induced chemicals, so as to calm your usual reactions to fear.;
, Breathing properly calms the sympathetic nervous system, or your ""fight-flight"" response.Perceived threats don't come from rabidly hungry beasts for most people anymore; they come in the form of deadlines, angry bosses, unsettled coworkers, and belligerent online users. This can mean that we don't burn off the flight-fight response, instead allowing the stress chemicals and hormones like cortisol to become elevated and swim around our body unabated. And the breathing becomes stressed too: short, sharp, stabs of breathing over which you have little focus. Signs that you need to turn your focus to better breathing include a tight neck, bunched-up shoulders, shallow breathing, a tight chest, and a tension headache.By starting to breathe slowly, you will signal your brain to relax, as you slow down the release of adrenalin and cortisol, and increase the release of endorphins. You will also fully oxygenate your brain and body, allowing your heartbeat to slow and your blood pressure to stabilize.Read Breathe Deeply, Meditate on Breath, and Breathe Like a Yoga Master for more details.
Read Do Mindful Meditation for details on how to practice mindfulness meditation, which has been shown in studies to shut down and even reprogram your body’s stress responses., Clean your room. Run down to the store on an errand. Try yoga, stretching, or other exercises. Letting your body do something that uses the ""fight or flight"" adrenaline energy will reduce the amount of toxins building up in your muscles and helps burn out the immediate emotional reaction.A sense of satisfaction from accomplishing something physical like chopping firewood or scrubbing the bathroom can raise endorphins and your confidence in general.


Social fears don't usually have an effective physical response the way natural disasters and physical threats do. That's what your body's prepared for, though. So literally running around, picking up things, moving them around and doing something tangible uses the adrenaline and gives your body the satisfaction that you've dealt with the threat - you're still breathing. A threat to your status or long term relationships is something best handled in a calm frame of mind. This is good for cooling off from emotional fights too.
If you have a habitual response to situations that involve fear for you, your body will remember this and repeat it each time a similar fearful (for you) situation arises. For example, your regular response to someone yelling at you or informing you unkindly that you're wrong and responsible for damage might be to curl up under the blankets and want to hide yourself away on the emotional side, while on the physical side, maybe your mind goes blank, your heart rate starts to increase, you sweat, and feel your body turn tense, etc. All of these biological responses seize your mind and try to take control of the situation, making it much harder for you to think straight. They are instinct responses to physical threats, not effective ways to handle social and emotional threats. If this becomes a standard response for you whenever anything goes wrong, however mild or major, you will probably find yourself unable to break the fear response cycle without knowing some specific techniques to work around it.

, Dietary choices can provoke and increase a sense of anxiety and worry if you're lacking in healthy nutrients, have blood sugar swings, and you're fueling up on unhealthy foods most of the time. Caffeine and sugar are culprits in fueling your flight or fight responses. Decreasing anxiety through food can be achieved by increasing your intake of complex carbohydrates, eating smaller, more frequent meals, drinking plenty of water, and limiting the intake of caffeine and alcohol. Be careful to avoid food sensitivities as these can heighten your sense of anxiety and fear if you have a reaction to them.Increase your intake of foods that are high in tryptophan. Tryptophan helps boost your brain's calm mood and relaxes you. Try such foods as bananas, soy, oats, milk, cheese, poultry, nuts, peanut butter and sesame seeds.There’s a difference between choosing healthy foods to help quell stress responses and “stress eating”. If you notice that you’re turning to “comfort foods” to relieve stress, be mindful.Comfort eating should not become (or remain) a habit and the long-term goal must be to eat a healthy diet, ensuring that your nutrients are balanced and moving your desire to comfort eat into yoga, meditation, breathing, and other more constructive outlets.

Blood sugar swings will feed fear because you lack strength and energy as a result of them, causing you to feel physically weaker. As your blood sugar soars, you feel exuberant but as it crashes, your sense of fear will return and leave you feeling irritable, unresolved, and worried.

, When you feel fear, your body responds by tightening your muscles to prepare you to run away. This tension can cause muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches.PMR helps relieve this muscle tension. The technique suggested here can be used in a quiet spot in the office, at home, in the lunchroom, in a park, or anywhere that you can escape to when you feel the fear mounting:


In a comfortable position, sitting or lying down, take a few deep breaths while letting your body go as limp as possible.
When you're ready, begin by tightening the muscles in your toes... hold to a count of ten... then relax.
Enjoy the relief of tension melting.
Do the same by flexing your foot muscles, and move slowly through your entire body: calves, legs, stomach, back, neck, jaw, face, contracting and releasing each area.

, Immerse yourself in hot water to relax muscular tension as soon as possible, even if this means doing it the moment you step back through the door into your home.


Some studies have shown that physical warmth is very soothing for many people and can help relieve stress."

Join a support group.",How to Overcome a Driving Phobia," You should feel comfortable just sitting in the car regardless of whether or not it's moving. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Practice sitting in the car and becoming relaxed before you begin driving. Consider playing soothing music. It may help you overcome a sense of rising panic and can drown out the noise of other cars.


Even the most confident driver can become anxious if there are noisy passengers in the car. Make sure the car is quiet and free of trash or clutter.
Increase your sense of safety in the car by making sure your car gets any needed repairs.;
, If you begin to feel a panic attack come on or your neck and chest muscles tighten, begin breathing deep into your lungs. Inhale slowly through your nose with the focus of getting air to the bottom of your lungs. Let your belly expand and pause for a moment while you hold your breath. Slowly exhale and let your whole body relax.You can repeat this process 10 times counting backwards from ten on each exhale. Try to complete three sets of 10.

, Tighten and relax muscle groups in your body so that you become aware of how to hold and release tension. Begin by clenching your fists for 7-10 seconds. Release your fist for 15 to 20 seconds while you focus on how the tension is leaving the muscles in your hands. Repeat the exercise with other muscle groups, moving up your arms, to your head, then down the back of your body to your feet and toes.You can even practice PMR every day for 20 minutes even if you are not experiencing panic. This can improve your sense of control over your mood, reduce the frequency of panic attacks, and increase your concentration.

, Affirmations are short positive statements that remind you that you can make changes. With driving, the type of affirmations that you might want to use include:


I am driving carefully and within the speed limit. Careful driving is safe driving.
Driving is a common, everyday activity. I am an alert driver participating in a common activity with care.
I do not have to drive fast. I can drive in the right-hand lane if I want to travel slower than other cars.
I do not have to risk switching lanes at the last minute. If I miss a turn-off, I can safely double back.
I have planned this journey from start to finish. I know where I am headed and when I have to make lane changes and turn offs. I am well prepared.
Even though I am a passenger, I can control my reactions to riding in the car. If I feel uncomfortable at any time, I can ask the driver to pull over.

, You've probably been told that you need to face your fear. Exposing yourself to the fear is especially important if you've been avoiding driving for fear that you'll have a panic attack. Exposure therapy remains one of the most important ways to get over a phobia, although you should know and be able to use relaxation techniques before you start. This way, you'll have some sense of control during the session.


Avoiding your phobia will actually make the fear worse over time and can create other phobias., Become familiar with your anxiety levels so you can take action before you reach a full scale panic attack. Having a scale of anxiety will also help you know when to stop exposure before you reach moderate panic. Your scale should describe physical and mental characteristics of anxiety. An example scale might look like this:0 - Fully Relaxed: no tension, calm, feeling peaceful
1 - Minimal Anxiety: feeling slightly nervousness, more alert or aware
2 - Mild Anxiety: muscle tension, tingling or butterflies in stomach
3- Moderate Anxiety: heart and breathing increase, feeling slightly uncomfortable but still in control
4 - Marked Anxiety: clear muscle tension, increased feelings of being uncomfortable, starting to wonder about staying in control
5- Beginning Panic: heart is starting to race or beat irregularly, dizziness, clear fear of losing control, wanting to escape
6 - Moderate Panic: heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feeling disoriented
7 to10 - Full Panic Attack: feelings of terror, fear of dying, and increased feelings of moderate panic

, Be specific and write down what things you fear about driving. Then, go through and rank these fears from what you fear the least to what causes a full panic attack. This will help you gradually expose yourself to your fears. But, you'll slowly work your way through your fears so that you never feel truly out of control.


For example, holding the keys in your driveway might be something you fear the least while driving on the highway can cause you to have a panic attack.

, Start with the least feared item on your list and gradually expose yourself until you no longer feel anxious. Once you've mastered an item on your list, move on to the next thing on your list or scale. For example, you list might expose yourself to fears like these (ranked from least to greatest feared):Hold your car keys and look at your car in the driveway
Sit inside of your car, working up to 5 minutes
Drive around the block
Drive in your neighborhood making right turns, then left turns
Drive on a main street taking left turns at traffic lights or stop signs
Drive on a highway in the right lane for 1 to 2 exits
Drive on a highway in the left lane for 2 exits
Drive on the highway changing lanes past cars for 3 to 5 exits

, If you find that you can't even stand being a passenger in a car, follow the exposure therapy steps. Instead of driving, you may want to gradually face your fear by riding in a car with a driver you trust. Choose someone you know will drive with the greatest of care. Once you're comfortable riding with that person, try to ride with other drivers or ride along on more challenging drives (like on the highway).


Find what feels the most comfortable for you when you begin riding as a passenger. You might find that you prefer to sit in the backseat. Or, maybe you find it less stressful to sit next to the driver. Experiment to find what works for you.

, Most people are afraid of getting behind the wheel for the first time. To ease your fear, choose a knowledgeable driving instructor who has a lot of experience teaching new drivers. A good driver can reassure you and make you feel comfortable in the driver's seat.Consider working with a driving school instructor. You might realize that the anxiety you had been feeling about learning to drive actually stemmed from your previous instructor, especially if it was a relative trying to teach you how to drive.

, If your fear of driving is disrupting your life, you should get medical or psychological treatment. If you're unsure who to ask for help, contact your doctor who should be able to put you in touch with trained professionals.You may work with your doctor, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a counselor trained in phobias.


If you're increasingly depressed by your inability to drive, make sure to seek help. Don't simply adjust to the fear that prevents you from driving this can cause other phobias to develop., You may work with a counselor or therapist on a one-on-one basis. In addition to relaxation techniques and exposure therapy, your counselor may simply want you to talk. Talking is an important way for your brain to learn how to handle fear. It will give you a chance to think about what's behind the fear and can treat your driving phobia.Don't expect your counselor to offer you advice. Many counselors simply listen and ask questions so you can give thoughtful answers and explore your fear.

, If you'd rather talk about your phobia with a group, find a local driving phobia support group to talk with. You may also find an online support group with people who experience similar symptoms. Just knowing that you're not alone can be helpful in overcoming your fear.You can also talk with friends and family. Share your fears with them and explain the challenges you face. It can help knowing that you have friends and family who understand what you're going through.

Enjoy running.,
Plan regular running times.,
Find time where you think there is no time.,
Begin gradually.,
Add new goals.,
Keep in mind why you're running.",How to Relieve Stress With Running," Above all else, running must be something that you like to do. It won't relieve stress to simply take up running because you think it might help but you can't stand it as an activity. Find a different physical activity if running pains you. On the other hand, if you love running and how it feels, make the most of it as a stress reliever.;
, Stress builds up daily, especially in competitive, busy or challenging work environments. As such, it makes sense to schedule a run every day where possible, even if the time allocations vary depending on your other needs. However, the times you choose don't have to be long or the same length each time; fitting in a 10 minute run here, a 20 minute run there and an hour on the weekend will work just fine too.


Grab a schedule planner, either digital or paper-form, and map out the next few weeks to include regular runs. The idea is to commit to these times and make them, and start working other things around these no-change times.
When planning the runs, be realistic. Choose times that you know won't be interrupted by work, family and other commitments.

, If you're finding it hard to commit to times on the schedule, perhaps you need to think more creatively about finding time. Some ""spare time"" ideas that you might be able to make use of include:


Lunchtimes. Eat a healthy sandwich before or after your run for 5 minutes and use the rest of the time for running.
Before work. Get up an hour earlier and use this time for a refreshing early morning run. Morning exercise is often beneficial for most people, as it gets you active for the day ahead.
After work. Why not get off the train or bus earlier and run the rest of the way home? Change when you leave work and use a good quality and comfortable backpack to carry all your work gear and clothes in. The weight is something you'll get used to.
When you walk the dog. As long as Fido is in good shape, your dog might not mind keeping a running pace going in the evenings. This will, of course, depend on the type of dog you have.
Instead of other sporting activities. If you don't much like the gym or find that team game you've been playing just isn't doing it for you, switch those over to running time instead.

, If you haven't done much running or haven't run in a long time, be gentle on yourself when you begin. Something is better than nothing and your body needs to get used to the activity and then the pace. Walking is a great way to get started, so begin with that if you want to and slowly ease into running.


For the first week or two, just do what you can. After that, you can start to build in distance or time goals to meet, making sure the goals are reasonable reflections of where you're at.

, Over time, you'll find it gets too easy; that's when it's time to push yourself a little more, and the same for each new ""easy stage"" you reach. However, when you find yourself at a plateau, it might be a sign you're at a comfortable amount of running. You can test this by pushing it a bit more but not getting results; this tells you it's time to stick with what is working best. You're not in training for athletics, just to reduce stress, so don't turn the running into yet another form of stress!

, When running to reduce stress, the benefits you want include increased energy, release of endorphins (it should be a pleasure to run), a meditative state (thinking lots as you run, but thinking through things, not panicking or worrying) and an elevated mood when you're done.If you're not getting these things out of running, it's possible you're not doing it at a pace that's good for you or you've chosen an activity that isn't really suited to you.

Avoid the fear generators.,
Ration the sources of fear.,
Use the 4 A’s.,
Take calming mini-breaks.",How to Calm Your Fear Reactions2," People who push your buttons and put you into fight and flight mode regularly should be avoided until you learn stronger coping mechanisms. For some people, this may mean avoiding them long-term. All the same, it may be unrealistic to avoid all fear generators, especially if they're your boss or a family member, so practice very non-committal responses when these people begin to create fear situations and quickly and politely remove yourself from their sphere of influence. Don't explain yourself, just simply make excuses to get going.Balance the fear generators with emotional nurturers. For every fear generator, find an emotionally regenerative and calming person you know that you can turn to and unwind around. People who are good listeners, healers, carers, and good humored are generally excellent antidotes to the nastier, darker personalities out there. This isn't a time for trying to find the good side to the person who has generated your fear; deal first with calming down and building yourself up again.
Use your eyes and not your heart. Look at people to judge their real intentions and behavior. By learning to better translate body language, you will learn that much of what people say is counteracted by their body, giving you far greater insight into their real motives and even their own fears.
Studies have shown that emotion is contagious. How the people you spend time with feel rubs off on you.Fortunately, this works both ways; while spending time with people who are anxious and fearful can provoke your own fear responses, spending time with people who are calm and balanced can foster those feelings in you, too.

, When terrible things happen, there isn't a reason to force yourself to participate. Watching endless repeats of violent newscasts or disasters will increase your fear greatly and offer nothing in return than awful images and worries. Realize that doing this doesn't help the victims of such crises and it makes you feel more helpless.If a disaster does set you off, get proactive and plan how you'd be prepared for a disaster if it happened, instead of worrying your socks off.

, The four A’s are Avoid, Alter, Adapt, Accept.Different stressors require different responses. Using these techniques, depending on the situation, can really help you fight your fear response.


For example, if traffic increases your fear levels because you're worried about time, accidents, and noise, you can choose to Alter or Avoid this source of stress. Find an alternate route to drive to work that decreases your chances of being involved in traffic jams. Read How to cope with rush hour for more details. Or, see if you can take public transportation or carpool to work instead, and avoid that stress altogether.
If conflict provokes your fear response, you can Alter how you handle it or Adapt to have different expectations.Learn to reduce conflict by managing it. Instead of avoiding it, find constructive ways to cope and to assert yourself around others. Always remember that you don't have to provide explanations for excusing yourself or for standing up for yourself. You do not have to tolerate abusive people or situations.
Some sources of stress you may just need to Accept. For example, you can’t control how other people react to stress. If a person in your workplace gets all flustered over missing a big deadline and spreads that stress around your office, you can try to soothe her, but you can’t control whether she changes her behavior. You can look at this situation as an opportunity for you to grow as a person, instead., If you're highly sensitive and tend to get overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and activity around you, until it builds up into a fearful crescendo, make an effort to take regular breaks to restore a sense of inner calm.Sit outside for a bit, go for a walk, do a short meditation, etc. In this way, hopefully you will alleviate the build-up of fear that can be triggered through any event during the day that upsets you.

Get professional counseling.",How to Overcome the Sunday Night Blues," Friday afternoon, when you're excited about the weekend, is the perfect time to take care of all the annoying little work tasks that will otherwise await you on Monday.Get yourself organized so that you can enjoy the weekend instead of worrying about the work week to come.;
, Don't let unanswered emails hang over your head. Spend the last part of your day on Friday answering all your emails and cleaning out your inbox so that you can start fresh on Monday. And don't leave your office a mess, either. A neat, organized workspace is a place you will be happier to return to after the weekend.Be sure to acknowledge receipt of emails. A simple ""Thanks"" or ""Got it"" is usually all it takes. It let's the sender know that they don't need to do anything else and can check this task off their list. If you do it, those you correspond with will, too.
If you don't have time to get to all your emails, mark as ""unread"" the important ones. This will remove the worry that they will get lost in the clutter by making them easy to locate and respond to.

, Leaving work with a sense of accomplishment – instead of focusing on what you still have to do – can make a huge difference in your sense of well-being.Review the goals you set for the week and cross off those that you have accomplished.

, If there is something you didn't accomplish this week, writing out a to-do list detailing how and when you will take care of it next week is a great way to get it off your mind. You should also make a list of 3 to 5 new goals you want to accomplish at work in the week to come, and a to-do list indicating how they will be accomplished., If you haven't already, use Friday afternoon to make plans for the weekend. And make plans for the following week, as well. It's especially helpful to plan something for Monday. The sense of anticipation can help overcome the Sunday Night Blues.

, Let your coworkers know when you will be available to work. If you don't, you'll likely be asked to work, and more often than not, that work will get pushed to Sunday night. Telling them you'll be doing no work after noon on Sunday is a great way to prevent Sunday evening from becoming too stressful.

, Let your coworkers know you appreciate any help they gave you during the week. If any tensions flared up, try to resolve them as best you can. Relationships are a huge part of what makes a workplace enjoyable or uncomfortable. By making sure you leave your co-workers on a high note, you can avoid the stress of worrying about seeing them on Monday.

, Waiting until the last moment to do weekend chores like paying bills, planning meals, shopping, doing laundry, or balancing your budget can leave you harried and stressed on Sunday. Instead, tackle the most annoying tasks on Saturday morning, when you'll have more energy and be in a better mood.And if you don't get though your entire to-do list that weekend, don't sweat it. Simply set aside some time to finish the tasks during the week or next weekend., You're more likely to worry about Monday if you're not doing anything.Instead, start a fun weekly ritual that makes Sunday evening something to look forward to.Make Sunday night date night.
Go to a movie or make it movie night.
Have a dinner picnic.
Watch your favorite TV show.
Invite people over for dinner.
Do a volunteer activity.
Cook a fancy dinner.
Have a game night.

, Aerobic exercise, in particular, has been clinically proven to reduce levels of anxiety and depression.Exercising on Sunday will help produce endorphins that can combat the Sunday Night Blues. It will also give you a sense of accomplishment and help you to sleep that night.Just remember to start slow and not overdo it at first. Some particularly good exercises to help you relax and get those endorphins pumping include:Walking or jogging for at least 10 minutes
Yoga
Tai Chi or Qi Gong (meditative martial arts developed in China)
Dance
Biking

, While it may seem like a good way to fight the blues, alcohol is a depressant that's only going to make you feel worse. Drinking on Sunday will also make Monday harder, only reinforcing your Sunday fears. Instead, eat a healthy dinner Sunday night. Try a warm cup of tea or some bubbly water instead., Turn off your cell phone and do not check your work email. It may be tempting to get a head start on the week by doing work on Sunday, but that can be counterproductive. Doing work on Sunday can cause you anxiety and stress, and not getting enough down time can actually cause you to be less productive. Taking time to recharge your batteries, on the other hand, can make you a happier, more productive worker. Those work emails can wait until Monday. If you must, give yourself no more than 30 minutes on Sunday to write out your work to-do list and organize your calendar.
Writing things down will allow you to put those tasks out of your head, stop worrying about work, and will make space for you to think about relaxing.

, While keeping busy is a good way to keep your mind off the blues, you'll want to start relaxing and winding down by 8pm so that you can recharge and get ready for Monday. Try creating a soothing Sunday night ritual that you can look forward to. And be sure to keep work-related items out of the bedroom so that you can relax properly. Some activities to try include:


Take a hot bath with salts or bubbles.
Read a good book.
Meditate.
Do yoga.
Listen to calming music.
Give yourself a mani-pedi.
Take an evening walk.
Watch the sun set.

, Studies show that what you wear can have a significant effect on your mood. So make Monday the day you wear your favorite clothes or unveil the latest addition to your wardrobe., A tough commute can be a big source of stress and contribute to the Sunday Night Blues. So especially on Monday, work on making your commute fun. Leave early so that you can stop and get your favorite coffee. Or visit a diner where you can eat while you sort work email and prepare for the week. If you don't want to stop, try getting a book on tape (you can check them out digitally from most public libraries for free). It will give you something to look forward to on your commute.

, Monday is not the day to have a salad at your desk. Give yourself something to look forward to by treating yourself to a nice lunch. Take a co-worker if you can. Making personal connections at work will help make the workplace less stressful., Fun is not just for the weekends. Having something to look forward to on Monday night can go a long way to dispelling the Sunday Night blues. Go to a happy hour, out on a date, or to a movie or concert. Or have a quite night at home watching your favorite show, if that's more your speed. If you have kids, head out for dinner, make Monday night pizza night or game night, or hire a babysitter and make it date night., Recognizing that you have the Sunday Blues and what they stem from can go a long way to helping you work through them. Keep a log of specific actions, tasks, or times of days that trigger your blues. Write down exactly what you feel, what time it is, and why you think you feel that way. After a few weeks, look for patterns in your log to see what is causing your blues.If your Sunday blues come from leaving unpleasant tasks for the week ahead until Sunday night to complete, then you can help yourself feel better by changing your weekend and work routine.
If your Sunday blues stem from anxiety about an upcoming presentation or assignment due on Monday, allow yourself to acknowledge your nervousness as normal, and then tell yourself that Monday will go well. Set aside prep time that weekend to make sure you are prepared.
If your Sunday blues stem from your job, and none of the steps you take to address them work, then it may be time to look for new employment. Schedule a little time on Sunday's to update your resume and search for work. Taking positive steps forward will help you cope with returning to your job the next day., If you think of Friday as the end of the week, you'll be anxious about what you haven't gotten done. Similarly, if you think of Sunday as the end of the weekend, you'll worry that you haven't maximized your time. But these days aren't ends. They are a part of an unending procession of days and nights, each one a part of a larger process. If you don't finish what you hoped to on Sunday, that's fine. You have the next week to do it. So instead of creating artificial units of time, separate from the rest of life, during which certain tasks have to be accomplished, try to weave those tasks into the overall fabric of your life.If Sunday evening is approaching and you still have tasks to accomplish, don't try to cram them in that night. Instead, make a to-do list of how you will accomplish them during the week to come.
Space out fun activities. Trying to cram all your fun into the weekend can be more stressful than enjoyable. Be sure to space out fun activities over the course of the week. That way you won't be disappointed if your weekend isn't as fantastic as you hoped.

, If after adjusting your weekend routine, organizing your Fridays, and trying to make Monday a fun day, you still suffer from the Sunday Night Blues, it is time to get professional guidance to help you explore the deeper causes of your negative feelings. They might stem from experiences earlier in your life, such as fearing school on Mondays because you were bullied or had a learning disorder. Or they might reflect unease with the type of work you do. A professional counselor can help you talk through and, hopefully, resolve your negative feelings."

Relax and have fun.",How to Not Be Obsessive," You may be preoccupied because you see your obsession as part of who you are. Instead, you need to focus on yourself.Mentally separate yourself from your obsession by considering what other areas of your life contribute to who you are. Think about tasks, roles, or jobs that reward you as much as your obsession. Is your obsession based on a fantasy or idealized version of a person or activity?You need to start seeing how the obsession has served or fulfilled you before you can begin to fulfill that need in other ways. For example, if you're currently in a romantic relationship but obsess over a co-worker who flirts with you, you might need to refocus your attention on making your relationship fun again.;
, Become aware of yourself and your surroundings without judgement. To do this, tune in to each one of your senses while you also pay attention to your physical or emotional state. For example, notice if your body is tense, you feel fatigued, or you're content with your life. Even being mindful for small periods of time can help you become more aware of yourself.Mindfulness can help you to become more connected with yourself and others because it builds empathy and emotional intelligence. It can even stop you from negatively dwelling on things you can't control. Instead, you'll be able to regulate your fear or anxiety when you're stressed.

, Think about something else to take your mind off of your obsessive thoughts. Don’t be hard on yourself if you find your mind wandering back to your obsession, simply acknowledge the thought and let is pass you by as you practice focusing on something else.To distract yourself, try reading a great book, chatting with a friend, or taking up a new volunteer position. You could also do something physical like taking a yoga class or cooking a complex meal.

, If you find that you're emotionally drained from constantly obsessing, you need to get in touch with your emotional needs. A good way to practice this is to write a letter to your obsession telling the obsession why it attracted you. Explain what part it's played in your life and the emotions your obsession makes you feel. Also, tell your obsession why it is has become worrisome or why it is causing you stress.Getting in touch with your emotional needs will help you to start meeting them, relying less on your obsession.

, You may be constantly obsessing. To stop these obsessive thoughts from interfering with your life, tell yourself that you'll only obsess at certain times of the day. Put it off for the moment and tell yourself you can obsess later. You might find that your mind relaxes enough to forget to obsess.For example, if you start to obsess over something when you're out with your friends, remind yourself to enjoy the moment and tell yourself you can always obsess when you get home.

, If you're obsessing over a challenge or problem, try to solve it. Brainstorm a list of options, so you feel like you have options. If you have trouble seeing potential solutions, talk with other people who have experienced a similar situation to the one you're trying to solve.Other people may be able to offer you a different perspective to solving your problem.


For example, maybe you've been obsessing over a way to maintain your fitness through a life change. Your challenge could be finding a way to schedule your morning run while still being able to take your new infant to daycare. You might talk to another new parent or offer to take turns with childcare so you can work out.

, You may feel that obsessing over something or someone has isolated you from friends and family. Re-connect to friends, family, or co-workers who you can explain your situation to. Talking can help you understand the underlying cause of your obsession and having a support network to turn to can reduce your stress.For example, if you're obsessing over an ex after a break up, talk with a friend or family member. Talking with your friend might help you realize that you're obsessed because your ex was the first person to take you seriously in a relationship.

, It's easy to slip into the routine of obsessing over something if you're not challenging yourself with new things. If you've been meaning to pursue a new hobby or take a class, start doing it. Not only will you take your mind off of your obsession by focusing on a new task or skill, you may also meet new people or learn something new about yourself.New people and new ways of thinking can help you move beyond your obsession. You might realize that you no longer crave whatever the obsession rewarded you with. For example, you might not obsess over a lost job opportunity if you learn a new trade that you actually enjoy more.

, You might be so focused on obsessing over something going on in your life, that you completely overlook the lives of your friends, family members, or people in your community. Reach out to people who might need your help. Not only will they appreciate it, but you'll realize there's more to life than your obsession.For example, you might tutor at a school, serve at a soup kitchen, or drive an elderly relative to the grocery store.

, If you're obsessed with something like playing video games or watching tv, begin to reduce the amount of time you spend doing it. If you're obsessed with a person, limit how often you contact the person. Cutting back on your obsession can help you become more independent and carefree.


For example, if you're limiting contact with a person, remember to include social media time when cutting back on contact. Avoid texting, messaging, sending photos, or calling often.

, When you're busy, it's easy to forget about what's bothering you. Preoccupy your mind so that you don't obsess. In addition to trying new things, you can also catch up on tasks you've been meaning to do, staying in touch with your support network, and taking time to focus on your needs.


You might find that much of your time had previously been spent obsessing. Think about things you've put on hold and finally do them. For example, you could get a haircut or meet up for a drink with friends who you've been putting off for a while.

, It's easy to make your obsession someone else's problem. But, instead of worrying over something that you believe to be someone else's fault, just own up to it. Taking responsibility will help you control your mindset. Only you have control over your thoughts and you can stop obsessing.


For example, if a colleague got a promotion you were up for, don't blame the colleague and obsess over it. Instead, take responsibility for the fact that your colleague was more qualified than you.

, If you obsess over something, regardless of whether it's a drug, video games, or a person, chances are your friends enable you to obsess. To stop obsessing, you should be in an environment where you don't feel like obsessing and the people around you don't bring it up. You might want to spend your free time in a different hang out spot and be around people that don't enable you, even if this means taking a break from certain friends.


Are all of your friends part of this culture? Then you may have to rely on family. Take this as an opportunity to renew your relationships with those you've fallen away from recently. You could rediscover people that you've been missing in your life.

, Obsessing over something or someone is stressful. Take a break from the anxiety and do something you find relaxing. You might soak in a bubble bath, practice deep breathing, or have a glass of wine while you read a book. The point is to do something you enjoy that also calms you.


If you're having trouble with obsessive thoughts while you relax, consider playing a recording of guided imagery or listen to an anxiety relief script."

It can also lower cortisol, a steroid hormone that your body releases when you become stressed.Even the ritual of brewing the tea and sipping it it slowly can help you unwind after a long day.Choose your favorite black tea and prepare it however you like (adding milk, sugar or lemon).


If your cortisol levels are normally high, you could develop a number of health issues caused by stress.Keep in mind that black tea contains caffeine, so if you're worried about it keeping you awake, you should limit your intake throughout the day.

, Although more research is needed, early studies indicate that chamomile extract can relieve stress in people with generalized anxiety disorder.For a relaxing cup of chamomile tea, place 1 heaping teaspoon of dried chamomile tea or flowers in your tea cup. Pour boiling water over the chamomile and let it steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain the tea and drink it slowly.The flavor of the tea will become stronger the longer it steeps.

Take deep breaths.,
Deconstruct anxious thoughts.,
Focus on the present moment.,
Use calming visualizations.,
Accept your thoughts are not reality.",How to Be Laid Back1," If you want to be more laid back, you need to learn how to cope with anxiety in the moment. If you struggle to stay calm under pressure, simply taking deep breaths can help you slow down, relax, and regroup.


Deep diaphragmatic breathing is a powerful means to reduce anxiety. Inhale through your nose, channeling your breath into your stomach. It can be helpful to place your hand on your stomach and make sure it rises when you take in air.Then, hold your breath for a count of four. Exhale through your mouth. While a fairly simple procedure, it's a good start to work towards a more laid back mindset.;
, Many times people who want to be more laid back suffer from chronic overthinking. If you're prone to anxious thoughts, take a second to deconstruct any negative thoughts you encounter. Pause when you're feeling anxious and ask yourself a series of questions.


What are you worrying about? Is this a realistic worry? Are the possible outcomes you're imagining likely to actually occur?Consider what, realistically, the worst possible outcome is. Is that outcome really insurmountable? Are there ways you could deal with this outcome that wouldn't be so bad?Is there any way you can prepare for what might happen? Is what you're seeing and believing actual truth or just your own perception?, Try to keep your thoughts in the present moment. People who are more laid back are able to occupy a single brain space at a time. When you start thinking ahead, and getting nervous or agitated, pause and try to return to the present.


It's perfectly okay to make plans and have to-do lists, but you should try to focus on one thing at a time. You might know you need to do the dishes after work, but try not to linger on the dreaded chore. Simply relax and do your job.
Mindfulness meditation is a form of meditation in which you focus on aspects of the present moment, such as your breath, your body's sensations, and your environment. Regularly practicing mindfulness meditation can help you stay in the present and feel more laid back overall. There are many free guided mindfulness meditation routines you can find online. These can help you get started with regular meditation., Calming visualizations can also help you unwind in the moment. Picture yourself relaxing in a place you enjoy. Maybe you're resting your feet in the sand on the beach. You could be lying in a hammock in the woods. Try to imagine with all your sensations. How does it feel, taste, smell, sound? Going on a mental vacation to a safe, relaxing environment can help you stay calm under stress., People who are laid back tend to avoid overthinking. Social interactions, plans, events, and other aspect of life are things they can maneuver with ease. If you're prone to overthinking, and convincing yourself something is wrong in any given situation, make an effort to change. Try to periodically remind yourself your thoughts are not necessarily a reflection of reality.


If you perceive something a certain way, you may start imagining your worldview or perspective represents truth. For example, say you made a comment at work you feel have rubbed a coworker the wrong way. You may go from wondering if you bothered your co-worker to imagining her sitting alone, thinking negative thoughts about you. This is not a particularly realistic scenario, but if you're anxiety-prone you may convince yourself your perception represents the reality.In such a scenario, remind yourself your thoughts are not reality. Your co-worker is probably not thinking poorly of you. Even if she was bothered by the comment, it's doubtful she is even still thinking about it. Your thoughts are, by nature, very centered around yourself and your own actions. Other people likely do not think about you as much as you think about yourself. Try to relax and remember this fact on occasion."

Let go of your fear of missing out.",How to Be Laid Back2," You may struggle to feel laid back if you're overcommitted. Prioritizing what truly matters to you can help you simplify your life. This will reduce stress and may result in you having a more relaxed, laid back approach to life.


Consider how you spend most of your time. Try writing a list of everything you do during the course of a day and roughly how much time that all takes up. How much time are you spending doing what you want? Compare that to how much time you spend on errands, events, and other tasks you feel you have to do.Is there anything you could stand to do less? Are there any events or activities you pack into your life that aren't particularly fulfilling or personally important to you?It's perfectly okay to work at a pace that seems comfortable and reasonable for you. You may think you have to put in overtime hours each week to make more money, but are you really getting to enjoy that money? Try to spend your time more wisely, giving yourself space to rest and relax., Many people who consider themselves high-strung or overstressed have trouble saying ""No."" It's important to remember that just because you can do something does not mean you have to do something. An important step to becoming laid back is accepting that it's okay to tell someone ""No.""


It's very difficult to be laid back if you have no time for yourself. Many people feel obligated to say yes when a friend asks a favor or when an organization needs volunteers. There's nothing wrong with wanting to help out, but before agreeing to something pause and ask yourself if you really have time. If you're already suffer from a lack of downtime, sometimes it's okay to give yourself some needed rest and relaxation.You'll actually find it's easier to accomplish things if you commit yourself to less. Needlessly packing your schedule means your energy will be spread out across 10 different tasks. Instead, pick one or two tasks to focus on and do a really good job. The pressure to be perceived as successful often translates to feeling a need to be busy. Business does not equate success.For example, say your friend is going away with her boyfriend for the weekend. She asks you if you could stop in twice a day to feed her cat from Friday to Monday. You could do it, but it would mean sacrificing much of your own weekend as your friend lives across town. You have a fairly stressful job and weekends are important to you as it's a chance to unwind. Do not feel guilty about telling your friend ""No."" While you technically could look after her cat, you should not feel obligated to do so simply because you can. It's important for you to have time for yourself, to relax, rest, and have downtime. No one can truly be laid back if they're busy all the time.

, People who are laid back tend to be able to relax and unwind easily. However, when caught up in daily obligations and stress people often struggle to find pleasure and levity. If you open yourself up to embracing small pleasures, you'll find yourself feeling more laid back throughout the day.Try to count the simple pleasures you encounter each day. Begin when you get up in the morning. Even something small can provide great joy. For example, really take a moment to enjoy the taste and smell of your morning coffee. Appreciate the great song that's playing on your iPod on your morning commute.
Take time to indulge in pleasures. You might not have time to treat yourself to a lavish dinner out, but maybe make yourself a cocktail when eating at home. If you want to go on a hike this weekend but have a work commitment, take a half hour stroll around your neighborhood instead. Embracing pleasure throughout the day can help you feel more laid back.

, Oftentimes, we pay a lot of attention to the lives of those around us on social media. This can lead to a fear of missing out. If you want to be more laid back, try to be content with yourself, your friends, your life, your job, and your own experiences.


Many people are online for the majority of their days. This fuels a lot of anxiety about missing out. If you're on your phone or your computer constantly, it's only natural you'll develop curiosity about what others are doing. Anxiety about missing out and comparing yourself with others is inevitable. This can lead to feeling high strung and feeling pressure to participate in certain social events or rituals.Make a conscious effort to disengage. This does not necessarily mean deleting your Facebook account and ditching your smart phone. Even short breaks from your phone or computer, about 10 minutes in length every few hours, can help reduce feelings of anxiety over missing out. Get off the computer every few hours and go for a walk with your phone turned off or in your pocket out of sight."

Stop being a perfectionist.,
Process your thoughts before reacting.,
Accept what you can and cannot control.,
Embrace downtime.,
Seek therapy, if necessary.",How to Be Laid Back3," Oftentimes, perfectionism is what makes feeling laid back difficult. If you're a perfectionist by nature, try to work against the tendency.


Periodically remind yourself no one expects you to be perfect. People will still like you if you make a mistake. Try to work to be less critical of yourself and avoid thinking of life in terms of either success or failure. Your accomplishments are not a reflection of your worth as a person and many perceives failures are only minor setbacks.Perfectionists often have a tendency to compare themselves to others, feeling that they're falling behind or that they have more flaws than others. If you catch yourself comparing yourself to another person, stop. It may be difficult at first so you might have to do something to distract yourself. Go for a walk, for example, or watch something on TV.Try to do a little less each day. This might feel awkward or uncomfortable at first, but you'll be taking a tremendous amount of pressure off yourself longterm. Start small. For example, cut 5 minutes off your daily run or take a little longer at lunch during work., When an event occurs, especially an event that's perceives as stressful, your first thought may be to react. This can lead to acting impulsively and saying or doing things that worsen the situation. Instead of reacting immediately to stress, pause to process. The vast majority of situations do not require an immediate responses. When you experience something stressful, give yourself a few hours to process before reacting. Do something relaxing, like reading a book or watching a movie, to take your mind off the stress before trying to deal with the situation., It can be very difficult to let go of what is beyond your own control. However, if you want to be laid back it's important to be able to live with life's frustrations. Try to make a conscious effort to recognize when a situation is beyond your control and accept the fact.


Focus precisely on what you're concerned about in the present moment. For example, say you're stressed because your brother is coming into town. He can sometimes be difficult to get along with and tends to pick fights with other family members.
From there, figure out what you can control in the situation. In regards to your brother's visit, you can choose to disengage if he tries to bait you into an argument. You can try to be polite, even if he's being difficult. You cannot, however, reasonably control or change another person's behavior. Therefore, try to let go of any frustrating comments or behavior your brother makes. As you have very little control over it, it's best not to linger., It's important to embrace downtime. Downtimes is a necessity in life, not a luxury. You can't be expected to be a laid back person if you're always on the go. Make time in your schedule to spend an hour each day doing something you find relaxing. You could take a bath before bed each night, read a short story after work, watch a movie you've never seen before, or call a long distance friend. If you work at actively embrace downtime, and accept your need for it, you'll feel more laid back in your day-to-day life.

, Some people struggle to feel laid back due to an underlying mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder or are depressed, it can be hard to cope on your own. If you consistently struggle to enjoy life's pleasures and can't let go of worrisome thoughts, make an appointment with a psychiatrist or counselor.


You can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist. You can also call your insurance company and ask for a list of mental health providers in your area.
If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your college or university.

Your jaws are clenched and your muscles tense.
Your head or stomach hurts.
Your heart starts racing.
You sweat (even the palms of your hands are sweaty).
Your face flushes.
Your body or your hands shake.
You get dizzy.;
, Anger is often accompanied by a flood of other emotions. After all, the amygdala, the center for emotions, is pumping out signals with all its might to meet a threat and ensure your survival. It isn’t surprising that you can get a flood of other related emotions. These emotions are capable of sounding the alarms for the fight and flight response. In addition to anger, some emotions you might feel include:


Irritation
Sadness
Depression
Guilt
Resentment
Anxiousness
Defensiveness

, If you feel yourself getting angry and are experiencing the symptoms of anger listed above, you can tell yourself that you don’t have to react right away. Counting can help you put off your feelings for the moment. It might feel a bit silly at first, but counting really can distract your long enough to calm down. Hold off on reacting and give yourself time to sort out your feelings.

, Try to get some space to yourself for a bit. If you can, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom, a stairwell, or outside while you do this, and this will help you feel comfortable deep breathing to calm down.Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.

, Try saying something calming to yourself, such as, “Calm down,” or “Relax,” or “Take it easy.” Repeat this phrase over and over until you feel your anger start to dissipate., If you feel your blood boil, get out. Take a walk. Breathe deeply. If you are able to remove yourself from the situation, do it. By not having the thing or person that makes you mad in front of you, you can more easily calm down.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is the process of tensing and relaxing your entire body in progressive stages. It is thought that by tensing your muscles yourself, you can release pent-up tension in your body. Here is an overview of this method:


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four. Keep breathing deeply.
Start with the muscles in your head and face. Tighten as many muscles as you can in your face, head, mouth, and neck, and hold for twenty seconds, then release.
Then work your way down the body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back (only if you don’t have back problems), hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Now wiggle your toes around, feeling the relaxation from your toes to your head.
Take a few more deep breaths, and enjoy the feeling of relaxation.

, If you can get yourself laughing, you can change the chemical reaction in your body. You can use your brain and imagination to create all sorts of ridiculous situations that can get you laughing, especially if it isn’t mean-spirited or sarcastic humor.


For instance, say you’re in a situation where your boss got mad at you about something. Instead of fuming about it at your desk, you can dissipate your own anger by imagining he has a fish head and he was yelling through his fish mouth. It is important, however, not to laugh or smirk if you're still in a conversation with your boss. This could make things worse.
You can even use this method if you lose your temper a lot. Using something to make you laugh will help you calm down for this moment. Then you can more effectively employ other methods, such as problem solving, to come up with a solution to the situation you’re facing.

, We might feel angry when we have a lack of control, whether it’s physical or emotional. These common occurrences all have the potential to raise ire in people:Physical discomforts: Feeling tired, hungry or in pain can make people angry and cranky.
Going through the grieving process: Anger is a part of the grieving process.
Dissatisfaction with your sex life, or your spouse is cheating on you.
Other people’s inconsiderate or rude behavior.
Dealing with addiction and withdrawal
Medical reasons such as hormone fluctuations and illnesses.
Having a mental disorder: Anger can be part of the symptoms for many disorders.
Being in an unjust situation, such as being under the regime of an oppressive government, or being subjected to discrimination.
Being subjected to abusive situations, such as being bullied or humiliated.
Stress from the daily grind, such as meeting deadlines, putting up with traffic, dealing with disappointing outcomes, or not meeting one’s goals or expectations.
Loss of money or income, such as getting robbed or having money problems.

, Rating your anger can help you realize what type of events make you angry and the degree they make you angry. Some events might cause mild irritation, while others might trigger you wanting to blow your top. You don’t really need an official anger scale. You can make your own, for instance, on a scale of one to ten, or zero to 100. You can use what works with you.Track how often your anger spikes by writing down your anger rating in a journal.

, An anger journal will help you keep track of what events anger you and the degree to which they anger you. You should also track the surrounding events and environments that preceded your anger or occurred during your anger. Take note of how you react when you’re angry, and the reactions of other people when you get angry.When you record in your journal, you can make the following observations:


What provoked the anger?
Rate your anger.
What thoughts occurred as you got angry?
How did you react? How did others react to you?
What was your mood right before it happened?
What symptoms of anger did you feel in your body?
Did you want to leave, or did you want to act out, such as bang the door or hit something or someone, or did you say something sarcastic?
What were your emotions immediately after the incident?
What were your feelings a few hours after the episode?
Was the episode resolved?
Keeping track of this information will help you learn what situations and triggers your anger. Then, you can avoid those situations when possible. Or, you can predict when these situations may occur if they are unavoidable.

, A trigger is something that happens or that you experience that brings on an emotion or a memory. Some common triggers for anger are:


Not being able to control other people’s actions.
Other people disappointing you for not meeting your expectations.
Not being able to control daily life events, such as traffic or things that get in the way of your progress.
Someone trying to manipulate you or take advantage of you.
Getting mad at yourself for a mistake.
Being hungry, tired or stressed.

, Following a plan will help you gain control over your anger at the moment. The key is to gain control of your body’s response first. Once you do this, you can work out what is bothering you and why. When you understand this, you can assertively express yourself to make sure you are expressing your anger in a productive way. It takes lots of practice and patience to deal with your feelings in a new, constructive way.


Have a specific set of actions in mind for when you feel angry. For example, once you recognize that you are feeling angry, step outside for five minutes. Take some deep breaths and repeat a calming phrase to yourself. This process will help you defuse your anger.

, When a person is angry, he may tend to think, “Everything’s ruined,” or “I’ll never be able to do that.” This type of thinking reduces things to an all-or-nothing scenario because the person thinks that the problem is the end of the world. Avoid words and phrases that put situations in absolute terms. Stop framing things with “always” or “never.”Instead, think to yourself: “This situation is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world.”

, Oftentimes, you can avoid angry outbursts by avoiding the situation that makes you angry. For example, if you know that you get angry at the morning traffic, try to leave at a different time, or take public transit. If you know you get angry because you skipped lunch, be diligent about eating properly.

, When you harbor resentment against someone, your anger will only continue and become hard to control. Accept others for who they are. Focus on how you handle a situation, rather than how someone else handles it. Letting go of grudges will help you refocus your energy on more positive things., Exercise can help dissipate anger. For adults and children, research shows that exercise helps with mood regulation and controlling emotions. Try exercising when you’re in a mad moment, or use it daily to release aggression.

, Getting a good night’s sleep helps people regulate their emotions. Emotions are harder to control when we don’t get enough sleep. One study showed that with only a few nights of disrupted sleep for teenage girls, their negative feelings increased as well as their anger.


If you are having trouble sleeping on a consistent basis, you should see your doctor.

, Meditation has been shown to be effective in emotional regulation. It has a longer lasting effect on the amygdala, the center for emotion and the part of the brain where the stress response begins after a stressful or threatening event has been perceived. Start with deep breathing. You can also combine breathing with visualization tasks. Try this visualization exercise:


When you breathe in, envision a golden-white light that relaxes you and makes you feel happy. Envision this white light spreading into your lungs and throughout your entire body. When you breathe out, breathe out muddy, dark colors which represent your angry, stressed out feelings.
If you feel like you have trouble meditating, don’t worry. Meditation is a combination of deep breathing exercises, visualization, and performing mental tasks. But if you feel like it’s difficult for you to sit long enough to meditate, or if you feel uncomfortable meditating, you can just begin with simply deep breathing. This will still initiate your body’s calming response.

, When people try something new, it doesn’t always go perfectly.This can be true when you’re learning new ways to deal with anger. The best way to deal with relapses in exploding with anger or reacting passive-aggressively is to look at what didn’t work. It’s part of the learning process. When you are able to look at what didn’t work, you can adjust what you do for that anger trigger for the next time.


Most of all, hang in there! Be happy for your smallest accomplishments, because each one of them is a step towards accomplishing your bigger goal, which is dealing with anger.

, Assertive communication emphasizes that both people in a conversation have important needs. To communicate assertively, give the facts without making accusations. For example, you might say: “I was hurt and angry because it seems like you were belittling my project when you laughed during my presentation. I don’t know what was going on, but it seems like you weren’t paying attention or taking my hard work seriously. I could have just misunderstood what was going on. Can we talk and work this out?”

, Using please and thank you is not only polite, but it also shows respect for other people. Your communications should convey requests rather than demands. In order to get respect, you have to give it. Then you will foster cooperation and reciprocal respect. This is the opposite of what happens with anger, where aggressive, passive, or passive-aggressive communications puts others at odds with you.You can start your communications this way: “When you have the time, could you…” or “It would be a great help if you… Thanks, I appreciate it!”

, If you hem and haw and beat around the bush, or make general statements that are not specific, everyone involved will get frustrated. Instead, directly address the person you need to resolve your issue with. Make it clear what you would like to see happen. Be sure to put it in the form of a request.For instance, if your coworker is speaking very loudly on the phone and it’s difficult for you to do your work, you can state your request like this: “I have a request. Would you please lower the volume of your voice on the telephone? It’s making it very difficult to concentrate on my work. I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.”
If you had stated instead, “It’s really difficult to get my work done with all the noise in this office” to everyone in the room, it’s not specific. Moreover, it will most likely alienate all of your coworkers, and you probably won’t get your problem solved.

, When you figure out how you’re feeling, convey the real feeling, like hurt, and keep judgment statements out of it.For example, this is not an assertive way to express yourself: “I feel that you are an insensitive bore.” That is a judgment against another person (and not a very nice one at that).
Instead, stick to things that pertain to you: “I feel that you are not being sensitive to my feelings when you read your paper instead of listening to what I’m trying to say.”

, Once you are able to recognize your anger triggers, you can slow down your anger and address anger-provoking thoughts. Then you will be able to shift your focus to problem solving. With problem solving, you are doing everything in your power to address the problem, figure out your own feelings regarding the situation, and express your feelings in the most productive way possible.


For example, you might get angry because your child got bad grades on his report card. To avoid having an angry outburst at your child, you should try to problem-solve. This will help you process through the situation.
Work through your emotions by taking a few minutes to yourself, breathing deeply. As your head clears a bit, you can start thinking of solutions to this problem. You can strategize how you will talk to your child about his grades, emphasizing that you love him and support him. You can also think of solutions, such as getting him a tutor or enrolling him in a study skills class.
You might have to accept the fact that sometimes, there isn’t a solution to the problem at hand. This is okay, because not everything in life can be tied up in a package with a neat little bow. Life’s a lot messier than that. You can’t control life, but you can control how you react towards it.

, Fortunately, anger management programs have been shown to have a high rate of success. The most successful programs help you understand your anger, give you short-term strategies to deal with your anger, and help you build skills.There are a wide variety of options for anger management programs.For example, there are anger management programs available for teens, executives, police officers, and other populations of people who might be experiencing different types of anger for different reasons.

, Therapy is a great way to find new ways of dealing and expressing anger. You can take your anger journal, for instance, and bring it to therapy with you.Your therapist will most likely use relaxation techniques to help you calm down in the middle of an anger episode. Your therapist will also help you deal with the thoughts that can trigger anger and find new ways to view your situations. Therapists will also help you with emotional coping skills and assertiveness communication training.
You may choose to see a psychotherapist who specializes in a person’s history to resolve problems today, such as overcoming an abusive or neglectful childhood, or overcoming a tragic event. This can be very helpful in dealing with anger from past events.
Find a therapist in your area by using the American Psychological Association’s Psychologist Locator.

, Anger is often part of a different disorder, such as bipolar disorder, depression, or anxiety. Drug therapy for anger will depend on the condition with which the anger is occurring. Taking the medications for the disorder could help the anger as well.For example, if the anger is occurring with depression, anger could be treated along with other depression symptoms with antidepressants. If irritability is occurring as a part of generalized anxiety disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Lexapro or Prozac might be used to treat the disorder. In the meantime, these drugs can help with your irritability.
Each drug has side effects. For example, lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder. It has a very high rate of renal (kidney) complications. Being aware of the possible side effects will help you monitor for complications. It’s very important to discuss these possibilities openly with your doctor.
Be sure to talk about any addiction problems you have with your doctor. The last thing you need when you are struggling with alcohol, for instance, is to add another addiction. This should be discussed candidly with your doctor to help her decide the best medication to treat your anger and any other symptoms you might be having.

Think about why you act mean.,
Realize that your thoughts, feelings, and actions are connected.,
Gain control of your emotions before you speak.,
Keep a “be nice” journal.,
Cultivate a sense of humor.,
Sleep well at night.,
Meditate before potentially stressful events or conversations.",How to Stop Being Mean to People1," Many people are mean to others in order to feel better about themselves.However, this approach may not really be effective, especially if you want to be nicer to others. You might lash out at someone, feel better in the moment, but then feel bad about yourself later for lashing out. Other reasons that you are being mean may include: You cannot handle your own negative emotions, so you lash out at others.
Your ego feels threatened, so you are mean as a form of defense.
You envy someone else’s life or accomplishments, so you want to hurt her. You are projecting your own negative feelings about yourself on someone else.
You are trying to make yourself feel unique and distinct from other people by distinguishing differences between you in a mean way.;
, It can be difficult to determine what is a thought and what is a feeling. In fact, the two interrelate: your thoughts affect your feelings. Your feelings, in turn, affect your actions. Thus, if you want to change your actions (or words), you can start by first changing your thoughts.For example, if you think, “this guy is an idiot!” you may feel frustrated talking to him, and that will come across in your words and actions. If, however, you think “this person needs to learn more about the topic,” you might be more inclined to teach him, and your increased patience will come through your words.
Remember that even when you feel that you cannot control your thoughts or feelings, you can always choose how to act. Each time you speak or act, you are making a choice about what words and actions you use., If you are speaking to someone and feel as though you are about to be mean to them, give yourself time to think before you respond. You’re more likely to give the person a productive response (and less likely to be mean) if you allow yourself to use reason first. If you are feeling particularly angry, resentful, hurt, or sad, you may want to wait to talk to others. These emotions can stand in the way of positive communication and cause you to lash out at someone else.

, Write entries about how you interacted with people throughout the day. If you had incidents in which you were mean, try to recall details about who you were mean to, why you think you were mean, what you said, and what events led up to the incident. If you were able to be nice to others, particularly in situations in which your tendency would normally be to be mean, then reward yourself for “good behavior.” Building a cache of journal entries about your meanness can help you identify whether there are people, events, or environments that seem to “trigger” your tendency to act mean. Identifying your triggers gives you the opportunity to work towards improving in those situations in the future.

, Being able to laugh easily (with people, not at people), can help humor override your tendencies to be mean. If you are beginning to feel impatient and think you might be mean to someone, try to find a reason to laugh. Finding humor in a situation or getting yourself laughing about something else can diffuse the situation by actually changing your body’s chemical reaction from anger or negativity to humor., You need to get plenty of sleep (at least 7-8 hours) every night to thrive.Being sleep deprived can contribute to a wide range of health problems, including the inability to manage emotions properly. Getting adequate sleep can help you have the patience and understanding to be nice to others regardless of your emotional state.


If you have chronic sleep problems, consult your physician or a pharmacist about safe sleep aids. Alternately, making dietary changes, such as reducing caffeine and sugar consumption, or lifestyle changes, such as reducing nighttime screen time, may enable you to sleep better at night.

, Meditation can help you regulate your emotions, which can help you be nicer. If you are feeling as though you might be unkind to someone due to feeling angry or impatient, give yourself a little mental refresher through meditation. Find a private, quiet place, then follow the following sequence: Breathe deeply and slowly. Deep breaths can slow your heart rate and make you feel calmer. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends outwards on the “in” breath.
Picture a golden-white light filling your body as you breathe in. Picture that light filling and relaxing your mind. When you breathe out, visualize dark, muddy colors leaving your body.
Once you are calm from your meditation, you should feel more ready to speak to others in a kind way.

,How to Control Anger1,
"
Understand anger.,
Identify the problem.Figure out what, specifically, you feel hurt over.,
Let yourself grieve.,
Temporarily avoid the person who hurt you.,
Scream.,
Metaphorically throw your anger away.,
Replace resentment with compassion.,
Determine if reconciliation is an option.,
Forgive.,
Take responsibility for your own actions.,
Look for the positive.,
Leave a positive influence on the world.,
Write a letter or a journal.,
Exercise or take up a hobby.,
Turn to your faith or meditate.,
Avoid social functions as necessary.",How to Let Go of Anger," It's important to learn how to let go of your anger, not just for your psychological health, but also for your physical health. Part of letting go of anger involves forgiveness, and forgiveness can have a deterrent effect, making it less likely for people to hurt you again in the future.When someone betrays or hurts you, it can have a negative effect on your health through increased anxiety and stress. This can negatively impact your cardiac,immune, and nervous systems.;
, Only in identifying the loss or underlying problem can you begin to confront that issue and let go of it. It's also important to understand whether the other person knows that she has hurt you. This will impact how you begin reconciling.For instance, if a spouse cheated on you or left you, you would understandably feel angry. The sense of loss you feel likely stems from the loss of being loved and being appreciated or respected. Furthermore, your spouse likely understands the way that she has hurt you.
Alternatively, if a friend has an extra ticket to a concert and does not invite you, you may feel a loss of friendship and camaraderie that drives you to sorrow and anger. However, your friend may be unaware that your feelings were hurt.

, Interpersonal conflict and resolution can be thought of as a grieving process. For example, when someone hurts you, it can feel as though you have lost that person. The stages of grief are helpful for understanding your emotions after you are hurt. They can also help you understand how your anger is a part of the grieving process and therefore, can help you let go of your anger.If the hurt has to do with a breakup or other type of indefinite separation, then that loss may seem permanent. If the hurt has to do with being overlooked, forgotten, or otherwise disrespected then it can seem as though you lost that person temporarily by losing their attention or respect.

, Anger can get out of control when tension escalates between you and the person who hurt you.Wait to interact until you've processed your grief and moved on to a more accepting stage.


It's important that the other person move on the grieving process as well, so that anger is not directed at you when you interact. Even if the other person is the one that hurt you, she can still feel a sense of loss and regret.

, There are times when a person feels so angry that he or she feels the desire to scream. If you are facing this sort of anger right now, pause your reading and go scream into a pillow. Screaming offers you a physical release. Studies have shown that crying it out can release toxins that are built up by stress.As a word of caution, you should try to make sure that your scream is well-muffled by the sound of your pillow to avoid worrying any neighbors.

, If there are a lot of details about a given situation that make you upset, you can find something symbolic to represent these components of your anger before throwing those symbolic elements away. For example,


You can collect stones alongside a river and throw them into the water after you have assigned a component of your anger to each one., Another way to put this would be to “walk in the other person's shoes.” Consider the reasons the offending party may have had for acting in a hurtful way. You might never completely understand another's motivations, nor may you agree with them upon identifying them, but it is easier to let go of anger towards someone after you spend a little time in her head.If possible, remind yourself that the other person didn't realize she was hurting you. If she did consciously hurt you, think about what led her to do so.

, Understand that forgiveness does not automatically lead to reconciliation. If you suspect that the party responsible for triggering your anger feels remorseful and wants to make amends, reconciliation might work out.On the other hand, if the other party is not open to setting things right, or if the nature of the pain is such that you can never trust the other person again, reconciliation might not seem like an option.

, Recognize that you alone can forgive. Completely letting go of anger means forgiving the person who has hurt you. However, forgiveness is not for everyone at all times.Forced or feigned forgiveness is of little benefit to anyone, least of all yourself. It's important to thoroughly process your hurt, control your anger, and decide if/when forgiveness is right for you.


Understand that forgiving someone may not prompt the other person to change her behavior. The purpose of forgiveness, in this sense, is to cleanse yourself of the anger and resentment building inside you. Forgiveness is for your own benefit and is an internal necessity, not an external one.

, There can be a lot of blame during the anger stage.It's important reflect on your own role in the situation and accept responsibility for whatever role you played. This doesn't mean that you can't acknowledge the poor treatment given to you by the other party. It simply means that if you did wrong, you should be honest about it, especially if you ever plan to reconcile.


Accepting responsibility can start with eliminating negative emotions. One way to do this is to make a list of the 3 to 5 strongest negative emotions you feel, and think about how to substitute the negative emotion for a good one.

, Examine any ways that your pain has helped you to grow as an individual. Look for benefits or unexpected positives and cling to them to help you cope. If you can't look at the good brought about from a hurtful situation, then look at other positives in your life and other things you can be thankful for.Consider if your pain has put you onto a new path leading to good things that you may not have experienced had you missed that path completely.

, You can let your anger spill out and affect those around you, but then you would only be spreading it and making those negative feelings stronger. By consciously deciding to spread a positive influence to others, you can transform the way you handle social interactions in a way that leads to less anger.Surround yourself with positive people. Simply put, by exposing yourself to the optimism and positive thoughts expressed by other people, you introduce positive thinking back into your own life. As time progresses, you may even start to develop positive thoughts of your own to replace your anger.

, If you keep a diary or journal, write about your anger as often as necessary to help you release it. If you do not have a journal, you can write an angry letter to the person who triggered your anger to get the feelings off your chest. Do not actually send the letter, though.


Sending the letter is almost always a bad idea. It can easily be viewed as retaliation or be poorly received, which could escalate problems.Even if you phrase it as politely as possible, the other party is likely to take it poorly, especially if she is suffering from low self-esteem or other personal pain.

, Exercise provides you with a positive physical release for your anger. Choose a form of exercise that you enjoy. Take a walk in a scenic park, go for a refreshing swim, or shoot some hoops. The key is to take the energy you feel that could be channeled into anger and channel it into something more positive for yourself.If you are not a big fan of exercise, you can start small by taking more walks, channeling your energy into picking up a new hobby, or doing something nice for your friends or family., If you believe in God, pray for the strength and willingness to let go of your anger. When letting go of anger seems out of your ability to handle, petitioning for divine help can help soften your heart enough to let you release that anger for good. Whether you believe in any particular faith or not, meditation is a good way to stabilize your body, mind, and soul. There are many types of meditation you can try, so choose which is best for you and your needs.


Consult with a religious leader at your center of worship or others who share your faith for support and guidance. Read from your faith's scriptural texts, or read spiritual books written on the matter of anger and forgiveness.

, If someone who makes you angry will be at a social engagement and you want to avoid the temptation of getting into an argument or stirring up old feelings of resentment, there is nothing wrong with skipping that social event, even if others do not entirely understand why.


At the same time, you should also avoid letting the person who makes you angry ruin your life. If the two of you share most of your friends, go out of your way to schedule time with your friends away from the offender's company.

Realize that meanness comes from within.,
Develop empathy.,
Visualize a role model.,
Smile at people.,
Use positive body language.,
Use assertive expression of your feelings when necessary.",How to Stop Being Mean to People2," Most people act mean towards others when they themselves feel threatened, demeaned, or bullied. Realizing that when you act mean, it’s really your issue and not someone else’s can help you determine whether your mean words or behavior are appropriate in the situation., Empathy can help you make being kind to others a priority.Empathy can take the form of understanding another’s perspective, feeling distress at the plight of another person, and being able to relate to the emotions of another.Whichever approach you take, be sure that you focus on understanding and relating to the people that you are speaking to.

, Find someone whose words and actions inspire you and imagine how she would act or what she would say in a given situation. Then try to emulate that type of communication yourself., Smiling at people can make you seem nicer. People will likely smile back at you, and you may find that you cultivate friendships more easily. Smiling can also help you feel happier. Acting happy with good posture and a big smile can actually boost your mood; your thoughts and feelings respond to the action of smiling., Communication is not all about words. Your words can be completely polite while your body language or actions are communicating negativity to others. Negative feelings towards others may be present in your body and send a signal to others that you are unpleasant.


To have more neutral body language, you may want to try using progressive muscle relaxation—a process by which you tense and then release all of the muscles in your body. This can remove negativity or stress from your body as well as your mind. , Rather than expressing yourself passively (being angry without saying anything) or aggressively (exploding in a way that may seem disproportionate to the situation), try assertive communication. To practice assertive expression, use the facts involved (not exaggerated by emotion) to communicate requests (rather than demands) of others in a respectful way. Communicate clearly and express your feelings effectively so that everyone’s needs are met.


For example, if your tendency would be to yell at your spouse for not folding your laundry the way you like, you could try assertive expression instead. You might say, “I appreciate your helping me by doing laundry, but it frustrates me that you fold my pants in a way that causes them to wrinkle. I feel unprofessional while wearing wrinkled pants at work. I would really appreciate it if you would fold them more carefully, or if you would just let me wash and fold my own laundry.”

Do something you enjoy.,
Give yourself time alone.,
Read a book or watch a favorite television show.,
Exercise.,
Eat a healthy meal or snack.,
Socialize with a friend.",How to Stop Being Mean to People3," Taking care of yourself by indulging in activities that make you happy can help you be nicer to others as well.Doing something you enjoy can improve your mood by distracting you from a bad mood.If you can control your mood, you’re more likely to make reasoned decisions (not emotional decisions) about how to communicate with others.

, Particularly if you are an introvert,you may need to make time alone with yourself from time to time. This can help you be nicer to others because you will feel more refreshed. This can be of particular benefit if your loved ones are the recipients of your mean behavior; taking a break from them may help you be nicer to them., Studies have shown that having vicarious experiences through others (which happens with both reading and watching well-known characters on a favorite TV show) can make you feel happier.People also experience catharsis, or a second-hand release of emotions, by experiencing events through fictional characters. Releasing emotions in a controlled environment in that way can help you control your emotions in real life.

, There is a strong connection between moderate exercise and improved mood.Regular exercise can also help you regulate your emotions in general. All of this can help lead to you feeling happier, which can help you be nicer to others. \


Consider practicing yoga. It combines physicality and mindfulness, so it has the benefits of both exercise and meditation. If you can’t get to a yoga studio, try streaming an internet yoga video or downloading a yoga application to your mobile device.If you are feeling whimsical, you might try dancing to feel better. Dancing both gives you a bit of an exercise boost and activates the pleasure centers of your brain.You may find that getting daily exercise gives you more overall energy, which can help you be productive and patient without getting irritated with other people.

, Being hungry can make you feel irritable, which can lead you to lash out at others. Eating a nutritious diet full of whole foods can make you feel healthier and happier.


Include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and protein in your diet.Getting healthy fats can also make you feel full longer.
Avoid fat-free and overly processed foods. These often lack adequate nutrition and may leave you feeling dissatisfied. Anti-inflammatory foods and those containing Omega-3 fatty acids may particularly contribute to your feeling happier.Some specific foods that fall into this category include leafy greens, avocado, asparagus, walnuts, dark chocolate, and green tea., You may be venting your frustrations on others because you feel isolated.Spending time with friends in person can be a great way to improve your mood if you are feeling disconnected from others. Go to an early or late lunch, happy hour at your favorite bar, or dinner. If eating out isn’t in your budget, go for a walk with them or visit your local park and sit on the swings and talk.


If you’re unable to get together in person, talking on the phone and having a 2-way conversation (particularly with a funny friend!) can improve your mood quickly.

Watch for physiological signs of anger.,
Take inventory of your emotions.,
Accept that anger can be a normal, healthy emotion.,
Watch for signs that your anger is out of control.",How to Control Anger2," Anger is certainly a psychological emotion, but it is also physiological, involving chemical reactions in your brain. When you get angry, your amygdala, the center for emotional processing, sends a distress signal to your hypothalamus, which sends epinephrine along your autonomic nervous system through the path of the sympathetic nervous system to the adrenal glands, which starts pumping epinephrine (adrenaline) throughout your body. The adrenaline gets your body ready to meet a threat, increasing your heart rate and sharpening your senses. This process serves a biological purpose (preparing you for fight or flight), but if you have an anger problem, your threshold for what triggers this physiological response may be too low (for example, if you get angry at a coworker for playing music too loudly).

, Anger often masks another emotion; many times, anger is a secondary emotion to hurt, sadness, grief, depression, or fear.Anger emerges as almost a defense mechanism because it is easier for many people to deal with than the other emotions. Think about whether you allow yourself to feel a wide range of emotions or if you may be suppressing emotions that you think you “shouldn’t” feel.


If you commonly substitute anger for other emotions that you find more difficult to deal with, consider seeing a therapist to learn to handle and accept those emotions.

, Anger is not always a bad thing. Anger can serve a healthy purpose by protecting you against continued abuse or wrongdoing. If you perceive that someone is harming you, you will likely become angry, and that anger will prompt you to confront the person or end the harm in another way.


Some people are taught that it is impolite to feel or express anger. But suppressing natural feelings of anger can have negative effects on your emotions and your relationships with others.

, While anger can be healthy, it can also be unhealthy. You may need to deal with an anger problem through self-help or professional help if the following are true:


Insignificant occurrences make you very angry, such as spilled milk and accidentally dropping an object.
When you’re angry, you display aggressive behaviors, including yelling, screaming, or hitting.
The problem is chronic; it happens over and over again.
You have an addiction, and when you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, your temper gets worse and your behavior more violent.

"
"
Engage in physical activity.,
Get enough sleep at night.,
Keep an anger journal.,
Put together an anger management plan.,
Practice assertive expression of your anger.People using assertive expression of anger acknowledge the needs of both parties involved in a disagreement.,
Find a local anger management program.,
See a mental health professional.",How to Control Anger3," The endorphins that come from exercise can help you calm down, and moving your body provides a physical outlet for your rage: in this way, exercise can help in the moment of anger. However, maintaining a regular exercise schedule can also help you regulate your emotions in general. While you exercise, focus on thinking about the exercise and your body, not what has been on your mind lately. Some forms of exercise that might appeal to you and help you control your anger include:


Running/Jogging
Weight training
Cycling
Yoga
Basketball
Martial arts
Swimming
Dance
Boxing
Meditating

, Most adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to thrive.Being sleep deprived can contribute to a wide range of health problems, including the inability to manage emotions properly. Getting adequate sleep can improve your mood and lessen your anger.


If you have chronic sleep problems, consult your physician. You may be able to make dietary or lifestyle changes to improve your sleep. You may also be able to try herbal or medicinal supplements to sleep more.

, Begin writing down details about your anger. If you have an episode or event in which you lost control of your emotions, write it down. Be sure to include exactly how you felt, what caused you to be angry, where you were, who you were with, how you reacted, and how you felt afterwards.After you have kept your journal for a while, you should begin to look for commonalities among entries to identify the people, places, or things that trigger your anger.


A sample journal entry may look like this: Today, I became very angry at a coworker. He called me selfish for not offering to pick up lunch for everyone. We were in the lounge area, and I was taking a break from a stressful day by eating a cheeseburger from the restaurant next door. I got really angry and yelled back at him, called him a name and stormed off. I punched the desk when I got back to my office. Then I felt guilty and ashamed and hid in my office the rest of the day.
Over time, you may evaluate your journal and find that being called a name (such as selfish) is a trigger for your anger.

, Once you begin to identify triggers to your anger, you can make a plan for dealing with those triggers. Using the strategies for controlling anger listed in Part 1 can help, along with scripting an if-then response ahead of time.


For example, you may know that you are going to visit your mother-in-law, who makes disparaging remarks about your parenting style. You could decide ahead of time, “if she makes a comment about my parenting, I will calmly tell her that I appreciate her input, but I am going to make decisions about the way that I parent regardless of how she feels about those opinions.” You may also decide that you will leave the room or even pack up and go home if you feel that your anger is growing.

, To practice assertive expression, you should stick to the facts involved (not exaggerated by emotion), communicate requests (rather than demands) in a respectful way, communicate clearly, and express your feelings effectively.


This approach differs from passive expression, which involves being angry without saying anything, and aggressive expression, which generally manifests as an explosion or outburst that generally seems disproportionate to the problem. For example, if you are angered by a coworker playing music loudly every day while you are trying to work, you could say, “I understand that you enjoy listening to music while you are working, but the music makes it difficult for me to focus on my work. I would like to request that you use headphones instead of playing the music aloud so that it is not a distraction to your coworkers and so that we can all have a pleasant work environment.”

, Anger management programs can help you learn to deal with anger and control your emotions healthily. Attending a group class can help you feel as though you are not alone in your situation, and many people find that peer groups are as helpful as individual therapy for some kinds of problems.


To find an anger management program that is right for you, try searching online for “anger management class” plus the name of your city, state, or region. You can also include search terms like “for teens” or “for PTSD” to find a group tailored to your specific situation.
You can also look for appropriate programs by asking your physician or therapist, or consulting the self-improvement course offerings at your local community center.

, If your anger has progressed to the point that it's interfering with your day-to-day life or your ability to maintain positive relationships, see a therapist. He or she can assess the root of your problem and whether or not you require therapy, medication, or some combination of both. A therapist can give you relaxation techniques to use in situations that make you feel angry. She can help you develop emotional coping skills and communication training. You can search for a therapist specializing in anger management in North America here and in the United Kingdom here.

Take a break as soon as you recognize that you're angry.,
Let yourself feel angry.,
Breathe deeply.,
Visualize a ""happy place."",
Practice positive self-talk.,
Ask for the support of someone you trust.,
Try to see some humor in what angered you.",How to Control Anger4," You can take a break by stopping what you're doing, getting away from whatever is irritating you, and/or just taking a breather. Getting away from whatever is upsetting you will make it infinitely easier to calm down.


Remember that you do not have to respond to a situation immediately. You can count to 10 or even say “I will think about it and get back to you” to give yourself additional time to cool down as necessary.If you're angry at work, go to a room or step outside for a moment. If you're driving to work, consider sitting in your car so that you're in a space you own.
If you're upset at home, go to a single-occupancy space (such as the bathroom) or for a walk or go for a walk with someone you trust or that can help you.

, It is perfectly normal to experience emotions such as anger. Allowing yourself a little time and space to feel angry may help you accept the anger and move on. Once you move on, you can stop returning to the anger and reliving the reason that you were angry.To allow yourself to experience your anger, think about locating it in your body. Do you feel anger in your stomach? In your clenched fists? Find your anger, let it be, then let it go.

, If your heart hammers with rage, slow it down by controlling your breathing. Deep breathing is one of the most important steps in meditation, which can contribute to controlling emotions. Even if you do not fully “meditate,” using deep breathing techniques can offer similar benefits. Count to three as you inhale, hold the breath in your lungs for three more seconds, and count to three again as you exhale. Focus only on the numbers as you do this.
Be sure that each breath in fully fills your lungs, causing your chest and belly to expand. Exhale fully each time, and pause between the exhale and the next inhale.
Keep breathing until you feel that you have regained control.

, If you're still having a difficult time calming down, imagine yourself in a scene you find incredibly relaxing. It could be your childhood backyard, a quiet forest, a solitary island or even in an imaginary land - any place that makes you feel at home and peaceful. Focus on imagining every detail of this place: the light, the noises, the temperature, the weather, the smells. Keep dwelling on your happy place until you feel completely immersed in it, and hang out there for a few minutes or until you feel calm.

, Changing the way that you think about something from negative to positive (known as “cognitive restructuring”) can help you deal with your anger in a healthy way. After you have given yourself a moment to calm down, ""discuss"" the situation with yourself in positive and relieving terms.


For example, if you experience road rage, you could try turning from “That idiot almost killed me! I want to kill him too!” to ""That guy almost sideswiped me, but maybe he was experiencing an emergency and I'll probably never have to see him again. I feel lucky that I'm alive and my car is unscratched. I'm fortunate that I can still drive, and I can continue to be calm and focused when I get back on the road.""

, Sometimes sharing your concerns with a close friend or confidant might help you vent your anger. Clearly express what you want from the other person. If you just want a sounding board, state at the beginning that you don't want help or advice, just sympathy. If you're looking for a solution, let the other person know.


Set a time limit. Give yourself a set amount of time to vent about what's upsetting you, and stick to it - when time is up, your rant is over. This will help you move on instead of dwelling on the situation endlessly.

, After you've calmed down and established that you're ready to get over the incident, try to see the lighter side. Casting the incident in a humorous light can actually change the chemical response in your body from anger to humor. For example, if someone runs you off the road in your car, you might think about how silly it is that they might get where they are going 15 seconds faster by not yielding to you. You can have a good chuckle about how their priorities are out of order and move on with your life.

For many people, a short temper results in a “fight” response due to a chemical and hormonal response in the brain. , Many people show signs of anger in their bodies, even before they realize that they are feeling anger. You may be heading towards an outburst of anger if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms: Tense muscles and clenched jaw
Headache or stomachache
Increased heart rate
Sudden sweating or shaking
A dizzy feeling

, In addition to physical reaction to anger, you will likely begin to experience emotional symptoms before losing your temper. Some emotions that often flare up alongside anger are:


Irritation
Sadness or depression
Guilt
Resentment
Anxiety
Defensiveness

, Monitoring your outbursts of temper or thinking about what usually sets you off can help you identify your temper triggers.A trigger is something that happens that makes you have an automatic reaction. Triggers are usually tied to past emotions or memories (even if you aren’t consciously aware of them). Some common triggers for anger include: Feeling out of control of your own life, another person’s actions, or your environment or situation
Believing that someone is trying to manipulate you
Getting mad at yourself for making a mistake

, If you are aware of specific circumstances that are likely to trigger your temper, do your best to avoid them. You may particularly need to focus on avoidance if you have other factors that may contribute to a shorter temper such as a lack of sleep, another emotionally-straining event, or increased life or job stress.


For example, if getting yelled at by your boss is a trigger for your anger, you could avoid the trigger by removing yourself from the situation or asking for a moment to yourself.You can also ask your boss to speak to you more calmly in the future.

, If you are aware of the emotion or memory that is tied to one of your triggers, try to restructure the memory to lessen the effect of the trigger. For example, you may know that your boss yelling at you is a trigger because you were verbally abused as a child, try disassociating the two kinds of yelling. Convincing yourself that your childhood yelling was different because it only happened in a living room may help you separate it from yelling that you experience in the workplace.

, If you feel that the symptoms of your anger are escalating, and you seem to be moving from mildly irritated to really angry, remove yourself from the situation if at all possible. If you can remove yourself to be alone, you can use strategies to reduce or redirect your feelings of anger and avoid an outburst. , Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing your body in progressive stages. Consciously tensing your own muscles can help you redirect the outlet of the anger you’re feeling. To practice progressive muscle relaxation, take a few deep breaths, then do the following: Begin with your face and head muscles. Hold the tension for 20 seconds, then release it.
Work your way down your body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back, hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Take deep breaths, feeling relaxation from your toes all the way up to your head.

, If you know that you have become angry and feel that you are about to lose your temper, give yourself the gift of time. Remind yourself that you do not have to respond or react immediately. Leave the situation, think about a reasoned response, then react later, when the anger has subsided. If you cannot physically leave, you can still give yourself a delay by stopping to count to 10 (or 20, or 50, or 100) before you respond.

, If you begin to lose your temper, change to a new location. If you are inside, go outside for a walk if possible. The combination of leaving the person or situation causing your anger and “shocking” your senses with an entirely new environment can help you regain control. , Because anger is, in part, a chemical reaction, if you can change the chemicals in your body, you can circumvent a temper outbreak. Trying to find humor in a situation, or getting yourself laughing about something else, will diffuse the situation by changing your body’s chemical reaction. For example, if you find that your children have dumped a bag of flour over your entire kitchen, your initial reaction may be anger. However, if you stop and try to look at the situation objectively (perhaps pretending that it is someone else’s kitchen!), you may be able to laugh about it instead. Having a good laugh and then rallying the troops to help you clean up the mess can turn a negative situation into a funny memory.

, Meditation can help you regulate your emotions. Therefore, if you are feeling as though you are going to lose control of your temper, give yourself a little mental vacation through meditation. Remove yourself from the situation causing the anger: go outside, to a stairwell, or even to the bathroom. Take slow, deep breaths. Maintaining this breathing will likely bring down your elevated heart rate. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends on the “in” breath.
Visualize a golden-white light filling your body as you breathe in, relaxing your mind. When you breathe out, visualize muddy or dark colors leaving your body.
Once you are calm from your meditation, think about your emotions and decide how to deal with the situation that angered you.

, Tempers can be heightened (and fuses shorter) if you are lacking sleep or exercise. Sleep can help you regulate your emotions effectively.Exercising when you feel angry can help you redirect your anger. Maintaining regular exercise can help you with mood regulation and controlling your emotions. , Cognitive restructuring helps you replace automatic negative thoughts with more functional or appropriate ways of thinking. Anger may distort your thoughts, but learning to apply reason to your thoughts can make them clear again and can help you avoid losing your temper. For example, you may get a flat tire on your way to work. Your automatic negative thinking caused by anger may lead you to think “My whole day is ruined! I am going to get in trouble at work! Why does this kind of thing always happen to me?!”
If you restructure your thinking to take a reasoned look at your comments, you may realize that one setback does not automatically ruin your whole day, that your workplace may understand that things like that happen, and that it’s unlikely that this “always” happens to you (unless you get a flat tire daily, in which case you may want to reevaluate your driving).
It also may help to realize that anger at the situation will not help any; in fact, it could hurt by making it more difficult to focus on finding a solution (such as changing the tire).

, Anger management programs have been proven to be highly successful. Effective programs help you understand anger, develop short-term strategies to deal with anger, and build your emotional control skills. There are many options available for finding a program that is right for you. Individual programs are available for teens, police officers, executives, and other groups of the population that may experience anger for different reasons.
To find an anger management program that is right for you, try searching online for “anger management class” plus the name of your city, state, or region. You can also include search terms like “for teens” or “for PTSD” to find a group tailored to your specific situation.
You can also look for appropriate programs by asking your physician or therapist, or by consulting the self-improvement course offerings at your local community center.

, Ultimately, the best way to control your temper is to identify and treat the root of your anger problems. The best way to do this is in a therapist’s office. A therapist can give you relaxation techniques to use in situations that make you feel angry. She can help you develop emotional coping skills and communication training. Additionally, a psychoanalyst who specializes in helping resolve problems from someone’s past (such as neglect or abuse from childhood) can help mitigate anger tied to past events.

Allow people to make mistakes.,
Surround yourself with positive people.,
Forgive.",How to Get Over Resentment," Be honest with yourself in confronting the emotions surrounding the situation. Ask yourself whether this resentment is associated with any other past hurt, not related to the person or situation. Acknowledge your anger or feelings of indignation, but don’t get stuck in them.Anger can sometimes feel like a remedy for feeling powerless: it makes you feel more powerful.Keep in mind, however, that the feeling will go away. Give less of your attention to anger and focus on healing your wounded emotions.
Write in a journal and focus on your emotions regarding the situation. Don’t write about the anger, instead focus your attention on the hurt. Write about your feelings, and if anything like this has happened before. It may be that you hold onto previous hurt and it is being expressed (and magnified) in the present situation.;
, Radical acceptance means accepting life on life’s terms; it means allowing and not resisting the things you cannot change. While pain may not be optional, suffering is.By saying “this isn’t fair,” or, “I don’t deserve this,” you deny the reality of your situation, and try to keep the truth from being a truth for you in that moment.


Radical acceptance means turning your resistant thoughts into accepting thoughts. “This is my life right now. I don’t like it and I don’t think it’s okay, but it is my reality and I cannot change what is out of my control.”Practice radical acceptance with smaller things, and it will help you radically accept larger, more painful situations. You can practice radical acceptance while in traffic, waiting in line at the grocery store, after a spill on the carpet, and during extra long waits at the doctor or dentist.

, Engaging a meditation practice is overwhelmingly good for you. Meditation can increase positive emotions, decrease stress, help with feelings of compassion, and help you regulate your emotions.Meditation can help you work through feelings of anger and resentment by replacing them with compassion and empathy. The more you practice meditation, the more benefits your receive.


The loving-kindness meditation helps practice compassion and empathy. Sit comfortably, close your eyes and start by choosing a phrase to say to yourself, such as, ”I wish to send unconditional love to myself” and do so. Then, say this mantra to someone you feel neutral about (such as a salesperson or man next to you in a line). Then, say the mantra to the person you hold resentment toward. Finally, say the statement to all beings (“I wish to send unconditional love to all beings”).Now, reflect on how you feel. Do you still feel the tightness toward that person?

, It can be difficult to take the other person’s perspective when you are fuming mad. However, sharing empathy with the person that hurt you can shed light on the situation and lessen your pain. The more empathy you experience, the less of a role resentment has in your life.Remember that you make mistakes and still want to be accepted. Remember that all humans want acceptance, even though we all have our challenges.
Try to see the situation from the other person’s eyes. What was going on with that person? Is he experiencing difficult things in life that may have caused him to explode? Understand that each person has personal struggles that must be dealt with, and that sometimes those struggles leak out in other relationships.

, No one person can make you feel loved and accepted at all times except yourself. Remind yourself that you are valuable and lovable.Chances are, if you have high standards for other people, you have high standards to yourself. Are you exceptionally hard on yourself when you make a mistake? Take a step back and remember to love and appreciate yourself at all times.


If you struggle to love yourself, begin practicing a mantra of “I am able to love and be loved fully.” Practice saying this mantra and it will begin to influence the way you see yourself., While revenge may cross your mind and you may even begin to plot your plan, don’t go through with it. Revenge may be a way that people seek justice, yet the quest for justice may result in more injustice if the cycle of revenge continues. When you want revenge on someone, acknowledge your feelings as a way to cope with a loss of trust.Don’t act on your impulses; wait until you are calm and in control of your body and emotions. It is likely that feelings of revenge will pass once you get out of the mindset.If you choose to talk to the person you resent, watch your words. Don’t say anything you may regret in a moment of passion or to get revenge. It’s ultimately not worth it.

, Remember that no one person can meet all of your needs.If you believe that having a partner or a friend or being part of a family means that you will have all your needs met, think again. Having high expectations sets you up for failure.


Resentment can occur when expectations aren’t communicated clearly. A discussion on expectations and desires can help clarify current problems and avoid future problems.
Have clear expectations with the people in your life. Compromise with the people in your life on what standards and expectations you each have for the relationship.

, When discussing your resentment with someone, don’t be quick to place all of the blame onto him. Instead, own your own feelings and experience.You cannot tell someone what his motivation was, or why he did something, because you simply cannot make that judgment call for someone else. Instead, focus on yourself, your hurt, and your experience.


Instead of saying “You ruined the relationship and I’ll never forgive you!” try saying “I feel very hurt by what you did and it’s hard for me to move past this.”

, Sometimes it’s hard to admit that you yourself are flawed, have blind spots, and don’t always respond to situations in the most constructive way. This a reality for every person on planet Earth. Just as you want people to forgive your mistakes, extend the same courtesy to the people in your life. Remember that the person that hurt you is flawed, and sometimes functions from a place of limiting beliefs or skewed perception.Accepting that people make mistakes doesn’t mean excusing their behavior. It means you allow yourself to see the context surrounding the person and the experience to help you understand better.

, Allow the people in your life to be positive people who support you and allow you to make your own decisions. These are people who allow you to make mistakes and still support you.Have friends that are honest with you, that will give you a fresh perspective when you are stuck, or that will tell you when you are over-reacting.


Good friends will accept you regardless of the mistakes you make, and being a good friend means accepting others even when they make mistakes.

, You may feel betrayed or absolutely justified in your resentment toward someone, making forgiveness nearly impossible. However, forgiveness doesn’t mean pretending the situation didn’t happen or that you have to excuse the person’s behavior. Forgiveness means you let go of the pain the person caused you.Ask yourself what the person or situation triggered that deeply hurt you. Did you experience feeling abandoned, traumatized, or re-experience unpleasant memories from the past? It’s likely the person uncovered a deeper hurt inside you.You don’t even have to verbally forgive someone. You can forgive someone who is no longer in your life or who has passed on.
One way to practice forgiveness is by writing the situation and then writing about why you are choosing to forgive. Have a small (safe) fire and burn the paper.

Throughout the day, or at the end of the day, jot down some notes about your anger experiences.Provide some information about the specific situation or person that made you feel angry. For instance, you might write:

“Got cut off in traffic today.”
”My sister-in-law accused me of being insensitive, which led to an argument.”
“My wife forgot my lunch again.”

;
, The thoughts you have can cause anger and even make anger build up over time. These thoughts can also influence your behaviors like shouting or punching a wall. Pay close attention to your thoughts before, during, and after anger experiences. Make notes in your diary.You might find yourself thinking, for example, “My wife doesn’t care about me."" This thought may cause you to feel hurt, which is the underlying emotion beneath your anger. Instead of sharing your feelings with your wife, you might behave irrationally by do something equally hurtful to her.
These thought patterns may worsen your anger and create a vicious emotional cycle of negative thoughts, feelings and behaviors.

, Anger is considered a secondary emotion, meaning it is caused by experiencing another emotion. Anger is often triggered by feelings of fear, which are masked by the powerful feelings and sensations that come with anger. Fear often makes people feel vulnerable, which can be uncomfortable and scary in itself, or can make you feel out of control. As you explore what makes you feel angry, dig deeper and start exploring your thoughts.For instance, your anger toward your spouse may actually be driven by a fear of abandonment. Anger triggered at work may be caused by a fear of losing your job, or a fear of being betrayed by a co-worker.

, The experience of anger causes sensations in your body. Being aware of these sensations can help you recognize when anger is brewing and find healthy ways to cope.


Common ways people experience anger in their bodies include: flushed face and ears, clenched fists, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and clenched teeth. You might also feel like your body is gearing up for a battle due to the fight-or-flight response., Anger is quite often the result of a cognitive distortion, or faulty thinking error. If you jump to conclusions, you make inferences about a situation without having all the details. Doing this can cause anger unnecessarily.


For example, you think “The new boss doesn’t like me” only because the person didn't seem as friendly during your first introduction. Your boss could have been busy or preoccupied as opposed to not liking you., This type of distorted thinking involves assigning “either/or” groups to people or situations without considering a middle ground or grey area.


You might think, for instance, “My spouse snapped at me, they must not love me,"" instead of considering that your spouse may be snapping at you because they are frustrated by something that has nothing to do with you. Or you may struggle to understand that if your spouse is angry at you, it doesn't mean they don't also love you and care about you.
When you recognize when your thinking patterns are unreasonable, you can restructure your thoughts and avoid getting angry. For example, no human alive does everything right. You have set the bar impossibly high, and your spouse will have no choice but to disappoint you., Another common cognitive distortion is filtering, in which you emphasize the negative qualities of a situation while ignoring the positives. This type of thinking can lead to irrational anger, also.


With filtering you might storm off after a special event, saying, “Two people were whispering during my speech! How rude!” However, you have allowed yourself to discount the fact that several dozen other people were politely paying attention., You can learn to remove the power from thoughts that trigger anger by searching for errors in your reasoning. As you get used to noticing negative thinking patterns that provoke anger, you can start restructuring your thoughts to lean in a more positive direction. This is a core aspect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) — consider working with a therapist who specializes in CBT techniques.


For instance, instead of thinking “He should have called to tell me he would be late,” you might reframe this to “I would have appreciated if he had called to inform me he would be late.” Changing the language takes some of the steam out of fiery, anger-driven statements.Look for books and literature that focus on CBT techniques to challenge and reframe common thinking distortions, such as ""The Feeling Good Handbook,"" by David D. Burns.

, A major roadblock for many people who struggle with anger is using their energy to fret about circumstances out of their control. Having the forethought to carefully assess your level of control beforehand can help you avoid getting angry.


A good example is being delayed in a cab ride on your way to an important meeting due to a car accident. There was little you could do to foresee or prevent this delay. Therefore, it is more helpful to accept this and use the delay productively like for reviewing notes or making phone calls.When you identify the things you can change, be proactive. If there are people who often trigger your anger, try to work on your relationship with them or simply try to spend less time with them. If you get angry when your house is messy, hire a cleaning service.
Focus on being proactive instead of reactive.

, Stress-management is a powerful tool that you can use to avoid anger experiences. Sometimes, you may lose your temper because you are tense, tired, or overwhelmed. By making relaxation a regular part of your routine, you can counteract anger that is provoked by stress.


Start with deep, mindful breathing. This type of breathing activates the body’s natural stress response. It works to naturally ease rising stress that can bubble over into anger. Take a long, deep breath in through your nose. Hold the breath for a few seconds. Now, exhale the breath slowly from your mouth. Repeat for several cycles.Other helpful relaxation techniques for anger include progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditation, stretching or massage.Consider using a biofeedback device, which can help you monitor your physiological responses and teach you to relax.

, Not physical as in physical aggression — this physical refers to getting your heart pumping and generating the release of endorphins in your bloodstream. One of the most effective ways to conquer angry feeling before they explode is with vigorous exercise.


Release anger with physical pursuits like rock climbing, cycling, boxing, running, or martial arts. Moving your body will help you manage stress, lift your mood, and may even counteract some of the negative effects of anger like high blood pressure., While anger can feel unpleasant in the moment, you can actually use this surplus energy and emotion to spark your creativity. Research even shows that a smidgen of rage helps you think out of the box.Use your anger to throw yourself into a creative pursuits like writing, painting, knitting, woodworking, or gardening. You might even channel your fury into setting new goals and developing an action plan to reach them.

, Music is a widely available and a wonderful tool to diffuse anger and relieve stress. So, power up your radio or music app and have a dance party with a friend, or on your own.


Stay away from heavy metal or aggressive music in favor of calming or upbeat tunes., Think like a small child and give yourself a “time-out.” Sometimes, anger brews because you’re overworked and situations become charged with tension or anxiety. Knowing when you need a break can help you avoid anger-provoking thoughts or find a healthy release before those thoughts become destructive.


Schedule in natural breaks into your day to just sit or talk to a supportive friend. Do relaxing, nurturing self-care activities like reading or walking outside rather than activities like watching violent movies or playing aggressive video games.Your break can come in the form of a technology detox, too. The fast-paced society that we live in is riddled with hurtful comments on social media or negative media sources online.Logging out of social networks and forums or limiting your technology use for a day could help improve your anger.

, Download an anger management app onto your smartphone to help you track and diffuse your anger. These apps may help you track when you are angry and identify triggers as well as providing ways to calm down, such as playing distracting games.

These apps include Anger Management — Techniques to Release Stress, My Mood Tracker, and Squeeze and Shake., Sometimes, anger management is best left to those with adequate experience and training. Visiting a mental health therapist in your area who has a background in anger management could help you learn useful skills to avoid anger-provoking thoughts and cope with angry feelings.Attending a local self-help anger management group may also be beneficial. These groups are frequently facilitated by therapists or peers who have successfully conquered their anger issues. In them, you can build connections with others and develop skillsets to express anger in a healthy way.

It's human nature to want to make it better in your mind by coming up with excuses, explaining away what you did. However, if you're going to ask someone to forgive you, you need to first admit to yourself that what you did was wrong and not try to explain it away., That is, step away from any emotion that is going to make you want to offer excuses. If you were angry when you did what you did, you'll likely want to offer that as an excuse. However, you can't truly apologize until you accept sole responsibility for what you did. It's his job to accept any responsibility he played in the scene., You shouldn't read your apology to your guy. However, writing out what you want to say can make it easier to stop yourself from explaining your actions or excusing yourself. Focus on taking responsibility and making amends., It's in most people's nature to put off things they don't want to do. However, you should apologize sooner rather than later. If you wait, your guy is only going to get angrier or more hurt.

, Don't try to apologize when your guy is sitting down to a football game or reading a good book. Choose a time when he's not distracted by something else, and ask if you can talk. If he already knows what you've done, he probably can guess what the conversation will be about. If you need to confess, it might not be as easy for him to guess., That means that you convey with your tone and attitude that you are sincerely sorry for what you did. Don't try to laugh it away, or play it off with a joke. Look him in the eye, and with a serious tone, say you're sorry.For instance, you could say, ""I'm truly, truly sorry about what I did.""

, Also, you need to accept that what you did was wrong in the presence of your guy. That means naming what you did wrong to acknowledge that you know what you did.As an example, you could say, ""I know that when I made a joke at your expense I hurt your feelings. I should've thought before I spoke. I know you're sensitive about that issue.""

, Finally, you have to acknowledge how you could do better in the future. This part is how you start to make the situation better. You can't take back what you did, but you can talk about how you intend to change your behavior in the future.As the end of the apology, you could say, ""Next time, I'll try to bite my tongue before I speak. You deserve better from me. I love and respect you, and I want to show you that with my actions.""

, If this conversation is the first he's heard about it, he's probably going to be angry. Let him give voice to his anger, but don't try to offer a defense. He needs a chance to talk about it. Even if he did know about what your apologizing about, he still needs a chance to talk about what he's feeling and why. Give him an opportunity to speak about why what you did hurt him.You can give him a space to talk by saying, ""How do you feel about what I've said?""

, Finally, show that you understand what he's feeling. Show you are listening and that you understand why he's upset.One way you can show you're listening is by repeating back what he's said. That is, you can say, ""What I hear you saying is that me making jokes like that makes you feel belittled and disrespected. I totally understand that, and you are totally valid in feeling that way."", Sometimes, when someone is really hurt or angry, he just needs some time to process what's happened. He might want to take a few days or even a week to think about what you've done, and that's okay. He needs that time to get in the right head space., If you are trying to get someone to forgive you, you can't argue your way to that end. In other words, once you've said you're sorry, leave the discussion alone. You are not going to convince him by arguing that you are in the right., If you feel like you need to do something to show you're sorry, surprise him. You can bake cookies or get him a present that you know will mean something to him. Doing something thoughtful can show you still care.

, You need your guy to forgive you, of course, to move on in the relationship. However, you also need to forgive yourself. Everyone does bad things sometimes, and in the grand scheme of things, what you did was probably not that bad. Even if it was, you still shouldn't blame yourself forever. Give yourself permission to stop feeling bad about it.That doesn't mean you should completely forget about it. You should definitely use what you've learned to do better in the future.

, As much as you'd like to make it true, no one has an obligation to forgive someone else. It may be that you just have to learn from this mistake and move on with someone else."

Determine what change in behavior you want.,
Ask the other person about their offense.,
Provide the other person a chance to explain their actions.,
Highlight the other person's errors.,
Select your alternative behavior.,
Restore relations.",How to Give Someone a Guilt Trip1," Is this a point you want the other person to agree to or action you want them to take? This will assist your dialogue.In the case of agreeing to a point or idea, you may be asking the other person to admit they are wrong for saying, writing, or otherwise expressing a certain opinion. For example, if the other person insulted your appearance, you will be targeting their guilt about the statement.
In the action case, you are guilt-tripping them about something they took part in physically. For example, if they stole from a store, you are focusing on their feelings about this act in particular.
In either situation, you might expand your target to the general feelings of wrong doing on the other person in question.;
, You may not get a direct answer about this on the first try, but don't repetitively ask the question the same way each time.This is not a time to directly confront them about lying, more of a chance to turn their shame about the situation into the behavior you want.
Rephrase the question until you get an admission of guilt about the statement or action. If you have detailed knowledge of the offense, you might lead them a bit. For example, if they were late to a wedding, you could provide details of the engagement in the question and ask where they were.

, This will allow them to realize they need to be held accountable and permit you the opportunity to offer alternatives.It is possible the other person's explanation may not be entirely honest, but you should hear it out nonetheless.
If the other person's explanation makes sense, consider accepting it--if you insist on checking it out--you may risk unnecessary resentment between the two of you.
If the explanation is blatantly false, then consider re-using the questioning method from the earlier step to get a more accurate account. For example, if you are guilt tripping them for causing a scene at your birthday party, but they blamed a relative that wasn't even in attendance, you might rephrase the questions so they eliminate other parties first.

, You should be careful to link the other person's offense and sense of wrong doing--not accuse them of more than they are guilty of.If the other person was guilty of an expressive offense, point this out and the slander, libel, or emotional lines they have crossed. For example, if they wrote a demeaning letter about a former partner in a public newspaper--this is a crime as well as personal insult.
If the other person was guilty of a physical offense, such as damaging your personal music collection while borrowing it, point out the violation as well as the morals of personal responsibility.

, This is whatever you want the other person to change their actions to.


If this was a guilt trip for an expressive violation, then you may just want the other person to apologize and agree you are in the right. Consider asking them to write a formal apology. For example, in the situation of the violation occurring in print, the apology may appear in the same publication.
If this was a guilt trip for a physical incident, you might want the other person to make more actionable amends. For example, if they ate food from your supplies without permission, you might ask them to replace it at their expense.
In either situation, set a reasonable time limit for the other person to complete the behavior change.

, Whatever happened to cause you to guilt trip the other person, and after the alternative behavior is satisfied, you should restore a healthy relationship.Review with the other person what went wrong and how you can prevent it from happening again.
In the case of an expressive violation, see if you and the other person can change how you communicate.
In the case of a physical situation, perhaps find other constructive behaviors to engage in.
In extreme cases, consider professional psychological counseling.

Apologize with sincerity.,
Take responsibility.,
Make a meaningful gesture.",How to Get a Woman to Forgive You1," Reconciliation begins with asking for forgiveness. Apologize with sincerity and start the healing process. This is often the hardest step because it means that you have to take responsibility for your actions and face the issue.A sincere apology means that your head and heart are aligned to make a focused intellectual and emotional decision to accept responsibility, even if it was unintentional.
Sometimes it’s a good idea to write down your apology. First, because it will give you a chance to choose and practice saying the right words. Second, it will give you time to think about if you are seriously sorry or not for what has happened. After that, you can decide whether or not you want to offer a sincere apology.
Say something like, “I understand that I hurt you and I want you to know how truly sorry I am for what happened between us.”
Be present in the moment. In other words, apologize somewhere appropriate, put all electronic devices away, and make eye contact. Keep your apology short, simple, and sincere.;
, Taking responsibility for your actions is an important step in starting the process for forgiveness. Accept your role in the issue and imagine how you would feel if the same thing happened to you.A sincere apology is a selfless act that demands that nothing be expected in return. Remember, you are not “giving” an apology; rather, you are seeking forgiveness.
Avoid apologies that blame the other person. For example, “I am sorry you feel that way,” or “I regret that you got so angry about…” These kinds of apologies do not take responsibility and actually place some responsibility on the person you are apologizing to.
Taking responsibility also demonstrates your maturity, something a woman would admire in a man. Instead, of blaming or minimizing your role, say “I messed up and I am so sorry that I hurt you.”
An apology such as “In the future I will…” demonstrates that you will continue to work on making things better between you. In this case, it will enable you to make a meaningful gesture without the perception of buying forgiveness.

, It is best to follow an apology with a gesture, not before. This is a tricky proposition because a woman might think her forgiveness is being bought. Therefore, make a sincere apology first and then make sure the gesture conveys that you learned your lesson and won’t repeat the issue.


Your intentions should always remain clear with a meaningful gesture. Regardless of the gesture you choose – making a card, buying her favorite coffee, or sending her a song or flowers that conveys an apology – make sure you highlight your intentions.
This is a no strings attached apology. In other words, nothing should be expected in return nor should you expect to be forgiven completely.

Use what you know about you both.,
Appeal to their senses of the memory.,
Describe how much this means to you both.,
Use the environment.,
Evoke a response.",How to Give Someone a Guilt Trip2," Select a common experience, usually one where the other person is indebted to you in some way. You can use a memory that you know the other person feels guilt or shame about, though this is riskier.There are a wide variety of choices in a situation like this, but you want to select something vivid and with a great deal of emotion tied to the memory. For example, a time where you saved the other person from a bad stage performance or from drowning in a lake.
If this is a memory the other person feels guilt or shame about, proceed cautiously. For instance, if you use an old memory of when you took the blame for them stealing from a store--there is some incrimination risk. Or if you have documentary evidence of the other person performing shamefully in pursuit of material gain, this could be construed as the crime of blackmail., You will need to ensure the other person adequately remembers the incident you are using to guilt trip them with.Use sight, sound, and smell if possible. Describe the memory's elements, but if you can reproduce them in any way, that is also a help.
Focus on the parts of the memory where you are in the advantageous situation. For example, if you helped the other person dress better to meet their future spouse, point out the moments you actually selected their attire, told them how to put it on, etc...

, This is to emphasize the value of the memory so you get the measured response you want out of the other person.If the past event you use to guilt trip the other person was life altering, then you may get more of a change out of the guilt trip. For example, if you are using the memory of rescuing a friend from a burning house, their response may increase greatly. But if it's only the memory of stopping them from stepping in a puddle of water, then this is not typically going to gain as great a response.
If this is a memory of guilt or shame, such as a crime or other morally questionable behavior, then focus on the value of your keeping the other person's confidence on the matter or sharing in the incident. For example, if the past event was the other person cheating on a partner and you negotiated a settlement--this can be a valuable point to you both from which you can get your desired behavior out of the other person.

, You may want to bring the other person into a situation reminiscent of the memory.This is a variation on the sensory step, but should be done more in conjunction with the value step.
This step involves taking the other person into a location similar to or actual from which the memory occurred. For example, if you are trying to guilt trip the other person by having them remember the time you stood all day in the rain to get them tickets to a concert, you can walk them past the same ticket counter (even when its raining) while you are discussing the incident.

, Once you have your memory selected, and the other person sufficiently recalling it, you can pick the change in behavior you want them to undergo.


With this method, the new response does not have to be at all related to the memory.
This can be a favor you need the other person to do that you both agree is equal in weight to the effort given in the memory you used in the guilt trip. For example, if you used the memory of watching the other person's pets for a week the favor can be the other person buying you tickets to a sporting event of equal value to a professional pet sitter or kennel for the same time period.
Discuss if the other person's response is adequate to make you ""even"" for the original memory, if you now owe the other person back, or if the other person still has further responses to make.

"
"
Review the other person's offense.,
Offer an early opportunity to make amends.,
Share in the other person's recovery.,
Document both of your experiences.,
Establish any learned lessons.",How to Give Someone a Guilt Trip3," Whether this is an expressive or physical incident, determine if the other person is already remorseful.If the other person is clearly remorseful early on, you may want to pursue a positive, constructive response rather than a traditional guilt trip.
This method is also less likely to garner resentment between you and the other person.
Consider a third-party mediator to discuss the issue between you and the other person.

, In this method, you want to provide a way to fix the situation as immediately as possible, and not let the problem linger. It's best if you do this directly, without a go-between, but whatever method is more efficient is preferable.The nature of this opportunity will vary greatly, it could be a written apology, charity/volunteer work, donations, etc...
Tailor the opportunity to the offense. For example, if the other person shoplifted, have them not only return the object and write an apology, but help to deter others from doing the same things.

, Don't let the other person feel isolated in their guilt.Whatever new behavior the other person is engaging in, try to do some of it yourself and let the other person see this.
For example, if you guilt trip the other person into writing an apology for a false claim on a blog, write positive comments in support yourself.

, Keep track of your responses, written or actionable.


This can help you and the other person track progress towards satisfying the feeling of guilt on their part and injury on yours.
If this is a written response, maybe keep an album of clippings from the written publications or similar.
In the actionable response category, keep copies of schedules, photos, and/or souvenirs from events. For example, if you used the other person's memory of you getting them to their championship soccer game on time to guilt trip them into helping your charity food drive... you can collect photos of them on the cook's line.

, There should be take-away points both you and the other person gain from this experience. Being clear that you both have at least some common ideas about what you went through should be part of the process.In the case of an expressive guilt trip, you can share the other person's mistake and both of your responses as lessons for what not to do and to do in the future. For example, if the other person was guilt tripped into writing a letter to the editor to apologize for an earlier letter that made false claims, and you made supportive comments in your own letter--the two of you can go over etiquette in writing and the subject matter.
An example for a physical event, such as you using the other person's memory of a prank call to guilt trip them into help you move furniture for an elderly neighbor, you can discuss the merits of helping others over immature behaviors.

"
"
Deliver a message.,
Use text based communication.,
Use personal communication.",How to Give Someone a Guilt Trip4," This can be done in person, by email, text, phone, or in combination. Whatever method you choose, be sure the other person will receive the message in an efficient manner.


Despite guilt being a somewhat negative emotion, you don't want to add more negativity by being rude in your messages.
Get your point across while being firm and polite.

, For text-based communications including e-mail, you can't translate emotion as well, so rely more on memory in the scripting..


For example, if you guilt trip someone over standing you up on a date you might try something to the effect of, ""I was waiting all night at location X for you, but you can make it up to me by doing Y"" where X is the common memory you have of a meeting place and Y is the changed behavior you wish to get out of the other person.
Another sample of this might be an e-mail to a boss that you need to get more time for an assignment on. You could remind them of a time you did another job for them by saying something such as, ""Remember when I got your taxes done just at the deadline? I need another week on this project.""

, For personal or phone communication where body language or emotion can be better transmitted, you can use similar phrasing as the steps above, but the degree to which you are upset over the memory may be conveyed through your expressions and affect how much guilt you draw out of the other person.An example of a personal contact may be you having the person over for a drink and guilt tripping them over leaving you with a large bar bill on another occasion when you also had to pay your rent that week. So, you could say something to the effect of, ""Do you remember the last time we had a drink together?""--and then discuss repayment.
Another type of this contact over the phone might be asking a relative to take you with them on a trip to a place that meant a lot to you as a child. It might go something like, ""Uncle Joe, you recall how much I loved seeing the mountains with Aunt Jane, can I go with you on this trip?"" Your desire to go would be audible.

Listen to her.,
Give her space.,
Show her kindness.,
Prove to her you can change.,
Try to be honest.",How to Get a Woman to Forgive You2," Listening is often a powerful action that can help you resolve any kind of conflict. When the woman in your life is upset, keep your mouth closed and be prepared to listen to all of her continued attacks without defending yourself or counterattacking.Listening means listening, not calming, reasoning, or sympathizing - just listening. Don’t interrupt and let her get everything out that she needs to say.
When she is finished, let her know that you heard everything she has to say about the problem while you think about carefully responding to her words.
Think about what she has said to you and try to find some agreement even if you find what most of what she said as not true. Once you find a point you can agree on, say something like: “I agree, sometimes I can be that way” or “If I was in your shoes, I would come to the same conclusion.” Every time you agree, you will lessen her anger and create a space for cooperation.

, When people are upset, it is best to give them time and space to cool down. Bombarding her with emails, text messages, or phone calls will only make the situation worse because it shows no sensitivity on your part.


Let her vent her frustration with friends and family first. This will allow both of you to gain some perspective on the relationship.
Being annoying and trying to get some response from her will only drive her further away. She doesn’t want to be controlled. Instead, remain calm and her agitation will die down and she will become more reasonable. A heated discussion rarely ends on a positive note.
When conflict occurs, forgiveness is not something that will cross her mind. She will need time to cool off. How long depends on her. It could be a few minutes, a couple of days, a month, or forever.

, Being kind does count for something. Displaying acts of kindness will let your female friend know that you are truly a nice person and that it might not be worth it to hold a grudge for too long against you. Many friendships and relationships have survived simply because nice gestures will soften hearts and minds enough to smooth over any ill will.Manners are always a good starting place. Holding the door open for her, pushing her chair in, helping grandma cross the street, or buying her a coffee will certainly open her heart when she notices how courteous you can be.
If you find yourself stuck, try texting or tweeting, “I am thinking about you.” By engaging in small acts of affection and kindness, she will realize that you really do care about the relationship.

, Sometimes saying “I’m sorry” is not enough for forgiveness. You might have to take a step further and demonstrate that you are genuinely aware that your actions were hurtful. The best way to do that is to prove that you are making changes so the issue never happens again.Don’t try to seek forgiveness until you have convinced yourself first that you can truly change your habits. Find the source of the problem, address it, and then work on making positive changes. Don’t be too hard on yourself, but verifiable proof will be needed to demonstrate new habits to the woman in your life.
Think about not only correcting the one problem that is causing the conflict but also other potential issues that could undermine your attempts at change. In other words, fixing the problem does not permit you to lapse in other areas or she might think that you are not taking the issue seriously.
Consider making an agreement with her. Narrowing in on the issue and making specific changes will give you an opportunity to prove you are changing. If there is a disagreement over what actions to take or what is acceptable, then you need to sit down and discuss it with her. Are you able to honestly agree and make the changes, or are you saying yes only to get her to come back to you? You have to decide whether or not the changes are something you can achieve.
Follow through on your promises. If you are forgetful, write yourself notes, think about it when you wake up in the morning, and review your actions before you go to bed. If you really want her to forgive you then you need to do everything in your power to make sure your actions support what you promised to change.

, It is dangerous to tell half or partial truths just to alleviate the conflict and gain forgiveness. She might find out later and, if she does, there will be little hope for reconciliation, only increased anger. It is true that full disclosure is not always necessary, but don’t minimize what you did or hide the most important details. Even if being honest hurts or embarrasses you, remember that being up front about everything will be better in the long run.Most importantly, make sure that honesty is important to both of you. Communicate openly by saying “I want us to be able to talk about what is important in our friendship without lies.” This will begin to set the ground rules for moving on in your understanding of each other.
An honest person is a mature person. Demonstrating that you are above lying, cheating, or hiding the truth will prove to her that you are mature and that the issue that caused conflict was unintentional or a one-time occurrence.
Honesty does not mean perfection. White lies don’t hurt as long as it is not necessary to be completely honest (e.g. “No, that outfit does not make you look fat”).
Set boundaries for what topics are okay and off limits for discussion so that you are not pressured into lying and then having to ask for forgiveness. If a topic cannot be agreed upon, such as watching porn on the computer, then you have to seriously consider if your friendship should continue.

Take it slow.,
Build stronger communication.,
Do something together.",How to Get a Woman to Forgive You3," Even after forgiveness, the rawness of the conflict might still linger and issues of trust are still not strong. Don’t rush back too soon. Instead take the time and necessary steps to rebuild your trust by showing maturity, patience, and understanding.Don’t assume that once you are forgiven that everything will go back to the way it was. It will take time to establish the same level of understanding you had before the disagreement.
Remember who you are giving valuable time and attention to and try to get her to reciprocate. That way, the slower you go the faster you will get to forgiveness. Finding out if she is on the same page as you can help you formulate reasonable and realistic expectations moving forward.
Take time to make sure you are on the same page. Taking things slowly will put her mind at ease and encourage her to communicate more clearly about future expectations. It will also give you time to bond all over again.

, Good communication is the key to any kind of healthy relationship. If she accepts your sincere apology, start building better lines of communication so that you talk through any issues in the future. Being open to communication might mean discussing things that you never have before and trusting her to empathize with you.Pay closer attention to nonverbal signs that you did in the past. For example, look for signs in body language, tone of voice, or eye contact. These nonverbal signs are important, but you have to be patient and learn how to read them. These can be either positive or negative.
Always stay focused on the present moment. Try not to give off disinterested signs or be thinking about something else when she is talking to you. Be interested in talking and listening to her while you are together.
Minimize your emotions when discussing serious topics like money, sex, politics, or religious beliefs. These are topics are lightning rods for emotional responses. Remain rational and understanding, even bite your tongue if necessary, or even cede the conversation in their favor to avoid an emotional outburst.
Remember communication is not just talking face-to-face but other ways exist: nonverbal, phone, texting, email, and Facebook or Twitter. Always be cautious of the words you type, but keep in mind that a friendly message once in a while to let them know you are thinking about them is a good idea.

, Although we find comfort in routine, try to find something new to do together to build a connection. Think about things you both enjoy like sports, amusement parks, theater, cooking, or relaxing in the park. If you spend all your time analyzing each other and trying to find solutions, you will forget to have fun and the reasons why you care about her in the first place.It can also be with friends. Make sure it is a time you can relax without tension and simply enjoy the moment together or with friends.
Don’t try too hard. Getting too elaborate might seem too formal or serious. Keep your focus on fun and enjoying the experience.
Take it slow. Don’t try to do something special every night. Instead, plan something for day during the weekend. Let the memories sink in during the week so that she will realize how much you really care about her.

Being able to recognize and rate your anger helps you take action before the anger builds up too much so you can start to calm down.You will rate your anger from a one to 10. One is just minor irritation, while 10 is explosive rage.
Since anger does not go from normal calm to explosive rage, you can learn how to identify the increasing rating of your anger so you can maintain control.

, Your mental health professional will help you develop an anger management plan that you can use whenever you start to feel increased anger. Each person’s anger management plan is different.

, Another technique you may be required to do is writing in an anger journal. The anger journal provides you an outlet where you can vent your anger in a healthy, non-destructive way. You can use the journal during an anger episode to get out your thoughts and feelings.You can use your anger journal to help you understand your anger and the triggers.

It is good to have these feelings because it means that you recognize your own mistakes. Learning to forgive yourself involves a willingness to change and let go. Say out loud, “Yes, I did that,” or, “I take responsibility for what I did.”
Be open with someone you trust about your actions. This could be a private meeting one-on-one with a family member or friend.
For example, let's say that you ignored your best friend who was going through a really hard time with her family because you wanted to spend the weekend with your new boyfriend. You ignored her calls or texts for two days, and now you feel guilty. When you do talk with her, say, ""I'm sorry for not being there for you. I realize now that ignoring your calls and not telling you what I was doing was wrong."";
, Think about the reasons why you acted the way to you did. Were you upset with the person or with yourself? Were your needs being met, or not being met, by the person you hurt? Exploring your behavior will help you to move forward.


Consider writing about your motives as a way to open yourself up to your emotions and behavior.For example, let’s say you lied to your significant other. You felt like you wanted to protect them, but instead hurt them worse. Do you have difficulty talking with your partner? Think about your own actions in the situation.

, Do you feel like others have high expectations of you? Do you have high expectations of yourself? Think about how your family, friends, and surroundings have influenced your values and behaviors.Let’s say you wanted to hang out with the new group of friends that excluded a close friend of yours. Your close friend finds out that you chose to hang out with a bunch of other people that actively excluded her. You feel like you’re caught between one set of friends and your best friend.
If you feel pressured by others to make a choice between your friends, think about what really matters to you. Are you willing to give up one good friend for those other friends?

, Acceptance can be hard, but it will help you heal. Remember that no one is perfect. Sometimes we hurt others by accident and other times on purpose. Rather than repressing or ignoring what you feel, see acceptance as a form of catharsis.For example, let's say that you had a really busy day at work, and forgot that you had plans to meet with your sister after work. At the last minute you're caught up in helping your company with something, and completely forgot about your plans with your sister. You forget to check your phone until two hours after the date/time you planned to meet her. When you realize what's happened, you call your sister. Take ownership of your mistake. And make plans to reschedule if she's willing.
When you have negative thoughts about yourself and who you hurt, tell yourself, “I accept my mistakes. I have learned from them.”
If you are feeling guilty about what you did, you are already expressing a very honest emotion — the sense that you aren’t perfect.
Take this emotion to heart, and avoid repeating your mistakes. Don’t continue to hurt someone what you know it’s wrong.

, You are not automatically a bad person for hurting someone. Sometimes we end up hurting others because we felt hurt ourselves. Do you feel like you’ve been hurt?Practice self-love. Take time to reflect on who you are and who you want to be. Take time away from the stress of work, school, and life.
Think of three things that you love about yourself. Focus on aspects of your personality. By looking at your strengths, you can remember what good things you have to offer.

, This may seem simple, but oftentimes it can be difficult if the person is hurt, no talking to you, and avoiding you. Don’t assume that saying, ”I’m sorry,” will fix things. It may take time for someone to believe or trust you.


Apologize in-person if possible. See if there is a way to talk with them one-on-one rather than in public. If in-person isn't possible, then a phone call is the next best thing.
Avoid apologizing via chat, text message, or email. This form of communication may skew things, and make it more difficult to be direct and supportive if they’re still feeling hurt. For example, instead of texting back and forth with a friend you’ve hurt, ask to talk with her one-on-one the next time you see her. The apology will be more genuine and straightforward when done in person.
Consider giving them some time to recover before talking with them about what happened. Don’t try to patch things up if the person is shocked or stressed. They may have difficulty listening to your apology.
Ask the person if there is anything you can do to make it up to them. If you missed a dinner date, for example, offer to take them out at a later date — your treat.
If things continue to be rocky between you and the person you've hurt, consider writing a thoughtful and apologetic letter. Think about what you want to say and why before you just write and send it. Think about the letter as way to let go of being hurt, rather than trying to assign blame. But don’t expect that the letter will set everything right again.Listen to what the person says. After an apology it's easy to want to hear an immediate ""You're forgiven,"" but this is the person's opportunity to get that hurt off their chest. The most loving thing you can do is listen with empathy and not become defensive. Give the other person time to really air it out if that's what they need.

, Everyone makes mistakes at one point or another. It is a fact of life. While some mistakes are in our control, others are not. Take initiative when you’ve hurt someone due to your own actions and mistakes. While you can’t take back the past, that doesn’t mean history is going to repeat itself.


Talk with others that you trust about what you did and how you’re feeling after hurting someone. Get the perspective of someone who doesn’t necessarily have an emotional investment in the situation. An objective look from an outsider’s point of view may help.
For example, instead of asking a mutual friend for advice about another friend you’ve hurt, ask your parents, an older sibling, or someone you trust who doesn’t have a close relationship with your friend who you’ve hurt.
Think about what you can do better next time. Think about the different ways that you could have handled the situation better.

, Letting out your feelings of guilt, remorse, and self-hate may help you to ultimately let go. Simply putting pen to paper may make it easier to see what you want, who you want to be, and how you hope to move forward. You don't need to worry about spelling, grammar, or even making sense when you journal. Just think of it as a way to work out what you're feeling, which may be messy.


Journal about the incident and who you hurt. Think about any other similar incidents that have happened recently and their consequences. Conversely, write also about what you want to do to make it better. Focus on things that you believe you change about yourself.
Create a daily journal as a stress reliever. Take five minutes out of your day to evaluate your actions and what you want to do better.

, Focus on how you can make your friendships, relationships with family, and your interactions with others better. While you can’t change the past, you can control your own actions for the future. If you dwell in the past, then you will not be able to forgive yourself. Prioritize the present and show your love to others.


Communicate that you care about those most important in your life.
Make them feel special by complimenting them, and telling them in words what you think they are doing well.
Spend more time with those you value in your life. Talk with them about what you’re feeling. Get their advice about how to move forward.

, If you continue to feel depressed, upset, or guilt-ridden for weeks or longer, then consider talking with a professional who can help you cope with your feelings and provide pathways for self-forgiveness.Find if your health insurance provider has a list of therapists that are in-network. You may be able to get some affordable options through your health insurance.
Seek out local therapists or counseling centers in your community. Ask about sliding scale or low cost options.
Consider joining a support group. There are many kinds of support groups depending on what you’re facing — depression, grief and loss, divorce, and many others. This can help you feel less alone in your feelings of guilt.

, If you are finding it difficult to forgive yourself, you may someone who is very self-critical in general. If this is the case, it may be beneficial to learn ways to quiet that nagging, critical voice that wants to remind you that you messed up or tell you you're not good enough. Journaling and listing your positive qualities can help you begin to address those negative thoughts.


Realize that your negative thoughts are not necessarily the truth. Just because you are thinking ""I'm a terrible friend,"" that doesn't make it true. Try making a list of all the ways that you have been a good friend in the past.
Soften your criticism. It is good to be self-critical sometimes, but not to the point where you can't move forward and forgive yourself, or if it is ruining your self-esteem. When you think ""I'm a terrible friend,"" stop and restate it in a softer (and more truthful) way. ""I hurt my friend's feelings, but it was unintentional and I have apologized. I'm a human and I make mistakes.""
When you begin to criticize yourself, ask yourself if you would say those things to a friend. Would you ever tell your friend they were a terrible person because they made a mistake? Treat yourself like you are your own best friend.

, This may sound strange, but reframing the way you look at mistakes or guilt can help you forgive yourself and grow. Remind yourself that every mistake is an opportunity to learn, and to be grateful for that tool as a way of growing. Tell yourself, ""I am thankful for the opportunity to make mistakes, to learn, to grown, and to become a better person.""

, If you feel like you can’t make amends with the person you’ve hurt, but are still emotionally hurting, then give back to others as a way to make amends. Give you time, money, or resources to communities in need and those who could benefit from your support. Even if you can’t fix the hurt between you and the person, you can possible make a difference in someone else’s life. Consider ways to volunteer and give back to these groups:


Local non-profits
Neighbors or people in need within your neighborhood
Faith-based groups such as your local church or place of worship
Co-workers or classmates who are having a difficult time

Remember that you did the right thing.",How to Forgive Someone," Forgiving someone who has done you wrong can be a bitter pill to swallow. Your first reaction is probably to hold on to your anger and blame the person who caused you pain. While this is natural, holding on to hurt and anger causes you more pain than the person your anger is directed towards. For this reason, it is necessary to forgive - not for the other person, but for yourself.Holding a grudge can spoil future relationships with other people, cause depression or resentment, and can isolate you from others.;
, Forgiveness requires the conscious, active decision to let go of negativity and to try to move on with life. It does not come naturally or easily. Forgiveness is something you must work towards.Often, people claim that they ""cannot"" forgive the person who did them wrong. They believe that it is impossible for them to get past their feelings of hurt and betrayal. Yet, what people fail to realize is that forgiveness is a choice. When you choose to forgive people who have hurt you, the person that will benefit most from this decision is you.

, Let go of all the negative emotions you harbor towards the other person. Allow yourself to cry, hit a punching bag, go into nature and scream, or whatever provides you an outlet for all these bad feelings.If not, they will fester and cause you further pain.


Remember, you are not doing this to ease the other person's conscience or to condone his actions. You are doing it to allow yourself to heal and move forward.

, Try to gain some perspective by taking a step back and viewing the situation from an objective point of view. Did the other person try to hurt you intentionally? Were there circumstances beyond his control? Has he attempted to apologize and make things right with you? Try to take everything into account and to calmly analyze the situation. If you can try to understand why and how the situation came about in the first place, it will be easier to forgive.


Honestly ask yourself how often you've wronged someone and been forgiven. Remember what that felt like, and how relieved and grateful you felt when the other person forgave you. Sometimes it helps to remember that we're just as prone to hurting others. , Talking to someone you trust will help you process your emotions and gain an unbiased perspective. Just getting everything off your chest can help you feel like a weight has been lifted. A friend, a family member, or a therapist can lend a sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on.


While you may be tempted to talk to the person you're having trouble forgiving, wait until you are in a calm place and have completely considered your feelings. This will keep you from going off on the person and further damaging the relationship., This will help you release destructive negative emotions and work through your issues. Try keeping a journal or writing letters, using creative methods like painting and poetry, listening to or writing music, running or dancing. Do things that help you to relieve tension and make you feel good.


Positively dealing with your emotions will make you more aware of the issues you need to confront. This is key to recognizing and dealing with negative emotions, rather than simply ignoring them., Read or listen to stories of others who have exercised forgiveness, in even more difficult circumstances than yours. They can be spiritual leaders, therapists, family members, or simply people that wrote about their experiences. These can give you hope and determination.

, Forgiveness does not come with the click of your fingers. It requires self-control, determination, compassion and, above all, time. It is something that can be worked towards, little by little, every day. Remember, no one comes to the end of their life and thinks ""I should have stayed angry for longer."" In the end, love, empathy and forgiveness are what matter the most.


There's not an optimum window of time for forgiving someone. You may find yourself holding onto a grudge for years, then realizing that you need to come to terms with that person. Listen to your instinct., It is important not to make any rash judgments when dealing with the person who hurt you. If you react too quickly, you may say or do something you will regret. Take some time to process what you've just learned and gather more information before acting upon it.Whether it's a partner or family member who has hurt you, don't drastically react. Think about your history with him and whether this was a once off offence or a habit. Make sure you are thinking calmly and rationally before you say something you can't take back or cut him out of your life altogether.

, Ask to meet somewhere private. Make it clear that this doesn't necessarily mean that things will go back to normal between the two of you, but that you are willing to hear him out before moving forward. Tell him that you are willing to listen to their side of the story.

, When listening to the other person's story, try to sit back and let him do the talking. Don't interrupt or contradict him. If your relationship with this person is what's at stake, the least you can do is hear him out.As clear-cut as the situation may seem to you, you should always take the opportunity to hear the other person's side of the story. You may be surprised at what you learn, and if nothing else, it will allow you to make an informed decision about what to do next.

, Try to be compassionate when dealing with the person who hurt you. Put yourself in his shoes and ask yourself what you would have done in a similar situation. Would you have acted differently?Try to understand what the other person's motives or intentions were. Was he deliberately trying to hurt you? Did he have your best interests at heart? Or was he simply being careless?

, When speaking with the person who has hurt you, don't say or do anything you can't take back. Lashing out angrily and throwing insults and accusations at the other person may feel good at the time, but will not help the situation in the long run. It is counter-productive and may ruin your relationship for good.Stay calm when confronting the person who hurt you. Avoid accusatory phrases when addressing the other person. Instead of saying ""you made me feel like..."" say ""I feel like..."" Breathe deeply and if they say anything that provokes you, try counting to ten before responding.

, Once you've had time to cool down and think things through, clearly explain to him, in a calm and measured manner, how his actions have hurt you and how they have made you feel. This is vital, otherwise you will bottle up feelings of anger and resentment towards the other person, making true forgiveness impossible. Let him know how this has impacted your relationship, especially if it's a romantic one.Once you have expressed your feelings clearly and thoroughly, it is important that you move on. If you have decided to forgive this person for his actions, you cannot bring up past hurts every time you have an argument or hold it over his head.

, When working towards forgiveness, it is important to let go of the notion of getting even or taking revenge on the person who has hurt you. Trying to get even will only result in more people getting hurt, including you. You need to be the bigger person, try to forgive and move on. Instead, work to rebuild trust and your relationship. This is especially important if the conflict is between a relative.You'll want to resolve any family tension, since you'll probably be interacting with him for a long time.


For example, if your partner has cheated on you, you will solve nothing by cheating on him in return. You will only cause more pain and resentment. Two wrongs don't make a right. Your forgiveness won't count for much if it only comes after you've had your revenge.

, If he asked for forgiveness, he'll be grateful and relieved that you can work towards rebuilding your relationship. If he didn't ask for it, at least you can get if off your chest and move forward with your life.Remember that forgiving someone does not necessarily mean that things will go back to normal between you. If you feel that he may have hurt you one too many times or you don't think you can trust him again, that's okay. Just make this clear to him as well. This may seem easier in a romantic relationship that is ending, since you most likely won't see each other very much. It's harder to do in a family situation, since you'll be encountering each other regularly.

, It is important to understand that even if you forgive the person, you don't need to let him back into your life. Decide whether you want to rebuild a relationship with him or let him go. In order to this, you need to think long and hard about your relationship. Is it worth rebuilding? Is he likely to hurt you again if you let him back in?In some situations, such as an abusive relationship or a relationship where your partner has cheated multiple times, it is safer and healthier to cut the person out of your life for good. You deserve better.

, Once you have made the decision to forgive, you need to forget about the past and focus on the future. If you decide that the relationship is worth rebuilding, then you can slowly start to move forward. Let the person know that even though they hurt you, you still love him and want him in your life.If you continue to dwell on past hurts, you will never be able to truly forgive or move forward. Look on the bright side and see this situation as an opportunity to make a fresh start. It might be just what your relationship needs.

, Once you have been hurt, it can be difficult to rebuild trust. However, it's important that you learn to trust yourself - your judgment and your ability to make well-informed decisions. Then you can work towards rebuilding trust with the other person.


Make a commitment to be completely open and honest with one another about everything. Take it one day at a time. Trust can't be earned overnight. You need give the other person time to regain your trust.

, Try to look on the bright side by making a list of the positive things you can take away from the experience. These might include: realizing the extent of your ability to understand and forgive, gaining valuable life lessons about trust, or having a closer relationship with the person who wronged you since you worked through your issues together.


If you start remembering the hurt and pain the other person caused you, don't let that thinking take hold.If you do, you might have to revisit your past for the answer. Don't look at this as another reason to be angry. Instead, see this as an opportunity to heal.

, Sometimes forgiveness will mean nothing to the person you've given it to and sometimes a relationship just can't be fixed. Even if the situation doesn't resolve itself the way you had hoped, remember that you did the right thing. To forgive is a noble action, and it's one that you won't regret.


Remember that forgiveness is a process. Just saying that you forgive someone does not make it true. You will need to work towards it, little by little, each day. However, saying it out loud will help you to stand by your decision.

Reflect on whether it was a true lie.,
Does the other person acknowledge he or she lied?,
Is the other person willing to talk about it?,
Why the lie?,
Is the other person sorry?,
Is he or she willing to make amends?,
Everyone lies.,
Forgiving means ""moving on"".,
Take a leap of faith and trust again.,
Do not confuse forgiveness for trust.,
Forgiving without a person apologizing.,
Reflect on whether you are too quick to forgive, or too slow to let go of a grudge.",How to Forgive Someone Who Lied to You," A lie is a deliberate deception. Being told something you believe is not true is painful, but take the time (if possible) to determine if the person deliberately deceived you. There are some untruths that may not actually be a lie. For instance:


Your friend said he signed up for pottery class with you, but he did not get into the class. You think maybe he lied, but in talking with him discover there was not room enough for everyone who signed up. Or it conflicted with a required class for him.
Maria said to you she is not attracted to girls. Later, you find out she kissed Gabrielle in the past. Maybe that kiss actually convinced her she really is not attracted to girls. Or she might not be honest to herself. Or she really is not sure, she might be exploring her own feelings.
Your stepmother claims she did not take your earrings. You know she is wearing them. It turns out your father gave her a pair that looks just like yours, and she mixed them up.;
, If the other person denies lying, it is difficult to move towards forgiveness.


Be very, very careful of accusing another person of lying. Be sure you have explored Step #1 first.
If you have a good relationship with the other person, try to give the other person a way to ""save face"". In other words, a graceful way to tell the truth without looking bad. Example: Your friend lied about placing first in a swimming championship. You know she actually placed third, and asks if she is mixing her story up with last year, when she placed first. By doing so, she can correct her story without embarrassment--and the truth is still told.

, It is much easier to forgive someone if he or she communicates to you about the deceit. The situation may determine if you can or should make an effort to make it easier for the other person to talk about it or not. For example:


Your usually get along great with your twin, but he lied about a minor but annoying thing. You approach him gently at a time when he is more relaxed and open to talking to you.
You were stood up; she lied about wanting to go on a date with you. She admits that to you but will not give any coherent reason. You decide that is a lousy way to treat you, and if she really wants forgiveness, she knows how to get in touch with you.

, It helps to know the reason behind the lie, if there is one. Sometimes the reason is selfish and petty. Other times, the reason might actually be rather lofty. If you can understand the reason behind the lie, it may clarify to you whether you can forgive or not.


A lie may be there for a lofty reason. For example, some people grew up not knowing they were adopted because adoptive parents wanted them to feel just as valued as biological children. It still may be hurtful, but it may help to understand it was in an attempt to protect you.
You can forgive a selfish lie. Your friend may have lied about taking your shoes, but if she came clean and made amends, it may be easier to forgive her.
It is usually up to the liar to explain the lie. In general, the person who lied to you needs to explain why he or she lied. ""I don't know"" is generally not useful in gaining your forgiveness. Younger children, special needs individuals, and the like sometimes may require a caregiver to help moderate this conversation.

, If the lair is contrite, that is a factor often in favor of forgiving the liar. But that does not mean you must or even should. Some factors to consider:


It is OK to forgive and still be angry. You might forgive your little sister for lying about eating your chocolate, but you can still be angry about it.
If a person lies, and is unrepentant about it, you are under no obligation to forgive.
If the liar is sorry, you still do not have to forgive. Generally it is a good idea to do so, but the choice is yours. Forgiveness is not automatic just because the other person is sorry.
Sometimes truly deceitful people will sometimes pretend to be sorry. If there is reason to believe this is the case, be careful.
Even if the other person is genuinely sorry, some grave matters may not or should not be forgiven in the sense of ""everything between us completely is all right again"". For instance, if you are sexually assaulted, you have every right to cut off all contact and be angry at that person even if you move on with your life.

, Sometimes there are actions a person can make to help repair the damage he or she has made. This can go a long way to earning your forgiveness. This request can be made by you or the other person. The action should make logical sense, be roughly proportional to the misdeed, and make your situation whole. For example:


Your friend has to also come clean and apologize to another friend affected by a lie.
Your cousin has to pay for the replacement bike seat.
Your camp bunk-mate is the one that has to get a pie to the face at Skit Night for lying about who left the fake spider on the toilet.

, It is just a fact of the human condition. Everyone bends or breaks the truth sometimes -- nobody is immune. Even you. You have lied and have been forgiven in the past. And it is something that is necessary when dealing with people.

, Forgiving means that you are willing to move on from the offending act. You are willing to give the person another chance. It means you are looking forward to the future rather than dwelling on the past.


Forgive does not necessarily mean forget. You have to act as if the lie never happened. Repeated lies (or other offensive actions) are something you can and should monitor, and increasingly be less forgiving about.
While you have a right to remember past wrongs, true forgiveness means you also do not bring up something you say you forgave again and again. If you are doing that, you are saying you forgive the lie without actually doing so.

, Trusting again can be very, very hard. Someone told a lie, and here you are trusting him or her to not do it again! It is a very vulnerable position that is not guaranteed to always work. Here's some things to consider:


If you hold onto a grudge, you will find yourself lonely. Everyone messes up, lies, and so on. If you cannot forgive, you will not be able to deal with imperfect people.
Be careful about being ""right"". Some people would rather be in the right than happy. You might be entirely right about not forgiving your stepbrother about that lie. But are you really going to be happy going your entire life not forgiving him, ever?

, Forgiving is not the same as trusting again. It is up to the other person to demonstrate trustworthiness again. And that can sometimes be earned back, and sometimes not. For example:


You might forgive your sister for lying about borrowing your iPod, and breaking it, but you are not going to trust it with her again anytime soon, either.
Your wife cheats on you. You both reconcile, and the marriage is better than before. Still, she knows she must communicate with you about things like coming home late from work. The trust is back, but only because she is willing to be transparent in a way she was not before.

, Sometimes, a person cannot apologize for a lie. It is possible to forgive without a conversation or apology, but this is often more difficult because you may have to go through this process alone without the other person. It may be advisable to work with a counselor, religious leader, or psychologist to help.


For example, you are angry your grandmother lied about a family secret...your Aunt Cassie is really your biological mother. But Nana she died years ago. You want to give up your anger and forgive her. Cassie helps you to realize at the time, being a teenage unwed mother was taboo. Nana set up the ""aunt"" story so she could avoid a stigma, be a part of your life, and keep the family intact. Realizing that, you can forgive Nana the lie. You feel so much better.
Your friend stole money from you, and lied about it. She will not speak to you now. You have good reason to believe she has a drug problem. You are still angry and upset about it. With your pastor, you realize she has a serious health issue, one that causes such behavior. You forgive her for having an addiction, and letting that hurt go. You will not give her money ever again, however!

, Ideally, before moving on, reflect on whether it is wise to forgive. Forgiving a person for lying is a complicated and emotional process. And it can take experience, maturity, and time to really judge things well. So taking a moment to go over these steps can slow down this process. Some key questions to consider:


Am I holding on to anger to the point it is doing me no good?
Is my not forgiving affecting innocent people, like friends or family members?
Am I being gullible?
Would talking to a trusted person about the situation help?
Am I forgiving...but not holding the other person accountable for my hurt feelings or making good on the damage done? Am I being a doormat?
How many times has this happened before? Zero? Twice? Every week?

, Although you may hold resentment towards more than one person, it’s best to focus on one person at a time. For that matter, if you are harboring resentment towards someone who has hurt you numerous times, focus on each experience individually. This could require many forgiveness meditation sessions, but it will help you let go completely of each negative experience.

, Make sure you won’t be disturbed, and that there are no distractions, such as ringing phones or noisy traffic.

, If possible, set aside an entire afternoon or evening for the entire process. You need to be calm and centered before you begin the meditation, and you will need to rest for a few hours when the meditation is over.


Take a shower.
Put on comfortable clothing. White clothing is preferable because the color is associated with purity.
Do not eat for at least 3 hours before beginning your meditation.

, Darken the room, light candles and play soft, melodic music.

, Keep your spine straight. Close your eyes.

, This will relieve stress and tension and have a calming effect.


Starting with your left foot, contract the muscles and hold for 5 seconds and then release. Continue this process methodically; right foot, left and right calves and thighs, buttocks, stomach, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, face and scalp.

, This “inner smile” is so calming and peaceful; you will be able to feel the physiological changes in your body.

, Breathe in gently and say mentally, “breathe in.” Exhale gently while mentally saying, “breathe out.” Continue gently focusing on your breath for at least 5 minutes.

, You cannot forgive and love others if you don’t first forgive and love yourself. While you are completely relaxed and focused on your breath, begin a series of short statements that affirm your spirituality and loving nature. Mentally say one statement with your in breath and one statement with your out breath. Do this for 10 minutes. You can make any statement you like that feels comfortable to you. Here are some examples of simple affirming statements:


I am a spiritual being (inhale). I am filled with love (exhale).
I am one with spirit (inhale). I give love freely (exhale).
I honor myself (inhale). As I honor others (exhale).

, Form an image in your mind of that person wearing white, flowing robes. Picture him or her as relaxed and smiling. See the person in the most positive light you can imagine.

, You and this person are meeting on a spiritual plane where there is only love.


Walk slowly to the person and quietly say, “I forgive you.”
Continue to talk to the person, using only loving, forgiving statements, such as: “I am sorry we argued,” “I wish you love and happiness,” “I have only love and peace to offer you.”
Keep talking to the person for as long as you feel it is necessary. At some point during this imaginary conversation, you will start to feel a release; your anger and resentment will begin to fade. When you feel at peace with the process, begin saying goodbye to the person.
Extend your hands to them and say, “The highest good in me sees the highest good in you.”
Take their hands in yours and say, “My peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you.”

,, Lie still and quietly for another few minutes while you gently breathe.

,, Stretch or do some yoga postures to refresh your body.

, The sleep will be healing and peaceful when you are in this loving frame of mind."

Move forward instead of looking back.",How to Forgive and Forget," If you want to ever really forgive the person who wronged you, then you have to kick all of those bitter and resentful feelings to the curb. Let go of the part of you that hates the other person or wishes him or her harm or failure; if you hang on to these negative feelings, then they will plague your own life and make it hard for you to find happiness, so the sooner you see that letting go of your resentment is the right thing to do, the better.


Sure, the person really hurt you, but if you waste energy in resenting the person, then you’ll only be letting that person cause you even more harm. Take the higher ground and let go of those nasty feelings.
It’s better if you admit that you’re feeling resentment first instead of being in denial about it. Talk about your feelings to a friend. Write them down. Do what you have to do to get them out there so you can get rid of them faster.;
, In the moment, you may feel that the person absolutely ruined your life or made you feel absolutely miserable. Okay, so maybe one of your friends forgot to invite you to her party; maybe your significant other said something hurtful to you in the heat of the moment. Could they have done something a lot worse? Will whatever they did really cause you pain in another few weeks – or in another few months? Chances are that sure, you’ve been hurt, but that it’s not the end of the world.


It may feel like the end of the world, just then. But if you give yourself time to cool off, you’ll see that it’s not so.
Take a step back and look at your life. Filled with mostly good things, right? Was the thing the person did to you really bad enough to put all of that in jeopardy?

, Think of yourself as a student instead of a victim. It’s convenient, and even safe, to think of yourself as a victim when someone has wronged you, but instead, try to put a positive spin on the situation and see if there’s something that you can really learn from the experience. Maybe you’ll learn not to be so trusting. Maybe you’ll learn not to get into a situation where your gut tells you get away. Even if you’re feeling hurt or upset, the situation can shape your future interactions, and may help you not get hurt as you move forward.


At the time, it’s easy to think that the experience has only been a bad one. But if you truly process what happened, it can lead to something positive in the future.
If you accept that there’s a lesson to be learned, then you’ll be less likely to resent the person for hurting you.

, Try to see the situation from that person’s perspective. Maybe your boyfriend didn’t tell you that he took a weekend trip with his friends because he knows you’re prone to jealousy. Maybe your best friend didn’t tell you about her new relationship because she’s afraid you’ll judge her. Or maybe the person who hurt you really didn’t mean to do it and is feeling really, really horrible about everything that happened.


Remember that there are two sides to every story. You may feel like the complete victim, but you might have hurt the person, too.
It may feel silly to feel sorry for someone who messed up. But think of the times when you’ve hurt people and really, really regretted your actions. There’s a chance that the person is feeling even worse than you are.

, You may be really hurt by whatever your mother, sister, significant other, or friend did to you, but try to think about all of the great things that person did for you too. You may want to get dramatic and think that the entire relationship was a huge mistake and that every interaction with the person who hurt you has caused you nothing but pain, but that is rarely the case. Try warming up to the person by thinking of all the times that person really was a good friend, support system, or shoulder to cry on.


Make a list of all of the great things the person did for you and all of the memories you shared. Refer to it when you’re feeling angry or resentful if you need to.
Hey, if you’ve thought long and hard about all of the good things the person has done for you and you really can’t come up with anything, then maybe you really are better off without the person in your life. But this will rarely happen. If the person didn’t do that much for you to begin with, then you wouldn’t be so angry after he or she hurt you, would you?

, Look at the flipside. Remember that time two years ago when you accidentally told your best friend you thought she was a follower? Or that time that you completely forgot your sister’s birthday and went drinking with your friends instead? Chances are that you’ve caused some pain in the past, and the person managed to get over it. Relationships are long and complicated, and it’s likely that pain has been caused by both sides.


Remind yourself of how you felt after you hurt the person– and how much you wanted to be forgiven.

, Studies have shown that being unforgiving and dwelling on the injustices that were done to you can actually raise your blood pressure, increase your heart rate, make your muscles more tense, and lead you to be much more stressed out than if you worked on forgiving the person instead. Cultivating feelings of forgiveness has been shown to make people feel calmer and more emotionally stable. So, if you want to be selfish about it, then know that forgiving the person will actually make you feel better physically and mentally. And who doesn’t want that?The longer you hold on to your angry feelings, the worse your body and mind will feel. And why do that to yourself?
Remember that forgiveness really is a choice. You can decide to start forgiving, and to stop harboring all of those feelings of ill-will in your body, as soon as you want. Yes, forgiveness is a process, but there’s no need to hold it off.

, Even if you make the decision to start forgiving today, it doesn’t mean that you have to call up the person who hurt you and talk about it right away. If you’re still so angry, hurt, sad, or disappointed that you can barely see straight, or that you just don’t quite feel like yourself, then it’s perfectly okay to take some time to think about it. The person may be rushing to talk to you and to make things right, but calmly explain that you do want to talk about it, and that you need a bit more time to process everything.


Giving yourself a bit of time to heal and reflect can help you figure out what to say to the person when you do talk and can keep you from getting too angry and saying something that you’ll regret.

, Talk to the person and make sure that he or she is truly sorry and that his or her feelings are truly genuine. Make eye contact with the person and see that he or she is being really sincere and feels true remorse for what happened. If the person is saying sorry just to say it, then you’ll know. Once you see that the person really cares, then be honest and say that you do accept the apology if you mean it. Let the person talk and evaluate the words, and if you think it’s time to accept the apology, then say so.


Remember that there’s a difference between accepting the person’s apology and forgiving him or her fully on the spot. You can accept an apology and then give yourself more time to get over it.
If you’re trying to accept the apology but just can’t do it, be honest. Tell the person that you want to be able to accept and forgive, but that you just can’t do it yet.

, Talk about how the person has hurt you. Share all of your pain, your feelings, and your doubts. Make the person see how much his or her actions have really affected you and how much you’ve thought it all over. There’s no need to talk just to make the person feel even worse, but if you want to get something off your chest, then now’s the time. If you just accept the apology and don’t talk about what happened, then you’re much more likely to be angry and bitter for longer.


You don’t have to be mean about it. Just say something like, “I’ve really been feeling terrible because…” or “I’m having a hard time dealing with the fact that…”

, You can talk to the person, share your feelings, and accept the apology, but that doesn’t mean you have to go back to being BFF right away. If you need to take a week, a month, or even more time than that off, away from the person, then be honest about it. Say something like, “I really do want to rebuild our relationship, but I’m going to need to take some time to come to terms with what happened on my own first.” It’s okay to go at your own pace.


If a month has passed and you still can’t bring yourself to see the person, that’s fine. If another month has passed – and then another – and you still can’t do it, then you may have to consider whether or not it’s even possible to repair your relationship with the person.

, You may not be feeling very compassionate toward a person after he or she has harmed you. But if you want to rebuild your relationship more quickly and make both of you feel better, then you have to show compassion for how the person is feeling. Think about how terrible the person feels for hurting you and recognize that nobody’s perfect; the person is likely suffering a lot without your love and kindness, and that’s surely taking a toll on him or her. Even if you were wronged, you should take the high road and recognize that the person is upset, too.


If anything, you can feel sorry for the person. He or she must not be in a very good place if he or she had hurt you so badly.

, Take things slow with the person and work on repairing your relationship. You may not trust the person right away and you may have some doubts about whether or not you can continue to be friends or to date each other, and that’s perfectly normal. Take things slow and hang out in low-pressure situations while giving each other space to be alone, too. Don’t open up completely to the person and have less intense conversations until you feel comfortable sharing.


This may not feel as great as your relationship used to be, but if you want to go back to how things were before you were hurt, then you’ll have to take baby steps to get there.

, So you’ve tried everything. You’ve given yourselves time apart. You’ve shared your feelings with the person who hurt you. You’ve shown compassion and have considered the situation from that person’s perspective. You’ve tried hanging out in low-pressure situations. But no matter what you do, you can’t stop thinking about how hurt you are, being angry with the person, and doubting that you’ll ever be able to fully trust him again. Though this is unpleasant, it’s perfectly natural, and if you can’t get over it, then it’s better to admit that than to be in denial about how you feel.


Sometimes the pain is so deep that you won’t be able to brush it aside and act like nothing happened. Now you have to decide – even though you can’t forget the pain, will you be able to find a way to deal with it that allows you to still spend time with the person who hurt you?
Accept it if you can’t keep being with the person. Maybe the wound was so deep that being with the person feels like picking the scab all over again. If you really just can’t get over it, then there’s no point in forcing something that just isn’t there anymore.

, Make sure to have other things on your mind while you’re working on rebuilding your relationship. Spend more time running and training for that 10K next month. Work on finishing that short story you’ve been working on forever so you can submit it to a local contest. Enjoy your relationships with people who haven’t hurt you. Find something else that makes you really happy and that you can look forward to, and you’ll spend less time feeling the pain.


One day, you may look as see that hey, the pain is no longer there anymore. You might have thought that would never happen, right?
Staying busy will keep you moving forward and having positive things to look forward to. If you give yourself too much time to wallow, you’ll only feel worse and will be less likely to forget what happened.

, Though staying busy and active will help you heal faster, you shouldn’t be so busy that you don’t have a second to breathe or think about what happened to you. Make sure you have time for “me time,” that you can write in a journal about your feelings, or that you can just take some time to turn off your computer, television, and phone and focus on just inhabiting your own mind and body. Being quiet with yourself can help you figure out how you really feel about the situation; the faster you know exactly what you think, the faster you can move forward.


Plan a weekly or bi-weekly date with yourself when you have nothing to do but spend time with yourself. This will help you calm down, think, and get rid of those angry feelings.

, You may be so hurt that you want to get the person who hurt you back to make him or her feel the same pain that you felt. However, this will only make you feel more stressed out, angry, and bitter, and it won’t solve anything. If you really feel the need to seek vengeance, then know that the best revenge you can get is just to live a great, accomplished life, to be happy, and to not let what happened get to you in the end. This may not sound as sweet as slapping the person in the face or hurting him or her the same way they hurt you, but in the end, you’ll feel much better for being your best self instead of stooping down to that person’s level. Just live your life and enjoy being yourself and doing the things you love to do. If you spend all your time trying to make the person who hurt you feel terrible, then you’ll never be able to go on.

, Focus on the future and all that it holds for you – whether the person who hurt you is in it or not. If all you do is wallow in the past and think about all of the ways that you were wronged and that life hasn’t been fair for you, then you’ll never be able to forgive and forget. Instead, have gratitude for all of the people who do make your life great and all of the opportunities you have and think about all of the wonderful things that lie ahead.


Focus on the goals you want to meet in the future that will make your life even better. Make a plan for achieving them instead of thinking about all of the things that went wrong for you.
Continue to work on yourself. Improve those things you want to work on and see how much better you feel as you become a more caring, compassionate, and well-rounded person.
You have made a choice to forgive and forget, and you should be proud of yourself for doing that, even if it takes longer than you hoped to get there.

Realize the pitfalls of perfection.",How to Eliminate Guilt," Guilt can be productive; it can help us grow and mature and, most importantly, learn from our behavior when we offend or hurt others or ourselves. This type of guilt serves a purpose and encourages us to redirect our moral and/or behavioral compass.For example, if you said something offensive to a close friend over which you feel guilty because it upset them, you will learn not to say those types of things or else you risk losing friends. In other words, you will learn from your mistake. In this sense, then, the guilt has worked productively to positively reshape your behavior.To give another example, if you feel guilty because you ate an entire bag of chips, that's your brain's way of reminding you about a behavior you probably already know is unhealthy and can adversely affect your well-being. Thus, the rational feeling of guilt motivates you to reflect on and change your behavior for the better.;
, Guilt can also be unproductive, in the sense that you feel guilt even when your behavior doesn't need reflection or transformation. This is irrational guilt that can devolve into a cycle where you begin to feel guilty when there is nothing to feel guilty about and you then ruminate on that guilt.For example, many first-time parents worry about going back to work because they think leaving their child with a nanny or in daycare will cause unknown damage to their child's mental and physical development. In reality, however, that's just not the case; in fact, most children develop normally irrespective of whether one or both parents work. There's nothing to really feel guilty about in this situation, but many people do, nevertheless. Put differently, this feeling of guilt doesn't produce anything but more irrational guilt.Unproductive guilt can have adverse effects on your cognitive well-being. For example, you may become overly self-critical, experience low self-esteem, and doubt your self-worth., It is important to recognize that sometimes we feel guilty for things over which we had no control, such as a car crash or not arriving in time to say goodbye to a loved one before he passed. Sometimes people involved in such traumatic events overestimate their knowledge of the event and what they could have done. In other words, these individuals think they could or should have done something but, in reality, could not have.These intense feelings of guilt can produce feelings of helplessness and a feeling of having lost control.For example, perhaps you feel guilty that you survived a car accident, while your friend was killed. This is known as survivor's guilt, which often emerges when we try to explain and make sense of traumatic events that we experience. In the case of serious guilt, you may want to seek professional help from a therapist who can help you work through your feelings of guilt., Engage in self-exploration to really get in touch with your feelings and to determine that it is guilt that you are experiencing and not another emotion. Studies using MRI scans of the brain have shown that guilt is an emotion that is distinct from shame or sadness. At the same time, these studies show that shame and sadness were often also present and correlate with guilt. Thus, it is important that you spend some time reflecting on your feelings in order to precisely pinpoint what you need to address.Define your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, and body sensations.You can do this cognitively, through the practice of mindfulness, meaning that you just focus on what you're feeling in that moment without judgement or reaction.
Alternatively, you can write your feelings down in a journal. Writing out what you're experiencing can help you clarify those emotions as you try to put them into words.
Example: I am feeling overwhelmed today with guilt, and I also feel sad. I can't stop thinking about it. I can tell that I’m stressed because I have a tension headache, tension in my shoulders, and a nervous feeling in my stomach.


, Think about what is causing these guilty feelings. Again, consider writing everything down to begin the process of working through the feeling of guilt.Here are some examples:


""I let Fido out and he got run over by a car. I feel guilty that Fido is now dead because our whole family loved him so much.""
""I didn't study for the exam and I got an F. I feel guilty that I let my parents down because they pay so much for me to go to school.""
""I broke up with Bobby. I feel guilty that he hurts so much.""
""My friend's mom passed away, and my mom is still alive and healthy. I feel guilty because my friend's life is in pieces and mine is perfect.""

, You will have to accept that you cannot change the past or what has happened.Acceptance also involves acknowledging difficulty and recognizing that you are able to withstand painful feelings in the present moment. This is the first stage in dealing appropriately with your guilt and moving forward. It is helpful to tell yourself affirming statements that emphasize acceptance and tolerance. Examples of these statements are:""I know dealing with guilt is hard, but for now I know I can endure.""
""This is difficult, but I can accept what has happened and not fight or avoid this feeling - it is what it is.""

, If your guilt stems from something you did that affected someone else negatively, the first step is to make amends with that person.Although a sincere apology may not eliminate your feelings of guilt, it can start the process by providing a time for you to express how truly sorry you are.


Arrange a time to speak with the other person and offer a genuine apology for your actions or inactions. Make amends sooner, rather than later.Remember that just because you offer an apology doesn't mean that the other person has to accept it. You cannot control how the person will react or what he will do with what you've said. However, for yourself, realize that this is just the first stage of eliminating your guilt. Although the person may not accept your apology, you can feel proud of accepting and recognizing your guilt and responsibility and for actively showing remorse and demonstrating empathy., In cases where the guilt is productive, make a commitment to change your behavior to avoid a repeat of the situation and, in turn, the guilt you feel.For example, you can't bring back your dog Fido, but you can make sure not to let future pets out of the house unless on a leash. Or, in the case where you failed an exam, you can make a commitment to dedicating more time to studying so that your parents' money isn't going to waste.


In some cases, you may not have any behavior to change, but you can still change your outlook for the better. For example, you can't bring back your friend's mother who passed away from cancer, but you can make sure that you offer your support to her as she grieves and make sure that you also let your own mother know how much she means to you.

, With guilt, people often feel shame for something they did or did not do. Even once you've made amends with others, you may still hold onto the guilt inside yourself and engage in rumination. So, you also need to make amends with yourself. Learning to forgive yourself is an important tool to help restore your self-esteem that may have been damaged by guilt or shame and move on.


Trying writing a letter to yourself. Writing a letter to your younger or past-self can be a powerful emotional and cognitive tool to start the process of self-forgiveness.Using a kind, loving tone, remind your other-self that our past often offers valuable learning opportunities and it builds empathy for others. Remind yourself that how you acted or what you did may have been all you knew to do in that moment. Consider the closing of the letter, or confession, a symbolic closing to the situation. You have accepted, confronted, and made amends for your guilt. It is now time to let it go.

, Guilt can be a productive tool to help you change behavior or build empathy, so transforming statements of guilt into statements of gratitude adds worth to the experiences and helps you alter how you view the past. It also aids the process of healing from guilt and turning unproductive guilt into something productive and tangible that can improve your life.Write down the guilt phrases/thoughts you have, and turn each into a gratitude statement. Guilt statements often start with ""I should have..."", ""I could have...,"" ""I can't believe I...,"" and ""Why didn't I..."" Turn these statements into phrases that emphasize what you are thankful for.
Example: Change ""I should not have been so critical of my husband when we were together"" into ""I am grateful I can learn to be less critical in my future relationships.""
Example: Change ""Why didn’t I stop drinking? My drinking because my family to fall apart"" into ""I am grateful that I can learn to stop drinking with help and make amends with my family.""

, An affirmation is a positive statement meant to be encouraging and uplifting. Employing this method can help your restore your sense of self-worth and self-compassion, which is often eroded by shame and guilt. Build compassion every day by saying, writing, or thinking affirmations. Some examples of affirmations include:""I am a good person and deserve the best despite my past actions.""
""I am not perfect. I make mistakes, but I can learn from my past.""
""I'm human, just like everyone else.""

, The following statements can help you create alternative meaning for past actions and experiences that may be eliciting feelings of guilt. In turn, this process can help you change your thoughts in order to begin to eliminate the guilt. Try to remember the following when you fall into patterns of unproductive thinking or rumination about past deeds.Guilt can be an important learning tool for the future. Look for the lessons learned and know that life lessons make you wiser. For example, if you regret not treating your spouse with respect because you have seen first-hand that demeaning your partner can seriously harm a marriage, this knowledge will make you a wiser spouse in the future who has had to learn this lesson the hard way.

Feeling guilty about a past action can help build empathy because you recognize the harm that your past actions have caused, which can help you realize how you affect others. Remember that having the skill of empathy helps you to better understand the feelings of others. For instance, if you feel guilty about yelling at a friend after heavy drinking, you may be better able to recognize how your actions made this friend feel.

You can not change what happened in the past, but you can choose how your past affects your present and future. For example, you can't change that failed an exam, but you can make choice in the future that will not lead you down this same path.

, Striving for perfection in any one part of our lives is an unrealistic expectation. Mistakes are a part of life and are there to help us learn.Engage in activities that are positive and affirming, and where you have opportunities to do good. Allow yourself to see how the same mistake that made you feel guilty has now resulted in your being a better, more conscientious person.Rumination of negative, guilty feelings can lead to inappropriate levels of shame and self-loathing. If you do find yourself ruminating on your guilt to the point that this is affecting to your mental health and daily functioning, you should consult a mental health professional who can work with you on these cognitive restructuring strategies.

Understand that you have no control over rejection.,
Validate your strengths.,
Practice techniques to stop indulging in the negativity.,
Acknowledge your part.,
Declare a clean slate with the person.,
Choose to forgive the person.",How to Get Over It," The reason we hold onto resentment and other negative emotions in the first place is because we tend to replay an event and the events leading up to it over and over in our minds, causing us to relive the emotional impact.Much like other addictive states, we often feel compelled to replay the event from which the negativity stems as opposed to choosing to do so. Understanding these emotions as an addictive state of mind is, therefore, a big first step to letting them go., One of the biggest reasons we hold onto negativity and replay the events is because we think we’ll eventually get the justice we deserve from the impactful event.In addition to realizing that reliving the source of the negativity is an addictive state of mind, you should also try to realize that you will never change the past by replicating old drama., Negativity can easily be tied to certain feelings as well as people. You may resent someone who makes you feel a negative emotion in one instance because someone else in your past used to make you feel similarly on several occasions. By trying to examine the source of the negative emotions, you can determine if it’s even truly tied to the person with whom you’re quarreling at all., Whether you were actually rejected by a former significant other or simply feel as though you were rejected by being slighted or having your feelings invalidated, getting over it requires understanding that you have no control over being rejected.Much like realizing that you cannot change the past, realizing that you cannot control those who rejected you is about learning the futility of beating yourself up over something that is impossible to alter.

, Part of the reason people hold onto resentment or grudges is because despite feeling slighted or taken advantage of, we also feel powerful over being wronged in the form of righteous indignation over what we perceive as unfair treatment. This is still a type of strength drawing from negativity, though, and you should instead try to validate your real strengths that come from a positive place., One of the hardest parts of getting over anything whether it’s resentment, a break up, a loss, or even depression is to develop the self-awareness required to remain logical about the emotions you feel. This allows you to evaluate when a negative emotion creeps in, making it easier to shut down before it takes hold.


Some of the most effective techniques for this stem from the practice of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).CBT often focuses on cognitive distortions—such as understanding the illogical source of your negativity but feeling it regardless—and how to help eliminate them. You can learn more about CBT at: How to Use Cognitive Behavioral Theory.

, In many instances, we get so wrapped up in negativity over an event that we become blind to any part we may have played in the outcome. Once you’ve separated the things you have no control over, it’s easier to acknowledge your part in the event because you could have controlled that, and having awareness of that now will make the same mistakes easier to avoid in the future.


Even if you feel as though you really were not at fault in your specific situation, you may have allowed the negative situation to go on longer than you should have, and you can still learn to be more assertive in the future based on that.Just as crucial as acknowledging any part you played in the negative event, you must also forgive yourself for it.The important thing—as with all negative experiences—is how you use it to learn and grow for the future.
By moving away from your role solely as a victim, you also remove the control the person or event has had over your life., Forming new experiences with a person in order to put the past behind you is another important step. You’re more likely to replay the source of your negativity if you leave it as one of your final interactions with the person. In situations where it’s appropriate to remain in contact with the person, declare a clean slate, so you can begin building toward the future of the relationship rather dwelling on the past., When you’re ready, make the active choice to forgive the person.Though forgiveness and forgetting ultimately take time, remember that they’re acts you perform for yourself so that you can move on from a positive space. Always think of the acts in this light rather than as a form of surrender to the cause of the negativity; getting over it is not capitulation."

We can't be vague, or speak in generalities. Once you have named a specific type of behavior, or even one specific event of your mother's, we now have something to work with.;

Acknowledge the benefits of regret.,
Identify the source of your regret.,
Write about your feelings.,
Consider talking to a therapist.",How to Deal with Regret1," Regret may seem like a completely negative thing, but it can have some benefits as well. Try to look at regret as a life lesson and look at the feelings of regret as motivation to do things differently.Although regret can be unpleasant, keep in mind that it has a function. Regret can even save your life. For example, if you regret using drugs and having to go to rehab to recover from your addiction, keep in mind that this event may have saved your life. If you had continue to use drugs and had not entered a rehab facility, then you might have died of an overdose.;
, Before you can deal with your regret, you will need to identify the source. What is it that you feel regretful about? It is one big thing or lots of little things? What do you wish you had done differently?


Some of the most common regrets that people have are related to education, career, romance, and finances.Take some time to think about what you regret and why you have those regrets. If you like, you can write down your regrets.

, You may have lots of different emotions relating to the thing or things that you regret. You might feel sad, angry, confused, or cheated about the decisions you once made and your inability to change them. Write about all of the things you are feeling in as much detail as you would like.Writing about your feelings is a great way to vent and relieve stress related to holding these feelings in.

, Dealing with your feelings of regret can be a long, intensive process. You may not be able to overcome them on your own, especially if you have regrets about something major or if you feel powerless to do anything about your regrets. You might want to consider finding a therapist who can help you to work through your feelings of regret."

Determine if there is anything you can do to change the situation.,
Use what you have learned to help you with future decisions.,
Look for a role model.,
Set goals for your future.",How to Deal with Regret2," In some cases, you may be able to do something to reduce the impact of your regret. Consider whether there is anything that you can do to move in the direction that you would like to go.For example, if you regret not taking a job that was offered to you a few years ago, consider whether that job is still an option for you now. Or, if you regret not finishing your degree, consider whether continuing your education is still an option.
You might even be able to minimize feelings of regret by making an apology to someone. For example, if you feel regret about not spending much time with your kids when they were growing up, consider telling them how you feel and offering a sincere apology for not being there.
Changing your situation or even making an apology may not always be an option. In these cases, you may need to find ways to let go of your regret and move on with your life. This can be quite difficult, but it is possible., Having regret can also be a benefit. You may be able to use what you learned from your regret to make better decisions in the future.Try to identify some concrete lessons that you learned from the things that you regret and think about how you can apply these lessons to future situations.
For example, if you made the mistake of overusing your credit cards when you were in college and ended up with a lot of debt, then you can use that knowledge and decide to be more cautious about using credit cards later on in life.

, You may have an idea of how you want your life to look now as a result of your decisions. You might even know someone who seems to have everything that you want and you can use this person as role model. Think about what this person does differently from you and how you can use their actions as a model.For example, if you wish that you had been more family-focused than work focused, find a role model who puts her family first and pay attention to what she does. You can use her behavior as a model for your own behavior going forward.

, Another great way to move forward from regret is to set goals for your future. By setting goals for yourself, you can give yourself something to work towards rather than constantly beating yourself up over past mistakes.Try to relate your goals to what you regret in some way. For example, if you regret not making more time for your hobbies because of your personal and professional obligations, then make a goal to dedicate one afternoon per week to your hobbies.
Make sure that the goals you set are realistic and manageable. For example, it might be overwhelming to set a goal to learn to speak French fluently by the end of the year. However, you could set the goal to take a French class or listen to language instruction CDs during your commute.

Think about how the situation might have been worse.,
Focus on the positive aspects.,
Practice gratitude in your daily life.,
Try meditation.",How to Deal with Regret3," It might be possible for you to feel better about regret if you consider how the situation might have been worse. You can do this by looking at the hardships that other people have suffered and noticing how some people have been worse off than you.For example, you might feel regret about not pursuing a college degree, but perhaps you know someone who got his degree and then could not find work in that field. That person might have suffered even more than you because he was landed with high student loan payments and could not find a job with high enough wages to be able to pay the loans off.

, Regret has a negative impact on our emotions, but we can also gain lots of positive things through these experiences. Consider what positive aspects came you’re your experience.For example, perhaps you regret your marriage and wish you had married someone else. But you can look at what you gained from the marriage, such as kids, more self-knowledge, stability, etc.
Identifying the positive aspects of some situations can be difficult. You may need to look at things that happened after the experience to find the positive. For example, you may regret driving drunk and losing your license, but perhaps the experience led you to seek help for a drinking problem and you gained new friends and a better outlook on life as a result.

, Practicing gratitude is a great way to increase your feelings of happiness and satisfaction with your life. Practicing gratitude can also help to relieve stress and other negative emotions.Practicing gratitude on a daily basis may also help you to stop dwelling on your feelings of regret and look at positive aspects of your life instead.


To practice gratitude, try making a list of five things that you are grateful for. The following day, add five more things to the list. Keep doing this every day.
You can start your list with basics such as, your health, your family, a place to live, food on the table, etc. As your list goes on, you might try to add less obvious things, such as a good cup of coffee, the sound of birds singing outside your window, or an unexpected phone call from a friend.

, If you are preoccupied by regret then you are probably focused on the past and what could have been. Meditation can help you to calm your mind and focus only on the present instead of the past. Try incorporating meditation into your daily routine to quiet your mind when it begins to ruminate on the things you regret.You don’t need to meditation for hours. Even five minutes of meditation every day can make a difference in your outlook on life.

Recognize the kind of guilt you have and its purpose.,
Forgive yourself.,
Make amends or changes as soon as possible.,
Start a journal.Writing journal entries about the details, feelings, and memories of the situation can help you learn about yourself and your actions.,
Accept you did something wrong, but move on.",How to Deal with Guilt1," Guilt is a useful emotion when it is helping us grow and learn from our behavior that has been offensive or hurtful to ourselves or others. When guilt arises from hurting another or having a negative impact that could have been prevented, we are being signaled to change that behavior (or else risk the consequences). This guilt, ""proportionate” guilt can be a guide for redirecting behavior and adjusting our sense of what's acceptable and what isn't.


For example, if your guilt is from spreading rumors about a co-worker so that you will get a promotion in their place, you'll feel proportionate guilt. If you simply got this promotion for being more qualified and feel guilty anyway, then you are dealing with disproportionate guilt.;
, Forgiving oneself, like forgiving another, can be a difficult process. Steps that are important in the process of self-forgiveness include:Acknowledgement of the actual hurt caused without exaggerating or minimizing what happened.
Addressing the degree to which you were responsible for this harm – there may have been something you could have done differently, but you may not be responsible for everything. Overestimating your responsibility can prolong guilt longer than necessary.
Understanding your state of mind at the time of the harmful action(s)
Dialogue with the other(s) who were negatively impacted by your actions. A heartfelt apology can go a long way. It is important that you and the other(s) know that you are aware of the damage done and are clear on what actions will be taken (if any) over and above apologizing.

, Staying guilty instead of making necessary repairs or amends is how we punish ourselves.Unfortunately, this behavior will only keep you feeling too ashamed to take the action that can really help. Making restorative changes means swallowing your pride and trusting that others will be grateful for your work resolving the source of guilt.


If apologizing is how you'll make amends, try to avoid justifying what you did or pointing out the parts of the situation that you were not responsible for. Simply recognize the others' pain without the distraction of extra explanations or attempts to revisit the details of the situation.

It may be much easier to apologize for an offhanded remark that caused some pain. But when the behavior has spanned some time, say you ignored your partner's distress about your relationship for years, it will take more honesty and humility.



, Working to improve your behavior in the future is a great way to relieve guilt.Your entries might answer questions like the following:


How did you feel about yourself and everyone involved leading up to, during, and after the situation?
What were your needs at that time, and were they being met? If not, why not?
Did you have motives for this action? What or who was the catalyst for this behavior?
What are the standards of judgment in this situation? Are they your own values, your parents’, your friends’, your spouse’s, or coming from an institution like the law? Are these appropriate standards of judgment, and if so, how do you know?

, We know that it's impossible to change the past. So, after spending time learning from your actions and making amends and repairs wherever possible, it is important not to dwell for too long. Remind yourself that the sooner you are done feeling guilty, the sooner you can bring increased focus to other, more current parts of your life.


Another benefit of using a journal to deal with guilt is being able to keep track of your feelings to show yourself how quickly guilt can diminish once we attend to it.Especially important is making note of how making amends and repairing the situation has changed them. This will help you take pride in your progress and in the legitimate ways that you have used guilt positively.

Talk to the person, if you can.,
Consider the person’s point of view.,
Find closure for yourself.,
Make amends.You can enhance your own self-forgiveness by trying to make amends.,
Meet with a support group.",How to Forgive for Your Own Mental Health1," Forgiving someone does not mean that you are also forgetting what happened. You can choose to forgive someone’s actions when you feel ready, but it may take much longer to forget what happened. Deciding to forgive is something you do for yourself and you don’t always have to tell the person who wronged you that they are forgiven. However, you may find that speaking about the incident gives you the closure you need to move on. If you aren’t able to get in touch with the person, write a letter you may or may not send, or write down your “conversation” in a journal. This could be what you finally need to move on.


For example, say, “I just want you to know that I forgive you for what happened. This doesn’t mean I think what you did was OK, but I have decided for my own mental health, to let it go.” If you want to rekindle the relationship, then you can put that out there. If not, it’s OK to tell the person you don’t want to have contact anymore, but you still forgive them for what happened.;
, Taking a look at why the person did what they did may help you fully forgive. Was the person going through a stressful time? Did they misunderstand the situation that led to the incident? Examining what was going on with them could help you to learn how to prevent this from happening in the future.You may also want to think about the person’s past as you consider their point of view. For example, if you are trying to forgive a friend for betraying you, then consider what might have happened in their past that may have contributed to their behavior. Did they grow up in a dysfunctional family? Have they been betrayed by friends in the past? Identifying some of the potential causes of the person’s behavior may help you to develop empathy for them, which may make it easier for you to forgive them.

, Part of completely forgiving someone also includes forgiving yourself. You may have reacted in a way that you aren’t proud of when the situation occurred, or you may blame yourself for what happened. Allowing yourself to feel better can allow you to completely move on from the situation and improve your mental health.


For example, if your spouse was unfaithful, you may blame yourself for their betrayal. Understanding that what they did is not a reflection of your self-worth, and realizing that the affair isn’t your fault, can allow you to let go of any guilt or responsibility you may feel towards the situation., This may involve trying to rebuild your relationship with the person who hurt you or setting personal goals that help you to move forward from a trying situation. Whichever circumstance fits your case, making amends essentially involves action.


Try asking the person what you can do to make amends. It is important to get their feedback before doing anything because what seems like a good way to make amends to you might not fit with the other person’s expectations.
You might also take action to make amends with someone else by working on the shortcomings in the relationship. For example, if you forgave a spouse for infidelity, making amends may include attending couples' therapy and working on your communication to prevent future infidelity.
Or, another option is to take action to make amends with yourself by initiating personal change. For instance, if you had to forgive yourself for being cheated on, you might take more time before becoming emotionally involved in your next relationship in order to grow as an individual and learn your needs.

, If granting forgiveness to yourself or someone else is a difficult process, you can find assistance by participating in a support group. The type of group you join may depend on the circumstances. You may locate a group in your area or find one online.


If you were estranged from a parent, you might find others who are in similar situations. If you are coping with the end of a marriage after infidelity, you might find a support group for the divorced.

Right, first things first: you have to scale this problem from one to ten eg.,
Remember the good times and the bad.",How to Ease Regret," you think you said something stupid, I would rate that on my scale as a 2 or you cheated on your partner, I would scale that as a 8. This is all depending on the details of your situation.


If you have a regret under 5, it's probably not such a big deal and all you really need to do is think about it calmly. Remember, we all make mistakes and it's in our nature, if you just take a look around you will soon see there are plenty of people who mess up.
If it's something from 5 - 10, you have to calm down, sit with yourself and decide if it's something you can deal with or if you need some professional help.;
, You can learn from any situation and improve on them, but most importantly it shows you what you were like through the different stages of your life and how you've grown.


Just like tattoos, you got that memory of that phase in your life with you forever. You can always remove it but the scar will be there, so you might as well learn to appreciate that time, grow and learn from it. What else have you got to lose?

Recognize the kind of guilt you have and its purpose.,
Take stock of what you can control versus what you cannot.In a journal, write out the things that you truly have total control over.,
Examine your standards for achievement and helping others.,
Focus on quality, not quantity when helping others.,
Seek acceptance and compassion through mindfulness.Mindfulness and meditative practices can help you learn to observe your own mental processes, including the tendencies that keep guilt going, like self-blame and excessive self-criticism.Once you learn to observe these processes, you can start being more compassionate toward yourself, recognizing that these thoughts need not be taken seriously or acted upon.It can also be helpful to maintain close contact with loved ones who accept you as you are and display unconditional compassion for you.",How to Deal with Guilt2," Unlike the useful ""proportionate"" guilt that signals us to right our wrongdoings, disproportionate guilt usually comes from one of the following sources:Doing better than someone (survivor’s guilt).
Feeling that you didn’t do enough to help someone.
Something that you only think you did.
Something you didn’t do but that you want to do.

Take the example of feeling guilty for getting a promotion. If you spread nasty rumors about a co-worker in order to get it, this guilt is indeed warranted or proportionate to the action. But, if you simply got this promotion from having earned it and feel guilty anyway, then you are dealing with disproportionate guilt. This type of guilt serves no rational purpose., Also include those things you only have partial control. Blaming yourself for a mistake or incident that was only partially in your control means that you're angry at yourself for things that are beyond you.


Also helpful is to consider that you are not to blame for things you regret not doing, since you could not possibly have known then what you know now. You likely made the best judgment available to you at the time.
Remind yourself that you’re not to blame for surviving a tragedy that someone else, even someone close to you did not.
Recognize that you are not ultimately responsible for other people. Even if you have a great deal of love and concern for those in your life, they are charged with stepping up to ensure their own well-being (as you are with yours).

, Writing in a journal, ask yourself ask yourself if the behavioral ideals you set for yourself may be too high.Often times these standards are imposed on us from outside forces which may have helped us gain footing at an early age, but that now are so rigorous and unattainable that they cause great distress.


This also involves acknowledging the your right to protect and stand up for your own self-interests. Since we often feel guilty for not bending over backwards for others or sacrificing something we hold dear (like free time or our own space), this is a crucial part of overcoming guilt.Remind yourself to accept that people’s interests may conflict, and that this is natural. No one is at fault for earnestly seeking to fulfill their own needs.

, Guilt often stems from thinking that we are not being sensitive enough to others.And, since you only have so much of yourself to give, remember that the quality of your help will diminish if you are trying too hard to help all the time or help everyone you care about all the time, no matter what.


To avoid this type of guilt, be more aware of situations when it is truly you who must step in. Being discerning about the moments you offer help will give you a healthier sense of how much responsibility you have for others, diminishing guilt automatically. It will also improve the quality of your help, making you more aware of the good you are doing rather than what other things you could be doing.

, By seeing others treat you this way, it will be easier to develop this attitude toward yourself. However, you are responsible for self-acceptance and self-compassion, and this can be done with or without help.

Confront changeable sources of anxiety.,
Change the way you think about sources of anxiety you can't control.,
Train your mind to calm down.,
Talk about your feelings.",How to Relieve Anxiety2," Sometimes anxiety stems from a feeling of being overwhelmed by a million little things you have to get done. Taken alone, each item on your to-do list may not be a big source of stress, but the compilation of a lot of small obligations can end up being an anxiety-inducing burden. Tackling issues you have the power to change one at a time can help you feel less anxious right away.


Perform small but annoying tasks right away so they don't start accumulating. Pay your bills and parking tickets on time, get your taxes done well in advance, register for classes in plenty of time, keep your doctor and dentist appointments, and so on.
You may have the power to change situations that seem out of your control if you approach them from a different angle. For example, if you're dreading a family reunion that's coming up, put a time limit on how long you're going to stay. Make sure your accommodations are comfortable. If taking these measures still doesn't stop feelings of extreme anxiety, you can always skip the event. You have control over how you spend your time.

, Some sources of anxiety aren't going away any time soon. Illness, financial problems, relationship issues, and other more permanent sources of anxiety aren't easily fixable, but thinking about them differently can help you reduce the stress and fear they elicit.


Do what you can to make the situation better. For example, you can talk with a financial counselor to help you sort out your financial issues. You can spend time helping your loved one who is ill. You can talk to your partner about getting couples counseling.
Limit the time you spend actively thinking about your main sources of stress. You can't change anything by obsessively worrying. Do what you can do, then spend time thinking about something else or having some fun, even if it just means taking a walk or watching an episode of your favorite show.

, Have you ever tried meditation? It's a useful tool for relieving anxiety on the spot. With practice, it can make a marked difference in your long-term state of mind and improve your mental health.


If you're a beginner, pick up a guided meditation CD or join a meditation class. The leader of the meditation will teach you how to relax your mind and reach a state of calmness when your thoughts start to race.
Mindfulness meditation is also useful. It involves focusing on the source of anxiety until you've thought through it and your mind is free to think about something else for the rest of the day. If you tend to wake up full of anxiety, rise and go to a quiet, peaceful place in the house. Spend 5 minutes thinking through your worries and making plans on how to deal with the issues you can change. After that, go about your day knowing you've already addressed what's bothering you.

, Letting anxious feelings bottle up inside you is a recipe for anxiety attacks. It's important to discuss your feelings with someone else. You'll gain an outside perspective, and you might even get some good ideas for solving some of the problems you're facing.


Talking to a trusted loved one is a good place to start. Your partner, parent, sibling, or dear friend knows you well and may be able to provide an inside perspective on how to reduce your anxiety. On the other hand, the people close to us are often sources of anxiety themselves.
Talk to a therapist. Therapists are trained, objective listeners who are getting paid to give you the tools to relieve your anxiety. If you feel persistent anxiety that you can't seem to kick on your own, you should give therapy a try.

Stop eating and drinking items that lead to anxiety.,
Incorporate mood-balancing foods into your diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Change your physical space.",How to Relieve Anxiety3," You may be stoking the fire of your anxiety by ingesting stress-inducing foods on a regular basis. Limiting your intake of harmful foods and drinks can go a long way toward calming your mind and keeping your heart rate steady.


Limit sugary and starchy foods. Most ""comfort"" food falls into the sugar or starch category, but these types of foods cause your blood sugar levels to spike and lead to greater anxiety.
Drink less caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the nervous system,so reaching for that cup of coffee in the morning could be making you feel more anxious. Either stop drinking it altogether or limit yourself to one cup of coffee a day.

Limit your alcohol intake. It's tempting to reach for alcohol when you just want to free your mind from stress. However, the temporary relief alcohol provides gives way to an increased state of anxiety.Alcohol is a depressant, so it can make your mood worse, and its effect on the body - dehydration, water retention, and negative long-term health effects - are anxiety-inducing on their own.

, In addition to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats to keep your body healthy, these foods give your mood an extra boost:


Acai berries, blueberries, and other foods high in antioxidants. Detoxifying your body can help reduce anxiety.
Foods high in magnesium and potassium, natural stress reducers. Eat nuts, dark chocolate, and bananas.

, Studies show that people who exercise regularly have reduced anxiety.Getting a physical workout improves your circulation and gets your mood-enhancing endorphins pumping. Rotate all of the following types of exercise:


Cardio exercises like biking, power walking, running, or swimming.
Weight training exercises that improve your muscle tone.
Strengthening exercises like yoga and Pilates.

, Sometimes anxiety is exacerbated by living or working in uncomfortable spaces. The places where you spend most of your time can have a big impact on your mood. Try making the following changes to reduce daily anxiety.


Get rid of clutter. Having piles of books and mail, recycling waiting to be taken out, or files that need to be put away sitting around your house can make anxiety so much worse. Organize your house and workplace so that everything has a place, ideally out of sight, and take the time to pick things up and put them away every single day.
Redecorate a room or two. Freshen things up to give yourself a new perspective. Paint your bedroom or living room a different color, buy new sheets or throw pillows, and rearrange the furniture.
Spend time in new places. Take a weekend trip, or simply a walk in a park on the other side of town, to change up your routine every once in a while. Stimulating your brain with new sights, sounds and smells can be a big mood booster.

Try a natural anti-anxiety medicine.,
Try prescription medication.",How to Relieve Anxiety4," Many people have found relief by using herbs and other natural substances that have been shown to reduce anxiety over time. Go to your local health food store and try out the following natural medicines:


Chamomile flower. This powerful flower has a calming effect. Buy a box of chamomile tea or take chamomile extract or supplements.
Valerian root. This root is popular in Europe as an anti-anxiety treatment.
Kava kava. This Polynesian plant has a sedative effect, which is said to help treat anxiety.

, In some cases, anxiety cannot be relieved by making mental and physical changes on your own. If you have anxiety attacks or believe you may have an anxiety disorder, it's important to see a doctor. Look into getting a prescription for one of the many anti-anxiety drugs on the market, which have provided relief for many people who suffer from chronic anxiety."

Get advice from friends and family.,
Forgive, but don’t forget.,
Tell yourself that forgiveness isn’t condoning what happened.,
Let go of anger and resentment to truly forgive.,
Consult with a therapist.",How to Forgive for Your Own Mental Health2," You may not know the exact route that will lead you to forgiveness, but, chances are, someone you love has been in a similar situation. Reach out to trusted friends and relatives to ask their opinion on how you should overcome any barriers to forgiveness. These people may have infinite words of wisdom gained from their own experiences with forgiveness.

, Some are hesitant to forgive because they think it means they will forget what happened. However, this isn’t the case. Just because you choose to forgive what someone did to you, doesn’t mean you’ll ever forget it. Rather, you’ll just accept it, put it in the past, and move on with your life.If you think it might help, you could try vowing to learn from the experience before you put it behind you. Identify how you will change and how you will make different decisions in the future.

, Forgiving someone in no way means that you are OK with their behavior. Forgiving simply means that you are releasing yourself of the anger and resentment you feel towards them, and that you are making a conscious decision to let go of the toll what they did took on you. The peace you will feel upon letting go of this burden will likely affect you both physically and emotionally.


Give yourself a pep talk when you decide to forgive. Say, “By forgiving, I am not telling this person that what they did was appropriate or even acceptable. I am helping myself by removing this stress from my life. I will learn from this experience and not let it happen again.”If you think that it would help you, then you can even let the person know that you are forgiving them for your own benefit and that it does not change how you feel about what they did. For example, you could say something like, “I am forgiving you because I think it will benefit me. However, forgiving you does not change the way that I feel about what happened.”

, Don’t fool yourself into thinking that just because you accepted an apology, you’ve forgiven that person. True forgiveness is fully removing feelings of anger, hurt, betrayal, and resentment about the one who wronged you. Even if the person doesn’t actually apologize to you, you can still forgive just the same by coming to terms with what happened and letting it go.Holding on to anger takes a major toll on the body. Being mad can negatively affect your heart, increase your chances of a stroke, can give you anxiety, and weaken your immune system.A ritual to rid yourself of anger may involve writing down your thoughts and feelings about a situation. You can then read them aloud and tear the paper to pieces or burn it. This symbolizes how you will no longer allow the anger to control you. You can even write down forgiving thoughts about the person and then read these over and over to rewire your brain for forgiveness.

, If forgiving someone or yourself seems impossible for you, you may need to see a professional for deep-seated guilt or shame. Sometimes, the hurt done to us can leave lasting marks that we are not able to heal on our own. Find a therapist in your area that deals with guilt or forgiveness to start the journey of moving on.

Enjoy stronger relationships.,
Lower your stress level by forgiving.,
Let go of your grudge and your pain will soon follow.,
Help your heart and blood pressure with forgiveness.",How to Forgive for Your Own Mental Health3," In addition to the psychological benefits of forgiveness, you may also experience emotional benefits in your interpersonal relationships. When you forgive you grant someone else with a second chance. This shows faith in your relationships and may allow you to deepen your bond with friends, lovers, family, and others.By showing forgiveness to others, your friends and family will also be more likely to forgive you when you make a mistake.

, One of the biggest contributors to unstable mental health is stress. The body experiences an increase in cortisol levels when a person is stressed, which causes the unpleasant symptoms that are associated with stress. Releasing yourself of the burden you carry by not forgiving someone can not only improve your mental health, but help you feel better, overall.


Having too much cortisol in your body because of stress can result in serious health risks, including digestive problems, heart disease, headaches, anxiety, depression, and weight gain. Holding onto a grudge isn’t worth the mental and physical problems that are associated with it.Deciding to put something behind you may also improve your focus and energy levels. You may find it easier to concentrate on the things that make you happy when you are no longer replaying the distressing experience in your mind and processing your feelings about that experience.

, A recent study showed that people who were more likely to forgive typically experience less physical pain than those who aren’t. When people hang on to grudges and burdens, their bodies are under constant stress which can put them into “fight-or-flight” mode. This frequent anxiety often affects the immune system, which can wreak havoc on your body, resulting in physical pain., Not only do your shoulders carry the burden of hanging onto grudges, but your heart does, too. Carrying around this pain increases your blood pressure. Letting go of it may help to lower your blood pressure.


In addition to being bad for your heart, high blood pressure can also cause major damage to other areas of your body, including your brain, kidneys, and eyes. High blood pressure can also negatively affect your sexual performance and can lead to bone loss and trouble sleeping."

Focus on your intent.,
Refrain from thinking “if only.” You will not make yourself feel any better by continually ruminating on what could have been or what you could have done differently.,
Remember the pain your dog was in before it died.,
Let yourself off the hook.",How to Cope with Guilt After a Dog's Death1," If you chose to euthanize your dog, your intention was to alleviate its suffering and pain. Similarly, if your dog died as a result of an accident, remember that you did not intentionally let your dog run outside unattended. By choosing to remember that you did not actively intend to cause harm to your dog, you can help alleviate your feelings of guilt.Remember that you made the best decision you could under the circumstances.;
, Rather, you will just torture yourself further and increase your feelings of guilt.There is no way you can know what could have happened differently had you noticed, for instance, that your dog was sick earlier than you did. When you notice yourself thinking along these lines, try to gently redirect your thoughts to the happy times you shared with your dog and remind yourself that you provided them with many happy years.

, Your feelings of guilt related to euthanizing your dog may be lessened if you remember that your dog, in its final days, was suffering and not living life to the fullest.Although painful, it may be useful to remember how sad you felt to see your dog suffer. If you can remember that pain, your guilt may subside as you recognize that your dog is no longer suffering. You may also remind yourself that your dog relied on you completely to decide when to end their life, so making that decision was like your last gift to them to end their suffering.

, As a pet owner, it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility for your pet’s life. After all, you were responsible for everything it needed, from food to hugs. However, you must be able to accept that you are not in control of everything that happens in life, or to your dog.Remember you cannot change the past.
If you believe in a higher power, you can ask for forgiveness.
Try to focus on the positive memories you have of your dog and all of the love and care that you gave to them over the years.

Listen to relaxing music.,
Consider coloring with others.,
Add color in layers.,
Practice art therapy.,
Work with a licensed therapist.,
Consider medication.",How to Reduce Stress with Adult Coloring Books," There are many different themes within the adult coloring book genre. These themes vary based on personal interest, but they typically all include intricate designs on plain, white pages. Some people prefer more intricate images, while others prefer simpler ones (like those you might find in a child's or adolescent's coloring book). There is no right or wrong approach, so choose a pattern that you feel good about.Some common themes for adult coloring books include animals, characters, geometric shapes and patterns, landscape scenes, story panels, and religious or spiritual prints.
Don’t forget that coloring books come in digital formats, too. You can use these on a phone or tablet, sometimes for free.;
, You can use any coloring tool that suits your tastes. You can even combine coloring tools within the same page to produce richer color combinations and varying textures. Some commonly used tools for adult coloring books include crayons, colored pencils, markers, gel pens, pastels, and watercolors.Colored pencils have the advantage of allowing you to shade with greater accuracy and precision.They also allow greater accuracy and precision., Some people prefer to color while working through something stressful, like at work or in a therapy session. Others use coloring at home to wind down after a stressful day. There's no right or wrong time or place to color - it's simply a matter of finding a routine that works well for you.Try to give yourself at least 30 minutes of uninterrupted coloring time.
Pick a location that is comforting or convenient for you. For example, you might be more comfortable working in your living room at home, but you may need the de-stressing effects of coloring at work.
You might also try coloring to ambient music to help you set a relaxing mood and de-stress even more.

, One easy way to maximize your coloring time is to practice mindfulness techniques while you work. These techniques can help you relax, and when coupled with coloring, they can help improve your de-stressing time.Be fully present in the moment by paying close attention to the movement of your hands and the colors that emerge on the page.
Focus on your breath. Pay attention to the sensation of air across your nostrils as you breathe deeply, in and out.Look closely at each color as though you were seeing it for the first time. You can also focus on the tactile experience of holding your pencils or crayons and think about what it feels like in your hand.

, Different individuals may find different types of music relaxing. This will vary, depending on your personal tastes and preferences, but listening to an album or soundtrack that you find calming can help improve your coloring session., Some people find it soothing to color with other people. Others may prefer working in solitude. If you think you might enjoy coloring with others, give it a try. It lets you talk about your day while practicing your relaxation coloring.Try coloring with friends or relatives. Invite a few people over so you can all color, chat, and maybe have some snacks together.
Some community groups meet on a weekly or monthly basis to color together. You can find these groups by searching online or checking group platforms like Meetup.

, Adding color in layers allows you to build a more complex color palette than simply applying a single thick layer. It can also increase the meditative components of coloring. You can practice mindfulness techniques during each additional layer. Layering also allows you to step back and reassess your work up to that point, which can be soothing and also allows you to feel good about the progress you've made.Keep your tips sharpened. This will help you achieve finer details and a broader shading stroke., While using a coloring book is relaxing and artistic, it is not quite the same as art therapy. Art therapy has different means and ends. It entails using your hands to create a wholly original work of art based entirely on your imagination. Art therapy can also help you express emotions non-verbally to treat various debilitating health conditions.As said, in art therapy you’ll use your hands to create a whole work of art, rather than just color in the lines.
Art therapy can be used to help people who can’t find words to express their pain and emotions. This can be a result of anxiety, depression, loss of brain function, or pain and distress from things trauma, combat, and physical abuse.

, If art therapy isn't enough for you, you may need to work with an actual therapist. A licensed therapist can help you deal with stressful life events and work through an anxiety disorder by teaching you valuable coping skills.


Art therapy can help you de-stress, but you may need professional help to tackle your anxiety issues directly if you feel anxious or stressed most or all of the time.You can find therapists in your area by searching online or by talking to your primary doctor.
Some common forms of therapy include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)., If you suffer from severe anxiety, your doctor or therapist may recommend that you try medication. You'll need a prescription to take anti-anxiety medication, which you can get through your primary care doctor or a specialist like a psychiatrist.Some common types of medication prescribed for anxiety include:


antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) like duloxetine (Cymbalta) and escitalopram (Lexapro)
buspirone
benzodiazepines, including alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), and diazepam (Valium)
Be careful about the long-term use of such drugs. Consider natural ways to cope with your anxiety if you can, like mediation, yoga, exercise, and art.

Write down your thoughts.,
Make a game plan.,
Vow to eliminate as many sources of stress as you can.,
Share your feelings.,
Know when to get help.",How to Relax and De Stress2," Before you can begin to relax and minimize the stress in your life, it's time to sit down and put pen to paper to write down your feelings. If you're really stressed, it's likely that you haven't had much time to just sit down and be alone with your thoughts, so just by writing what you're feeling, you're already beginning the process. Here's what you can write:


What are you feeling? What goes through your mind and body on a daily basis, and how much stress are you feeling? Would you say you have always been stressed, or that you're in a particularly stressful period of your life?
Consider the sources of your stress. Are you stressed because of work, your relationship, a situation with your family, or a combination of many factors? What can you do to address these situations to minimize your stress?
If it's helpful, write down your thoughts nearly every day. Being aware of how you're feeling and what your stress triggers are can go a long way in helping you address your stress.

, Once you've written down your general feelings and feel more comfortable expressing how stressed out you really are, you should take the time to make a game plan that will help you start addressing the stress in your life. Though many aspects of life are inherently stressful, there are many things you can do to make it easier for yourself to relax. Your game plan should have three main parts:


Short-term solutions. Make a list of short-term actions that can minimize your stress. For example, if your hellish commute to work is a major source of your stress, try leaving for work twenty minutes early to beat the traffic.
Long-term solutions. Make a plan to be a more relaxed person overall. This will include how you view your work, your relationships, and your responsibilities. For example, if one of your major sources of stress is that you're overcommitted at work, make a game-plan to lower your work responsibilities over a long period of time.
Making time for relaxation. Take a look at your schedule and block out time each day for relaxation. Even if part of the reasons that you're so stressed is that you have no free time, you should squeeze in time wherever you can, whether it's in the morning or right before bed.

, Though you can't turn your life upside down to eliminate stress, you can certainly find a way to eliminate any sources of constant stress in your life. This will make a marked difference on your every day life. Here are some examples of stressful situations you can eliminate:


Get rid of the toxic friend. If you have a ""friend"" who does nothing but cause you grief, make you feel bad, and generally stress you out, it may be time to do some friend ""spring cleaning.""
Do some real spring cleaning. If your desk, briefcase, and home are so filled with clutter and loose papers that you can never find anything, clean up to make your life easier.
Try to avoid stressful situations. If you always feel stressed out at concerts but your boyfriend really loves them, listen to music at home instead. If cooking for guests really stresses you out, order in the next time you planned on cooking a meal.
Plan ahead. If you're stressed out because you haven't worked out the details of a trip that's months away, start booking your flight and hotel so you can stop worrying about it already.

, You don't have to feel alone in your plan to minimize the stress in your life. You'll feel better about your feelings and less isolated if you're able to openly and candidly speak about your stress to a friend or family member. Just having someone who will listen to your problems will help you minimize your level of stress.


Talk to a close friend about how stressed you're feeling. It's likely that your friend is also dealing with stress or has dealt with serious stress at some point, so be open to suggestions and advice.
Open up to a family member about your stress. A family member can help give you the affection and support you need to overcome your stress.

, If you feel absolutely debilitated by stress and can barely sleep, eat, or see straight because you're so worried about all of your responsibilities and feel completely incapable of dealing with them, then you may not be able to deal with the problem alone. See a health professional to debrief and to find some constructive ways to deal with your problems.


A professional can help even if your feelings are situational. If you're stressed out because you're planning a wedding and have started a new taxing job, a professional can teach you stress-management techniques that you can use for the rest of your life.

Meditate.,
Watch a movie.,
Spend time with friends.,
Go for a long drive.,
Read.,
Calm your mind before bed.",How to Relax and De Stress3," Meditating is a great way to relax your mind, and you can meditate almost anywhere and at any time. Just pick a quiet place where you can sit on level ground and close your eyes. Cross your legs and keep your hands on your lap. Focus on inhaling and exhaling, and let your body be governed by your breath. Keep as still as possible and avoid fidgeting.


Be aware of what you can't control. Focus and absorb the smells and sounds around you.
Clear your mind. Don't think about how much work you have left to do, or about what you're going to make for dinner. Just focus on clearing your mind and managing your breath.
Relax every part of your body. You can focus on one part of your body at a time until you feel that every part of you is loose and relaxed.

, Going out to the movies or watching a movie on television can help you escape into another universe and to take your mind off of your own problems. When you watch a movie, try to clear your mind as much as possible and think about what the characters are doing and saying instead of what you're going to do or say after the movie.


Pick a comedy or a romantic film for maximum relaxation. Anything too violent or gory will only make you stressed or anxious and will make it harder for you to sleep.
If you're watching a movie on television, skip the commercials. Either use DVR to watch the movie without commercials or just walk away and take a quick break during the commercials. Otherwise, you may feel more frenzied and distracted from the influx of mixed messages.

, Spending time with friends is a great way to relax. There are a variety of ways that hanging out with friends can help you relax, whether you're laughing over a board game or having a catch-up session over coffee. Spending time with your friends can make you wind down and spend time talking about your feelings, which will make you feel less stressed. Here's what you can do:


No matter how busy you are, make sure to spend time with your friends at least twice a week if not more. Plug social events into your calendar and stick to them, or you will feel even more isolated.
Make sure to spend quality time with your friends. Quality time means actually talking to and listening to each other in small groups, not feeling crushed at a loud party or concert.
Open up. You don't have to go into every little detail of every little thing you're worried about with your friends, but you shouldn't be afraid to ask for feedback.
Try to pick events that will make you laugh. If you have a busy schedule, choose a board game night or go out to see a comedy with your friends, instead of going to a crowded bar where you won't have as much of a chance to laugh.

, If you love to drive, then going for a long drive late at night can help you relax and feel more in control of your life. You may feel overpowered by nasty traffic, or annoyed by how aggressively other people drive during the day, but if you take to the roads at night, you'll feel calmer and more empowered.


Find a favorite driving route. Drive the same route every time so it becomes a routine and you don't have to worry about deciding where and when to turn.
Listen to jazz or other soft relaxing music while you drive.
Long drives are great after you spend a few hours socializing. If you're leaving a party after hours of laughing, sharing your feelings, and listening to your friends, taking a 20-minute solo drive before going home can help you wind down.

, Reading is a fantastic way to relax, especially before bed. Try to shut off all the noise and visual stimuli in the hour before bed and take the time to read something with a cup of camomile tea before you go to bed. Reading is a great way to start your day and to feel sharp in the morning as well. Reading will not only improve your knowledge, but it will allow you to rest your body and quiet your mind as you focus on the material in front of you.


Reading is a great way to feel like you're slowing down in a fast-paced environment. Make a goal of reading for at least half an hour a day.
If you feel so stressed out that you can't focus on what you're reading, take a break to meditate, or whisper the words aloud until you absorb their meaning.

, To do this, find your own space and darken it. Light it with gentle lamplight or candles. Put on some soothing music and lie back on a comfortable bed or couch. Relax as long as you want to or until you feel that is enough.


Focus on thinking happy thoughts, or almost no thoughts at all. Visualize how it will feel to slip into bed and fall into an easy and restful sleep.
Slowly turn down the music and blow out the candles, and fall into sleep.

Give yourself a massage.,
Avoid too much caffeine.,
Exercise.,
Take a bubble bath.,
Eat well.,
Sleep well.",How to Relax and De Stress4," Self massage is very effective at reducing the pain from muscles that tighten when stressed. Massage your own shoulders, forearms, thighs, and even your hands. This is something you can do any time during the day -- even when you're sitting at your own desk.


If you like the self-massage, consider having a friend or a professional give you a massage. This can make your body feel very refreshed, especially if you spend all day sitting up and have a sore back.

, Though caffeine may give you the kick you need to wake up in the morning, it's not worth it to over-indulge in caffeine in the long run. After a few hours, coming down from caffeine will make you feel shaky, irritable, and can even give you a headache. Drinking too much caffeine will also make it more difficult for you to sleep at night.


If you're a heavy caffeine addict, try cutting down on just one cup of coffee per day or per week. You can also try switching from coffee to tea.
If you really need your caffeine, eliminate it after noon, and you will be able to sleep more easily. If you're used to the cup of coffee after dinner, switch to decaf.

, Getting just 30 minutes a day of healthy exercise will help relax your body by leaps and bounds. You don't have to do anything strenuous or out of your comfort zone to get your heart rate going and to let yourself blow off some steam. Try to factor in 30 minutes of exercise into your schedule at least three times a week. Here are some great exercises to try:


Power yoga. Not only will this give you a killer workout, but you'll be able to focus on clearing your mind and concentrating on your breathing as well.
Running. This is a great way to clear your mind while getting a great cardiovascular workout.
Hiking. You'll feel instantly more relaxed by being in touch with nature.
Find a gym buddy. If you go to the gym with a buddy just once or twice a week, you'll be able to get a great workout while laughing and sharing your thoughts.
Remember to always stretch. No matter what form of exercise you do, take at least 5-10 minutes to stretch before and after your workout. Stretching your limbs will not only prevent injury, but it will help you slow down and relax.

, Run yourself a hot bath with lots of scented oils and bubble bath. Relax in this bath for about 10 - 20 minutes. This will be just long enough to refresh and restore a small amount of energy to get back to your own head space.

, Eating well is the key to having a more relaxed body. Your body may be feeling out of sorts because you've been too stressed out to eat three healthy and balanced meals. Here are some eating tips that can help you relax your body:


Always eat breakfast. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, and if you skip it, your entire day will feel off-kilter. Eat a healthy breakfast with protein-filled items like eggs and lean turkey, as well as some fruits and vegetables or a healthy bowl of oatmeal.
Eat three balanced meals a day. Eat three meals a day around the same time each day and make sure to find a healthy balance between proteins, carbs, and fruits and vegetables.
Avoid foods that are heavy in fat or very greasy. They will give you indigestion and will make your body feel more sluggish.
Eat healthy snacks. Eat fruit, nuts, or a small amount of peanut butter with celery in between meals.

, Having a healthy sleep schedule can go a long way in making you feel less stressed. If you get enough sleep, you'll feel more control of your life during the day and will be more equipped to handle any responsibilities and challenges that come your way. Here's how to sleep well:


Go to bed and wake up around the same time every night. Falling into a sleep routine will make it much easier for you to wake up and go to bed at a certain time.
Find the amount of hours that work for you. The average person needs around 6 - 8 hours of sleep. Remember that oversleeping can make you feel just as groggy as not sleeping enough.
Before you fall asleep, visualize your wake-up success. Close your eyes and think about how good you'll feel when you hit your alarm once, stretch, and instantly get up and get started with your day.
Avoid caffeine, chocolate, or spicy foods in the evening, or it will be harder for you to go to fall asleep.

Write an apology letter to your dog.,
Surround yourself with loved ones.,
Seek out a therapist if your guilt does not subside.,
Join a support group.,
Stay busy.",How to Cope with Guilt After a Dog's Death2," If you truly feel you in some way caused your dog’s death, whether through an accident or by not noticing an illness in a timely manner, write down those thoughts and feelings. Address the letter to your dog and explain why you feel guilty and apologize to your dog. This active acknowledgement of your feelings can be helpful in working through your feelings of guilt.This exercise can elevate your mood and help you realize the depth of love you had for your dog. It can reinforce to you that you made the right decisions.
You can bury the letter where your pet is buried.
Try to remind yourself that you and your dog did not speak the same language, so there is no way that you could have known about some of the symptoms they were having due to illness. Don’t blame yourself for missing things when there is no possible way you could have known.

, Accepting the death of a pet can feel like a lonely time, but you will help yourself progress through the grieving process by opening up to friends or relatives. They can also help you understand that you are not responsible for your dog's death, which may help alleviate your feelings of guilt.Close friends or relatives may have stories of your dog they’d like to share with you. Reliving those good memories will help you focus on more positive times with your dog.

, Left untreated, continuing feelings of guilt and grief can eventually lead to depression. If you feel you can no longer deal with your feelings of guilt on your own, find a professional to assist you. A therapist can offer coping mechanisms and support as you move through the grieving process.

, Your veterinarian may be able to recommend a group for other local owners dealing with the loss of a dog. By connecting with people in similar situations, you will learn how to empathize with their feelings of guilt and grief. In turn, you will be better able to empathize with your own feelings of guilt.


A therapist may also be able to connect you with support groups for others dealing with the loss of a pet.
There are online support groups for those who are suffering with the loss of a pet as well.

, While your dog was alive, you spent a lot of time feeding, grooming, or walking it. Instead of using your new free time to think about the void in your life, take it as an opportunity to try new activities or reach out to friends.


Positive experiences can help lead to positive feelings. Try to do things that bring you pleasure so that you are not so trapped with your feelings of guilt and regret.
Also, don’t rule out the possibility of getting another dog when you feel ready. Getting a new dog does not mean you have forgotten your old dog, only that you are honoring his memory by providing a safe, loving home for another dog in need.

Make a scrapbook of your dog’s life.,
Conduct rituals to remember your dog.,
Do something positive in your dog’s memory.,
Volunteer your time with other animals.",How to Cope with Guilt After a Dog's Death3," Take the time to journal about the wonderful times you spent with your dog. By reflecting on the good times you shared, instead of solely focusing on the last few days of your dog’s life, you will gradually replace feelings of guilt with those of gratitude.You can choose to keep your writing private or share it with friends on a blog.
If you choose to share with others, you may benefit from their feedback and their experiences dealing with the death of a dog.

, Similar to writing about your dog’s life, creating a scrapbook is an active way to remember your dog and the good times you shared. You can include your adoption papers and vaccination and medical records, as well as the multiple photos you have of your times together.


The scrapbook will be a wonderful repository of all of your good memories of your dog.
The more positive memories and feelings you create, the less room there is for guilt.

, A ceremony at a favorite dog park or a service at your home with a few close friends is a nice way to memorialize your dog and help you begin to accept its passing. Being in the presence of those who loved your dog will help you take advantage of the support they can offer, instead of being trapped with your feelings of guilt.


You can also scatter your dog’s ashes along a favorite hiking trail or visit a place that was special for the two of you.

, Of course you will never forget the meaningful role your dog played in your life. But you can help others remember your dog as well by making a donation in your dog’s memory to an animal shelter. Or you can plant a tree or garden in its honor.You can also ask friends or family members to donate in your dog’s name as well.

, If you can face being around animals, think about volunteering your time at a local animal shelter. Alternately, you could pursue becoming a foster parent for dogs. There are many needy animals out there who could use your attention, and helping them may be a good way to work through your feelings of guilt.

Examine your current exercise regimen.,
Ease into a new exercise regimen.,
Choose physical activities that you enjoy.,
Engage in green exercise.,
Exercise with friends, relatives and colleagues.,
Take exercise breaks.,
Establish a system for keeping yourself in an exercise regimen to reduce stress.",How to Reduce Stress Through Exercise," According to the American College of Sports Medicine, healthy adults should establish a regular exercise routine.


Engage in at least 20 minutes of vigorous cardiovascular (cardio) activity 3 days each week to reduce stress.






Substitute vigorous cardio with moderate activity, if necessary. A variation on the 20-minute option is to exercise moderately 5 days per week for a period 30 minutes each time.
Incorporate strength-training exercises. Your exercise regimen should include about 10 different strength-training exercises performed in sets of 10 repetitions, 2 times per week.





;
, If you have not been exercising for some time, reduce your stress levels by easing into a new exercise program. You don't want to jump into a strenuous exercise regimen only to injure yourself, become overly sore and increase your stress.


Start with simple activities. Walk, ride a bike, hike a trail or take a beginning dance class to ease into a new exercise program.






Join a gym. Exercising in a structured environment with workout professionals available to assist you will increase your motivation and commitment to exercise, and may decrease the stress associated with a new exercise routine.







, Increased enjoyment will reduce your stress and take your mind off of life's challenges. Playing a favorite sport or taking a dance class with enjoyable music will increase your sense of relaxation.

, Studies show that exercising outdoors near bodies of water, mountains and greenery improves your mood. Cycling near the water or running on the beach will help to reduce your stress.

, Research shows that exercising with others helps you to feel calmer. Whether or not you are speaking to one another as you exercise is irrelevant. Just the presence of others alongside you as you exercise is known to decrease your stress and motivate you to get a better workout.

, If you are approaching an especially stressful week, allot breaks of 20 to 30 minutes in the middle of the day for exercise. Use the time to walk, run up and down stairs or stretch.

,


Ask loved ones to remind you to exercise. When life gets busy, a commitment to exercise is often the first to go. Enlist the help of friends and family to remind you to get back on track.






Mark your exercise regimen on your work calendar. Prioritize your exercise regimen by blocking out time for it.
Use online and cell phone alerts as a reminder. A reminder alarm can help you to establish a regular commitment to exercise.

Reach out to others.",How to Overcome Being Burned Out," If you are experiencing burnout, you may begin to lose sight of why your work matters to you. Even if you were once passionate about your job, constantly overextending yourself can deplete this passion. Allow yourself some time to think about what is meaningful about your work. This may give you a temporary boost to get through the next few days.If you don't find your current work or project meaningful, think about how it relates to a larger goal that is important to you. For instance, maybe you don't feel passionate about working in the mail room at a big company, but you know that it is the first step toward moving up to get the job you really want.
Try talking to a higher up at work to see if you can take on any projects that are meaningful to you. You may feel less burnt out if your passions and skills can better match your commitments.You can also try to shift your focus to any aspects of your work, even small things, that you do enjoy. Even mundane jobs carry meaning. If you're just doing data entry for an organization, for example, think about the larger goals of that organization and how you contribute to the cause.;
, If you feel your life is nothing but work, try to find fulfillment elsewhere. No one can work all day every day and not feel burnt out. If you don't find meaning from your job, look at the roles you fulfill outside of the office.Where else can you find meaning and satisfaction if you're frustrated with your work? Think about your relationships with friends and family members. Think about any hobbies you have you find personally enjoying and fulfilling.
It's important to have some balance in life. Everyone needs multiple outlets to feel fulfilled and happy, so be open to reminding yourself of everything you take pride in, not just your professional life.

, Many times, burnout is the result of being too hard on yourself. This often manifests in comparing yourself to others on a similar life path or in a similar field. Try to avoid comparing yourself to others.Comparisons can sometimes be helpful if you are comparing who you are today with an older version of yourself to see how far you've come. Then you can ask yourself what changes you'd like to make and how you'd like to keep growing in the future.

, If you're feeling very burnt out and struggling to stay confident, seek outside support. Many support groups focus on stress reduction techniques. You also do not have to join an official support group. You can find a group of friends and agree to get together and vent once a month.If you want a support group for issues like stress and anxiety, which can cause burnout, check at a local counseling center and hospital. If there are no support groups in your area, you can seek support online through forums.

, No one can go all day every day without feeling burnt out. If you are experiencing severe burnout, force yourself to take more breaks throughout the day. This will result in you being more energetic and productive.If you're the type to overwork, it can be hard to force yourself to take breaks. However, work on reminding yourself breaks are necessary to your emotional well being and will actually result in increased productivity.
When you start feeling frustrated or burnt out, force yourself to step away. Go for a walk, have a snack, listen to some music, or do anything else you need to recharge. Then, return to work with a refreshed mental state.

, Electronic devices can be great for unwinding or socializing, but can sometimes contribute to burnout if you feel like you're never really away from your work. If you have work-related emails coming in on your smartphone, it will be difficult to disengage and relax. Try stepping away from your phone for an hour or so every night to focus on relaxing and unwinding.If you use your phone for relaxing activities, like listening to music, try disabling notifications for the night or logging off your email.

, If you're feeling a lack of energy and excitement, you may need to add something new to your routine to make you feel more fulfilled. Connecting with something that's personally meaningful for you can help. Look into your local community and see where and how you can get involved.Think about what you find personally meaningful. You could volunteer for a charity, a church, a non-profit, or any other organization that feels meaningful to you.

, If you have sick days or vacation days, use them. Taking a break from work when possible can help lessen burnout. Everyone needs a break now and again, so make a point of taking a vacation every few months.If you're on a budget, keep in mind a vacation doesn't have to be costly. You can do a stay-cation, where you just stay at home and enjoy your local community. You can also do something like a day trip to a nearby city.
If your company offers personal days, use those to have a free day at home or take care of personal needs or tasks that you haven't been able to address.

, Time to relax is as important to your well-being as making time for productivity.Adjust your schedule to give yourself time to take breaks and unwind. Look for pockets of time where you don't have anything to do.


Use that time to relax without feeling guilty. Remind yourself you don't need to fill every minute with work. It's okay to give yourself an hour a day to, say, read a book or watch television.

, If you're feeling burnt out, it can be helpful to identify why. What are the biggest stressors in your life that are leading to this emotional state? Identify the major causes of your stress can help you see what areas of your life you need to change.Write down everything that causes you stress on a day-to-day basis. Is work, family, friends, a social life?
Think about which areas cause you the greatest stress and why. Maybe you're incredibly stressed out at work because your job is very demanding but low paying.

, Think about what you can do. Review all the assets and talents you could bring into an organization. If work is a major stressor in your life, it may be time to switch gears career-wise. Think about what skills you currently have and how they could be applicable to a more fulfilling career., Burnout is often caused by excessive commitment. If you have too much on your plate, avoid new responsibilities.You do not have to feel guilty for saying ""No."" Sometimes, it's important to your emotional health to disengage and relax. Just because you can do something does not mean you're obligated to do it.
The next time an opportunity presents itself, review whether you truly have time. Maybe you would like to help run the bake sale with the PTA, but if you're already committed work, raising your children, and other obligations, now is not the time to volunteer.

, Oftentimes, burn out is the result of not granting yourself enough of a personal life. If you're feeling burnt out, try to invest in your relationships. Having a solid support group can help combat burn out.Spend time working on your current close relationships. Spend more time with family members and close friends to combat burnout.
You can also try to make new friends. Reach out to people at work or places where you volunteer.

Choose a location.,
Arrange the space.,
Arrange the prayer area As you are organizing a sahaja yoga meditation, there ought to be a place where Shri Mataji’s photo and idols of Ganesha, Laxmi, Saraswati, Krishna, etc., can be put on display.,
Make sure the room can be cooled down.,

If your group will fit, you can use a room or space in your home; if you have a big group, you may need to find an available space elsewhere, like a community center or local school (with permission).;
, Shift the sofas, armchairs, tables and other furniture to the corner so that there is enough space to move about and sit down without banging into other people. Place carpets on the floor so that people can sit down which is better to have full concentration and attention.

, Set up a covered table to display the idols and pictures where they can be seen, in the center of the room.

, The people or shaja yogis might feel uncomfortable, sweaty and hot during meditation. Provide fans at an angle where they won’t affect the diyas or lamps but still cool your attendees. If you have air conditioning available, switch it before they arrive to cool the room down.

, Connect your laptop or USB to your speaker (if you have one) and play it. If you don’t have speakers, you can borrow some or use the volume on you laptop or phone or iPod or tablet to play it. It'll help set the scene for your meditation.

, Prepare yourself to sing bhajans or slokas or songs sung to hail the lords in the heaven. Browse the internet and find god songs to sing. Having a daily practice helps a lot!

, Put in a CD which has the speech or amrutvaani of Shri Mataji, talking about some gods or chakras or pujas.

, Prepare some offerings for the gods; fruits, biscuits, and other healthy foods will do. If you are preparing the offering then don’t taste it. It’s a rule to not taste the food you are offering to Shri Mataji.

, After the meditation, you ought to serve the offerings to the people so you need plate, bowls, cups, spoons, etc. Make sure there is water too. If possible, get some fruit juice and not soft drinks.

Be realistic and set a budget.,
Manage the renovation as a project.,
Cope with the inevitable small hiccup with a philosophical mindset.,
Get professional help for the things you cannot do.,
Tidy at the end of the day.,
Take a break now and then.",How to Reduce Stress While Renovating," Set realistic goals and a budget you know you can afford. Setting up a budget sheet so you can see the numbers day by day can help relieve financial stress.


Realize that renovation budgets have a tendency to balloon or blow out. Are you prepared for this or is there an absolute line after which you'll say, ""no more""?
Be sensible about choices for fittings and the like. Do you really need the most expensive when a lower cost item will still look great and function perfectly?
Get a range of quotes from different places and service providers. That way you will know what the basic industry prices are and can bargain better.;
, Keep good records of expenditure, of things done and not done, contact details of tradespersons, accounts of broken/damaged or unfinished things, and so forth. Set goals and desired finish times for elements of the project, breaking it down into reasonably achievable chunks. By staying on top of the documentation, invoices and comings and goings of tradespersons, you'll keep things running much more smoothly than if you approach the renovation in a haphazard manner without goal or end dates.


Divide the tasks among family according to strengths. If your wife is a whizz with accounts, or your husband is brilliant with bargaining, assign those tasks to the person best able to do it. Even the kids can get involved, with such things as suggestions for garden designs, searching for fittings online and making a Pinterest board of ideas. By involving everyone in the project, there is buy in and more interest in the eventual outcome.

, Relax. Okay, so if a wall falls down, then you have every right to jump around, stamp your feet and scream from the rooftops. However, if you find that the dust is piling up in the corner, you've purchased the wrong shaped fittings or the room hasn't been completed precisely on time, then don’t panic. These things can be rectified easily enough, so don’t let yourself stress out.


Be aware that just as with budgets, deadlines tend to blow out. Promises made by tradespersons don't always pan out, and expected finish times are often delayed by unforeseen problems that need attending to. At the end of the day, it is better to approach the renovation slowly but surely than to cover up problems and finish quickly, only to have the problems ending up undermining safety, longevity or soundness.

, Avoid doing renovating jobs you have no qualifications for or no idea how to go about. It's just not worth the hassle and stress involved, and there can be a potential for physical harm too.


In some cases, you may find that working alongside a renovation professional is a good option. You can be the laborer, the general dogsbody and the professional will do all the hard work. This can save money, depending on what it is the professional is doing.

, After a long day of renovating, the last thing on your mind may be tidying up to create a mess the next day. But give it a try to see how much better you feel. Returning to a tidy work site will start your renovation day on a positive note, and it stops the mess from piling up over the course of your renovation.


Enjoy your shower or bath after each day's hard renovation. Have a bubble bath if you like that sort of thing. A little bit of pampering is well earned during renovations.

, Get out of the house! Pack your loved ones up in to the car, stop by the grocery store to pick up picnic food and head out for a few hours off from your relaxation. You’ve earned it and you will be ready to work hard the next day.


Eat out or have take-outs now and then, to ease the burden of having to cook as well as renovate all of the time.

Incorporate movement into your meditation.",How to Meditate for Anxiety," You can meditate any time, anywhere, but for most beginners, it's significantly easier to meditate in a quiet place with no distractions. Try to find somewhere where you can be alone for a few minutes.You may want to set up a special area in your home for meditation. It should have a comfortable place for sitting and should be inspiring to you. You can create an altar or shrine, or simply decorate the area with items that speak to you.;
, Do your best to have good posture while meditating. Sitting up straight is not only good for your spine, but it may also help you stay focused on your meditation.Sitting on a pillow or block may help you keep your spine straight.

, Beginning a meditation practice does not have to take much time away from your busy schedule. You can start by devoting as little as 10 minutes each day to meditation.Scheduling a regular time to meditate each day may help you commit to it.
As you progress, you may find that you want to meditate for longer periods of time, but if you don't, that's okay too. Never feel like you have to meditate for a specific amount of time if that doesn't feel right for you.

, Some people find it helpful to spend the beginning of their meditation session thinking about a specific intention. This should be something altruistic that will help you stay focused on the good that you are creating with your meditation practice.For example, you may think about how your meditation will help you be present in the current moment and not ruminating on the past or worrying about the future.

, Journaling about the meditation process is very useful to some people, so you may want to consider trying it. This will allow you to keep track of the different meditation techniques you have tried and how they made you feel.In addition, journaling can also help you work through your feelings, so you may find that it helps you understand why a specific technique made you feel a specific way.

, All styles of meditation involve the replacement of racing or intruding thoughts with something more calming. If you suffer from anxiety, you likely have lots of different thoughts that cause you to worry unnecessarily. No matter which style of meditation you choose, your meditation practice should focus on replacing these negative thoughts.It may take some time before you understand when it will be most helpful for you to meditate. For example, you may want to meditate when you begin to have anxious thoughts, or you may find it more helpful to meditate when you know you are about to be in a situation that may trigger anxiety.
Over time, meditating will teach you to pay less attention to your anxious thoughts, so they will become less of a burden.

, You may be tempted to think that you are ""bad"" at meditating or that you are doing it wrong when you are new to the practice. Many people feel this way, but people with anxiety are especially prone to allow these thoughts to hold them back from really enjoying their meditation practices. Instead of judging yourself for your inadequacies, remind yourself that you are improving with each session and that you do not need to be perfect.Judging yourself for your meditation abilities can actually cause stress and anxiety, which is completely counterproductive. If you find yourself doing this acknowledge these thoughts as the same as all of your other anxious thoughts.

, Meditation is very helpful to many people who suffer from anxiety, but it is not right for everyone. For some, meditation can actually make anxiety worse. If this is the case for you, you should either stop your practice or reduce the amount of time you spend meditating.Note how you feel before and after meditation sessions. You may not feel noticeably better right away, which is fine, but you should not feel more anxious or noticeably worse.
People who are prone to relaxation-induced anxiety, are highly introspective, or have repressed memories are more likely to have increased anxiety after meditating.
Someone with relaxation-induced anxiety may be able to unwind at first, but soon he begins to feel even more anxious or tense as a result. This may because the person is afraid of the thoughts that occur when he stills his mind, or because he fears he is being lazy or not meditating ""correctly.""If you already have anxiety, you may be more prone to relaxation-induced anxiety.If repressed memories or trauma surface while you are meditating — you suddenly re-experience a traumatic emotion or experience while trying to meditate — put meditation on hold. Dealing with trauma is not something you should attempt to handle on your own. Seek counseling with an experienced therapist or mental health professional who specializes in trauma., If you decide that meditation is in fact right for you, don't expect it to change your life overnight. It may be a while before your brain begins to change in a noticeable way, but it will happen. If you are working to reduce your anxiety, be patient and commit to meditating regularly., Mindfulness meditation is one of the most popular styles of meditation for reducing anxiety. To practice it, you must simply focus all of your attention on the present moment, which helps retrain the brain not to fixate on the past or on the future.It's natural for your thoughts to wander, so don't get discouraged. If thoughts or emotions come up, acknowledge them, but do not judge yourself for them. Then do your best to replace them with thoughts about the present.
Keeping your eyes open will help you stay focused on the present.Many people like to consciously focus on their breathing while meditating, which helps keep breaths deep, while also preventing other thoughts from taking over the mind. If you are having trouble staying focused on your breath, you can try counting your breaths or repeating the words ""inhale"" and ""exhale"" to yourself silently., Loving-kindness meditation is similar to mindfulness meditation in that you replace unwanted thoughts with other thoughts. Instead of focusing your thoughts on the present moment, however, you can focus them on anything that involves love and kindness.Your thoughts should express love and kindness towards yourself, as well as towards others.
You can practice mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation together, as they complement each other nicely.

, Guided meditation is sometimes called visualization. This meditation style involves thinking deeply about a place or situation that you find relaxing. When practicing this type of meditation, you should try to engage all of your senses by imagining the sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and feelings that you would experience if you were really there.Guided meditation can be done alone, but it is often done in a class under the instruction of a teacher.

, If you choose to practice transcendental meditation, you will repeat a mantra to yourself to help achieve relaxation. This mantra can be any word, phrase, or sound that you find comforting.The way you say the mantra is also important. You should be focusing deeply on every aspect of the mantra.

, Meditation does not always have to be done sitting down. In fact, there are a variety of practices that combine exercise and meditation. If you don't like sitting still, this may be the perfect option for you.Tai chi, qi gong, and yoga are all practices that involve movement, as well as meditation. If you are interested in learning one of these practices, they are offered at many fitness clubs and community centers. You can also try watching an instructional video.
If you want to add a less structured physical component to your meditation practice, you can also consider walking while you meditate. As long as you are able to stay focused, this movement should not inhibit your meditation at all.

Call a friend.,
Listen to music.,
Engage in a challenging activity.,
Recite an alternative positive thought.",How to Not Worry About Something1," When you find yourself worrying, immediately get out of your head by getting in touch with a friend. Strike up a conversation about a relatively neutral topic unrelated to your worries. You can give your friend a heads up that you are worrying and need a distraction.


If your friend is reasonably logical and grounded, you might talk through your worries with him or her. He may be able to give you a recommendation on how to fix the problem (if there is a feasible solution), or help you to see how irrational a worry can be.;
, If your nerves are extremely on edge from nonstop worrying, try listening to classical music. Research shows that this type of music is most effective at reducing pulse and heart rate, lowering your blood pressure, and reducing the amount of stress hormones in the body.Classical music can also prevent the mind from wandering, making it a terrific aid in meditation.

, A great way to distract yourself from repetitive thoughts is to stimulate the mind in another way. Flip over the newspaper and complete the weekly crossword puzzle. Learn to play an instrument. Read a novel or a magazine article. Sit down with a friend and put together a jigsaw puzzle. Paint a picture. All of these brain exercises not only distract you from worrying, they reduce your risk of dementia, too., Take your mind off what’s worrying you by purposefully repeating a statement that is conducive to calm. Instead of thinking of something that upsets you or causes you discomfort, become centered by an affirmation that creates a positive tone for your mind and your environment. Worry-free affirmations may include:”Keep calm and carry on”
”Tomorrow is a brand new day”
”Don’t sweat the small stuff”
”I am a peace with myself”
”Relaxing my mind is transforming my life”

Positive thinking does not come naturally to everyone, but it is a habit that can be learned. The first step is to practice self-talk (thoughts that run in a continuous stream through your mind) that transforms negative thoughts into positive ones.

, You can also list the reasons for your stress in order to more effectively identify stressors and deal with them at the source.

, Physical activity releases endorphins, known as ""feel good"" hormones, into the body to elevate your mood naturally.

, These foods provide nutrients necessary to reducing tension, boosting the immune system and lowering blood pressure.

, These relaxation techniques help focus the mind, relax the body and relieve tension.

,


Some of the easiest ways to reduce stress include learning to say ""no"" when someone asks for a favor you don't have time to do and avoiding people and situations that create more anxiety and stress in your life. If factors like the news or discussions over hot-button topics induce tension, avoid those as well.

,


A healthy diet and sufficient sleep work effectively in combating the results of stress. By the same token, avoid behaviors that can contribute to tension, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine and taking drugs.

Perform a physical activity.,
Try visual imagery.,
Practice progressive muscle relaxation.,
Learn mindfulness meditation.Typically, worries are future-focused.",How to Not Worry About Something2," Physical activity packs a three-fold punch of benefits: you get out of your head by getting your body moving, you improve physical health, and you are rewarded with endorphins that elevate mood and produce relaxation. Since excessive worry overloads your body with adrenaline and a “fight or flight” response, exercise provides you with an outlet for the surplus energy., Visualization is a great tool to alleviate anxiety and worrying in the moment. It involves visualizing - with determination - yourself in an environment that brings you calm.The key is to think of a place, preferably one that you know, that naturally relaxes you.


Let’s say there was a meadow near your grandmother’s house where you used to play as a kid. There were beautiful flowers and soft mounds of grass and striking blue skies. If you notice yourself worrying about something, you might intentionally close your eyes and call up that safe place.
Go further than just how the place looks. Engage your other senses by thinking of how the birds sound, what the grass and flowers smell like, and what the ripe berries taste like on your tongue.
If you have difficulty calling up your own safe place, you can always visit YouTube for guided imagery videos that are effective at relaxing worrisome thoughts.

, When we are worrying all the time our bodies physically become just as tense as our thoughts. Conducting regular sessions of progressive muscle relaxation allow you to get an understanding of what both relaxation and tension feel like. Then, once you get the hang of it, you are better able to cope with tension in daily life. Here’s how to do it:Plan for about 15 minutes of quiet time. Locate a place where you can sit comfortably with minimal distractions. Start with one muscle group – your feet, for example. Contract the muscles in your toes and heels. Hold the tension for about 5 seconds. Notice what it feels like.
Then, release the tension and let all the tightness flow from your body. Notice what that relaxed state feels like. Stay in this relaxed state for about 15 seconds before moving on to a new muscle group, tensing and relaxing in turn. Move up through the body until you have worked with all the major muscles in your body. Perform this activity about twice a day for anxiety relief.

, When you can learn to focus on the present moment, you can kick worries to the curb. In mindfulness meditation, your focus is directed at acknowledging worries and letting them go.


Choose a place where you can sit quietly without distractions. You can close your eyes or focus on a single, non-stimulating spot in the room. Take several deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Observe your worries as if you were an impartial spectator of thoughts. DO not judge them or react at all, simply acknowledge each worry as it comes. Recognize that when you do not fight against worries, they eventually go away on their own. Only when you try to control them, do they become resistant.
Continue to breathe, slowly and deeply. Notice how your body feels, the sounds around you, and the steady ebb and flow of your breathing. Whenever a worry sticks around without passing, refocus on the present moment (i.e. physical sensations, breathing, etc.).

Write down and judge your worries.,
Recognize that uncertainties are unavoidable.,
Designate a “worry-time”.,
Put anxious thoughts to the test.",How to Not Worry About Something3," If you are a chronic worrier, you may find that no matter what you do to distract yourself or relax, specific worries come back again and again. Taking action can help you feel less helpless.


Get a notebook and pen and write down your worries. After you have listed each one, go through and judge each concern as either productive or unproductive. Productive worries are those you can take action against, such as a broken down car. Unproductive worries are those for which you have no control, such as a major hurricane moving into your area.
Handle productive worries by immediately brainstorming solutions to overcome them. For example, if your car is broken down, you may need to call and consult with mechanics, buy a part, or go rent a temporary replacement.

, Unproductive worries are generally those for which there is no obvious or feasible solution. Overcoming such worries requires that you learn to accept uncertainty.The best way to embrace uncertainty is to recognize that not knowing what’s going to happen does not automatically mean something bad will happen. Uncertainty is not negative, it is neutral.
For example, you are meeting with a friend with whom you lost touch. You worry that things will be awkward. Consider this: if this person is your friend, odds are, you had similar worldviews and interests. Those things may continue to connect you even though time and/or distance separated you. Things could be awkward, but they could also go fabulously. What’s more, even if they are awkward at first, they could improve as to two of you warm up to each other.

, An effective method to reduce the time you spend worrying about something is to schedule a “worry-time”. Also known as stimulus control training, this technique involves you writing down or pushing away worries to attend to at a later time. This way you have more time to spend on positive and productive thoughts and activities.Decide on a time in the morning or afternoon to attend to your worries. Limit this to a 15 to 30-minute period.
During your worry time, either write down or think over all the things that are worrying you right now or at some point during your day. You do not have to problem-solve these worries, but doing so may help you feel more accomplished.
Outside of your worry-time, when you notice yourself worrying, push away these concerns by telling yourself you will spend time thinking about them later.

, Another way to get control over worrying is to challenge anxious self-talk. The first step to challenging anxious thoughts is identifying them. These are thoughts that frighten you or stimulate a fight-or-flight response. After you become aware of these thoughts, test how realistic they are. The goal is to recognize that these thoughts are usually irrational and unrealistic, thereby, reducing their effect on you. Challenge negative or anxious self-talk by asking yourself these questions:Am I 100% sure that this will happen?
Have I mistaken a thought with a fact?
What evidence do I have that this is true? What evidence do I have that it is not true?
Am I confusing “possibility” with “certainty”? It may be possible, but is it likely?

Evaluate your spending.,
Create a monthly budget.,
Rank your purchases from most to least important.",How to Reduce Financial Stress1," You may wonder where all your money goes each month. Create an expenditure list of what you spend. First look at what you spend on basics such as housing, utilities, phone, car payments, and other regular monthly expenses. Then assess what you spend on that can vary day-to-day or week-to-week. Track your expenses for a month or longer, to get a better picture.If you are financially stressed and have a family, try tracking the spending habits of all your family members to get a better sense of each person's spending.
If you are stressed due to large amounts of debt that you owe, make sure to put debt payments as part of your basics, such as utilities and housing. It's important to prioritize these equally to your other necessities.
Make sure to track even smaller purchases such as a morning cup of coffee at Starbucks, DVD rentals, or quick trips to the grocery store. For example, if you purchase a cup of coffee for $2.50 five days a week, it ends up being $50 a month in buying morning coffee.;
, Look at all your sources of income that are regular and consistent. If you have a family, create a household budget that includes everyone's income in the home. If you are a student, look at your income and/or any money via student loans or family support. Once you have a sense of how much money you can spend each month, look at your spending habits again.See if your spending outweighs your income.
Evaluate if you are just ""breaking even"" in which you have no extra income or savings after your monthly spending each month.
Look at how much savings you have possibly each month.

, Understand that there are differences between necessities and luxuries. For example, if you buy your lunch every day, rather than bringing a lunch to work or school, that's not a necessity--it's a spending choice. In order to reduce your stress, you need to understand which purchases are most important to you.


You or your family may have strong feelings about what purchases are most important to them.
Once you all come to a consensus on what are necessities (such as housing, debt payments, transportation, utilities, insurance, and groceries), then you can figure out what changes to make with your other purchases.
Consider making a list of purchases that are ""luxuries"" that are costing you more than you thought. Evaluate which ones to keep, and which ones need to be reduced.
If you are evaluating your household's spending, try to come to a consensus among all family members. Don't force others to only make changes while you don't.

Try keeping a stress journal to help you identify the sources of your stress. Write in your stress journal every day and include:What you think is causing you to feel stress.
How you feel, including your physical and emotional state.
How you responded to the stress.
What you did to feel better.;
, If you are feeling stressed and it is making you feel nervous or jittery, then find an activity that you can channel this energy into.Go for a walk, clean your kitchen, or engage in a favorite hobby. Anything you can do to work off some of this energy may help.

, Having some alone time can also help you to feel more calm.Try going somewhere quiet, such as your bedroom or a bathroom. Then, do something relaxing, such as a progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga.


You can also listen to music, take bubble bath, write in a journal, or just sit quietly and think for a while.

, While stress can be frustrating, getting angry with yourself will only make matters worse. Instead, respond to yourself in a compassionate way. Imagine how a kind friend would speak to you right now. Try to speak to yourself in the same kind, loving way.For example, you might say to yourself, “I can tell that you are under a lot of pressured because of your job. But I think you are doing so well! Things might seem bad right now, but it is only temporary. Hang in there!”

, Being grateful for what you have can help you to shift your perspective from what is causing your stress to what is going well in your life.Try making a list of all of the things you feel grateful for, large and small.


For example, you might include in the list things like a place to live, clothes on your back, a family who loves you. You can also include little things like a good cup of tea, a beautiful sunset, or having time to read quietly.

, Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day is the most effective way to make sure you always get a restful night’s sleep.When you keep your sleeping hours regular, your body will get used to falling asleep right on schedule, and you’ll cut down on time spent lying awake at night.


Adjust the amount of sleep you get for your particular needs. For instance, if you feel tired easily, you may want to aim for more than eight hours of sleep a night.
Avoid napping. Though a catnap might be tempting when you’re tired, sleeping during the day can throw off your sleep schedule and make it harder to fall asleep at night., Try taking a warm bath, meditating, or writing in a journal before bed every day. A soothing ritual will help quiet your mind before bed, and over time you’ll begin to associate the activity with sleep.Avoid watching TV or using electronics during your bedtime ritual. The blue light from these devices can trick your brain into keeping you awake longer. Certain kinds of media such as the news can also add to your stress levels., Invest in a high-quality mattress, turn your thermostat down to a pleasantly cool temperature, and keep noise to a minimum when you’re trying to sleep. Try using earplugs or a white noise machine. By making your bedroom as comfortable as you can, you’ll minimize the amount of tossing and turning you do at night., An afternoon energy drink or cup of coffee might be a good pick-me-up, but it could diminish the amount and quality of sleep you get later on. Caffeine consumed within 6 hours of bedtime can cause you to have a hard time falling asleep or lead to a restless night., Electronic devices emit blue light, which affects your internal clock and makes it harder to fall asleep. TV and internet are also mentally stimulating, so they aren’t good activities for winding down at the end of the day. Turn off your devices at least two hours before bedtime for a better night’s sleep.If you like to read before bed, choose a physical book, not an e-reader.
If it’s absolutely necessary that you use your electronic devices before bed, consider installing an app like f.lux, which filters blue light from your screen at night.

, Exercise boosts your mood and lowers your stress levels by releasing endorphins, the feel-good chemicals in your brain. If you don’t have time to hit the gym, work smaller amounts of exercise into your schedule. Getting your heart rate up for even a few minutes a day can help burn off stress and give you a happier outlook.Aerobic exercises like walking, running, swimming, and dancing are good choices for stress-fighting workouts.

, Your mood has a lot to do with what you eat, and you’ll be better prepared to deal with the challenges of life if you eat nutritious, wholesome foods. Avoid processed foods made with sugar and white flour, which can cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash. Instead, choose fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich whole grains, and drink plenty of water.To keep your blood sugar stable and avoid cravings, try eating five or six small meals throughout the day.

, When you’re stressed, you might be tempted to use alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes to cope, but this only complicates the problem. Using these substances might make you feel better temporarily, but they don’t help you deal with your stressors in the long run.They also put you at risk for addiction and health problems.

, Breathing deeply is one of the best ways to induce your body’s natural relaxation response. Taking deep, slow breaths calms you down by relaxing your muscles, slowing your heart rate, and lowering your blood pressure. Try incorporating 10 minutes of deep breathing into your routine every day.To practice deep breathing, sit or lie in a comfortable position. Place one hand over your belly and the other over your chest. Breathe in deeply through your nose for a few counts. Notice the hand on your belly moving outwards. The hand on your chest should remain relatively still. Hold the breath briefly. Then, release the air out through your mouth. Notice the hand on your belly collapsing. Repeat as needed.

, Mindfulness can help reduce your stress by taking your focus off the future. When you practice mindfulness, you concentrate on what’s happening in the present moment, not on intangible worries that you have no direct control over. This makes you better able to accept your circumstances and solve problems.Meditation is a good way to practice mindfulness. Set aside a few minutes every day to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. When you notice your mind wandering, acknowledge the thought and let it go. Then turn your attention back to taking deep, calming breaths.

, Burnout can be a sign of working too much, spending time on activities you find unfulfilling, and neglecting your physical and mental health. Take some time to think about what is causing your burnout and what you could do to fix it.Can you stop taking on extra tasks at the office, delegate some of your work to someone else, or set aside some time to pursue a hobby every day?

, When you’re burnt out, you feel drained and disconnected from life. The best medicine for feeling passionless is rediscovering something you’re excited about.


Think about what makes you feel alive and find a way to work it into your schedule. Creative pursuits like writing, painting, or theater are especially effective for battling burnout., Getting support from others can help you fight burnout and relieve stress. Try calling a friend, making an appointment with a therapist, or reaching out to your coworkers. Sharing your feelings helps you overcome the feelings of loneliness and isolation that often accompany burnout., Everyone needs to take breaks to relax and decompress sometimes. If it’s been a while since you took time off, consider going on vacation to prevent or recuperate from burnout. Taking some time to lay down your worries and visit an enjoyable place might be all you need to feel refreshed and relaxed when you return."

How can you tell if you are experiencing an unusual or unhealthy amount of stress? If you know the common signs and symptoms to look for, you can begin the process of dealing with your stress.Common causes of workplace stress include: low salaries; excessive workloads; limited opportunities for growth or advancement; lack of challenging work; lack of support; lack of control; conflicting demands; unclear expectations; fear of job loss; increased overtime requirements; poor relations with a fellow worker or workers.
Symptoms of excessive workplace stress can include: feeling anxious, irritable, or depressed; apathy; loss of interest in work; problems sleeping; fatigue; trouble concentrating; muscle tension or headaches; stomach problems; social withdrawal; loss of sex drive; substance abuse; high blood pressure; obesity; heart disease.;
, You might think of yourself as too old or too busy to keep a “diary,” but using a stress journal for a week or two is an excellent way to identify your office stressors and how you respond to them. Take little notes throughout the day, recording events or individuals that caused you to experience stress symptoms, along with how you reacted.Be thorough and honest; you’re only cheating yourself if you aren’t. Use the information gathered over a period of one or two weeks to get a clearer picture of your primary workplace stressors. With this information, you can begin to formulate specific strategies for neutralizing and counteracting your stressors.

, Your stress journal can be useful here — are rumors of downsizing or a problematic co-worker causing you stress? If such causes are out of your control according to your work status and responsibilities, remind yourself that they are not worth worrying about, as these things are beyond your control.Focus your energies on your work (which you control), not on what other people think of it or you (which you can’t control). You’ve heard it since childhood, but it is as true as ever — all you can do is give your best effort.
It may be as simple as asking “Is there anything I can do about this?” If the answer is no, why worry about it?

, Successful people usually expect a great deal of themselves and push themselves hard to achieve their goals. Challenging goals, and the stress that comes with working toward them, are good things. Unrealistic, unachievable goals that only cause excessive stress are not. Take time to honestly assess your career goals and determine if you are demanding the impossible of yourself.Be realistic about how much you can do as well. Don’t spread yourself too thin or overcommit to an excess of tasks. Learn to say “no” and prioritize your work; differentiate between what you “must” and “should” do., In extreme cases, changing jobs may be the only way to reduce your stress. More often, though, you can achieve results by making small changes to the environment in which you currently work.For instance, if your office or workspace is a pigsty, try cleaning it up and keeping it more orderly. Research shows that clutter and disorder increase stress levels (remember that “mess equals stress”).
Listen to your mother and sit up straight. Sitting and standing with good posture, and presenting yourself in a more powerful, assertive manner can actually reduce your stress levels as well. When you look confident, you tend to feel more confident, and in turn less concerned with trivial stressors.
Avoid the “worry-warts,” naysayers, and stress-junkies in your office whenever possible. Instead, associate with positive, supportive co-workers who have developed strategies to deal with their own stress. Let some of their positive energy rub off on you., It is inherently stressful to walk into your office on a Monday and realize that you have 47 tasks to accomplish that day. Don’t let the full weight of that workload rest on your shoulders all day. By breaking down the tasks that need to done, organizing them more efficiently, and tackling the most essential stuff first, you can make that burden seem much lighter.When faced with one giant, stressful task, like a presentation or sales report, break it down into smaller, more manageable individual tasks. Nibble away at it piece by piece, taking time to appreciate each successful “bite,” instead of trying and failing to swallow the thing whole.

, It can sometimes seem like, without fail, whenever you are just getting a handle on an important task, the phone rings or that annoying co-worker wanders in. Some distractions are unique and unexpected; others, however, are recurring and predictable. For the latter, anticipate the distraction and prepare your response ahead of time in order to minimize its stress-causing impact.Whenever Bob or Janet stops by for his/her daily dose of distracting one-way conversation, be ready so you can pick up right where you left off. Politely ask for a second and jot down a quick note on what you were doing and were about to do, so you can get back up to speed quickly. Prepare your stock responses like “Yes, that is interesting” and “That could only happen to you, Bob/Janet.” Mention that you were in the middle of something and offer to pick up the conversation during a coffee break or at lunch. If all else fails, lock your door (if you have one).

, Sometimes, when experiencing a stressful work project or other situation, you may feel like “powering through” until the job is done is your best (or only) option. In reality, taking even brief breaks after every ninety minutes or so of intense work activity is likely to pay stress-reducing dividends. Meditate, take a walk, call a friend, knit a cap; do whatever healthy, non-stressful activity works for you.Try to make your time at home an extended break from work stress as well. You may have no choice but to “bring your work home with you” to some degree, but you can also choose to set boundaries to limit the encroachment of work onto home and family life. Even if it reduces your productivity a bit, for most people it is a worthwhile trade-off.
On the subject of stress breaks, also make use of your vacation time. And when you go on vacation, make it a vacation, not a business trip. Disconnect as much as possible from your work responsibilities. Take the week to refresh and recharge.

, If you are experiencing too much stress at work, there is a good chance that other people in the office are as well. Commiserating about your common woes can have a calming influence, and sharing stress-reduction strategies can pay dividends as well.If laughter isn’t always the best medicine for reducing stress, it is often an effective one. A timely joke or even just chuckling to yourself as the office seems to be crashing down around you can help calm and refocus you. However, don’t laugh at the expense of other people — it hardly seems right to try to reduce your stress by increasing someone else’s., No one can eliminate all stress, and that is a good thing. Stress derives from the body’s “fight or flight” response that served our distant (and even not so distant) ancestors well when danger was around every corner, and it can still serve you now in situations when you need an adrenaline boost and a heightened awareness. In appropriate doses, it sharpens your focus, clears your mind, and prepares your body to face a challenge.If you can avoid unnecessary stress and reduce excessive stress, whatever remains need not be seen as your enemy. Instead of fearing or fighting it, use it to drive you to achieve in your work.Simply adopting the mindset that stress can be beneficial, and not simply debilitating, can improve work performance and reduce psychological symptoms of stress.One way you can do this is to try reframing. When something stressful pops up or you feel that you're in a stressful situation — a last minute assignment at work, or thoughts about what the future might hold — pause and reframe by considering what might be positive about the situation.Tell yourself the last minute project is a challenge, a chance for you to put your skills to the test and push yourself. Remind yourself that the uncertainty of the future is actually pretty exciting — as far as you know, you could find yourself working or studying in another country in six months, or uncovering a passion you never knew you had, simply by chance.

, A strong, healthy body can deal with the physical effects of stress more successfully. Unfortunately, when under stress, many people turn to unhealthy coping habits like overeating, smoking, or excessive alcohol consumption. Instead, give your body what it needs to function more effectively, and it in turn will help you ward off the negative impacts of stress.Beyond choosing healthy food options like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins, try to eat smaller meals more frequently during the day. This can help keep your blood sugar levels steady, and prevent the spikes and crashes that can exacerbate stress levels.
Getting the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night will help you combat stress. Of course, being stressed can make it hard to sleep. Look into simple strategies you can use to get a better night’s sleep and consult your doctor if needed.
Aim for 30 minutes or more of aerobic exercise — walking, biking, swimming, dancing, etc. — each day. Turn your thoughts away from your stressors and toward your present experience — your breathing, your movement, your surroundings — and you can revitalize your mind and body.

, There are a million stress-reduction strategies out there, but most of the good ones boil down to some common concepts. For simplicity’s sake, remembering the following five words (all starting with “R”) can serve as a good starting point:Reorganize — Make lifestyle changes to avoid and relieve stress.

Rethink — Shift your focus away from your stressors.

Reduce — De-clutter your mind and your surroundings.

Relax — Use meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and other relaxation techniques.

Release — Learn to let go of things that you can’t control.

, For general help with identifying and dealing with stress, you may want to begin by checking out the detailed wikiHow article How to Relieve Stress. Additionally:


Find a good listener. When you are over-stressed, sometimes you just need to express your feelings or vent your frustrations to another person. Often, it is best if that person doesn’t try to diagnose or solve your problems, but just offers a sympathetic ear. If you already have a person in your life like that, seek him or her out and be grateful.Of course, you can also turn to professional counselors or therapists who have been trained to listen and help with stress issues. Talk to your supervisor or HR representative about possible workplace resources, or consult family and friends for references. Don’t be ashamed or afraid; everyone, at some point, needs help dealing with stress. Make sure you do it in a healthy and effective manner."

Find ways to increase your income.",How to Reduce Financial Stress2," While it may not seem realistic to increase your savings, you need to look at the situation in the long-term. Think about short term and long term goals in order to increase your savings.If you don't have a savings account, create one. Consider setting up your direct deposit with your employer so that a portion of your earnings automatically is set aside to a savings account.
Learn to make small changes that can lead to larger savings. For example, if you're able to save just $20 more each month, that could end up being $240 a year.
Be willing to make big changes in your lifestyle in order to get out of debt or overspending. For example, does a half or one-third of your income goes towards rent or your mortgage? Consider if there are ways to reduce your housing expenses. This may entail larger changes such as moving apartments or homes, or living with roommates.

, It's likely easier said than done, but it can make a big difference in your stress level. If you are struggling with student loans, credit cards, or other forms of debit, make debt reduction a priority. Be realistic that you may not pay off your debts until many years from now, but focus on how you make each day and month seem less stressful.If you are struggling to make your monthly debt payments, consider talking with the credit card companies, banks, or student loan companies about any recent hardships such as a job loss or a loss in income. See if you can negotiate lower rates or reduced monthly payments.
Only use your credit cards when you know you can pay off the bill each month (or pay off the bill and pay down any previous debt).

, Think about your spending as everyday choices you make. Many people overspend because our modern culture values wealth and luxurious living. You may feel like you want to have certain things because ""you deserve them."" Choose to make everyday choices that help you to save and feel more secure about your spending.
For example, if you like to regularly go to the mall, consider how the mall is a tempting place that can lead to overspending. Think about if there are other activities that you enjoy which could be less tempting.
You may find greater pleasure and reward in your purchases when they aren't everyday anymore. For example, if you switch to making your coffee at home or bringing your lunch to work, the pleasure of buying coffee at Starbucks or going out to lunch will have that much more meaning as a reward.

, While many people lack enough savings to cover an unexpected expense such as major car repairs or a broken refrigerator, there are unexpected expenses that can come up more often than you'd think. Address these unexpected expenses through an emergency fund.Anticipate that there will be unexpected expenses in life. Avoid increasing your debts because of a lack of foresight.
Once you have evaluated your monthly budget, factor into this budget some savings towards an emergency fund. An emergency fund should ideally cover about three to six month's worth of basic expenses.
Only use the emergency fund for emergencies. For example, don't use this fund to pay for Christmas gifts at the end of the year. If you need extra money for family gifts and expenses, then create a separate fund for this.

, One way to balance your spending is to increase your earnings. Consider the costs and benefits of increasing your income. That may involve taking on a second job, changing your job, or asking others in the household to contribute more.


Think about other job opportunities that could increase your earnings. Maybe there are ways to get a promotion and a higher salary in your company? Maybe you could interview for a new job and negotiate a higher salary?
See if there is another part-time job or extra income you could pick up. For example, if you're a handyman, you could help with a neighbor's chores around the home. Or if you like kids, you could babysit. Discuss with your family about how they may be able to contribute some of their earnings more.
With any of these options, just make sure that your work-life balance is still being considered. Many people reduce their financial stress through more work, only to face other stressors such as reduced time with family and friends, or a lack of sleep.

Assess if you are impulsive when coping with stress.,
Set boundaries when others spend your money.,
Avoid thinking that money can buy you happiness.,

Take care of yourself.",How to Reduce Financial Stress3," While issues of money can cause anxiety for many people, it's important to make it a regular part of the conversation. It shouldn't be a taboo topic in your household in particular. You and your family need to be on the same page about how to spend and how to save.Instead of only bringing up the topic of money when things are past-due or bills keep increasing, talk with your spouse and family about the values that you have related to money.
Explore what you think it going well in terms of finances, as well as what needs improvement.
Choose settings that allow for undivided attention, and help to foster learning. For example, have family dinners be a time to talk about finances and how to manage your money. Teaching your kids in particular about healthy spending habits that will help them in the long run.

, You may feel like you're out of control of your finances, yet cope with this stress by in turn making poor choices. Do you feel like you spend as ""retail therapy""? Do you feel your finances are making you turn to other poor coping habits, such as smoking, drinking, or avoiding people?Stress with work, your family, or your health may cause you to overspend as a way to compensate for feeling overwhelmed. It can be a vicious cycle in which the spending can in turn cause more stress at home or with your health.
Figure out if you are using negative coping to avoid thinking about your financial problems. Do you smoke, drink, or do drugs to avoid stressors about money? Do you make choices that are only about the short-term, such going out and partying with friends, but failing to see how this could lead to more trouble down the road?
Realize that your impulsive habits may be making things more stressful for you. Try replacing negative or impulsive thoughts with positive ones where self-control feels rewarding.

, Sometimes, your financial stressors may not be just your own, but they could involve your partner, relatives, friends, or children. Avoid being taken advantage of as a source of money for other people. Set boundaries of what others can take from you.


If they are relatives or friends, helping out once or twice is one thing. Helping out every week or month is different. Help them to figure out ways to reduce their spending or increase their income. Avoid letting them manipulate you into giving away your money, particularly if you are already struggling.
If they are your spouse or children, this could require you to set spending limits for your spouse and children if they continue to overspending or misuse the money.
Don't enable them by giving money when it only continues their bad habits. For example, let's say that your children continue to overspend their allowance each month on clothes, and end up asking for more money. Address this concern with them and help them to understand where they might be overspending. Set limits if it continues to be an issue.

, While our modern culture often portrays wealth as happiness, it may give a false impression. While being able to meet basic needs like food, shelter, and transportation are key, there are lots of people who get caught up in assessing their worth by how much money they have.Understand that you are not alone in your struggle. Avoid assuming that you're the only person making sacrifices because of financial issues.
Once you have your basic needs met, focus on how you can be happy with what you have. Focus on being grateful for a home, friends, family, a job, and other things that you might take for granted.
Get out of the ""keeping up with Joneses"" mindset. Avoid constantly comparing yourself and your worth based on what your friends, co-workers, or relatives have. If they are only your friends because you're spending money on fancy trips, nights-out, or dinners, this is not likely a genuine friendship.

, Focus your attention on friends and family that don't make you feel less-than if you're having financial stress. Identify people who care about you, no matter how much money you have.Turn your attention to building stronger and healthier relationships with your family and friends. If you're used to buying things for them as a way to show appreciation, consider new ways to show you care by spending more time with them, or using words of affection.
Openly communicate about any financial challenges you may be facing. For example, let's say your friend asks if you want to take a trip with her to New York City this summer. You may already know that you can't afford that. Be honest about your limitations. Loving relatives and friends will understand and be supportive.

, Learn to reduce stress through self-care. Find ways to relax and de-stress without spending lots of money. It could be a matter of having more time to yourself, or feeling more in control of your work and life.


Take five minutes each day to write down what you're grateful for. Consider talking about at least three positive things that happened that day or that week.
Get active. Exercise more at home, at work, or with your family. It could be as simple as taking a walk around the office building, or jogging around the neighborhood.
Set limits when your family or your work needs you. If it's after work hours, avoid taking home piles of work to do. If your spouse wants you to do everything around the house, learn to delegate tasks to your family members.
Find a relaxing space to unwind. Consider taking a nature walk. Having a hot bath. Or relaxing in the backyard. Use this time to avoid distractions. Put away any electronic devices.

, Money problems can be a major cause of stress in a relationship. Think about how your financial decisions, or your partner's, have negatively impacted the relationship. If you're continuing to fight about spending habits and feel like you've reached a stale-mate, consider talking with a therapist or couples' counselor.A couples' counselor can help to teach open lines of communication. They may help you to reframe how to handle your behaviors and your relationship in a clearer way.
Oftentimes the causes of financial stress don't stem from the money itself, but from the actions that lead to the debt, or possibly reckless spending habits. Therapists may help you to take control of those behaviors and find healthier ways to cope when feeling stressed.

Try biofeedback.,
Do deep breathing exercises.,
Meditate.,
Use guided imagery.",How to Manage Stress with Ulcerative Colitis1," Biofeedback is a technique where you work to control your body’s automatic response to something like stress. During biofeedback, you need to be hooked up to sensors that monitor your body’s functions, like heart rate and breathing. During biofeedback, you work towards relaxing your muscles and controlling your breathing, which can help reduce stress by lessening your body’s stress response. Talk to your doctor or therapist to get started with biofeedback.Biofeedback can be done in a doctor or therapist's office.
You can buy devices to wear to help you with biofeedback therapy. The devices connect to your cell phone or computer and produce feedback via an app.;
, Deep breathing exercises are some of the most effective stress-relieving techniques while being some of the simplest. If you feel pain or discomfort due to your ulcerative colitis, you can try focusing on your breath to reduce symptoms or flare ups. You can do deep breathing exercises sitting at your desk at work, lying on the floor, or standing up. You just need to be comfortable and loosen any constricting clothing.Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Breathe in and guide your breath into your belly. Exhale gently as the breath leaves your belly. Try and gain control of your diaphragm and use it to stimulate your parasympathetic nervous system. This will help you to relax and calm down.
Try counting to five as you inhale and then as you exhale.
As you breathe in, your belly should expand. It should deflate or flatten as you breathe out.

, Meditation is a common stress-relieving activity and can help you when you are facing symptoms or stress related to your UC. You don’t have to meditate for hours. A few minutes can help calm you and put your mind at ease. You can meditate anywhere, including work, while exercising, or while waiting for a meeting.You may choose to repeat a calming word or phrase to yourself to calm your mind.
You may try mindfulness, where you focus your attention to the present. You become aware of the moment and accept where you are at the present. Focus on your breath, the smells and sounds around you, and even your thoughts. If you are feeling pain or discomfort due to your ulcerative colitis, you can acknowledge those thoughts, be mindful of them, and let them go.
Practicing mindfulness will help you recognize situations that cause stress and learn how to deal with them.
Let the stressful thoughts enter your mind, and just observe them without any feeling. Then, let go of those thoughts without reacting to them. Accept that you had the stressful thought, then let it pass from your head.

, Guided imagery, also called visualization and guided meditation, is a stress relieving technique that can help you calm your mind and body. When using guided imagery, your mind comes up with images of relaxing places or situations that make you happy or calm you.During guided imagery, you use all five senses.
If you are new to guided imagery, you can use an audio track or video to walk you through the meditation process. You can find many of these online.
For example, you may close your eyes and visualize you are at a serene beach. You come up with the image of gentle waves on the beach, hear the soothing sound of the waves crashing, feel the sand under your feet and ocean breeze against your skin, and smell the salt on the air.

When your schedule is full of activities that keep you productive and distracted, you won't have the time to dwell on the fact that you are lonely. Volunteer. Find a part-time job. Join a book club, or a new gym with interesting group classes. Tackle a few DIY projects. Just get out of your head. What hobbies do you enjoy? What are you naturally good at? What have you always wanted to do that you've never gotten around to doing? Take this opportunity and do it.;
, It's easy to sit at home and allow the day to pass with the cast of your favorite sitcom. However, when you remain in the same environment, the pangs of loneliness will only get worse. Go to a cafe to do your work. Go to the park and simply sit on a bench to watch the passersby. Give your brain some stimuli to distract you from your negative feelings.


Spending time in nature can have a positive impact on your mental health.Getting outside can actually reduce stress, and may also help improve your physical health as well. So, grab a blanket and read a book on the park grass. Doing this regularly just might lift your spirits.

, Doing things you are passionate about can relieve your feelings of loneliness. Think about what makes you feel good. Meditating? Reading European literature? Singing? Go for it. Take some of your precious time and spend it nurturing your passions. Or, ask a peer from school, a buddy at the gym or your neighbor if they want to join you. New friend made.Refrain from using substances to dull the pain of feeling lonely. Find healthy activities that make you feel good - not just temporary fixes that only cover the wound.

, Sometimes, you may be so desperate to get past your feelings of loneliness that you'll take just about any chance that offers itself to be less lonely. Be careful not to seek out bad influences or people who only want to use you. Sometimes, the vulnerability that comes with being lonely can make you a target of manipulative or abusive people. Signs of people who are not interested in a healthy, mutual relationship include:


They seem ""too good to be true."" They call you all the time, plan all of your activities, and seem perfect. Often, these are early warning sign of abusive people who want to take control of your actions.
They don't reciprocate. You may pick them up from work, do them a favor on the weekend, etc., but somehow they never manage to return the favor. These people are taking advantage of your vulnerability to profit.
They get moody when you try to spend time elsewhere. You may be so excited to interact with another person that their controlling behavior doesn't initially bother you. However, if these people check in on you, try to keep track of where you go and who you're with, or express concern that you have friends other than them, this is a warning sign.

, Though it can be hard for those who crave independence, sometimes, we have to depend on others. If you're feeling lonely, reach out to a relative or friend you trust - even if they're a thousand miles or more away. A simple phone call can lift your mood.


If you're going through a hard time, maybe your loved ones don't even know. And, you don't have to tell them all your feelings if you don't feel comfortable. Share what feels comfortable for you. Your loved ones will probably feel honored that you shared your feelings with them.

, The easiest place to start is the internet. There are plenty of resources to connect with others, like local Meetups.Try to connect with people who share the same hobbies or interests as you. Think about what books and movies are your favorite, or where you are from or currently living. There are groups to fit every situation.


Just go looking for opportunities to socialize and take them. Search online for a group fitness class. Find a group of comic book aficionados. Sign up for that intramural league you've been contemplating at work. Get involved in something. Create opportunities. Initiate conversations. It's the only way these patterns of loneliness will change.This may involve getting out of your comfort zone - but you have to think of it as a good thing, a challenge. And if you don't like it, you can opt out. More than likely, you won't be hurt from the situation, but you can learn something from it.

, People need connection so much that they've been breeding furry companions for over 30,000 years.And if Tom Hanks can live with Wilson for years, you could certainly benefit from a dog or a cat. Pets can make terrific companions. Just make sure you don't substitute their company for people. Try to maintain a few human connections so that you have others to talk to and lean on in trying times.


Don't pay thousands of dollars for a dog. Go to your local humane society or pet shelter and rescue a pet that needs a good home.
Research shows that, aside from companionship, pets can improve your psychological well-being and even help you live longer., Social research suggests a connection between self-focus and loneliness. This doesn't mean you shouldn't reflect on your emotions, but it does mean you shouldn't let that become your sole focus. If you extend your focus to others, your loneliness may fade. Studies suggest that volunteering, for example, helps people feel more socially connected and emotionally fulfilled, which fights feelings of lonelinessThe simplest way to extend your focus is to find a group of people you can help. Volunteer at a hospital, soup kitchen, or homeless shelter. Join a support group. Get involved with a charity. Be a big brother or sister. Everyone out there is fighting a battle; maybe you could help them with theirs.
You could even look for ways to help others who may be lonely. The infirm and the elderly are often shut-in away from social interaction. Volunteering to visit an elder care home or ""candy stripe"" in a hospital could help you diminish someone else's loneliness, too.

, Keeping a journal can help you understand where your feelings of loneliness are coming from. For example, if you have a large number of friends, you may feel confused that you still feel lonely. Track when you have these feelings in your journal. When do they appear? What do they look like? What is happening around you when you feel this way?For example, perhaps you just moved out of your parents' house to a new city. You have a group of new friends from work whom you enjoy, but you still feel lonely in the evenings when you come home to an empty house. This suggests that you are looking for someone you can have a stable, strong emotional connection to.
Understanding the source of your loneliness can help you take action to fight it. It can also make you feel better about your feelings. In this example, understanding that you enjoy your new friends but miss the connection you had to your family when you lived with them allows you to acknowledge that what you're feeling is natural.

, Pay attention to the loop of thoughts going through your head during the day. Focus on any thought you have about yourself or other people. If the thought is negative, try to reword it and add a positive spin: ""No one at work understands me,"" becomes ""I haven't made a connection at work with anyone...yet.""Reframing your self-talk can be an incredibly challenging task. Oftentimes, we are not even aware of all the negative thoughts we have in a day. Spend ten minutes a day trying to just notice your negative thoughts. Then, attempt to reframe negative thoughts into more positive ones. Then, work your way up until you spend all day monitoring your self-talk and taking control. Your entire perspective may change after successfully doing this exercise.

, Thinking in all-or-none terms like ""I am lonely now, so I will always be lonely"" or ""I don't have anyone who cares about me"" will only hinder your progress by making you feel more miserable.


Challenge these thoughts when they come to mind. For instance, you can probably think of a few times when you did not feel so lonely. You made a connection with someone, if only for a minute, and you felt understood. Acknowledge and accept that statements derived from black and white thinking just aren't complex enough to reflect the truth of our rich emotional lives.

, Negative thinking can lead to a negative reality. Your thoughts often create a self-fulfilling prophecy.If you think negatively, your perception of the world will be negative, too. If you walk into a party thinking no one will like you and you won't have fun, you'll spend the entire party on the wall, making zero connections and not having fun. On the contrary, with positive thinking, positive things can happen.


The opposite is true, too. If you expect things to go well, they often do. Test out this theory by making a positive assumption about a situation in your life. Even if the results aren't absolutely wonderful, you may not feel so bad about things if you go into the situation with a positive mindset.
A great way to practice positive thinking is to simply surround yourself with positive people. You will notice how these individuals view life and others and their positivity just may rub off on you.Another tactic for positive thinking is to avoid saying anything to yourself that you wouldn't say to a friend. For example, you would never tell a friend that the person is a loser. So, if you find yourself thinking ""I am a loser,"" correct this harsh comment by stating something nice about yourself like ""I make mistakes sometimes, but I am also intelligent, funny, caring, and spontaneous.""

, Sometimes, loneliness is a symptom of a greater problem. If you feel like the entire world just doesn't get you and you just can't seem to see any gray area in your black and white thinking, you may benefit from seeing a therapist or counselor.


Persistent feelings of loneliness can sometimes be an indicator of depression. Seeing a mental health professional for a proper evaluation may help you to recognize signs of depression and adequately treat this disorder.
Just talking to someone about your situation can help. It can give you perspective on what's normal and what's not, what you can do to feel more social, and how much better you may feel just by changing up your routine.

, Loneliness can take on a few different forms and may manifest differently in each person. For some people it's an inkling that comes and goes intermittently, for others it's a nonstop part of their reality. You may have more social loneliness, or more emotional loneliness.



Social loneliness. This type of loneliness includes feelings like aimlessness, boredom, and social exclusion. It can happen when you don't have a solid social network (or if you've been separated from one, such as moving to a new place).

Emotional loneliness. This type of loneliness includes feelings like anxiety, depression, insecurity, and desolation. It can happen if you don't have the strong emotional connections with people that you'd like to.

, A central and mandatory step towards combating loneliness is knowing that, while it may be painful, it is just a feeling. It is not necessarily fact and, therefore, it is not permanent. Proverbially speaking: ""this, too, shall pass."" It has nothing to do with you as a social creature and everything to do with those little neurons in your head firing in an unfortunate, yet changeable, way. You can easily attack your thoughts about loneliness and feel better.Ultimately, you decide what to make of your situation. Take this as an opportunity to better understand yourself and make improvements. Evolutionary understanding of loneliness suggests that the pain it causes can fuel you to take action and become someone you'd never otherwise be able to become.

, Loneliness for an extrovert and loneliness for an introvert are two very different things.Loneliness and being alone aren't the same thing.Think about what the opposite of loneliness would look like for you, and remember that it looks different for each person.Introverted people may desire having a close relationship with one or two people. They may not need to see these friends everyday. Instead, they may enjoy spending time in solitude for the most part and only require the stimulation of others every now and then. However, if their social and emotional needs are not met, introverts can still feel lonely.Extroverted people may need to be around a group of people to feel like their social meter is getting adequately filled. They may feel down when they are not interacting with others who provide stimulation. If their connections are not socially and emotionally fulfilling, though, an extrovert can feel lonely even surrounded by people.Where do you fall on the spectrum? Understanding how your personality impacts your feelings of loneliness can guide you in making decisions about how to overcome these feelings.

, A recent survey revealed that one in every four individuals surveyed described themselves as having no one to talk to about personal matters. When family members were removed from the pool of confidants, that number increased to half the population of respondents.This means that, if you're feeling lonely like you have no one to turn to, between 25 and 50 percent of Americans feel similarly to you.


Scientists are now referring to loneliness a public health concern.Recent studies have shown that people who feel isolated, either by physical distance or subjectively, may die earlier than those who do not.

This helps keep flare ups and symptoms to a minimum, which can reduce your stress and worry. Following your doctor's treatment suggestions, taking any medication, and making lifestyle changes should reduce the risk of symptoms.


You don't want to have to worry about the unnecessary stress that comes from not taking care of yourself. When you have ulcerative colitis, you have enough to worry about. Try to limit the amount of stress you add to yourself by taking care of yourself and following your treatment.

, There are some stressors that you can’t avoid, like work related stress. If possible, avoid any stress that you can. Some stresses are not necessary, and reducing your stress load can help reduce any flare ups of your ulcerative colitis.Say “no” if you have to. Don’t agree to more work at your job if you don’t have time, or don’t agree to help out with a community project if you don’t have the time. Put your health first and say “no” when you need to.
Limit exposure to people who cause you stress. If you have to cut ties with someone because they stress you out and negatively affect your health, then do so.
Make adjustments in your daily life to lessen stress. Leave earlier for work if you have a habit of running behind. Make lunch and gather school supplies together the night before for your children.
Keep in mind that studies have shown that stress is linked to UC, but does not cause the onset or beginning of the condition.“Life Events” or the association of perceived stress is linked to rectal mucosal abnormalities, and is strongly suggestive of an association between psychosocial events and ulcerative colitis.Short term stress is not associated with the exacerbation of UC; however, long term stress is associated with increased exacerbations over months to years., Doing something soothing when you feel stressed out can help you feel better and lift your mood. This may be listening to soothing music, like classical or instrumental, or putting on your favorite upbeat playlist. You may want to watch your favorite television show or movie.Make time to do something fun, happy, and soothing when you feel stressed out.

, Having a positive attitude can do wonders for your stress.

Laughing lifts your mood, and a smile can help you trick your brain into looking on the bright side.Accept that there are some things you can’t change. Stay positive by reminding yourself that you are doing everything that you can do. Giving your all is enough.

It can help you think more positively about your ulcerative colitis and your symptoms. When using CBT, you address the feelings that are making you feel stressed and change those stressful thoughts into more positive ones.


For example, you may tell yourself, “I cannot control my boss, but I can control my reaction and the work I do” or ""I do not need to be anxious about going to the party. My ulcerative colitis will not control my life.""
You may tell yourself, “These stressful thoughts are unhealthy. I do not need this tension. I will let go of this stress and push it from my mind” or ""I will not allow this stress to cause my ulcerative colitis to flare up.""

, Ulcerative colitis can cause physical and emotional stress. You may find comfort in having a trusted group of people who you can rely on if you need them or who you can talk to if things get too much for you. These people should be friends or family members you feel comfortable enough with to share potentially embarrassing details with.These people may lessen your stress because you don’t have to worry about explaining to them what’s going on if you have a flare up or have to run to the bathroom while you are together.
Choose these people carefully. Make sure you are comfortable sharing the details of your condition with these people, and make sure these people will be understanding of your condition.

Recovery is possible, though, as long as you don't give up.The healing process has a beginning, middle, and end for everyone. You're stuck at the beginning now, but if you keep moving forward, you'll eventually reach the end.
Don't get discouraged by the occasional regression. You may feel worse today than you did yesterday, but that's not necessarily a bad sign. Surviving the loss of love usually requires you to go through both ups and downs.;
, If you still find yourself in a state of disbelief, you need to stop running from the loss and admit that it has happened. You need to admit that you lost your love before you can recover from the pain of it.


Don't downplay the loss, either. Your suffering is real. You don't need to feel ashamed of it, nor do you need to hide the fact that you're going through it.

, Pain naturally follows loss, and the loss of a love is no exception. Fighting the need to grieve will leave you feeling more worn out than living with your grief will do.


Don't rush yourself through your grief, either. Everyone heals at his or her own pace, so you shouldn't try to shorten your grieving period in an attempt to seem more ""normal.""

, It's important to give yourself the support system you need right now. Humans are social creatures, so it is easier to survive loss when you're surrounded by people who care about you.


If you feel suicidal or find yourself spiraling out of control, seek immediate professional help. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at: 1-800-273-8255
Even if you're emotionally stable, you should still seek comfort and support from loved ones. Accepting help from others can make you feel more vulnerable, but right now, it is ultimately better to be vulnerable with people who genuinely care for you than to isolate yourself.
Note that help from those who have undergone a similar loss can be especially beneficial. If none of your loved ones have lost a love in a similar manner, consider looking for a support group.
Non-emergency professional help is another option to consider. Counselors and therapists are trained to help people sort through losses just like yours. Scheduling an appointment with a professional is not an overreaction to your loss.

, Meditative breathing can recharge your body and calm your mind. It's a simple technique that can be performed whenever you feel overwhelmed by the pain.


Sit, stand, or lie down in an area free from distraction.
Exhale fully and inhale deeply. Stretch your abdomen and chest with each breath. Focus on your breathing for a few minutes until you feel yourself calm down.

, Give yourself a chance to rest physically, mentally, and emotionally. Pushing yourself too quickly can result in a meltdown and a major setback.


Get plenty of sleep at night. If you're able to nap in the middle of the day and you know your body needs it, indulge in a midday nap, too.
Don't engage in any project that requires heavy emotional or mental commitment for a while. Delay decisions until you feel as though your mind has cleared to prevent errors and additional regrets.

, Get the nutrition you need and avoid substances that may make you feel worse. Remain physically active, as well.


Don't skip meals; it is important to give your body the nutrients it needs even when you don't feel hungry. Eat balanced meals and try to drink eight glasses of water per day.
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and drugs. You can indulge in the occasional sugary comfort food, but don't allow yourself to binge on junk food.
Cardiovascular exercise is good for both your body and your mind. Studies have shown that it can reduce feelings of anxiety and depression during hard times.Try walking at a moderate pace for 20 minutes at least three times a week.

, You need to rest your mind and body, but you shouldn't let yourself become lethargic. Light activity can help you stay on track.


Don't worry about introducing new things into your schedule yet. Simply stick with your current workload.
If your current workload seems too much to handle, ask those around you to help out for a while. Do as much as you can without feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. It's okay to move at a slow pace as long as you keep moving.

, You may feel a range of emotions during the healing stage, including grief, anger, and fear. Let yourself work through each emotion as it comes instead of trying to ignore it.


Mourn now. Deal with the emotional wound while it is still fresh to avoid later complications.
Don't pretend that you're happier than you feel. Pretending requires you to use precious energy that could go toward actually healing. Let yourself cry, shout, and vent your hurt in similarly harmless ways.
Expect to feel afraid. You might be afraid of being alone or afraid that you'll never love again. The first step to conquering any fear is confronting it, so you'll need to be honest about the things you fear before you can bravely work through them.

, Losing your love might cause unresolved issues from the past to rise back to the surface. Accept that your current loss is connected to your past pain instead of trying to separate the two.If your current loss triggers an old issue, the two are unquestionably connected.
By healing from your current loss, you may even start to heal from that past pain.

, The loss of your love is not a reflection of your worth as a human being. No matter how the relationship came to an end, you need to remember that there is more to who you are than your failed relationship.


Be gentle with yourself. Ask yourself how you would respond to a loved one dealing with your sort of grief and give yourself the same sort of compassion and sympathy.
Take the time to reaffirm healthy beliefs. These can include healthy beliefs about your own self-worth, as well as healthy beliefs about the world around you. If you practice a faith or religion, now can be a good time to explore it further.

, It might seem tempting to reconcile with your lost love, but even if neither of you is to blame, reconciliation at this time is often futile and more painful than it's worth.


You need to focus on moving forward. Your past love is part of your past, and right now, you should let him or her stay in your past.
Ask yourself if keeping photographs and mementos are hurting you or helping you. Keep them if they help you heal, but if they delay your healing, get rid of them. You don't have to destroy them, but you should at least pack them away and put them in a place that is out of reach.

, A premature rebound is likely to lead to another loss, though.


Focus on yourself right now. Once you feel satisfied, happy, and whole, you can step back out into the dating world.
If your new love seems perfect in every way, you're probably fooling yourself. Make sure that you view each new relationship realistically.

, Give yourself time to reflect on the past and acknowledge your present feelings. Ignoring your grief won't allow you to heal from it.


Try keeping a journal, but don't force yourself to write in it each day. Use your journal to get thoughts and emotions out of your system when you aren't able to express them or make sense of them otherwise.

, You need to let yourself experience grief, but you also need to introduce positive emotion back into your daily routine.


Watch or read something funny. Spend time with people who make you laugh.
If you can find humor in your loss, or in certain aspects of your loss, let yourself do so.

, Once you've confronted your present hurt, you need to give yourself permission to move forward.


The grieving/healing stage lasts longer for some than it does for others, so there is no way to predict how much time will pass before you are able to grow past it. Once the urge to move forward becomes natural instead of forced, however, you may want to consider acting on it.
You don't need to forget the past, but you do need to reach a point where it is no longer your focus.

, You need to forgive both yourself and your lost love.


Your anger and bitterness has no effect on your lost love. Instead of making him or her miserable, you will only make yourself miserable.
Admit to any mistakes you made. Instead of regretting those errors, commit yourself to correcting them in the present and avoiding them in the future.

, Even though this experience brought you pain, it may have benefitted you in some way, too. Consider the positive things you gained from the relationship and the split.


For instance, your lost love may have introduced you to a hobby you're passionate about or taught you a skill you're glad to have.
In general, people are often improved by the process of loving someone. Nurturing your ability to love with one person can make it easier to love yourself and those around you.
Losing your old love can open the door for a healthier relationship or new path in life.

, Indulge in old interests but try to find a few new ones, as well.


Old interests and passions can be comforting, so they can give you the strength to keep moving forward on otherwise dark days.
New interests shake up your routine and encourage growth as a whole person. By developing a side of you that your lost love never knew, you may begin to feel as though you really have changed from who you were in the past.

, Don't abandon your old friends, but don't undervalue the importance of making new friends, either.


New friends never knew who you were while you were in your old relationship, so their presence won't remind you of your past hurt.
As you meet new people, do your best to be trusting, open, and honest with them. Doing so might be difficult after you were hurt so badly, but remember that the new people you meet were not responsible for your past pain and deserve an opportunity to earn your trust.

, Learn to love yourself when you're alone. You should love who you currently are, but working toward some positive self-improvements can reinvigorate your self-esteem and make the process easier.


Quit a bad habit, like smoking, or start on a healthy diet and exercise program (if you need it). If there's an aspect of your personality that frustrates you, take steps to improve it. For instance, consider a class on public speaking if you want to be more comfortable talking in front of strangers.
Work on one self-improvement at a time to avoid overwhelming yourself. If you overwhelm yourself, you're more likely to fail, and failure may cause a setback in your growth.

, When you have a hard time loving yourself or begin feeling sorry for yourself, a good way to combat the feeling is to focus on doing something kind for someone else.


Be there for your friends and relatives when they need your support.
Take time to volunteer. Mow your neighbor's lawn or spend a few hours at a local soup kitchen. Walk dogs at a nearby animal shelter or visit an acquaintance in the hospital.

Cry.,
Exercise.,
Smile.,
Listen to music.,
shower warm bath or.",How to Overcome Sadness1," Some studies suggest that crying may have a relaxing effect on the body by releasing endorphins, a natural “feel-good” chemical in your body. Crying may also activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps your body recover from stress and trauma.


Several studies suggest that crying is a useful coping mechanism because it communicates pain to others. It may also encourage others to show support.Dr. William Frey’s idea that crying removes toxins from the body is very popular in the media. This may be true, although the amount of toxins eliminated by crying is negligible. Most tears are reabsorbed in your nasal cavity.
One study suggested that whether you feel better after crying is linked to how your culture views crying. If your culture (or even your family) views crying as something shameful, you may not feel better after crying.Don’t make yourself cry if you don’t feel like it. While popular wisdom holds that not crying after a sadness-provoking incident is unhealthy, this is not the case. Crying because you feel obligated to may actually keep you from recovering.;
, Several studies have shown that exercise releases endorphins and other chemicals that can help fight sadness.One study showed that participants who did moderate exercise over a 10-week period felt more energetic, positive, and calm than those who did not. In addition, the benefits of exercise were greater for people experiencing depressed mood.Exercise will also give you a time to focus on one specific goal. This may help distract you from focusing on your sadness.
You don’t have to run a marathon or be a gym rat to see the benefits of exercise. Even light activities such as gardening and walking show a positive effect.

, Several studies have shown that smiling, even when you are sad, can help you feel better.Duchenne smiles, or smiles that engage your eye muscles as well as those near your mouth, have the strongest positive effect on your mood. So if you are feeling sad, try to smile. Even if you don’t feel like it at first, it may help you feel more positive. In fact, there are 19 types of smiles that you can perform.


Research has also showed the opposite: people who frown when they feel unhappy are likely to feel more unhappy than those who do not (or cannot) frown., Listening to music can help soothe and relax you. Why you choose to listen to music is as important as what you listen to. Listening to “beautiful but sad” classical music that you enjoy may help people work through their own sadness.It’s not a good idea to use music to reminisce about sad situations or experiences. Research has shown that this may make your sadness worse. Choosing music that you find beautiful is the most effective way to relieve sadness.If sadness has you feeling stressed out, the British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the “world’s most relaxing music” according to science. These songs include music by Enya, Airstream, Marconi Union, and Coldplay., Research has shown that physical warmth has a comforting effect. Taking a warm bath or a hot shower will help you relax. It may also help you soothe your feelings of sadness."

Reflect on why you're sad.,
Notice how you feel when you're sad.,
Learn to accept the feeling and ride it out.,
Have a plan for when sadness hits.,
Look for signs of depression.",How to Stop Being Sad2," Sadness is a normal reaction to many life events and ongoing situations. You may feel sad when you experience loss, when your feelings get hurt, or when things don't go your way. Understanding the source of your sadness can help you begin to process the feeling and deal with it in a healthy way. Here are some common reasons people experience sadness:


Loss of a friendship or another close relationship
Death of a loved one, or separation from a loved one
Bullying
Low self-esteem

Hearing about a tragedy

, Being sad doesn't feel good, so it's tempting to try to push the feeling away instead of taking a closer look. However, identifying the feeling of sadness will help you isolate it from your other emotions. Looking sadness square in the face will help you notice when the feeling starts and ends, making it easier to handle.You might experience sadness as a physical sensation. Maybe your arms and legs feel heavy or you have an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach. You might feel lethargic, too.
It can help to picture sadness as an image. You've probably heard people describe feeling a ""wave of sadness."" Try picturing sadness in your own way. It could be a towering wave or a deep, dark pool. If you're not sure what it is, it might help to draw a picture of how sadness makes you feel.

, Recognize when sadness comes, and allow yourself accept the feeling instead of pushing it away. If it's a wave, let it wash over you without resisting. Think about what's making you sad and realize that your feelings are valid.A normal bout of sadness can last just a few minutes or much longer, depending on the reason why you're sad.
As you process the sadness, recognize when it comes to a natural end. Pay attention to when you feel a little lighter, and you're able to turn your attention to a new emotion.

, Next time you feel sadness, recognize that it's an emotion that will come and go, just like other emotions. It can help to have a plan for what you'll do during and after the bout of sadness, so you know this is something you can handle.When you start to feel sad, you may want to go to a certain place where you have some privacy. There, you can call up the image of sadness that you constructed - a wave, a pool, or whatever image you came up with. Let yourself feel sad.
Plan to do something else when the sadness starts to recede. You might want to call a friend, go for a walk, or do something else to help you move past the sadness.

, When sadness doesn't go away and make room for other emotions, it could be a sign that you are depressed. Depression is when you have a low, sad mood that lasts longer than two weeks and interferes with your life.With depression, just processing your sadness won't be enough to manage your feelings in a positive way. Making lifestyle changes and seeking professional help are the best ways to manage depression. If you have depression, you may have one or more of the following symptoms:


Feelings of sadness and anxiety
Feelings of worthlessness or low self-esteem
Negative thought patterns and feelings of hopelessness
Low energy level
Changes in appetite and weight
Changes in sleep patterns
Suicidal thoughts

Consider alternative treatments.",How to Stop Being Sad3," If you find that you cannot overcome your sadness on your own, talk with a mental health professional. A trained therapist or psychologist can work with you to learn new ways of thinking and coping. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an approach that has been shown to give people to the tools to handle depression.


This practice focuses on using techniques to help people focus on the present, rather than getting carried away with negative thoughts.
It can be used in conjunction with medication as well.

, In some cases, people suffering from sadness or depression begin to feel better by taking medication.Antidepressants can help alleviate chronic feelings of sadness or depression.Your doctor may prescribe a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram. SSRIs generally cause fewer side effects than other antidepressant drugs.Your doctor may prescribe serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine, venlafaxine , desvenlafaxine, and levomilnacipran.Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), such as bupropion, are not generally associated with the sexual side effects of other anti-depressants.Tricyclic antidepressants are generally prescribed when other anti-depressants haven’t worked. These drugs-- including imipramine, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine, desipramine, and protriptyline—can have significant side effects.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a last resort antidepressant. MAOIs, such tranylcypromine, phenelzine, and isocarboxazid, are also generally prescribed when nothing else works. Be aware these drugs can have serious side effects., You and your care providers may want to consider other treatment options if medications and lifestyle remedies are not working. From hospital stays to transcranial magnetic stimulation, these alternative treatment options may help you stop feeling sad.If you are not able to properly care for yourself, you and your doctor may want to consider a hospital stay or outpatient day treatment to help you deal with your depression.Electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, is a surgical procedure in which electrical currents are passed to the brain to improve brain function.ECT comes with minimal side effects and can relieve severe depression immediately.Transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, is an option for those who haven’t responded to antidepressants.For this procedure, a treatment coil is placed against your scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate your nerve cells that are involved in mood regulation."

Try to stop feeling sad when you want to feel other emotions.,
Let go of sad feelings once they've run their course.,
Avoid ignoring persistent sad feelings.",How to Stop Being Sad4," It can hurt to feel sad, so it's normal to want to switch off the sadness and feel happiness again. Usually this is easier said than done, but sometimes you just need a change in perspective. If you're in a mental rut, and you feel ready to open the curtains and let in some sunlight, try different techniques to help you stop being sad.

, When you feel sad about a particular event or problem, it's hard to just make the feeling go away. Once you've given yourself time to fully experience the sadness, the load should start to lighten. You can help the sadness recede more quickly by staying healthy, talking it out, and using other methods that help you stop feeling sad. When the sadness is ready to go away, it will.

, Sometimes, no matter what you try, you can't stop feeling sad. Distracting yourself or trying to escape from the feeling will only set you further back.

Embrace your age.,
Adopt a healthy lifestyle.,
Set goals.,
Associate with like-minded individuals.",How to Stop Feeling Too Old," Most likely all you have to do is think about how you handled a few social or professional situations in your twenties (or even thirties) and cringe. With age comes wisdom (hopefully) so it’s time to embrace everything you’ve learned and love the fact that you are a more enlightened human being.


Realize that with age comes wisdom. Even though you may not still have the same body as you did in your twenties you have something more powerful--knowledge. Eye candy can only take you so far in life, but knowledge and life lessons can open an entirely new dimension. Love the fact that you have lived enough to know better and use that knowledge to your advantage.
Tap into knowing that you are only as old as you want to be. You can certainly act like you are in your 80’s even though you are only 42. You are only limited by your desire to live in the here and now so know that if you truly want to feel young, you have to remove mental limitations and open your mind.
Use your age to become more bold. Perhaps in your twenties you would have been too meek to ask for a raise at work or afraid to ask that cute server out on a date. However, you may find that in middle to old age, those insecurities are gone, providing you with limitless opportunities.
See middle or old age as being a time where opportunities abounds. In addition to having more knowledge, middle and older aged individuals most likely have more capital in their pocket, providing more opportunities. When you were struggling in your twenties you would have loved to travel. However back then you could only afford a youth hostel and a backpack. Now that you are more mature you may have the dough to fund not only an international trip, but one where you can afford to stay in upscale accommodations and see the sights in comfort.;
, One of the easiest (and best) ways to stop feeling too old is to adopt a healthy way of living. Toxic food such as fast food or overly processed meals not only make you put on weight, but they corrode your organs. Not only will you feel healthier, you’ll feel younger eating a diet that consists of whole, organic foods derived from nature.


Start (or continue) exercising. Exercise does wonders not only for creating a hot bod, it can help to improve your mood and give you more energy throughout the day. You don't have to run a marathon in order to get on the path to feeling younger. Just doing cardio for an hour a day for at least five days will rejuvenate muscle mass and rev up the metabolism.
Leave kid food for the kids. If you are still eating chicken nuggets, pizza, fries and other culinary delights typically reserved for college kids, it’s time to progress to adulthood. Eating kid food will not make you feel young and it can actually make you feel older than you really are. Fresh vegetables, lean meat and whole grains are the only way to regain your youth.
Reflect and meditate at least once a day. Stress can add years to your life both mentally and physically. While most adults cannot just avoid stress, there are ways you can combat and reduce it’s effects. In addition to eating a healthy diet and exercising, meditation or reflection at least once a day, in a quiet peaceful setting will help you quell the stress demons.
Visit your physician. Body and hormonal changes continue to occur throughout middle age and well into old age. Visit your doctor to have necessary tests performed and possibly medication prescribed to keep you at the top of your game.

, If you are middle aged or beyond and feel as though your best years are behind you, you will most likely feel extremely old. If you find yourself saying that you would have loved to have been a doctor or actor but are too old, stop yourself. It is never too late to realize your dream, no matter your age. Set goals and go for the gusto--you’ll feel years melt away.


Pursue dreams you had, but never had time to address. Perhaps you were too busy raising children or just trying to make ends meet, but now have time and possibly the money to re-focus on what you want. Don’t use age as an excuse--find out what it will take to pursue your goals and enact a plan to make your dream happen.
Use your education and life skills to reach goals. Perhaps in your twenties you had no idea how you would ever reach a certain goal. However later in life you’ve not only acquired more knowledge, but also more connections and cash to make things happen.
Bring someone along for the ride. There’s nothing like having a partner in “crime” while you are pursuing your dream. Whether its your spouse or a close friend, get them involved and inspire that individual to also pursue goals and dreams.

, Those who are in a more positive, youthful mindset will give off the vibe to others and create a more progressive way of living.


Join an organization or club that attracts individuals that share your passions. Whether your passion is animal rescue or ballroom dancing, join a group where you will meet others of all ages who share your desires.
Don’t take age into consideration. Age is only a state of mind so don’t seek out others because of their age (young or old).
Embark upon an adventure with friends. Try something new with others who have a lust for life. Take a cooking class, go skydiving, zip lining or run a half marathon. Plan an adventure and try something new.

Your emotions provide you with information. It is your responsibility to correctly reflect and identify the emotions you may be experiencing and decide what the most effective and responsible action would be. Emotions should not be identified as irrational, and it is important to validate and acknowledge these emotions as you are experiencing them. However, your behavioral actions and what you decide to do with your emotions can lead to irrationality and destructive behavior if you are not attuned with yourself.
, Grief is your response to any form of loss. You are uniquely different from other people in how you process your experiences of loss and how you go through the grieving process. Grieving encompasses a wide range of feelings and emotions, which may include anger, acceptance, guilt, regret, sadness, loss of meaning and purpose in life, and more. As you go through these emotions, it is your way of emotionally processing and adapting to the loss you have experienced.

Some thoughts you may experience when grieving are, “It’s all my fault, I should have been there,” “There is nothing more I could have done; she had a good life,” “Why did this happen to me, and not them?” and “This isn’t fair.” Depending on the type of thoughts you process, it can be either troubling or soothing. Additionally, these thoughts may yo-yo back and forth from positive to negative as you try to make sense of your loss.

, Learn about the emotions and thoughts people typically have after a bereavement, divorce, or another loss. Knowing what to expect may not make grieving any easier, but it will help reassure you that you are normal and not alone.Understand that the grieving process is not linear. Meaning that not everyone will have the same emotional experiences, and sometimes you can go back and forth between different phases of the grieving process. It is important to note that you should not compare your own grieving with that of someone else’s, and that there is no right or wrong way to experience grief.

The grieving process involves different emotions, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. However, not everyone goes through these emotions in the same order, and some people experience two or more of them at once.
Grieving behaviors can be expressed in the form of crying, verbal or behavioral outbursts, and even laughter. Some people prefer to be alone while going through this process, while others may prefer to spend time surrounded by friends and family. While there may be no right or wrong way to experience grief, some thoughts and behaviors are more helpful and safer than others.

, Acknowledge your jealousy, as well as any other emotions you’re dealing with. Commit to facing your feelings head-on. Allow yourself to experience your emotions without questioning or repressing them., It’s common to feel a wide range of emotions, including jealousy, as you cope with a recent loss. Realize that feeling jealous does not make you a bad person. Rather, it’s a natural reaction to the pain and sense of unfairness you’re living with., A ceremony of some sort can help you overcome grief and deal with the jealousy that sometimes accompanies it. Bringing meaning to your loss in a way that gives you closure and release can also help you move past the feelings of jealousy you have.

Try writing a letter to the loved one you lost. If your grief is over a relationship or job, write a letter to your future self explaining all that you have learned by going through the process.
If you are grieving a deceased love one, you might ask others to join you in preparing a meal of the person's favorite foods, attending a spiritual service, or releasing balloons in their memory., Jealousy is an emotional response to loss or the fear of losing something. When you feel jealousy, you may also feel other emotions such as grief, anger, hurt, insecurity, or sadness. It is important not to confuse jealousy and envy, as they have two completely different meanings and are not the same. Envy is the desire to have something that you do not possess. Jealousy is related to the loss of something you already possess., Normal experiences to jealousy allow you to further evaluate yourself and the experiences you’ve encountered related to loss. When utilized in an appropriate and healthy way, it can help us become more aware of our insecurities so we can address them appropriately. Normal jealousy should do the following:

Give you the insight and motivation you need for self-improvement based on the current circumstances you face from the loss you’ve experienced.
Provide you with warnings about a potential loss and motivate you to problem solve.
Irrational jealousy occurs when the jealousy is not based upon factual evidence, and there is no apparent rational justification for the person to be jealous. Additionally, this type of feeling may be just more than a fleeting emotion, and more of one that is lingering. The person who dwells on irrational jealousy may also engage in some sort of negative behaviors. These types of behavior include: violence, stalking, retribution, obsessive behaviors, and inability to trust others.

, Avoid thinking of yourself as a jealous person. Instead, remind yourself that a part of you is still happy for people who have not suffered a loss like yours. By splitting your ego like this, you can respect your own emotions while maintaining a healthy perspective on them.If you catch yourself sarcastically asking, ""What do they have to be so happy about?"" reframe the question with ""There is much to be happy about. I need to remember this despite my loss. I won't always feel sad.""

, When you see other people taking things for granted that you don’t have anymore, it’s easy to feel frustrated, but don’t act on your feelings. Lashing out at loved ones or strangers will damage your relationships and make you feel worse in the long run.Focus on controlling your actions, not your emotions.
If you do take your emotions out on others, apologize quickly. You might say, ""I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said that. It's just so hard for me to smile, and I have trouble remembering not everyone feels that way. Please forgive me.""

, If there is someone who is also grieving, seek out their company. It can help to be with someone who empathizes with your emotional pain. Being with a close friend or family member can uplift your spirits and help you feel less alone in your grief.

Reach out to them and say, ""I have been feeling horrible these past few days. Can we hang out?""The two of you may bond over the fact that everyone seems so happy or that the world is moving on despite your loss.

, If certain settings and people make your jealousy worse, avoid them as much as possible until you feel ready to handle them again. Give yourself time to heal without unnecessary reminders of your grief.For instance, someone who has recently lost a partner might not want to spend time around couples for a while.

, Social networks are known for creating feelings of jealousy because they typically show a highlight reel of everyone else's life. It can be hard to watch friends and family, or even distant acquaintances, enjoying their lives while you are hurting. Don't place yourself in the situation where you start to feel resentful of their happiness. Log off, if you must.It can also help to remind yourself that even though most people only display the good moments on social media, they, too, have hard times. Everyone grieves at some point.

, It can be difficult to process the sadness and jealousy of grief on your own. A therapist may be able to help you cope with your emotions and, eventually, find ways to move on. Look for a therapist who specializes in helping people through the grieving process.If you’re unable to accept the loss, or if you’re having trouble functioning in day-to-day life, you may be depressed. Arrange to see a doctor or therapist right away if you think this is the case, or ask a loved one to help you set up an appointment.
Connecting with a grief counselor or therapist is an effective way to have someone teach you how to cope with any stressors that may be associated with the loss. Because you are unique in your experiences, your therapist will be able to specifically tailor your individual sessions to meet your needs and goals.
It may also be beneficial for you at this point to seek out additional help through support groups or group therapy sessions. Sometimes connecting with others who share similar experiences may bring you a sense of peace and comfort in a time of distress.

, Everyone’s grief is different, and there’s no set timeline for moving on from a loss. Give yourself as long as you need to work through your emotions. Avoid comparing your own grief to other people’s, and don’t push yourself to feel better within a certain period of time.Some people might start feeling better within months, while others might need years.
Know that you may never be able to feel the way you did before the loss. However, you can still find purpose and fulfillment in life as you recover from grief.

, Lean on your support network instead of grieving alone. Your friends and family members can provide both practical and emotional support to help you get through this tough time. Let your loved ones know what you need, whether that means keeping you company, helping with meals, or driving you to therapy appointments.If other people reach out to you, accept their help.
Your loved ones may not know how to act around you, or they may worry about saying the wrong thing. Put them at ease by telling them what you need.
For example, you could tell your friends that you still want to spend time with them, even though you can’t act happy right now.

, Family and holiday traditions can bring back painful memories for people who have suffered a loss. Come up with some new, personally meaningful traditions that don’t remind you of your grief.For instance, consider taking a trip during the holidays instead of staying home.
On the other hand, if you find your traditions comforting, you don’t have to change them.

, Make time to relax and do something kind for yourself every day. Look for small things to enjoy, like the warmth of a sunny day or the taste of your favorite food. If you feel up to it, consider doing volunteer work to regain a sense of meaning in life.It can be cathartic to reach out and help other people who are going through the same thing as you.

Acknowledge your feelings.,
Distract yourself.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Try meditation.,
Take up yoga or tai chi.",How to Overcome Sadness2," Sadness is normal and can even be healthy. Research has shown that experiencing mixed feelings and negative feelings is crucial to mental well-being.Many studies have shown that people who apologize for or repress their feelings actually intensify those negative feelings.


Try to acknowledge your emotions without judging yourself for them. It’s easy to think, “This isn’t a big deal, why am I so sad about it?” Instead, accept your emotions for what they are. This will help you manage them., Studies have shown that rumination, or the process of going over and over your feelings of sadness, hinders recovery. Distracting yourself from ruminating on your sadness may help you overcome it.Find pleasant things to do. Doing things that you enjoy can help you overcome sadness, even if you don’t initially feel like doing them.Go for a walk. Take an art class. Find a new hobby. Learn how to play classical guitar. Whatever it is that you get enjoyment out of, make yourself do it.
Interact with friends. Interacting with loved ones can boost your body’s production of oxytocin. Go to a movie, grab a coffee, go on a blind date. Studies have shown that retreating from others can worsen depressive symptoms, including sadness., Mindfulness is based on acknowledging your experiences and accepting them without judging them or yourself. Research has shown that practicing mindfulness can actually change how your brain responds to sadness. It can also help you recover from sadness faster.Because mindfulness focuses on remaining in the present moment, it can help you avoid rumination.

, A common mindfulness technique is mindfulness meditation. Several studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can reduce your brain’s responses to negative emotional stimuli.Mindfulness meditation can also alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.
A basic mindfulness meditation takes about 15 minutes. Find a quiet, comfortable place. Sit, either in a chair or on the floor with your legs crossed. Loosen tight clothing and make yourself comfortable.Choose one aspect of your breathing to focus on. This could be the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe, or the sensation of air going through your nostrils. Focus your concentration on that element.
Inhale slowly through your nose. Allow your abdomen to relax and expand as you fill your lungs. Slowly exhale through your mouth.
Continue breathing as you expand your focus. Notice the sensations you feel. These could include the feeling of your clothes against your skin or the beat of your heart.
Acknowledge these sensations but don’t judge them. If you find yourself getting distracted, return to focusing on your breathing.

, Yoga and Tai Chi have been shown to relieve stress and elevate mood. These effects may be because of the emphasis on “self-awareness” in these forms of exercise. Many studies have shown that Yoga and Tai Chi help relieve physical and psychological pain.Taking classes with others may provide more relief than doing these exercises on your own.

Recognize natural grief reactions.,
Do not judge your feelings.,
Understand the stages of grief.,
Recognize denial.,
Recognize anger.,
Recognize bargaining.,
Recognize depression.,
Seek help from friends and family.,
Give yourself time.",How to Overcome Sadness3," Grief is the feeling of sadness that comes when you lose something or someone you value. How individuals grieve differs widely, but grief is a natural reaction to loss. Some common types of loss include:Losing a loved one, such as a friend, relative, or romantic partner
Knowing a loved one is experiencing serious illness
Losing a relationship
Losing a pet
Scoring less in any test or exam
Leaving home or moving to a new home
Losing a job or a business
Losing important or sentimental objects
Losing physical abilities

, Everyone reacts to grief and loss in their own way. There is no one “right” way to grieve. Some reactions to loss include:Disbelief. It can be hard to accept that the loss has occurred. You may experience thoughts such as “This can’t be happening” or “This doesn’t happen to people like me.”

Confusion. You may have trouble concentrating immediately after a loss. You may also experience forgetfulness or have trouble expressing your thoughts and feelings.

Numbness. You may experience feelings of emotional numbness early in the grieving process. This may be your brain’s way of keeping you from feeling overwhelmed.

Anxiety. It’s natural to feel anxious, nervous, or worried after a loss, especially if the loss was sudden.

Relief. This emotion can cause people a lot of shame, but it is also a natural response. You may feel relieved that a loved one who had suffered through a long, painful illness is finally at peace. Do not judge yourself for this feeling.Physical symptoms. You may experience a variety of physical symptoms after a loss. These could include feeling breathless, headaches, nausea, weakness, and fatigue. You may have trouble sleeping, or you may feel like sleeping all the time.

, It is common for people who have lost material objects or pets to feel embarrassed, as though they “shouldn’t” grieve these losses.Avoid these “should” statements and accept your grief. It is never wrong to grieve a loss of something or someone you value.


Some research has shown that the death of a beloved pet may hurt as much as losing a family member.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has a “Pet Loss Hotline.” They can help you with issues including when to euthanize an ill pet, how to handle your grief, and how to love a new pet. Their number is 1-877-GRIEF-10.

, Almost everyone experiences grief in five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.Not everyone goes through the stages in this order. For many people, grief forms a cycle of stages that gradually lessens over time.These stages are not prescriptive. They should not tell you how to feel. Use them as a way to recognize what you’re feeling and deal with that. Never feel guilty for how you experience grief.
The stages may not occur as separate stages. You may experience several stages overlapping. You may not experience some stages at all. There is no single normal experience of loss. Your experience of grief is natural and unique to you., Denial is usually one of the first reactions to a loss or bad news.It often manifests as a feeling of numbness. It may also include thoughts like “This isn’t real,” “I can’t handle this,” or even “I feel fine.”


A common thought while experiencing denial is wishing that it was “all a dream.”
Don’t confuse feeling numb or in shock as “not caring.” Denial is your mind’s way of protecting you from intense emotion as you adjust to your new situation. You may care very deeply about someone and still react with numbness or denial., Anger is another natural reaction to loss. This feeling may manifest as thoughts such as “It’s not fair” or “Why did this happen to me?” You may look for someone or something to blame for your loss. Anger is a common response to feeling as though you have lost control of a situation. It is also a common response to feeling like you have been harmed.


Talk with a grief counselor and/or support group as you experience anger. It can be difficult to manage anger on your own.It’s important to talk with people who will not judge your anger but can help you through it.

, Bargaining thoughts and feelings may occur some time after the initial loss. These thoughts may be about what you “could have done” to prevent the loss. You may feel extremely guilty. You may fantasize about going back in time and doing things differently to prevent this loss.It’s important to seek help during this stage too. If you cannot resolve your feelings of guilt, you may not be able to help yourself heal. Talk to a mental health professional or find a grief support group., Depression is a very common reaction to loss. It may last for only a short time, or it may take a long time to recover from. It’s important to seek professional mental health help as you work through depression. If left untreated, depression usually gets worse. Symptoms of depression include:Fatigue
Disturbed sleep patterns
Feelings of guilt, helplessness, or worthlessness
Feelings of fear and sadness
Feeling disconnected from others
Headaches, cramps, muscle aches, and other physical pains
Loss of enjoyment in things you used to like
Changes in your “normal” mood (increased irritability, mania, etc.)
Disturbed eating patterns
Suicidal thoughts or plansIt might be very difficult to tell the difference between sadness during grieving and clinical depression. People who are grieving could experience all these symptoms. However, a person is more likely to be clinically depressed if the person is thinking about suicide or has a plan for suicide. If you are having suicidal thoughts, seek immediate medical help.

, It may help to talk about your grief with people who are close to you. Sharing feelings of sadness with others may help them feel less intense., The sadness from a loss may take a long time to heal. Be patient and kind with yourself. It may take awhile for you to achieve “acceptance,” the final stage of grieving."

Exercise.",How to Overcome Sadness4," Depression is unlikely to improve on its own.Sadness is a natural human emotion. It can occur as a response to loss. It can be the result of experiencing something unpleasant or uncomfortable. Sadness or “feeling down” usually lessens on its own over time. It is often not a constant feeling. Sadness may come and go. It is usually triggered by a particular experience or event.Clinical depression is more than sadness. It is not a feeling that people can just “get over.” It rarely lessens over time. It is usually near-constant or constantly present. It may not be triggered by any particular event or experience. It can be so overwhelming that it interferes with daily living., Clinical depression may manifest differently in different individuals. You may not have all of the symptoms of this disorder. Symptoms usually interfere with your daily life activities and may cause significant distress or dysfunction.If you frequently experience five or more of these symptoms, you may have clinical depression:Changes in sleep habits
Changes in eating habits
Inability to focus or concentrate, “feeling fuzzy”
Fatigue or lack of energy
Loss of interest in things you used to enjoy
Irritability or restlessness
Weight loss or weight gain
Feelings of despair, hopelessness, or worthlessness
Physical aches, pains, headaches, cramps, and other physical symptoms that have no clear cause

, Depression has many causes, and researchers are not yet entirely certain how it works. Early trauma may cause changes in how your brain handles fear and stress. Many studies suggest that clinical depression may be partly genetic. Life changes such as losing a loved one or going through a divorce may trigger an episode of major depression.Clinical depression is a complex disorder. It may be partially caused by trouble with neurotransmitters in your brain, such as serotonin and dopamine.Medication may help regulate these chemicals and alleviate depression.
Substance abuse, such as misuse of alcohol and drug use, is strongly linked to depression.Studies suggest that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals may suffer from higher rates of depression. This may be because of a lack of social and personal support systems., If you have depressive symptoms that interfere with your daily life, consider talking with your physician. S/he may prescribe you antidepressant medications that can help regulate the hormones in your brain that affect mood.Be sure to describe all of your symptoms honestly to your doctor. There are several types of antidepressant medication. Your symptoms will help your doctor determine which medicine may be most helpful to you.
Your individual body chemistry can respond to medications very differently. You and your doctor may need to try several antidepressants before you find one that works for you. If you feel your medication is not helping after a few months, speak with your doctor.Do not switch or stop taking antidepressant medications without consulting your doctor first. This could cause serious health and mood issues.If you continue to have difficulty with your antidepressant medication, consider seeing a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with special training in psychiatric health. They may be able to help refine your medication to find the right treatment for you., Because depression is affected by so many factors, it’s crucial to seek help from a professional. A mental health professional can help you understand and navigate your emotions. Treatment that includes psychotherapy in addition to antidepressant medication is often more effective than medication alone.There are two common myths about depression. One is that you should just “snap out of it.” The other is that seeking help is a sign of weakness. These are not true. Admitting that you need help to manage your health is a sign of strength and self-care.There are many types of mental health professionals. Psychiatrists and Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are usually the only ones who can prescribe medication. They may also offer therapy.Psychologists have a doctorate degree in a field of psychology (clinical, educational, counseling) and specialized training in therapy. They are usually less expensive than psychiatrists, but more expensive than the other options.
Licensed Clinical Social Workers have master’s degrees in Social Work. They may offer psychotherapy services. They can usually also help you find other resources in your community. LCSWs  often work at community health clinics and university health centers.
Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists have specialized training in handling couples and family issues. They may or may not also provide individual psychotherapy.
Licensed Professional Counselors have a master’s degree in counseling. They usually have supervised training in offering mental health services. LPCs often work at community health clinics.

, If you have health insurance in the United States, it’s important to contact your insurance company to learn which mental health providers in your area are covered by your plan. Some insurance companies may require a physician’s referral. Many companies only cover treatments by certain providers.

, Withdrawal from social relationships is a common symptom of depression. However, you are likely to feel better if you reach out to your loved ones. They can provide support and love.You may not “feel like” seeing or interacting with others. It’s important to encourage yourself to do so anyway. Isolating yourself may worsen your depression., You cannot “cure” depression simply by changing your diet. However, you can choose foods that promote feeling well.


Choose complex carbs. Whole grains, brown rice, beans, and lentils are good sources of complex carbohydrates. These carbs leave you feeling full longer and help manage blood sugar levels.Avoid sugar and simple carbs. These may provide a temporary “high,” but the crash can worsen depressive symptoms.Eat fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are high in nutrients such as vitamin C and beta-carotene. These antioxidants can help fight free radicals that disturb body functioning. Try to incorporate fresh fruit and veg into most meals.Get enough protein. Several studies have shown that higher protein intake can boost your alertness.It may also help improve your mood.Incorporate Omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in many nuts, oils such as flaxseed and soybean oil, and dark green leafy vegetables. They are also found in fatty fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines. Some research suggests that eating more fatty acids may have a mild protective effect against depression., Depression often interrupts your sleeping habits. It’s important to get about eight hours of sleep a night.Try to establish healthy sleeping habits, like going to bed at a regular time and limiting TV exposure before bed.


Individuals with chronic insomnia are at much higher risk of developing clinical depression.Sleep apnea, a disorder that obstructs your breathing while you sleep, is also linked to clinical depression., If you are depressed, you may well not feel like getting out and exercising. However, many studies have shown that exercise elevates your mood. Try to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.Strength-training at least twice a week is also helpful.Some research suggests that you may be less likely to become depressed if you exercise regularly.People who are obese may be more likely to become depressed. Scientists do not fully understand this link, but exercise can help combat obesity and depression."

Cry.,
Take a few minutes to breathe deeply.,
Start journaling.,
Turn to a creative hobby.,
Rely on your support system.,
Reward yourself.,
Take a break to laugh.,
Give yourself a timeout.,
Avoid turning to drugs or alcohol.",How to Make Yourself Feel Better1," Emotional tears signal the body to release endorphins or “feel-good” hormones to promote a feeling of calm and well-being.Not only does crying allow your body to release stress hormones, but at the end of a good cry, the body assumes a calmer state with a lower heart and breathing rate.Engage in beneficial crying. This is crying that allows you to release stress and bottled up emotions and does not interfere with your daily functioning.


If you seem to have no control over when or how often you cry or if your crying is interfering with your work or home life, this may be an indication of a larger problem, such as depression or an anxiety-related condition. Consider seeing a counselor or therapist who can teach you techniques to control crying that’s interfering with your daily functioning.;
, The simple action of taking full, deep breaths can help you start to feel better. Deep breathing increases oxygen supply throughout the body, which can help to relax muscles and reduce your blood pressure when you’re upset or stressed.Deep breathing also helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which produces a calming affect.The very act of focusing on your breathing rather than the stressful situation at hand can begin helping you feel better.


Those who practice deep breathing for twenty to thirty minutes each day experience reduced levels of stress and anxiety., Writing down your emotions provides an emotional outlet, as well as a way to cognitively process the circumstances behind how you are feeling. This adds an additional component of clarity to aid in decreasing emotional pain.In fact, studies have shown that writing offers benefits of emotional well-being, including relief of emotional distress.Additionally, journaling has been shown to benefit the immune system.If you are dealing with emotional pain that you do not feel comfortable sharing, writing or journaling about your experiences offers you an outlet without the added stress of being vulnerable with a friend or family member who may not understand., Creative expression has a long history and connection to emotion within many different cultures where music, dance, and stories have been used to express emotions to promote healing.Whether as an appreciator or creator, try turning to your favorite hobby to help channel your negative or painful emotions into something creative.


For example, research has shown that music is linked to decreased anxiety by decreasing neural activity in the amygdala, which produces a calming effect.Additionally, music was shown to produce feelings of greater control over one’s life, as well as decreased pain in persons with chronic illness.Visual arts—such as drawing, painting, making collages or cards, or textile work—have been shown to offer an opportunity to make meaning of emotional pain, as well as increase feelings of self-worth.Movement-based expression—such as dancing or acting—has been shown to increase self-awareness and improve body image, problem solving capacity, and self-esteem., Numerous studies have shown the benefits of having a close support system of family and friends to whom you can turn.Social support leads to a sense of belonging and security rather than loneliness while dealing with emotional pain, and it’s also been linked to an increased sense of self-worth.Try calling a trusted friend or sitting down with a family member to vent your hurt and frustrated emotions.

, Times of emotional turmoil are also a great time to treat yourself to something special. This can be anything in which you take enjoyment. You can get a massage, go to an amusement park, buy some new shoes, prepare your favorite dessert, go see a movie, or anything else you love doing. Take some time for yourself and treat yourself.


Remember to do so responsibly. You don’t want to spend too much on a reward for yourself and lead to more emotional negativity later for budgeting poorly.

, Laughter does everything from aiding muscle relaxation to helping alleviate your body’s stress response.Laughter has also been shown to help elevate your mood in moments of anxiety or depression.Take some time to laugh by remembering a funny situation, calling your funniest friend, or simply finding a funny video to watch on the internet. Take advantage of whatever is at your disposal in the moment to take a break and laugh.

, A five-minute walk or a chance to get up and stretch can help you release painful emotional energy. Even if you’re not a big yoga practitioner, even basic stretching can help promote positive emotions. Stretching practices have been shown to help with releasing negative energy related to stress, anxiety, depression, and more., While drugs and alcohol may temporarily have a calming affect when you feel stressed or painful emotions, experts agree that the short-term release is not even remotely worth the associated risks. Exposure to stress and other traumatic emotions is one of the leading risk factors in the development of substance abuse problems.While all of the other steps in this wikiHow provide tools to help you overcome negative feelings, drugs and alcohol simply create a vicious cycle of dependence on the substance to feel better, which can quickly lead to addiction.Consult with a professional substance abuse counselor if you find yourself consistently turning to drugs and/or alcohol as a release from your painful emotions.

Seek help.",How to Look and Act Happy when You Don't Feel It," An easy way to look and act happy is smiling. But did you know that smiling can actually boost your mood? Smiling can induce feelings of happiness just as happiness can cause a smile.Try smiling with your whole face, not just your lips. Feel your cheeks and eyes change when engaging a large smile. This kind of smile is associated with positive emotions.If you’re feeling upset or grumpy, combat those feelings with a smile. Try to connect with the sensations of smiling and begin to feel happiness.;
, Getting through an uncomfortable situation while looking or feeling unfazed is a skill, and much can be attributed to confidence. If you have a presentation and feel fearful, tap into your innate confidence, even if public speaking is enough to make you run and hide. Tell yourself you can do it. Chances are, if you exude confidence (even if it’s forced or unnatural at first), people will believe you are competent.Speak loudly and clearly, and act as if you are fully confident in your abilities.
The opposite is true, too. If you go into a presentation feeling fearful, lots of things can give away your fear, such as shaky voice, lack of eye contact, acting flustered, etc.

, If you’re closed off, looking down, or crossing your arms/legs, people may assume you are unapproachable. People with proper posture report higher levels of positive mood and self-esteem than slouchers.Changing your body language can help your mind believe that your are confident.


Practice puffing your shoulders out (as a way to appear/feel bigger) or putting your hands on your hips.
Practice doing triumphant poses, such as pumping your first in the air before a nerve-racking situation., Relaxation can help calm any anxiety you may be feeling, and can help you feel more at ease. If you are feeling tense, restless, or unhappy, try some relaxation techniques to help you feel more balanced. This can be especially helpful before a big presentation or something that makes you feel anxious.Slow your breathing and start counting your breaths, 4 seconds inhale, then 4 seconds exhale. Once this feels easy, extend to 6 second intervals, observing your breath moving in and out of your body.
Use muscle relaxation to soften tense muscles. You can do progressive muscle relaxation, which focuses on different parts of your body at a time, releasing any tension you feel. Start with your toes, then work on muscle groups through your legs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, and neck., Some situations you have to get through and act natural, even if you feel unnatural. Think about how the way you look will affect your future. If you are meeting your long-term partner’s parents for the first time and are not feeling well, it’s a good opportunity to use some perspective and make a likeable impression. Yet, realize that not every situation is important to look or act your best. Recognize when you have the choice to leave a situation or whether you must go through with something due to circumstance.If you’ve just broken your leg, you don’t need to pretend to be happy. You are in pain! The same is true if you’ve experienced a difficult situation, like the loss of a sibling or grandparent. It’s okay to feel sad.

, Changing your attitude can be especially important before an unpleasant event. Take a moment and find new ways to re-think negative thoughts, and try to find some positive aspects to reflect upon. You may be stuck in a negative thought cycle and need an overhaul to help you feel more positively. Reflect on what kind of attitude you are bringing into a situation and whether it is in your best interest.Changing your attitude can help you feel happy long enough to get through a difficult situation.


If you have to go to an event you’re not looking forward to, adjust your attitude. Remember that these events don’t happen frequently, and you can get through it, even if you anticipate it being unpleasant. You may meet someone interesting, enjoy some good food, or be pleasantly surprised by what you learn.
Acknowledge the potential positives that can come from the event, and give less precedence to the potential negatives.
For more information check out How to Change a Negative Attitude.

, If you’re struggling to look or feel happy, chances are you may be experiencing negative thoughts. Self talk helps you to shift the focus from your negative or unhelpful thoughts onto calming yourself so you can feel more at ease.This can help you get through an unpleasant situation more easily and help you appear happier, even if you feel miserable. Some examples of self-talk:


""I may not feel well, but I can still do a good job”
”This is an uncomfortable situation right now, but I know I can head home immediately afterwards to deal with it”
""I am here to enjoy myself""

, If you’re struggling to even pretend to be happy, find things to be grateful for in your life. Grateful people report higher levels of health and happiness, such as better sleep, increased empathy, and improved self-esteem.Find things to look forward to and be thankful for the small stuff: a roof over your head, a nice day, a good friend, anything! You may even begin to feel happier, not just act happier.


List 5 things that bring you joy or fulfillment in your life. It can be as simple as waking up to no dishes in the sink. Then, think of a situation that made you feel upset or frustrated, and describe it in writing. Afterwards, think of three things that help you appreciate the difficult situation. Perhaps you ran late for work because you had to fill up your gas tank, but got the opportunity to buy your favorite coffee. Or, your workplace is understanding about being late occasionally. Reflect whether or not you will remember this even in a week, or two, or five., Strengthen your friendships and work on your social skills. Don't isolate yourself in a time of need, reach out! Talk to people everyday, and get some human contact to make you feel better. Even if it takes some forcing, make yourself socialize with the people you care about, and remember that they care about you, too.Acting happy can be a lot easier when surrounded by friends.


If you tend to isolate, realize that this can lead to or contribute to feelings of depression. Social contact is an important part of life.Especially if you are struggling with a situation, make sure you have people you can lean on and talk to when you get the chance.

, If you find yourself always trying to look and act happy when you don’t feel happy, seek out professional help. There’s no use trying to look and act happy when you don’t feel a source of happiness within you.


If you feel chronically unhappy, you may suffer from depression. For more information, see How to Know if You Have Depression and How to Deal with Depression.

Recognize the symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder.,
Seek professional treatment.,
Try light therapy.,
Get more sunlight.,
Brighten up your spaces.,
Enjoy winter.,
Get exercise.,
Consider natural remedies.,
Vacation in a sunny place.",How to Overcome Sadness5," Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression caused by a biochemical imbalance due to changing seasons. In some locations, usually ones further from the equator, there is less sunlight during the fall and winter months. This can change your body’s chemistry and cause symptoms that are very similar to clinical depression.These symptoms include:Low energy or fatigue
Difficulty concentrating
Increased appetite
Wanting to be isolated or alone
Disrupted sleep patterns, excessive sleepiness
SAD usually begins between 18 and 30 years of age.
You may experience increased carbohydrate cravings if you are suffering from SAD. This could lead to weight gain.

, The treatment for SAD is very similar to treatment for clinical depression. Anti-depressant medications and professional therapy are usually enough to treat SAD., Light therapy can help regulate your body’s internal clock. You can find light therapy devices at many retailers and online. The light therapy lamp should be 10,000 Lux. (Lux refers to how intense the light is.)Check with the manufacturer to be sure that your light therapy lamp is designed to treat SAD. Some light boxes used to treat skin disorders emit more ultraviolet light and could cause damage to your eyes.Light therapy is generally safe. However, if you have bipolar affective disorder you should consult with your doctor before starting light therapy.
Light therapy may also cause complications for individuals who have lupus, skin cancer, or some eye conditions., Exposure to natural sunlight may help elevate your mood.Open your curtains and blinds. Spend time outdoors when possible.

, Painting your walls with lighter colors can help reflect the natural light.Fun, bright décor may also help elevate your mood.

, When you can, try to emphasize the enjoyable aspects of winter. Try curling up in front of a fire if you have a fireplace. Roast some marshmallows. Drink some hot cocoa (in moderation, of course)., Just as with clinical depression, you can relieve the symptoms of SAD with exercise.If you live in a wintry climate, try participating in winter sports such as skiing or snowshoeing.

, Always consult with your doctor before taking any natural remedies. Some remedies may interfere with medication or cause complications to existing medical conditions.Try melatonin to help regulate your sleep. Melatonin supplements may help you regulate your sleep cycles if they’ve been disturbed by SAD.
Try St.John’s wort. There is some evidence that St. John’s wort may help alleviate mild depressive symptoms.St. John’s wort may limit the effectiveness of prescription medications, including birth control pills, heart medications, and cancer medications.St. John's wort cannot be taken with SSRIs, tricyclics, or other types of antidepressant medications. This may cause serotonin syndrome.Do not take St. John’s wort without first talking with your doctor.

, If you live in a location that gets very little natural sunlight during the winter, consider taking a vacation to a sunny place. Locations such as the Caribbean and American Southwest often have bright sunshine even during the winter."

Distract your thinking if you ruminate.,
Work on reframing your experiences.,
Look for patterns in what negatively affects you.,
Work on your physical health.,
Donate time to a cause about which you’re passionate.,
Remind yourself to maintain perspective.,
Consider consulting a counselor or therapist.",How to Make Yourself Feel Better2," Rumination is the process of replaying painful or disappointing events in your head in a cycle that makes it difficult to counteract. Rumination cycles are often unproductive and negative in that they do not help to solve problems or move forward.Rumination takes your focus off problem solving. Consciously distracting your thinking to stop the cycle of rumination is one of the most common methods of avoiding it.


Research has also shown that those who ruminate and talk about their situations over and over often drive away friends and family who could have acted as a social support.Mindfulness is the most common way of distracting yourself from ruminating. It involves turning your attention to your immediate surroundings, the sounds around you, or the sensations in your body., Negative experiences can often become echo chambers of feelings of fault or guilt. Reframing your experiences means looking at them from a different light.By reframing your thoughts, you can strengthen your senses of problem solving and confidence.For instance, to reframe a poor mood after a hurtful situation, you can think about what you have learned about yourself and your relationship.
As another example, if you are dealing with the uncomfortableness of embarrassment, you can try to find the humor in the situation and learn to laugh at yourself to feel better and move on.

, If you begin journaling or talking to trusted friends and loved ones regarding what’s affecting you, then look for patterns. Are you consistently writing or talking about the same issues? If so, what can you do to make changes at the root of the problem rather than simply venting the emotional impact of it on a regular basis?This can also mean taking a stark look at your relationships to determine if a toxic relationship consistently brings you down. Toxic interpersonal relationships can be the chronic source of anxiety, depression, stress, and other negative emotions.If the consistent source is related to your job, then what changes can you make to your work environment? If you can’t change your work environment to suit your mental well-being, then it may be time to consider a job change.

, Taking regular steps to improve and maintain your physical health also leads to an increased sense of mental well-being. Not only does exercise release endorphins to improve your mood, but it also gives you achievable goals to work toward with regard to your fitness. Joining a gym or a fitness group through another organization—such as your church or at work—also expands your support system., Feeling good about your contributions can go a long way to help with your self-worth and self-esteem. Try volunteering at a shelter, helping with a food drive, or finding another cause about which you’re passionate to donate some of your time., One of the harder and more important aspects of maintaining emotional well-being is to remember that difficult situations that lead to emotional turmoil are a normal part of life, that we learn and grow through these experiences, and that surmounting trouble can be a source of pride. Remember that you can overcome the source of your emotional distress and that how you deal with those emotions and move on without letting them interfere with your daily functioning is the important part., If despite your best efforts to feel better about your experiences you still feel overwhelmed by stress, anxiety, frustration, or depression, then consider making an appointment with a counselor or a therapist. A professional can help you increase your inventory of tools to deal with the situations affecting you. A professional can also recommend medications, support groups, or other resources that you might not otherwise be able to tap into.

A loved one’s absence shifts life into a different gear. For the person left to manage life when the other person is gone, it is essential to focus on successfully getting through each day!;
, Time is a precious commodity. You now have the time to reach out to those people you care about, but don't share quality time together as often as you would like. This includes your partner or spouse and friends and family living outside your home.


If you’ve been tied up with raising your children and they are away at college, you now have the time to do the things you have been postponing. , Prepare care packages and send them to the person. Each item you shop for will allow you the opportunity to focus on the person, do something for her, and then send all that love to her. If you have children, set aside a night of the week that you and your children can make arts and crafts that can be included in the care package.

, Staying busy around the house provides a healthy distraction and will improve your living environment. Focusing on tasks and completing them will make time pass quickly. Some days might be tougher than others, but there's always something you can do around the house.

Improve the curb appeal of your house. Planting a few colorful plants in your walkway or placing a beautiful potted plant on your porch will brighten the situation.

, There are projects that take more time and effort to complete. If you've got a lot of time to fill, consider a project that will purposely not end until after the person returns. This will give you and the person something to look forward to and will give you accountability to live up to your promise.


If your spouse is deployed, tell her that you plan to complete a project like building a wood deck in the backyard.
If you have children, join together on a project that will help all of you get through the time of absence.
Start the garden you have always wanted.
Raise funds for a cause that benefits the military or a cause that is important to your spouse. Reporting your progress to your spouse will help her feel like she is missed, but also that she is still loved and needed at home.

, Communicate via skype, email, or letters and cards. This is beneficial because you look forward to communicating. When you are writing to her you feel closer to her, and receiving a reply is exciting too. The positive feelings are spaced out over time, which helps manage the time you spend away from her.

Accept your decisions.,
Decide to let your past go.,
Think about what you have learned.,
Forgive yourself.,
Forgive other people.,
Stay away from toxic relationships.,
Seek a professional counselor.",How to Not Dwell on the Past1," There are many sources of pain in life. You may have made a mistake, regret a decision, failed to take an opportunity, hurt someone, or were hurt by someone. Instead of reliving your past over and over in your head, get it out.Express yourself by writing in a journal, talking to a trusted friend or family member, or talking to a professional counselor.
If your hurt involves another person, you can talk to the person about how you feel or write the person a letter. If you do not want to talk to the person, you can write a letter to the person, but never send the letter to the person.
Expressing your feelings about your past can also help you understand how you really feel about the situation.;
, Anytime you make a decision, you say yes to one opportunity and say no to other possibilities. It can be easy to sit and wonder ""what if,"" but that only leads to frustration. Running scenarios in your mind will not change what has already happened. Instead of thinking about what may or may not have happened if you made different choices, focus on the present and what you can do now.Accept that your past has happened and you may or may not be proud of what happened. However, it is now part of your story.
Tell yourself, ""I made that decision in my past. It made sense to me at the time. Looking back, it may have been better to ____. However, I could not predict the outcome, but this will help me in the future if I deal with a similar situation."", Once you have expressed your hurt, make a conscious decision to let it go. Although you cannot change your past, you can choose to not dwell on it and take the steps to move on. When you choose to let it go, you are being proactive about moving on instead of being a victim to your past.Tell yourself, ""I accept myself and my past. I am choosing to move on from this."" or ""I will not be defined by my past. I am choosing to move forward.""
This decision is an everyday choice that you are making. You may need to talk to yourself about moving on every morning until you actually get over your past., Your past is a learning opportunity for you. Your experience may have taught you abut yourself, other people, or life in general. Sit and think about both the positive and negative things that you have learned, but focus more on the positive lessons.

It's okay if you have a hard time thinking of something positive that you learned.
It may help to make a list of the positive lessons and negative lessons.
For example, a failed romantic relationship may have shown you traits (e.g. more patient, more affectionate, etc.) that you desire in your next partner.

, Everyone makes mistakes and has regrets. Your past is your past. It is not something that is currently happening or is guaranteed to happen in the future. You are more than your past. It does not define you.Forgive yourself and allow yourself to move forward with your life.


Write yourself a letter that details what happened, what you may have done differently, what influenced your choices at the time, and how you feel about yourself. Conclude the letter by writing about forgiving yourself and appreciating the person that you are now.
Tell yourself, ""I forgive myself,"" ""I love myself,"" and ""I accept myself.""

, You may have been hurt by another person in your past and continue to relive that painful situation in your mind. You cannot change how that person treated you, but you can choose to forgive. Forgiveness is accepting what happened to you and deciding to let go of the anger and pain so that you can move on. Forgiveness is about you, not the person that has hurt you.Examine what role you played in the situation, if any. Practice empathy and consider the other person's perspective and motivation for their actions. This may help you better understand the situation.
You can only control yourself and your emotions. Make a choice to forgive the person. You can have a conversation with the person, you can write the person a letter, or you can write a letter and never give it to the person.
Forgiveness is a process that does not happen overnight.

, There may be toxic people in your life that hinder your ability to grow and move forward. A person may be toxic if you dread being around them, feel bad or ashamed when you are around them, you feel drained or upset after interacting with them, are negatively affected by their personal drama, or are constantly trying to help them or fix them. It is important that you either manage or remove these relationships from your life.If you keep a toxic person in your life, set boundaries that protect you from the person's behavior.
Tell the person how you feel about their behavior by saying, ""When you ___, I feel ____. I need ____. I am sharing my feelings with you because _____.""

, If you need help dealing with your past, a professional counselor or therapist can help you work through your feelings. A professional is trained to listen, help you work through your problems, and give you tools to have a more positive life. Find a therapist that is credentialed, makes you feel comfortable, and has experience treating the problems that you have.If you have health insurance, contact your health insurance provider for a list of mental health professionals. You can also ask for a recommendation from your primary care health provider.
If you do not have health insurance, you can visit the Partnership for Prescription Awareness Assistance to find a free or low-cost clinic near you."

Start.",How to Live Unhappily," You will quickly cease to live unhappily or otherwise, if you don't drink water or water-based fluids for four or five days. You would get groggy, faint, and, possibly, not wake up. If you desire to be unhappy/alive, stick to plain, drinking quality, water. If you are living unhappily but not coping well with it, try to become a little happier by drinking liquids you enjoy.


A cup of tea in a proper China tea cup, a cold glass of sparkling lemonade, something slightly quirky like freshly squeezed orange juice in a glass cup and saucer, any of these, or something else, can be a little treat to yourself to help you feel a little better, a little reward for facing another day with a little change.
An alcohol addiction may assist you to live unhappily on purpose, while tackling the addiction might make you happier, in the long run. A little alcohol might help you relax and is a diuretic.;
, You will cease to live if you don't eat. Starvation will stop your living but will take more time than you might think. Eating a poor diet is likely to shorten your life and may well cause health problems making you more unhappy.


Eat whatever you like, or dislike, to live unhappily. Try to eat a balanced diet with all the usual nutritious elements, if you want to cope better with living unhappily.
Deny yourself treats to be unhappy, treat yourself in moderation if you're not doing so well living unhappily. Healthy eating is happy eating and preparing yourself, or better yet your family, a healthy, delicious meal can be very rewarding. Set the table, use your best china, light some candles, make it an event.

, If you have no friends or family, you will live unhappily. People lose friends through death, through their moving away, by simply losing touch with one another, through arguments and disagreement, all sorts of reasons.


Sadly, families become disconnected from one another for many of these same reasons. If you are lonely and isolated, you are living unhappily, try to get connected even though you are sad. Should you wish to try to tackle this, reach out.
Contact those you have lost touch with, you have nothing to lose. Write a letter, make that phone call, reach out. Join any community groups that are open to you, try your local place of worship, or a Sunday Assembly (these groups meet on Sundays to hear lectures and sing songs with no religion involved whatsoever).
Try becoming a regular at your local shop, go to the library, work outside in your garden when your neighbour is doing the same and get chatting. It's easy to be trite about tackling loneliness, especially in the elderly or those who are geographically isolated but it's important to remember you have to help yourself first, however hard it seems.
Virtual communities, such as wikiHow, can help you have human interaction, but remember, as in the real world, not everyone in internet communities is always helpful and supportive; so if you are a vulnerable individual, on line communities may not be for you.

, Get outside if you can and you want to live unhappily more easily. Fresh air and sunlight have health benefits, both physical and mental. You don't have to walk far, it doesn't have to be in beautiful mountains or by stunning architectural delights.


A walk around the block or down your road and back is a start. Go to your local park or a nature reserve, if you can. Stroll if you like, take in your surroundings. Observe the change of seasons or just what's happenin' in your 'hood.
If you wish to remain living unhappily, stay indoors, pull the curtains, and don't go out unless you don't want to.

, Try to maintain reasonable levels of personal hygiene at least, and consequently get more out of being unhappy. If you want to make it easier for yourself to live unhappily, try enough bathing and/or showering that you may see these things as a bothersome chore.


It's easy to think, 'what's the point' in making yourself look good if no one notices or no one will see you. You can look good, and smell good, just for yourself too. If you can, treat yourself to some luxury including personal care products. Take your time using them, have some 'you' time. But if you wish to continue living unhappily, you can stink and not bother cleaning your teeth.

, You may be living unhappily because you don't like your home, or don't like where your home is. You may not like who you live with, or how far away you live from loved ones.


These issues are hard to tackle, if you're not in a position to move house. Try to only worry about what you can change. Clean up or tidy up if the state of your room or home is getting you down. Redecorating may give you a boost if it's possible. Just displaying some photos or artwork that have positive associations for you might help. If you want to continue living unhappily, quit cleaning up and redecorate in black or grey.

, You might struggle to see the point in flinging on anything other than a tee shirt and sweat pants, if you are living unhappily.


Make more effort if you can. If you are convinced no one will see you, wear whatever you like, something totally over the top or unseasonably ridiculous, why not? Wear a ball gown or a tuxedo to water your house plants if you like. If you live with or around others, wear things that you enjoy wearing but won't be ridiculed for. Exactly what is entirely up to you. If you enjoy living unhappily, try hair shirts and starched underpants.

, If you are in debt and it is making you unhappy, get some advice. Burying your head in the sand when it comes to debt is unhelpful.


Tell those you owe you are in financial difficulties, responsible organizations are often prepared to assist when you are in genuine financial hardship. They may be prepared to take small, regular payments instead of a large, hard to come by one-off payment.
Get some help with budgeting. Citizens Advice Bureaus, Debt Counselling Services and other similar organizations can help.

, Forgive and forget. Living unhappily due to arguments or disagreements is not productive. Bury the hatchet.


Use your energy for positive things, not negative hatred or resentment. In the long run, it's often easy to give up an argument, even if you are the one in the right. Ending a conflict with you as the ""loser"" on purpose is not worse than continuing it with both parties angry, both losers.
Be the bigger person to tackle living unhappily. Do something desirable that you don't really want to do today, and go where you don't want to be, like work or do a good deed. Unhappiness can take you farther than you want to go -- so try taking control of your purpose and set a course for somewhere worthwhile.

, And, if you get up in the morning and face the day and don't hurt anyone or anything else, don't commit any crimes, don't do anything immoral and don't take or use anything you're not entitled to: You are being a good person.


You may, unhappily, believe you're not contributing to society because you don't have a job, or don't do volunteer work, or don't get good grades, or don't have children or there are many other reasons why you may be living unhappily and not feeling like you put much into life. As long a you're not dealing drugs, vandalizing property, defrauding the government, abusing your children, bullying your classmates or doing any other criminal or anti social activities, you deserve a pat on the back and credit for not being a scum bag.

, You can do something about that, if you see it as an opportunity. Being unhappy while bored is natural. You could try to put something old in a new place or vice versa and have a reason to keep on.

, Act like things matter until they do, and expect to create something that you want... Fungus won't grow on a rolling-stone/in a rapids, a tumultuous living stream. Action begets action. Do your good plan, if not now -- when?

, It's not always obvious what will make us happy. Take a minute to examine what it is that you want out of life. Some people find meaning in the joys and challenges of teaching, others thrive on the competition and creativity of the business world. Before making a big decision, ask yourself: ""Will this action or course cause me to feel regret? Is it in line with my values?""Your values have a lot in common with your highest priorities. Look at your daily life to help you answer this question. Where do you spend your time and money? Family? Education? Art?

, Constructive communication can help if you have trouble maintaining a relationship with a close friend, lover, or family member. Follow these steps in order to repair that connection:This kind of communication consists of:


Be proactive about repetitive disagreements. Recognize signs and triggers of a fight about to happen. Pause and re-orient yourself to being more aware of those old patterns of behavior. This will help you change your response and act more intentionally.
Express yourself in a more compassionate, less confrontational way. Use ""I"" language rather than ""you"" language, such as ""I'm upset by what you said,"" rather than, ""You're being rude to me.""
Find ways to deal with your own emotions, such as practicing mindful breathing when you start to feel angry. You can do this by paying close attention to the sensation of your breath going in and out of your nostrils., It's not always easy to reach our highest aspirations in life. Use the technique of goal-setting to help you take things one step at a time. Here are some tips for how to set realistic and achievable goals:Set goals that can be measured. This will help you feel accomplished and keep your motivation up when you see progress.
Set goals that are challenging but also realistic. Try to find a balance with goals that are challenging but not impossible. If they're too easy then you might get bored, and you won't grow as much. If they're too difficult then you may become frustrated and give up.
Keep your goals flexible. It's good to have a routine, but if your goals are too rigid, failing to meet them can be discouraging. Know that it's okay to go back and revise your goals. Also, missing a goal now and then is better than burning yourself out.

, Self-expression and creativity are integral to living a good life with no regrets.This can show up in many different ways, from more traditional avenues, such as performing as a musician or artist, to less conventional paths, like being a social worker or computer programmer. Creative expression is not limited to the arts, but appears anywhere someone has discovered their passion. Here are some steps you can take:Experience things fully.

Let your own self emerge. Be cautious about external cues from people and the larger culture for what you should feel, think, and do.
Be honest. Being honest with yourself and others will give your innermost self an opportunity to grow.

, It may seem like having more choices is always better than having fewer choices, but research shows that this is not actually the case.Having fewer choices means that once you make a decision, you don't worry as much about the path you neglected to take. On the other hand, if the decision is reversible and only one among many, there’s a higher potential that you will reflect needlessly on your decision, taking energy away from other pursuits.


For example, if you're looking at colleges to attend after high school, narrow your choices to a handful rather than applying to twenty different locations.

, Research shows that people are likely to regret buying things, whereas they're likely to regret not buying or pursuing experiences.Psychology shows that materialism, or the pursuit of ""things,"" is not the key to happiness.Experiences create lasting memories, while ""things"" deteriorate and lose their shiny new appeal.For example, spend your money on a family vacation or a trip to Europe rather than a slightly bigger TV.

, Feeling resentment and anger toward yourself for mistakes you've made in the past interferes with your life, and it can even contribute to health problems such as heart disease.Forgive yourself for the right things.

Research shows that many people rate regret as being more useful than other negative emotions in areas such as: avoiding future negative behaviors, gaining insight into yourself, and achieving harmony with the people in your life.

, If you've hurt someone that you care about and you have difficulty overcoming that guilt, do your best to make amends with the person. You can do this by:Demonstrating that you feel bad about your actions. The first step is to show that you feel empathy toward how the person feels.
Accepting responsibility for your actions. Don't blame anyone else; take responsibility for your behavior.
Showing that you are willing to make it up. Promise to try to act differently in the future, and take steps to make it right.
Even if the person isn't receptive, you made the effort, and for that you can be proud.

, There are things you simply can't control in life, no matter how much you want to or how hard you try. Life will always have an additional curveball to throw or an additional ace up its sleeve. The best way to deal with this predicament is to embrace it and throw yourself into the fray, loving every moment and knowing that you are living intentionally, even when you experience pain or make bad choices., If you are still feeling pain over something you did years ago, take that as a sign that something needs to be done in order for you to move on.

Let yourself cry, be angry, be confused, and express the emotions you have bottled up inside.


Each person experiences emotions differently.You may not cry a lot, but you might like to write about your feelings. Everyone is different.
Excuse yourself from the social scene for a while, or confide in close friends or family members. Some people are more private with their feelings, and that’s perfectly acceptable.
Writing down your thoughts can help pinpoint the feelings that are causing you pain.
Don’t be embarrassed about being upset, even if other people think your relationship was not serious. No one can truly know the pain you’re going through because it is your experience.

, Most people are taught how to acquire things, but very few people are taught how to lose something. This leaves most people ill-equipped to deal with the various forms of loss that life hands out. Whether the loss is a relationship, a loved one, a job, a physical ability, or trust in someone, the damage created must be understood and managed. Grief is a complex emotion that manifests in different ways for everyone.


Feeling stuck in the state of missing a person is worsened by unresolved grief.
There are stages to the grieving process that can be used as a guide to understand your own unique experience with grief: denial, numbness and shock; bargaining; depression; anger; acceptance.Grief is an individual journey. Everyone experiences it differently.You may spend more time in one stage versus another.
Don’t rush yourself and don’t allow others to rush you through your grief. There is a time to grieve and it is essential to a healthy healing process.

, It may be too emotionally difficult to see items that remind you of the person. Place the personal items that were left behind in a box and give them back to the person, throw them away or store them out of reach. Do the same with the items you have accumulated. It will make missing the person much easier when you don’t see the items on a daily basis.


If you find that something is so special to you that you absolutely can’t part with it, then put it in storage for a while.
If you feel too much pain doing this alone, ask a friend to help you. You will feel more confident about moving on without your ex.
Think about it: how are you ever supposed to stop missing your ex if there’s a big photo of him or her right by your bedside?

, If you are certain your relationship is over yet you still talk to your ex or see him on occasion, this will make it much harder to stop missing him. If you can completely avoid seeing your ex, then you should do so. Staying in contact puts you through an emotional tug-of-war that will not help you.


Do not call or text your ex just to see how things are going. It will only make you feel worse.
If you are forced to see him at school, work or elsewhere simply acknowledge him by saying, “Hello,” and spend as little time as possible in his presence. Your emotions will likely heighten after seeing him, which may cause you to miss him. This is temporary so stay strong and work through it.
Disconnect from him on all social media channels. If you continue to look up pictures of him, your mind will wander toward remembering and missing how things were between you.

, There is a purpose to the ceremonies we follow when something ends. Graduations, funerals, closing ceremonies – they all provide an end point. They allow us to reach a sense of closure. Creating a good-bye ceremony will help complete your relationship with the pain and allow you to lessen the feelings of missing the person.


Write a letter to the person, but do not send it. Include all the significant emotional experiences you shared. Thank him for the good times, and the bad. Express the anger. Tell him, ""I no longer need the pain that I am feeling about missing you so I am giving it back to you. Good-bye."", When you feel ready you can consider dating new people. You may think that immediately dating someone new will ease your pain; but it will likely make you feel worse about losing the person. The chances are minimal that you will find “the one” a week after the break-up of a serious relationship.


Being with a new person may remind you of all the qualities you loved about your ex, and it will make you miss him even more.
Dating a new person when you’re not ready will not fill the void you are feeling.
Spend time with friends who can help you feel good about yourself.

, Stop doing some of the things you did together, or the things that remind you of your ex. Avoid the restaurant where you went on your first date or your favorite spot in your local park. Get your coffee or bagels from a different bakery for a few weeks and see if it makes you feel better in the mornings. Don’t stop doing what you used to do completely, but do new things so you’re less likely to miss your ex.


It can be empowering to do something you’ve always wanted to do, but your ex never liked such as, hiking or learning to make pasta from scratch. Find ways to define yourself without your ex, and you’ll find that you’ll be missing him less in no time.
If your ex is in your social circle, you can avoid the parties he is likely to attend for a while. Find a way to make your own fun.

, If you spend time with close friends, then you will appreciate all of the love and support you receive. You always have someone to turn to who will anchor you during a struggle.


If you feel up to it, see at least a few friends per week so you’re more likely to keep your mind off of your ex.
Your friends won’t say anything that will magically make your pain go away, but having them by your side can make a big difference.

, When you were with your ex, you might not have had time to work on improving as a person. Take advantage of the time to work on being healthy, happy, and accomplished. Set a goal to train for a marathon, complete a novel, be less obsessive, or do what you’ve always wanted to do to improve yourself.


Address those qualities you would like to improve. Perhaps there are things that stand in your way from being happy. Perhaps you worry too much, or could benefit from being more assertive.

, Throw yourself into doing positive and meaningful work. You’ll be much less likely to miss him if you have a career that makes you excited to get up in the morning.

Allow yourself to grieve.,
Honor the person’s memory.,
Talk to other people who miss him.,
Know that your relationship has not ended, but it has changed.,
Spend more time with your friends and family.,
Consider therapy.,
Write down your thoughts.,
Find a soothing routine.",How to Not Miss Someone3," If you’re dealing with the loss of someone you love, then you should give yourself the time you need to grieve and come to terms with your feelings. You won’t be able to stop missing the person if you don’t give yourself the time to slow down, express your emotions, and grieve the loss of the person who is gone.Every person’s grieving process is different as noted in the above section. If you need to be alone for a while, make sure your friends and family members understand by telling them, “I am grieving and it is a struggle, but I am working through it. I hope you understand that it is going to take some time, and I’m not sure how long. I guess I am the only one who can figure that out.”
If you spend too much time by yourself and are feeling lonely as a result, make sure to spend some time with others.
Write in a journal,talk about your feelings aloud, go through old photos of the person you lost, or just cry. If you don’t cry, don’t feel guilty about it. Everyone has a different way of expressing sadness.

, This is a healthy way to move forward and to remember the person who is gone, and continues their legacy. This can mean talking about the person with your friends or family members, sticking to some of the traditions the person used to love, whether it was volunteering in your community or reading to your children, or even listening to the music the person liked.


If doing the things the person used to love increases your sadness and longing, then change your routine. However, once you feel yourself beginning to move forward, return to doing some of the things the person loved. The experience might bring you closer to the positive memories of the person without missing them too much.
Remember that you’re not trying to forget the person or never think of him again. You want to work on remembering the person in a positive light, feel the feelings and then put everything in perspective.

, It would be unhealthy to never mention the person again or get rid of anything that reminds you of him. However, you can do this temporarily if it hurts too much, but in the long run you will be more comfortable talking about the person. You may find that laughing about the funny things the person said or did makes you feel less sadness and improves healing.Recreating fond memories of the person can make you feel more at peace with the fact that the person is gone. Though you can’t bring the person back, talking about the memories can help the healing process.

, Relationships are comprised of two components: the physical and the emotional. While your physical relationship with the person has ended, the emotional relationship continues. You will never have to stop thinking about that person completely.


You are not betraying the person by trying not to miss him. If the person loved you, then he would be happy you are trying to move forward.
It will be impossible to not miss the person completely, especially on anniversaries, holidays, or other important moments that you shared together. Rather than ignore the feelings of loss say to yourself or to others, “Today, I miss ____. He would have loved this event. Let’s raise our glasses and toast to ____. We love you.” This will acknowledge your loved one’s impact and also allow a moment of honor that will help the healing continue.
It is healthy to miss the person sometimes, but it’s also healthy to want to enjoy the present instead of longing for the past.

, Your friends and family will be there to support you and lift you up during this difficult time. They may be grieving, too, and you can lean on each other and spend more time feeling loved, cared for, and simply occupied. You need love and affection during this time and spending it with the people you love will help you miss the person less.New friends or other family members can never replace the person in your heart and make you forget the person.
If you find that some of your friends or family members seem to be “getting over” the loss more quickly, don’t be frustrated. Everyone grieves on their own time table. You may not know how the person is really feeling.

, If you want help with moving forward, then seek professional help. If you’re not sure if therapy is for you, give it a try before you decide. Talking to a trained professional about your situation can give you new insight. It takes courage and strength to seek help and work through life’s struggles. Be proud of yourself for seeking the help you need to be healthy. You shouldn’t feel ashamed or weak about wanting to engage in therapy.

, Instead of having it weigh on you during all parts of the day, it can help to process feelings on the pages of a journal. Write in it every morning or evening to check in with yourself and to decompress. Also, you can write in it when a thought enters your mind. Find what works for you.


Write a letter to the person, but do not send it. Include all the significant emotional experiences you shared. Thank him for the good times and the bad. Express the anger. Tell him, ""I no longer need the pain that I am feeling so I am giving it back to you. Good-bye.""Read the letter out loud to yourself or to a trusted friend or family member, then burn the letter in a safe place. Fire is a form of cleansing and can allow the energy of your turmoil to change.

, When you’ve lost someone, you may be so focused on the loss and on the person who is gone you forget to take care of yourself. In order to miss the person less, make sure that you’re in a daily routine that helps you feel better. This means getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night,eating three meals a day even if you don’t feel hungry, and making time for at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.


You may not think that eating and sleeping regularly can make a difference when you’re in the throes of grief, but it definitely can. A healthier you is stronger and can manage a struggle more effectively.
Avoid things that tend to increase your stress levels. That could mean traffic jams, loud concerts, extra responsibilities at work, or spending time with a dramatic friend. Although you can’t get rid of all the stress you’re feeling, you can make an effort to minimize it.
Participate in 15 minutes of meditation or yoga each day.This can make you feel more in touch with your mind and body and more calm for the rest of the day.
Focus on your health. Up to one-third of people directly affected by the loss of a significant relationship will physically and emotionally suffer.While you may feel anxious, depressed and too exhausted to take action, you cannot ignore your needs.

Redirect your thoughts.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Set a time limit for your thoughts.,
Challenge your thoughts.",How to Not Dwell on the Past2," Memories of your past will come to your mind from time to time. The more you try to not think about the past, the more you will think about your past. Instead of trying to fight your thoughts, acknowledge and then redirect them.Plan out what you will say to yourself when you have the thought. If you start to think about the past, then you will do what?
If thoughts of your past come to your mind, say to yourself, ""It's okay. That was my past, but now I'm focused on _______."", Mindfulness will help you focus on the present and have more control over your thoughts. The ability to focus your mind on thoughts of your choice will help you stop dwelling on your past. Practice mindful exercises when you find yourself stuck on your past.Focusing on your breath is one of the most common mindfulness exercises. Notice all of the physical sensations as you breath in and out. How does the air feel moving in and out of your nostrils? Your lungs? Notice how your chest rises.
Commit to practicing mindfulness everyday. Consistent practice can help improve your mood and reduce the number of negative thoughts you have., If you are unable to stop thinking about your past, try to limit the time you spend on these thoughts. Pick a specific amount of time (e.g. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes) and time of day that you will allow yourself to think about your past. Choose a time of day when you are usually relaxed.For example, you may allow the thoughts from 5:00 pm -5:20 pm every evening.
If you have a thought outside of this time, tell yourself that this is not the time and you will deal with it later.

, When you dwell on your past, you may have an irrational or distorted view (e.g. ""everything is my fault,"" I'm a bad person,"" etc.) of what actually happened. You may begin to accept these thoughts as truth and reality. If you begin to challenge your thoughts when they come, you can develop a more objective view. Ask yourself questions such as:

Is there a more positive way I can look at my situation?
Is there evidence that my thought are true? Evidence that my thoughts are false?
What would I say to a friend in this situation?
Are these thoughts helpful?
Is dwelling on the past helping me or hurting me?
Instead of telling yourself, ""This is too hard, "" tell yourself, ""I can try to do this,"" or ""Let me attack this from a different angle."""
"
Distract yourself.,
Get some exercise.,
Remove triggers in your life.,
Make plans for the future.",How to Not Dwell on the Past3," When you are actively engaged in an activity you enjoy, your thought will not be focused on your past.Fill your life with activities and people that take your mind off of your past. Find a new hobby (e.g. arts, crafts, sports, reading, etc.), spend time with family and friends, read a book, or watch a movie. Do any activity that you enjoy and that makes you feel good about yourself.


Make enjoyable activities a regular part of your life.
Activities that require your complete attention (e.g. cooking a meal, doing a crossword puzzle) or force you to focus on something other than yourself (e.g. taking care of a pet, babysitting a child, etc.) are particularly helpful for shifting your focus.

, Exercise releases your endorphins (i.e. feel good hormones) and stimulates your nervous system. Try to exercise for 30 minutes or more each day. Exercise that engages both your arms and legs (e.g. walking, running, swimming, dancing, etc.) is best.Focus on your body and how it moves as you exercise.
Listen to music that you enjoy while you exercise.
Try working out with friends and make it a social activity.

, You may find that certain things cause you to dwell on your past. Listening to a certain type of music, visiting certain places, or watching certain types of movies, etc may cause you to think about your past. Changing some of these behaviors can help you move on.

For example, if sad or slow-tempo music causes you to think of your past, change the type of music that you listen to.
If you notice that you tend to dwell on your past before you go to bed, change your routine by reading or journaling before bed.
These changes may or may not be permanent. You may be able to do some of these things again once you stop thinking about your past so much.

, If you keep looking towards the future, you will not have time to focus on your past. Make a list of things that you are grateful for, that you are looking forward to doing, and things that you would like to do. Include things that are already planned and make new plans.Your future plans do not have to be extravagant. It could be as simple as going to dinner with a friend next week.
When you make plans for your future, write down everything you need to accomplish those goals.
Focus on your strengths and things that you like about yourself.

Recognize the underlying emotions below your regrets.,
Separate yourself from your mistakes.,
Look for a lesson.,
Accept you're imperfect.,
Acknowledge that you acted with a limited awareness.,
Recognize guilt is useful.,
Accept what you did wrong.,
Foster empathy.,
Find a way to make it right.,
See yourself in less black and white terms.,
Show yourself kindness.,
Embrace your strengths.",How to Accept Past Mistakes," If you're having trouble getting over a mistake, there may be a reason you can't let go. Spend some time trying to identify underlying emotions below regrettable behavior. In order to let go of the past, you need to be able to release certain emotions tying you to a mistake.What is it that you associate with this mistake? Do you feel like you missed out on something? Do you feel like you did wrong by a loved one? Can you identify a single emotion, or several emotions, tying you to your past?
For example, maybe you feel it was a mistake to turn down a job opportunity. You feel regret over what could have been. Try to deal with feelings of regret head on. Work on accepting that everyone has regrets, and they're a normal part of life. This will help you let go of a perceived mistake.;
, Often, we are unable to move on because we see mistakes or poor behavior as defining our character. Everyone makes mistakes and engages in poor behavior. Such behavior does not necessarily reflect your values and worth as a person. Learn to see yourself as a separate entity from the mistakes you've made.Try to treat yourself as you would treat another person. If a loved one, for example, made the same mistake you did, what would you say? Chances are, you would not think a friend or family member is a bad person because of a single lapse in judgment.
Grant yourself this same kindness. Just because you screwed up does not mean you're a bad person by nature. You and your mistakes are two different things. You can certainly use mistakes to identify ways to change yourself, but your bad qualities do not represent everything you are as a person.

, You may be better able to accept your mistakes if you feel they were worthwhile. Instead of ruminating over what you could have done better, stop and think about what you can learn. You cannot change the past, but you can use it to guide yourself towards better decisions in the future.Try to foster gratitude for the ability to learn something new. For example, if you learn that you get frustrated when your mom tries to talk to you immediately after arriving home, then be grateful for learning that you need some time to decompress after you get home. This is something new that you have learned about yourself that can help you to develop better relationships with those who are close to you.
Guilt is actually your brain's way of sending you a warning sign that you need to change. If you're feeling guilty, your behavior may be too extreme or unhealthy in some ways. If you're obsessing over a past mistake, stop and consider what you can learn.
For example, maybe you were having a stressful day at work and took it out on your mom. Maybe you need to learn to regulate your emotions more instead of lashing out at others. You cannot change the way you acted in the past, but going forward you can try to better regulate your emotions.

, You need to be able to let go of a need for perfection. If you cannot get over past mistakes, you may have perfectionist tendencies by nature. Remember that no one is perfect, and you cannot expect yourself to go through life never making mistakes.Remind yourself that you're able to recognize your mistakes. Many people are unable to recognize when they've made an error and will continue down a bad path. The fact you're self-aware will serve you well.
Not making mistakes is not realistic. You need to accept that you've made errors and are imperfect in some ways. As long as you're able to recognize your mistakes, you're on the right path.

, As life goes on, we are always learning and growing. Your values and beliefs may even change. Something that appears obvious to you now might now have been obvious a few years ago because you did not have the same knowledge or beliefs that you do now.

For example, you might have tried using a drug like cocaine several years ago because you thought it might be fun. Now, you might know that this is a highly addictive drug that may lead you to behave in ways that are not true to who you are. But at the time that you tried it, you did not have this knowledge.
Or, you might have trusted someone who betrayed you and look back on this with regret. However, at the time, you had no way of knowing that this person might betray you.

, The first step to making amends is embracing your guilt. Instead of trying to ignore or dismiss it, see what you can learn. If you're feeling guilty, it's because you've done something wrong. You may need to make up for this, and change your behavior in the future.Think about why you're feeling guilty. Did you hurt someone you care about? Did you lash out at a friend or family member? What can you do better in the future? What should you do to make up for it in the present?
However, do not lapse into shame. Shame is when you judge your whole self based on a few actions. This is counterproductive and will lead you to feel bad about yourself without making any productive changes. As you acknowledge your guilt, remember bad actions and decisions do not make you a bad person.

, It's important to be able to admit to mistakes without making excuses, especially if you've hurt another person. In order to change and make amends, you need to recognize your behavior was a problem.Avoid making excuses for yourself. Do not think, ""Yes, I snapped at my friends, but I had a lot of stress going on"" or ""Yes, I was difficult yesterday, but my childhood makes me act this way.""
If you're making excuses, you're more likely to let bad behavior slide in the future. Instead, think to yourself, ""I made a mistake. I can't change that, but I can work on improving in the future.""

, If you want to make up for your errors, try to have a sense of how you hurt someone. Think about what you said or did. Imagine how the other person felt being on the receiving end of your behavior.It may not be easy to have empathy. This may be especially true if you're working on moving on. If you're forgiving yourself, you may think less about the other person you hurt. However, self-forgiveness can be difficult.
In order to really commit to change, you need to stay empathetic. Spend a lot of time reflecting on how you hurt someone, and putting yourself in that person's shoes. This will ultimately help you slow down and consider your actions a bit more in the future.

, This may be as simple as an apology. You may also have to find a concrete way to make up for your actions. After reflecting on your mistake, and accepting blame, try to make it right with the other person.In some cases, it may be obvious what to do. If you, for example, damaged someone's property, you need to repair it. If you borrowed money and did not return it, you need to return it.
In other cases, the damage is less concrete. You may have to apologize to someone and try to show them you've changed. It may take time to rebuild a damaged relationship, but it will be worth the effort. This will help you accept your mistakes and move forward.
In other cases, the issue may be highly personal. While you did not hurt anyone else, you let yourself down. If you made a poor personal decision, think about how you can do better in the future. You can also look at ways to repair the damage now. For example, say you overspent this month due to going out with friends and unnecessary expenses. You could be very strict with spending until your next paycheck.

, If you have trouble letting go of mistakes, this may be related to your worldview. You may have a tendency to see things, including yourself, in very black and white terms. If you tend to view life as a matter of right versus wrong and good versus bad, try to work on seeing the gray area.Stop evaluating yourself. You do not need to put a label on your behavior. It's okay to admit you want to change, or that you disliked your actions in a given situation, but it may be counterproductive to label certain behaviors as objectively wrong.
Try to accept yourself instead. Some actions are ambiguous and confusing. You can make a mistake without needing to categorize your actions, or yourself, by a strict dichotomy.

, Do you show yourself the same kindness you show others? If not, it may be a time to do so. If you're not being kind to yourself, it will be harder for you to let go of your past and move forward.Try to accept who you are, mistakes and all. If you have close friends or family members, chances are you're aware of their flaws. Does that mean you don't care about them? Of course not. Try to grant yourself this same courtesy.
Stop problem thoughts as they occur. If you start to think, ""I'm so mad at myself for screwing up. I'm such a failure,"" replace these notions with more positive thoughts. You could, for example, instead think something like, ""I made a mistake, but it's okay I have flaws. I'm happy with myself overall.""

, It's important to acknowledge your strengths alongside your mistakes. If you find yourself ruminating over past mistakes, stop and remind yourself of everything you do right.Try writing your strengths down when you're feeling negative about yourself. Take a pen and paper and jot down everything you like about yourself.
You can start with something basic, like, ""I'm nice to others."" Build on that, and list strengths that are specific to you.

Name and admit the thing you’ve done.,
Tell God that you know what you did was wrong.,
Say that you are sorry for what you did.,
Pray about what you’re feeling.,
Use scripture in your prayer.,
Ask God to forgive you for what you’ve done.,
Tell God that you believe He has forgiven you.,
Seek forgiveness from people you hurt by what you did.,
Repent of the wrong behavior.,
Work to keep from doing the same wrong thing again.",How to Ask God for Forgiveness," Before asking forgiveness, you must specifically state the thing you did wrong and admit that you did it. If you’re feeling guilty, you may be tempted to make excuses or deny that you did anything wrong. Forgiveness is impossible if you don’t admit you did something wrong.You may think, “I guess maybe I shouldn’t have lied, but I had a really good reason and it was a small lie.” You are trying to justify what you did rather than admitting to it.
Begin by praying, “Father, I took $5 from my brother without asking him for it.” You have named the sin (stealing) and you have taken the responsibility for it without making an excuse.;
, Once you have named what you did, it’s important to recognize that it was wrong. It’s possible to say what you’ve done but to not believe that you were wrong to do it. Admitting you did it is pointless if you do not admit that you know it was wrong.You will not receive forgiveness if you say, “I’ve been sleeping with my co-worker even though I’m married, but I don’t see anything wrong with it.” You must recognize what you did as sin, as something God is unhappy about.

, It is still not enough to say what you did and admit that it was wrong. Now you must apologize for it. Feel sincerely sorry for the wrong, and let that regret come through in what you say to God. It’s important that you are actually remorseful when you say you are sorry.Asking forgiveness from God is not like when you say sorry to a brother but you really don’t mean it. It must be sincerely from your heart.
Say something like, “I know that what I did was wrong, and I feel truly bad for it. I’m sorry that I broke our relationship. I’m sorry for sinning against you.”

, You must always be honest when you are asking for forgiveness. If you believe that God knows your heart anyway, there is no sense in lying to him. Tell him the guilt you feel for your sin, and that being separated from him has made you sad.


Say, “God, I feel sick to my stomach because I know I have caused you pain.”
It can be good to pray aloud to God so that you are saying specifically what is on your mind as opposed to only thinking it.

, God’s word is powerful, and he encourages you to use it when you speak to him. Since the words in the Bible come from God, they show a model for how to talk to God. Search your Bible, or online, to find scriptures about asking for forgiveness. Use those to make your prayer meaningful.Look these scriptures up and pray them in your prayer: Romans 6:23, John 3:16, 1 John 2:2. These scriptures talk about forgiveness. The New Testament is full of truth about forgiveness.
Search on your own and find scriptures that speak to you about the forgiveness you’re seeking. You can repeat the scripture verbatim or paraphrase it so it means more to you.

, Just as you would with other people, after saying you are sorry you must ask to be forgiven. There is no special prayer you have to pray to earn forgiveness from God. All you have to do is ask him to forgive you, through Jesus Christ, and believe that he will forgive you.Say to God, “I denied knowing you to my friend. It was wrong and cowardly for me to do that. I’m sorry I didn’t tell him about your love for us. Please forgive me for my weakness in that moment.""
You do not need to plead, beg, or repeat yourself over and over. Asking God one time, with a genuine heart, is all you have to do.

, Belief and forgiveness go hand in hand. It’s no good to ask for forgiveness but not believe God will forgive you. God says that when you ask him to forgive you with sincere hearts that is He is faithful to forgive. Tell yourself you believe Him and tell God you believe Him.1 John 1:9 tells you that, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” Say this scripture to God and believe it.
It’s important to remember that forgiven sins are forgotten. Hebrews 8:12 says, ""For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”

, Although sin ultimately breaks relationship with God, other people are often hurt, too. When you know that God has forgiven you, it’s important to seek forgiveness from others. Tell the person you are sorry you hurt them and ask them to forgive you.Remember that you can’t make someone forgive you, and you can’t earn it from them. They will either accept that you are sorry for what you did and forgive you, or they won’t. Don’t pester them if they refuse to forgive. You can’t make them change.
Once you have apologized and asked for someone’s forgiveness, you must release yourself from the guilt. Even if they don’t forgive you, you’ve done your part in seeking to make amends.

, Once you are forgiven by God for your sin and by others for any hurt you caused, you must turn away from that sin. Make a conscious decision that you will not purposefully commit the same sin again after being forgiven.You must remember that you will always sin again, but it’s important to say in the moment that you are turning away. The only way to get further from habitual sin is to tell yourself you are not going to do it again.
Acts 2:38 is helpful in this process. It says, ""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”
Forgiveness is an important step, but walking away from sin is necessary, too, to remain close to God.

, Part of your goal in following Christ is to move further from sin, and this takes committed work. You won’t stop sinning immediately, but if you work on it, you will grow stronger. In Matthew 5:48, God calls you to become perfect, as he is perfect. It’s a goal that you must work toward.Find people who can help you avoid repeated sins. Learn scripture to combat temptation. Remember that sin only harms and you don’t need it.
Spending time reading your Bible, praying to God, and talking with other Christians are all vitally important to living a life that is free of sin.

Stay in touch.,
Don’t talk too often.,
Make plans to visit if you can.,
Write letters to the person.,
Find new ways to fill your time.,
Work on opening up your heart to new people.Make an effort to be friendlier to new people.",How to Not Miss Someone4," If you have a friend who has moved away or is gone for the summer, make sure to stay in touch. If you know you’ll have a weekly phone call or Skype date, then you will feel more connected and less lonely. Setting up a routine for communication with the person can allow you to look forward to talking with him.


If the person is on the other side of the world, you can communicate via email, and international texting programs. You may think that talking will make you miss the person more, but it will actually help you realize that the person is not completely gone.

, Don’t get into the habit of talking every day or texting all the time. You won’t enjoy your life in the present and you will be less likely to step out of your comfort zone to try new things or meet new people.


If the person who is away is the one who wants to talk more, explain that, while it’s important that you keep in touch, you don’t want to become too codependent.Call the person if you’re making a big decision or something major happens, but work on finding a person who is closer to home who can be there for you as well.

, Having a plan to see the person will give you something to look forward to and will help decrease the feeling that you will never see the person again. If you know you’ll be hanging out with him in a few weeks, then you’ll be less inclined to want to talk to him every second of the day and will actually miss him less.


You both are living your lives and if you are visiting too often, you will likely be precluding yourself from social activities with others. Strike a balance. You don’t want people to exclude you from social events because they think you’re always going to be with the person you miss.

, If you do this once every few weeks or so, it will give you a chance to access your feelings and thoughts and will make you feel less compelled to call or text the person all the time. This can be a fun way of communicating and it will make you feel less likely to miss the person.


Writing the letter will feel like an intimate conversation and allow you to feel closer even though they are miles away.

, You may just want to sit around missing the person. Instead, find new things to do to keep yourself occupied such as, bowling with new friends or learning to play guitar. If your schedule has huge gaps to fill that were previously occupied by time spent with the person, you will likely keep missing him. Fill those gaps with doing new things and meeting new, interesting people.


Pick up a new sport, such as running or basketball.
Try a new hobby, such as photography, painting, or cooking.
Sign up for interesting classes in your community or school, such as writing workshops or wine pairing courses.
Discover a new love of literature. Read all the books you’ve been meaning to read, but haven’t.
Find a new form of exercise. Biking, hiking, and yoga can all fill your time while making you feel great.

, Extend invitations to get together with your acquaintances. Though you may be shy, work on getting to know people little by little. Smile, be friendly and outgoing toward the people you meet.


Start by asking a few casual questions. Tell a fun fact or two about yourself, or make some funny observations. If you make more of an effort, you’ll be on your way to having more friends and missing the person less.
You won’t ever be able to replace the person who is gone. He was very important to you and always will be. Instead, just focus on finding new and interesting people to make your life more dynamic.
Give people a chance. You may have more in common than you think with people you were skeptical about in the past. Once you spend time with them, you’ll see that you might enjoy their company after all.

Think about what you did to upset the person.,
Understand why you did what you did.,
Empathize with the person you wronged.,
Remember that your mistake does not make you a bad person.,
Write out your apology.",How to Ask for Forgiveness1," Before you can develop an apology, you need to identify what you did to upset the person. It is important to know which of your specific actions led to the person being upset with you. If you are uncertain about why the person is mad at you, you should ask what specific things upset them.


Example scenario 1: I embarrassed my friend by making a scene at his party.
Example scenario 2: I snapped at my spouse and was irritable and short all day;
, In addition to understanding what you did to upset someone, you also need to understand why you did it. While you don’t want to use your intentions as an excuse, your reasons may help you develop your apology by helping you to take responsibility for your actions.Example scenario 1: I made a scene at the party because I was feeling left out and wanted more attention.
Example scenario 2: I treated my spouse this way because I did not sleep well the night before and I had a lot of things on my mind.

, It is important to develop a sense of empathy for the person to whom you are apologizing. Having empathy means that you understand why your actions hurt the other person because you have put yourself in their shoes and imagined their pain. Without empathy, your apology may end up sounding empty and insincere.Before apologizing to someone, take the time to develop your empathy for the person. Imagine if the same thing had happened to you. How would you feel? What would you do?


Example scenario 1: If my friend made a scene at a party I was giving, I would feel angry and betrayed.
Example scenario 2: If my spouse had snapped at me for no reason and treated me badly all day, I would feel hurt and confused.

, Apologizing can be hard because it requires you to admit that you have done something wrong. Just remember that by apologizing, you are not admitting to being a bad person. One study found that taking a few moments to affirm your good qualities (in private, before you apologize to someone) can make the apology easier.Try taking a moment to yourself before your next apology, look at yourself in the mirror, and say three things that you like about yourself.

, If you have many things that you need to say to the person, you may want to write out your apology before you apologize. By writing your apology out, you will have an easier time knowing what you need to say. You can also keep the notes with you when you actually apologize to remind yourself.


By taking the time to write out your apology, you will demonstrate to the other person that you have thought long and hard about your mistake. Your apology will be understood as even more sincere as a result.
Apologizing in person is preferable. But if you cannot reach the person by phone or in person, you can still email or snail mail your apology to the person."

Forgive yourself.,
Learn from your mistakes and accept your failings.,
Avoid comparing yourself to others.,
Practice empathy.,
Think positively.,
Make amends.,
Accept who you are by building your self esteem.,
Look forward to the future.",How to Live With Your Past," Letting go of the past can be difficult. Nevertheless, in order to move forward with your life, you have to reconcile and let go of the past. Some of the ways to do this include::

Become clear on your morals and values as they are right now.
Realize the past is the past.
Realize you did the best you could at the time.
Identify your biggest regrets.
Move towards self love.;
, Do not try to forget about it as some of your family or peers may suggest. That may work for them, but it is obviously not for you. If you could forget about it, it would not be on your mind. Stay positive and make peace with your mistakes:Try not to take you dwell on the errors in your past. This can have a negative affect on your self esteem and confidence.
Analyze the reason(s) why you failed in the past. Is there anything that you could have done differently? Was there circumstances that were beyond your control? Is it possible that you are trying to accomplish a task that is beyond your capabilities?
Quit obsessing about it. You are only making yourself crazy running it over and over in your head, and this is adding to your negative self esteem issues.
Be true to yourself and quit worrying about getting approval from family or peers. You know what is right for you. You are confident. You have your best interests at heart, so do not let what others say cause you self doubt.

, You can spend a lifetime comparing yourself to others and ultimately it will just make you feel self conscious. Whenever we compare ourselves, we will always come out looking bad. Here are some things to think about:Everyone is an individual. We excel at some things, and fail at others. When you find a task or are in situation that is beyond your capabilities, there is no shame in admitting defeat. Pick yourself, dust yourself off and try something else.
Spending time focused on what someone can do better than you is not only going to make you feel bad, it is a waste of time. It can also make you resent yourself or the person that does it better.
Comparing yourself is a losing situation. It is not only going to rob you of pride, but also your self esteem, passion and drive. There is no up side.

, Walk a mile in another person's shoes. It is easy to beat yourself up about your past wrongs. If you get the opportunity, sit down with a friend, a peer, and listen to their story. By being empathetic, you listen to others and gain an understanding of their feelings. It may help to put the regrets you have in a different light. To be truly empathetic, some of the things you will want to work on include:Building a bond of trust. Be able to listen to another talk about their feelings and regrets with an open mind and then be able to open up to them about your feelings.
Keeping any judgement(s) you may have to yourself. As you build trust, opportunities to offer help or a suggestion will likely come up, but it will not happen the minute you sit down to talk. Have patience.
Giving a physical show of support. This may be a pat on the shoulder, or a hug, but make sure you are confident that it is appropriate.

, Do not dwell on ""what if""s and ""if only""s. It will only lead to despair. Instead, work to overcome your negative thoughts by refocusing on the positives in your life:Take responsibility and refocus your thoughts. Until now you may have automatically assumed the worst or thought negatively. Train yourself to do the opposite; default to positive thinking. It will take a bit of time, but you will find yourself much happier when you stop automatically expecting bad things to happen.
Smile. To quote BJ Palmer: ""It takes 63 muscles to frown and 13 to make a smile. Why work overtime?"" People are attracted to happy, positive people. Just think, smiling takes less energy, and attracts people. You will save yourself some energy and maybe charm a friend. Sounds like a WIN/WIN situation!
Sing! Even if you think you are a lousy singer, remember, you are not the only ""shower"" singer! Sing while your cooking, running the vacuum, or doing errands. You will be amazed at how singing can change your mood.
Help other people. Perhaps you have an elderly next door neighbour that you could take grocery shopping. You could volunteer at a soup kitchen, to help the less fortunate in your community. Donate clothing that you or your family no longer wear to your local Salvation Army or Goodwill. It will give you a positive feeling to know that you have helped those less fortunate.

, Take personal inventory of actions you might or should have done differently. It will not be easy, but doing right by the person(s) that you have wronged in the past, you will be able to move on with your life.Examine and take stock of what you have done.
Explain to those you have hurt that you want to repair the damage that you have caused.
Admit what you have done.
Find an appropriate way to make things right.
Realize that it will take time to regain the trust of those you have hurt.

, Learn to accept yourself for who you realistically are; your strengths and your weaknesses. It is important to understand yourself if you are looking to improve your self esteem. Some suggestions on how to build your self esteem include:Cease talking about yourself negatively. Be positive, because this has a large affect on your self esteem.
Quit beating yourself up when you make a mistake. We all make mistakes.
Exercise. When you exercise, endorphins are released into your system, triggering a positive feeling in your body. Also, there is the obvious benefit of exercising for your health.
Celebrate the little things. Take the time to be proud of yourself, even if it is something as simple as organizing your closet.
Surround yourself with positiveness. Spend time with people who are a positive influence on you. Immerse yourself into activities you enjoy.

, By ridding yourself of the negativity of the past, and working on making changes to make your life happier, your future should look so much brighter. Enjoy the feeling. You deserve it!"

Understand the purpose of guilt.,
Recognize unproductive guilt.,
Identify what you feel guilty about.,
Write about your feelings.,
Apologize if necessary.,
Reflect on the situation to prevent a similar one.,
Change guilt into gratitude.,
Forgive yourself.,
Take a lesson from the fictional character Scarlett O'Hara.,
Do a good deed.,
Incorporate a spiritual practice into your life.,
Consider seeking help from a therapist if you can’t move past your guilt on your own.",How to Overcome Feelings of Guilt," Most of the time, we feel guilty because we have done or said something that caused harm to someone else. This type of guilt helps you to understand when you may be at fault for something, which is healthy and normal.For example, if you forget a friend’s birthday, you might feel guilty because friends are expected to remember and celebrate their friends’ birthdays. This is healthy guilt because it alerts you to something you failed to do that may damage your relationship with this person.;
, Sometimes we may feel guilty when we don’t need to feel guilty. This type of guilt is known as unhealthy or unproductive guilt because it is not serving a purpose. It just makes us feel bad. For example, if you feel guilty because you had to work on your friend’s birthday and could not attend her party, this would be an example of unhealthy guilt. If you are scheduled to work and cannot take time off for a birthday party, this is beyond your control. Your friend should understand that you had to miss her party in order to keep your job.

, If you feel guilty about something, it is important to identify what you feel guilty about and why. Identifying the source of your guilt and why it makes you feel guilty can help you to determine if you are experiencing healthy or unhealthy guilt. Either way, you will need to work through these feelings in order to overcome them., Journaling about your guilt may help you to start to understand it and deal it. Start by writing down the reason that you feel guilty. If it was something you did or said to someone, describe what happened in as much detail as you can. Include in your description how this situation made you feel and why. What do you think that you should feel guilty about?For example, you might write about the reasons why you forgot your friend’s birthday. What was going on that distracted you? How did your friend react? How did that make you feel?

, Once you have determined whether or not your guilt is healthy or unhealthy, you can determine if you need to apologize for your actions. In the case of forgetting about your friend’s birthday, you should apologize because you failed to do something that friends are supposed to do.Make sure that your apology is sincere and that you don’t make excuses for your actions. It is important to take full responsibility for your actions in order to show your friend that you really do feel bad. Say something simple like, “I am really sorry for _____.”

, After you have considered your guilt, identified its source, and apologized if necessary, you should take some time to reflect on your actions in order to prevent a similar situation in the future. Reflecting when you have done something wrong can help you to grow from an experience rather than keep on making the same mistakes.For example, after reflecting on the experience of forgetting your friend’s birthday, you might decide that in the future you need to be more careful about remembering important dates and take steps to prevent a similar situation in the future.

, Feeling guilty may cause you to think guilty thoughts, which are unproductive and do not provide you with anything that you can apply to your future behavior. Instead, try turning your guilty thoughts into gratitude thoughts.For example, if you forgot your friend’s birthday, you might think to yourself, “I should have remembered that yesterday was her birthday!” This thought does not allow you to improve on your situation, it just makes you feel worse for forgetting your friend’s birthday.
Change guilt statements to positive ones, such as “I am grateful for the reminder that my friends are important to me and the chance to demonstrate that to them in the future.”

, Forgiving yourself, just like you would forgive a friend, is an important part of learning how to deal with guilt. If you are dealing with guilt that stems from things that you have asked others to forgive you for or things that are beyond your control, you need to learn how to forgive yourself. One way that you can begin to move past your guilt is to forgive yourself whenever you make a mistake, just like you would forgive a dear friend.


The next time you feel guilty about something, take a deep breath and stop beating yourself up. Instead, say something like, “I made a mistake, but that does not make me a bad person.”, Consider the quote, ""After all . . . tomorrow is another day."" Realize each day is a new beginning filled with promise, hope and the opportunity to start over. Understand that while your actions may have been wrong, they do not dictate your future. Although they may have consequences, they do not have complete control of the rest of your life.

, Reaching out to others often helps the person who offers help as much as the person who receives it. Although you must understand that good deeds will not reverse your actions, they will help you move forward into a positive future. . Some studies have even shown that helping others has a wide range of benefits for your mental and physical health.Check with local hospitals, charities, and other organizations about volunteer opportunities. Even volunteering for a few hours per week may help you to overcome your guilt.

, Some faiths offer ways to atone for sinning, which may help you to deal with feelings of guilt. Consider attending a service at a religious house of your choice or develop your own spiritual practice. The benefits of spirituality are beyond relieving feelings of guilt. Research has shown that spirituality and prayer may even help to relieve stress and decrease healing times during an illness.Consider going to a place of worship to pray with other people.
Get into meditation or yoga.
Spend time in nature and admire the beauty of the natural world

, For some people, guilt can interfere with daily life and happiness. Without help, it may be hard to understand your guilt and determine the best way to deal with those feelings. A licensed mental health professional can help you to understand these feelings and help you work through them.


Keep in mind that feeling excessively guilty may be part of an underlying mental health condition that requires treatment. Talking to a therapist can help you understand what is going on and decide on the best course of action.

Try deep breathing a few times a day, or when you feel particularly stressed.


Taking long, deep breaths can help to control hyperventilation, bring down your heart rate, increase blood flow throughout your body, and reduce stress.;
, You might think something like, “He’s left me forever,” or “I have no one…” In the moment, identifying the thought may seem like it makes it worse, but it is the first step in regaining control of your thoughts and tears.


If you can’t do it in the moment, reflect on the thoughts you were thinking in the moment once you’ve stopped crying.

, If you are too upset to write a formal sentence, feel free to write anything, write messy, or even scrawl. You can simply list incomplete sentences, a page with one big feeling word, or a page full of feeling words. The point is to get these feelings and thoughts onto a page and out of your mind a little. Later on you can reflect on and discuss these feelings and thoughts when you are in a calmer state.


For example, you might simply write something like,""So heavy,"" ""Hurt, betrayed, offended."" Writing down what's bothering you can also help you have a conversation with someone who might be hurting you., To break the cycle of negative thoughts, try distracting yourself by tensing up your muscles or by holding a piece of ice in your hand or on your neck.Ideally, this will draw your attention away from the thought long enough for you to regain composure.


You can also try to distract yourself with music. Rock and sway to center yourself and calm your body. Singing along may help you regain control of your breathing and focus on something else.
Go for a walk. The change of scenery from going for a walk can help stop those pervasive, negative thoughts. Physical activity may also help reset your breathing and heart rate.

, Facial expressions and posture have an effect on our moods. If you find yourself frowning or hunching over in a defeated posture, this can make you feel more negative. If possible, try to change it up. Stand up and put your hands by your sides (hands akimbo) or try the acting technique “lion face-lemon face” where you make a “rawr”, lion-type face then a puckered sour face.Changing your posture may help break the crying cycle long enough to regain your composure.

, This is a technique where you tense and relax various parts of your body. Start by tightening the muscles as hard as you can for about five seconds while inhaling. Then, quickly release the tension while you exhale, then relaxing your face.Then tense your neck, relax. Then your chest, hands, etc. until you work your way down to your feet.


Perform these relaxation techniques regularly to prevent stress from building up.This helps you become aware of where you are holding tension when you're crying hard.

, This moment is not forever. This will help you see a bigger picture beyond this overwhelming moment.


Splash some cold water on your face. The coolness can distract you for a moment to gain control of your breathing. The cool water may also help some of the swelling (like puffy eyes) that happens after crying hard.

, Do you feel like you're crying too much? While this is subjective, on average women cry 5.3 times a month and men 1.3 times, but this crying varies from watery eyes to sobbing.These averages may not necessarily take into account times when crying is more frequent because of some sort of emotional life event, like a breakup, the death of a loved one, or other major life events. When crying fits start to feel out of your control and affect your personal or work life, then it may be considered a problem worth addressing.


You're more likely to feel overwhelmed and find yourself in a cycle of sad or negative thoughts during these highly emotional periods.

, If something is going in on your life that causes your stress or anxiety, you may be more likely to cry frequently. For example, if you're mourning the death of a loved one or just mourning the end of a relationship, crying is normal and understandable. But, sometimes life itself can become overwhelming and you may find yourself crying without understanding why you started crying in the first place.


In this case, excessive crying may be a sign of something more serious like depression or anxiety. If you find yourself frequently crying without understanding why, feel sad, worthless, or irritable, start experiencing pain or trouble eating, have trouble sleeping, or have suicidal thoughts, you may have depression.Seek medical attention to learn treatment options.

, Start being aware of the situations leading up to your crying fits and write them down.When do the fits happen? Are there certain days, situations, or scenarios that elicit intense crying? Are there things that trigger a crying fit?


For example, if listening to a certain band reminds you of your ex, take the band off of your playlists and avoid listening to the provoking music. Same goes for pictures, smells, places, etc. If you don’t want to be exposed to these upsetting reminders, it is ok to avoid them for a while.

, Write down any negative thoughts and ask yourself if they're rational. Likewise, consider if your ideals are rational and realistic.Remember to be kind to yourself. A good way to do this is to list any accomplishments or things that make you happy. Think of your journal or diary as a record of what you're grateful for.Try to contribute to your journal or diary every day. When you feel like you're going to cry, read what you've already written and remind yourself what makes you happy., Ask yourself, “How do I cope with conflict?” Do you typically respond with anger? Tears? Ignoring it? Chances are, if you let conflict build up by ignoring it, you'll end up in a big crying fit. Becoming aware of how to respond to conflict may help you identify what path you need to take.


Don't forget to ask yourself, ""Who is in control?” Reclaim control over your life so you have the power to change outcomes. For example, rather than say, ""That teacher is terrible and made me fail that test,"" admit that you didn't study enough and that led to your poor score. Next time, focus on studying and accepting the outcome.

, If you continuously think negative thoughts, you may be fostering harmful emotions. You might even revisit negative, sad memories that happened in the distant past, which also keeps the crying going.This can cause damaging behavior, including prolonged crying fits. Once you're aware of the effects your thoughts have, you can begin to change your thinking to create more positive situations.For example, if you keep thinking, ""I'm not good enough,"" you may begin to feel hopeless or insecure.Learn to stop the thought process before it affects your emotional well-being.

, You can try reaching out to a close friend or family member to talk about what is bothering you. Call them or ask if they are available for a cup of coffee. If you feel you do not have someone you feel you can talk to, try a hotline like the Samaritans, (212-673-3000).If you find yourself crying frequently and feel you need some additional help, a professional counselor may be able help you. A counselor can develop a plan for you to regain control of your thoughts and cope with them appropriately.

, Ask your general practitioner, check the phone book, or ask friends to refer you to a counselor or therapist.Your counselor or therapist will ask about what brings you into therapy. You can say something like, “I find myself having crying fits often, and I would like to understand why they happen and how to control them.” Or even something as simple as, “I feel sad.” The counselor will ask you questions about what you’ve been experiencing, as well as a history.You and your therapist will discuss your goals for therapy then devise a plan on how to accomplish those goals.

Diagnose why you need to forgive yourself.,
Accept that failures do not make you a bad person.,
Do not be afraid to start anew.,
Adapt a new mindset by learning from past mistakes.",How to Forgive Yourself1," If we recognize we are to blame, we may feel guilt and a need for forgiveness. When you think of memories, they may create these uncomfortable feelings. To identify why it is you may feeling like this, ask yourself:


Am I feeling this way because of the outcome of what I did makes me feel bad?
Am I feeling this way because I am to blame for a bad outcome?;
, Everyone fails at something at one point in her life or other. Do not think that failing at something - whether it be a job or relationship - makes you a bad person. As Bill Gates said: “It is fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.” Learning from one’s mistakes is a step of forgiving oneself.

, To really forgive yourself, do not be afraid to start from scratch. Learning to forgive yourself is not just learning to live with the past. It is learning from that experience. Take what you have learned and apply it to building a better you. , One way to move forward with yourself is to adapt from what you have learned.

Apologize to the person you have wronged.,
Explain why you did what you did, but don’t make excuses.,
Demonstrate empathy.,
Try to make things right.,
Show them that you've changed.,
Ask for their forgiveness.,
Try to sweeten the deal.",How to Ask for Forgiveness2," The first thing you need to do when you ask forgiveness of someone is to express remorse for your actions. In other words, you need to make it clear that you feel sorry about what you have done. This can be accomplished easily if you start out by saying, “I’m sorry,” or “I apologize.”Strengthen your statement of remorse by saying exactly what you are sorry about. For example, “I am sorry for making a scene at your party.” Or, “I apologize for snapping at you and being so short with you yesterday.”

, It is important to reveal the motivation behind your actions, but you have to be careful not to use your motivation as an excuse. Simply tell the person what caused you to do or say the things that you did. Keep this portion of the apology short and make it clear that you are not trying to use it as an excuse for your actions.For example, “I made a scene because I was feeling left out and wanted more attention, but that’s no excuse for my behavior.” Or, “I acted that way because I did not sleep well the night before and I had a lot of things on my mind, but that is not your fault and it was wrong for me to take it out on you.”

, In addition to making sure that the person knows you are accepting responsibility for your actions, you should also make it clear that you understand how you made them feel. Tell the person how you imagine or know that you made them feel.For example, “By making a scene at your party I know that I embarrassed you in front of your new friends from work.” Or, “By acting that way towards you, I probably made you feel unappreciated.”

, Once you have addressed what you did, why you did it, and why it was wrong, you need to make things right. In other words, you need to tell the person what you intend to do in the future to prevent another similar situation. This may be accomplished by providing a plan for future scenarios or by saying how you will respond differently in the future.For example, “In the future, I will talk to someone about how I am feeling rather than acting out.” Or, “The next time I am having a bad day, I will take some time to myself and try not to project my anger onto you.”

, It is important to demonstrate the amount of time and effort that you have put into your apology and the efforts you are making to avoid a similar situation in the future. If you took the time to correct the mistake you made, tell the person about how you corrected it. It shows a willingness to admit you're wrong, as well as a sincere desire to atone for a mistake.


Example: ""I've even changed after that incident. I'm trying to find productive outlets for my anger. I'm going to the gym and taking kickboxing classes. I've even talked with a therapist about confronting some of my anger issues.""

, Once you have apologized, you can ask the other person to forgive you. This may be the most difficult part of the apology because there is always a chance that the person will not forgive you. In fact, you should demonstrate your understanding by allowing the person that option. Just keep in mind that you can try again if the person is not ready to forgive and try not to get discouraged.Example: ""I care about you a lot and I value our friendship. Will you please forgive me?""

, Compensate for your mistake by doing something good for the person you have wronged. Approach them with a bunch of flowers or a card with a written note. Show them that your actions are not just about relieving yourself of guilt, but making them feel better, too. Just don’t rely on flowers or some other gift as a stand-in for a sincere apology."

Expect little, but hope for the best.,
Be understanding.,
Be patient.",How to Ask for Forgiveness3," If you expect to be forgiven and aren't, you're understandably going to be really disappointed. If you expect very little and are forgiven, then you'll be a lot happier. Prepare yourself for the worst but hope for the best., If the person does not forgive you, show empathy. Say something like ""That's okay, I don't know if I could forgive myself either. I just hope that time can bring us closer together again. I really value your friendship.""


Don't get mad at the other person for not forgiving you. Forgiveness is a privilege, not a right. Remember that you're more likely to be forgiven if you're a likable and understanding person afterward., Small transgressions may be forgiven easily, but some wounds need time to heal. Do not expect to be forgiven easily if what you did was especially hurtful. Even if your request for forgiveness is denied, continue trying.Apologizing in person is usually the best method, but if that is impossible, reach them through other means of communication. Text them, send emails, but do not give up.

Realize that no one is perfect.,
Do not dwell on past mistakes.,
Plan for a bright future today by not being stifled by the past.,
Learn to be mindful.,
Investigate your past choices.,
Identify situations where you feel strong emotions.",How to Forgive Yourself2," You may want to forgive yourself because of actions against another. You must first realize that you are not to blame for other people’s actions. We all make mistakes and we all have times in our life that we do not act our best. Realizing this may be the step you need to being the self-healing process.

, Learning from past mistakes is good, but dwelling on them can stunt self-forgiveness. It may stop you from being aware of present realities. Your life may become stagnant as you find yourself obsessing about what you did or did not do. Instead, focus on the present and what you can do in the future to make a better life for yourself.

, Consider a “fix it and move on” approach to life. If you experience a similar encounter that caused you emotional turmoil in the past, focus on what you can control.


Try and fix the issues that you know you can handle and try and let the rest of it go. You do not want to keep repeating the same mistakes. , Self-awareness of present actions can help for future healing. If you cultivate a strong sense of self and accept the actions you choose to take now, it will help you to build a better future and help you forgive past actions or reactions.

, You do not want to dwell on mistakes, but you must learn from them to move forward in a healthier way.


One way to forgive yourself is to identify the trigger, or cause, of emotions in the first place. If you identify what you did in the first place, then you can change your outlook for the future.
Ask yourself: “What did I do the first time, and what may I do to avoid the same outcome?” , This will help you directly pinpoint situations in which you feel uncomfortable. Once you’ve identified the situation, you can more easily plot out a solution. Ask yourself:


Do I feel anxious or guilty when I approach my boss?
Do I feel strong negative emotions when I talk with my significant other.
Does spending time with my parents make me feel angry or upset?

Let people into your life.,
Outline a solution or plan.,
Ask forgiveness from others.",How to Forgive Yourself3," As the philosopher Derrida once said: “Forgiveness is often confounded, sometimes in a calculated fashion, with related themes: excuse, regret, amnesty, prescription, etc.” .


Forgiveness is a two-way street. You may not be able to forgive yourself unless you learn to forgive others. You may need to let others into your life to help give you the support and structure to forgive yourself.
Talk to loved ones to support yourself while you grapple with self-forgiveness.

, To forgive yourself, you must be aware of what you need to forgive. Writing out a detailed step-by-step guide may help you focus on what is important and give you the structure for an apology to yourself or others. Take into consideration the following aspects of creating a solution to ask forgiveness:


Declare or ask for the apology using direct language. Do not step around the issue. Say “I’m sorry” or ask “Do you forgive me?” directly. You do not want to be ambiguous or come across as insincere.
Investigate how you can actually fix a solution. If you are asking forgiveness from another, figure out specific actions that can help make amends. If you are forgiving yourself, ask yourself what steps you need to take to move forward with a healthier outlook on life.
Promise yourself and others that you will strive to be better in the future. An apology is empty if you will not follow through with it. Make sure you do not repeat the same mistakes.

, If you ask for forgiveness for others, you will feel better about yourself.


Sometimes, clearing the air can help to resolve an existing issue. It may also help to show that you were internalizing a bigger issue than was actually present. Asking for forgiveness has been proven to bring more favorable outcomes and provide stronger relationships

Be honest with yourself about your actions.,
Stop rationalizing, and start taking responsibility for what you say and do.,
Accept the guilt that you are feeling.,
Identify self-values and self-beliefs.,
Analyze your needs versus your wants.",How to Forgive Yourself4," Before you can forgive yourself completely, you first need to acknowledge your actions.


It may help to write down your actions that you have strong feelings about. This will help pinpoint concrete examples of why you have negative feelings about yourself.

, One way to be honest to yourself is to accept the consequences of your actions. If you have done or said something wrong, you need to own the action before forgiving yourself for it.


One way to achieve this is by letting go of stress. The more stress you hold inside of you, the more damage you do to yourself.
Stress can sometimes lead you to releasing your anger out and harm yourself and others around you, but if you forgive yourself the anger will be gone and the bad stuff will be gone. The result is that you are more concentrated and better about the positive instead of the negative.

, Accepting responsibility is one thing, but understanding the emotions behind is another thing. Feeling strong emotions like guilt is not only common, but also good. Feeling guilt will encourage you to take action for yourself and others. .


You may be feeling guilty over your own thoughts. You may have thoughts of wishing pain or misfortune on others. You may feel things like lust or greed.
If you are overwhelmed by these guilty feelings, know that they are common. Your guilt may stem from these strong emotions; it is best to confront them and acknowledge why you are feeling this way. Only by doing this may you move on to forgiving yourself.
You may be judging yourself (or others) too harshly out of guilt. You may be taking out your feelings on yourself and others, making you feel guilty for your actions. You may blame others out of insecurities and increase the feeling of guilt.
If you find yourself blaming others, take a step back and acknowledge why you say these things. It may help you on the path to self-forgiveness.
You may be taking on guilt because of another’s action. It is not uncommon for a couple to feel guilt over his/her significant other’s actions. You might feel guilty over a spouse’s actions or insecurities.
You should identify why you feel this way to realize if you should forgive yourself or another person. , Before you can forgive yourself, you must identify what it is you value and what it is you believe. Take a moment to think about how you might atone for what you feel guilty for. Think about how you might make an actual difference. These actions may be based on a spiritual belief system, or based on societal demands.

, One way to forgive yourself for feelings of inadequacies to is to identify what you need in your life versus what you want.


Identify both concrete needs - such as shelter, food, and social needs - and compare them with concrete wants - nicer car, bigger house, nicer body. Identifying these needs vs. wants may help you realize that perhaps you were too hard on yourself or perhaps things are out of your control. "

Become a better person through personal challenges.,
Work on identified faults.,
Practice self-awareness.",How to Forgive Yourself5," To stop yourself from sliding back into a situation of doubt and guilt, design small challenges that will help you become a better person.You can do this by setting a routine for a month on something you want to improve. By doing something for a month - like tracking calories - you will begin to develop a helpful routine to improvement. This will help you self-actualize forgiveness by acting in a positive way.

, Try and give yourself a performance review to identify measurable means of self-improvement.


If you find yourself feeling guilty over procrastinating, for example, make a to-do list and try to stick with it. It is important to identify things that you can control. This will benefit self-forgiveness by self-improvement.

, Self-awareness is the ability to predict consequences of our actions. Thinking about ourselves and our actions can help us be better people by creating a self-imposed morality. You can practice self-awareness by noting your strengths, observing your reactions to situations, and expressing your emotions. "

Spend time together.",How to Forgive a Promise Breaker," In order to begin the forgiveness process you have to first accept that the promise was broken. Wishing that things had happened differently or that the person was more reliable only heightens the resentment.;
, When you allow yourself to be angered by the actions of another person, you’re essentially relinquishing some of your own personal power. You cannot change the actions of other people and ruminating over their actions only results in you feeling bad. Make the decision that the broken promise and the promise breaker will no longer have power over you. Here are things that you can do to help release the anger:Use affirmations to tell yourself a different story. Try telling yourself aloud several times each day “I need to forgive _____ for breaking their promise.”
Being mindful and focusing on gratitude and kindness will help to reduce overall anger. When you feel yourself starting to get angry about the empty promise, ask yourself “What am I thankful for today” so that you can re-center yourself before the anger gets out of control.

, Recognize how bad it feels to hold onto grudges. Notice that the bad feelings are not helping you but are actually making you feel worse.


Remind yourself out loud that “I am the person being hurt because of my lack of forgiveness, not _____.” Remember, releasing the negative emotions will actually help you begin to feel better.

, When you are angry with a person it results in your body going into fight-or-flight mode.The mind and body are very connected so when you allow your body to release stress and tension you’ll be in a better frame of mind to forgive. Deep breathing is a great way to de-stress and release anger:Sit in a chair with your spine straight. You’ll probably be most comfortable with the back of the chair supporting your back.
Close your eyes and put one hand on your stomach.
Slowly inhale by taking in a deep breath. You should feel the breath start in your abdomen and work its way up to your head.
Slowly exhale. You should feel the breath release from you head and move into your abdomen.
Repeat this process for five minutes or until you feel calmer.
This process helps to relieve stress by lowering your blood pressure and slowing your heart rate.

, Let the other person know how you feel and explain how the broken promise negatively impacted your life. This can help you to stop the thoughts from constantly replaying in your head.


The person who has offended you may not be prepared to apologize for breaking the promise. It’s important for you to be able to forgive and move on even if the other person does not make amends. Forgiveness is not about reconciliation, it’s about releasing the negative energy so that you can feel better.

, Every situation is a learning experience. When you’re able to acknowledge that you have learned something from the experience, even if it was the hard way, it makes the actual process of forgiving others easier.


Make the conscious decision to learn from the experience rather than be bitter about the outcome.
Ask yourself the question, “What have I learned from this experience?” and take a few minutes to explore the thoughts that come to mind. For example, did you learn to always have an alternative plan?

, Try to see the situation from the other person’s perspective. Sometimes uncontrollable things happen that make breaking promises unavoidable. Alternatively, sometimes people just have impure motives. Either way, when you are able to be empathetic, it’s so much easier to let go of grudges.


Think about the person’s intentions. Was the person’s intentions good but something happened that caused them to have to abandon the promise?
Understand that a broken problem is probably not about you. A person who breaks a promise is probably more focused on her own specific internal or external situation and may not realize how much the broken promise impacts you. For example, if someone promised to meet you for an outing and at the last minute bowed out, perhaps it was because she was having car problems or maybe money was tighter than she realized and she was too embarrassed to admit it.
Remember that everyone breaks promises at some point or another. Think back to a time when you had to break a promise. It didn’t feel good when you had to go back on your word and it probably didn’t feel so great to this person either. Keep in mind that everyone is human and sometimes things happen.

, If the person is a chronic promise breaker, consider what’s going on in the person’s life that makes her constantly go back on her word. Such behavior could be reflective of other chronic things going on in her life that she needs help with. Maybe it's something internal like she has poor boundaries or something external such as marriage problems. Try to experience compassion by considering how she may be actually feeling right now. If you’re still so frustrated about the empty promises that you struggling with this, here are some ways that you can cultivate greater compassion:Look for things that you have in common with the person. Maybe you both like the same music or drive the same model car. There are numerous things that you may have in common. Research shows that even something as simple as tapping your fingers to the same rhythm boosts compassionate behavior.
Don’t blame the other person for your misfortune. Even if her failure to keep her word created a negative result for you, recognize that there were other options available that you chose not to utilize. For example, if you were depending on her to take you to the job interview because your car was in the shop and she did not arrive, keep in mind that you could have made sure that you had a backup plan. Remember, you’re not a victim.
See the individual as a person and not “a promise breaker.” When you see her as a person who is struggling in some areas you may be more willing to forgive then if you see her as a promise breaker who just doesn’t care.

, There are many psychological and physical benefits to allowing yourself to forgive someone who has wronged you. When you are consciously aware that your own well-being actually improves when you let go of grudges, you may be more motivated to move forward with the forgiveness process. Here are some of the benefits of forgiving others: Greater psychological well-being
Decreased depression
Less anxiety
Lower levels of stress
Greater spiritual well-being
Improved heart health
Lower blood pressure
Strengthened immune system
Healthier interpersonal relationships
Increased self-esteem and feelings of self-worth
Research shows that the benefits of forgiveness are so marked because it lowers negative emotions and stress., Forgiveness is releasing the desire to seek revenge or ill will toward the person that you feel has wronged you. In addition, when someone has broken a promise, especially if they were close to you, you may experience a sense of loss and grief. Forgiveness is the natural resolution of the grief process.Forgiveness doesn’t mean that you’re weak. It's actually a very powerful choice that will ultimately help your well-being.
Forgiveness does not mean that you have to forget what happened. In fact, it is very important to put up boundaries with people who are not dependable. You can still be friends with someone and not ask them for help.
Forgiveness does not mean that you have to reconcile the relationship. You can let go of a grudge without maintaining the relationship, if you believe it is unhealthy or toxic.
Forgiving a person does not mean that you have to condone their actions. Forgiveness is so that you can move on with your life and it doesn’t mean that you have to make excuses for the other person. You can forgive and still take action to protect yourself from future hurts.

, After you have done all of the preparation work, now it’s time to actually let go. Decide whether you want to tell the person directly or if you’d prefer to privately release the grudge.Here are ways that you can express your forgiveness:


Tell the person that you forgive them. Call the person up or ask to meet with her in person. Take the opportunity to tell her that you are no longer holding a grudge and that you forgive her for breaking the promise.
If the person is deceased, unavailable, or if you’d prefer to just release the grudge in private, you can verbally express your forgiveness to yourself. Find a quiet place where you will have some privacy. Simply say out loud, “I forgive you, ____.” You can go into as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable.
Write a letter. This is another great option. You get to decide whether or not to send it or discard it. The point is to give yourself the opportunity to actually release the grudge.

, Boundaries will help you rebuild a sense of safety so that the broken promise is less likely to recur. This will help you rebuild trust and begin the process of reclaiming your personal power.


For example, let’s say that your cousin promised to watch your children so that you could attend an important event but she cancelled at the last minute. One of the boundaries that you could establish is that she give you a 24 hour notice if she has to cancel in the future (assuming there is no emergency) so that you can make other arrangements. You could let her know that if she does not keep this agreement then you will no longer ask her to babysit your children and will no longer be available to babysit her children either.
Keep in mind that as you begin to reestablish trust, the boundaries may change.
It’s especially important to set boundaries with chronic promise breakers. Yes, everyone has things that she needs to work through, but you don’t have to allow yourself to repeatedly be taken advantage of while she works through it.

, If you think that the relationship is healthy and you want to restore it then make the relationship a priority. Also, make sure you’re ready and not being pressured by what other’s say that you should do.


Emotions can interfere with the reconciliation process.Make sure you’ve allowed the inner healing to occur before trying to restore the relationship. If you’re still stewing over the broken promise then it can make things even worse.
There are times when reconciliation is not healthy, and that’s okay. If you don’t think that the relationship should be restored then it’s okay to forgive without restoring the relationship. It may feel a bit awkward but you can say something such as, “I value you as a person and I forgive you, but right now I don’t think it’s healthy for either of us to maintain this friendship.”

, When restoring a relationship, it’s important that you both feel valued. One of the best ways to show that you truly have forgiven the other person is to show your appreciation of her. Let her know that despite the broken promise, that you still value and respect her and your friendship.


Here’s an example of what you can say: “I know that we had a disagreement but I want you to know that I value our relationship and want us to remain friends. You are fun to be around, give good advice, and there’s no one else that I’d rather spend a Saturday Girl’s Night with.”
Try to be as specific as possible when you’re telling her what you appreciate about her. This will make you appear more genuine. Also, humor could be helpful too if appropriate.

, The way that you saw the situation may be slightly different from the way that she saw the situation. Share how you think you could have handled the situation differently.


Even if the person was the one who broke the promise, consider how you may have contributed to the situation. Being self-aware is important so that you can take responsibility for anything that you may have done to add to the problem.
Ask yourself questions like “Did I communicate clearly?” “Did I know that she had a lot going on yet I added more to her plate?” “Did I overreact a little?” These questions will help you acknowledge your contribution to the situation. When you share the responsibility for what happened, it helps the other person feel less defensive and the reconciliation process will likely be easier.

, Allow her the freedom to decide if she wants to save the relationship or not. Don’t assume that because she was the one who broke the promise that she’ll automatically want to reconcile. Keep in mind that although forgiveness is an internal progress reconciliation requires the participation of both people.If she is angry respect her right to be angry with you, whether you think it’s legitimate or not. Sometimes people unconsciously project blame onto others. Give her time and continue to think positive.
She may decide that she doesn’t ever want to reconcile the friendship. If this happens, be prepared to wish her well and continue to forgive.

, Be intentional about closing the distance again. Disagreements that result from broken promises can cause a rift in the relationship. Make spending time together a priority to close the distance. Try to be as normal as possible with each other.


It may take a little time to become close again, and that’s okay. Take it day by day and eventually you’ll get past this rocky period.

Contact those who you gossiped with.,
Contact the person you gossiped about.,
Apologize to the person you gossiped about.,
Take full responsibility for your actions.,
Allow your friend to respond.",How to Overcome the Guilt of Gossiping About Someone Who Trusts You1," Depending on the situation, it may be a good idea to contact those with whom you gossiped and point out that you regret your role in the conversation. This is particularly important if you were dishonest in any way, or may have over-embellished for the sake of a juicier story. Everyone says things they regret, but you have the option to partially undo the damage by articulating to those you spoke with that you regret your negative comments about someone.When speaking with those you gossiped with, be sure to include something along the lines of “It was wrong of me to say what I said. No one deserves to be spoken of poorly behind their backs, and I regret doing so. Please do not define your perspective of this person by my words.”
Further, ask whomever heard you gossip not to repeat what you said. Point out something like ""It was wrong of me to say what I said, and I sincerely hope you choose not to repeat it.""
If you lied or embellished something, stress that what you said was not only inappropriate, but dishonest or inaccurate.;
, Ideally, you can speak with someone before they hear the gossip you’ve spread. Either way, you need to reach out to them as soon as possible. Ask if you can meet to talk, and propose to meet someplace where you'll have privacy.Concern about getting caught should not be the reason you reach out or apologize.
Rather, your contact should be guided by genuinely apologetic sentiments, and your recognition of the potential hurtfulness you may have caused.

, An honest apology will help diminish the potential hurtfulness of your gossip, as well as the damage to your relationship with the person you gossiped about. Secondarily, you will help resolve your own feelings of guilt by acknowledging your wrongdoing. Most importantly, be straightforward when apologizing.Say something like, “I wanted to let you know that I said something negative about you the other day, and I feel terribly about it because it doesn’t reflect how I actually feel about you.”
If they ask questions, answer them honestly. Don’t try to downplay what you said.

, Don’t make excuses or try to assign some of the responsibility for the gossiping that occurred to someone else. If you participated, you need to take responsibility for doing so. Furthermore, don’t try to rationalize what you did. You violated someone’s trust, and you need to acknowledge that outright, without qualification.Be clear about how you’re feeling; “I know I violated your trust, and I hope I can earn it back.”

, After stating a clear and honest apology, just listen. Understand that they will likely be hurt, and potentially surprised to hear what you’ve told them. They may not know what to say, or they may become angry or otherwise emotionally upset. If they're so angry or upset that they shut you out, give them space.Consider how you would feel if the situation were reversed.
If they don’t have much to say, or become upset, reiterate your apology.
Say something like “I’m really sorry, and I hope I have to chance to repair any damage I’ve done to our relationship. I understand why you’re upset, and am happy to give you space in the meantime.”

Reach out to connect.,
Ask to be heard.,
Discuss the issue.,
Apologize for your contribution.,
Accept the apology.If you have discussed the situation and the person has extended a sincere apology, then accept it.,
Show your willingness to move on.",How to Forgive1," As life gets busy, it is difficult to stay in touch with friends. When a conflict has occurred to push people apart, that connection becomes even harder to salvage. If you want to forgive someone, then take the first step in the process by reaching out. This act alone will help you to feel more open and optimistic.


It is always difficult to take the first step, and sometimes you need to give yourself a push. Simply tell yourself, ""Here we go,"" and pick up the phone and make contact.;
, Whether you decide to set up a face-to-face meeting with the person, or communicate via telephone or electronic device, the goal is the same: ask the person for time to express your thoughts and feelings about the conflict.


Assure the person that you are open and willing to hear what she has to say as well. This will allow the person to feel more open about the forthcoming discussion.
If the person refuses to meet with you, do not despair. There are things you can do to move toward forgiveness regardless of whether the person complies. The act of forgiveness is designed to help you in the end. For example, use writing instead of direct contact to express your feelings and thoughts about the person. Writing in a journal helps to process your feelings and is effective.Journaling can help reduce anxiety and stress, as it is a healthy outlet for confusing or overwhelming emotions., Some discussions in life are harder to have than others. When a conflict has occurred and negative feelings have grown, it is difficult to start the conversation. The goal would be to frame the conversation and guide it toward a peaceful resolution to manage the hurt and disappointment you are feeling.First, thank the person for meeting with you.
Second, tell the person your goal is to hear each other’s side of the story and come to some peaceful resolution so you both can move on.
Third, provide the details of your story including how you felt and what you thought.
Fourth, ask the person if there is anything else you can clarify for him before he provides the details of his side of the story.
Fifth, ask the person questions that will give you the necessary information to understand his intent, motives, thoughts and feelings.

, Most every conflict involves a misunderstanding or misconception of what someone did or said. There are things that you must do to loosen the tension in the situation. Taking responsibility for your role is an act that fosters the open communication that you want, and is necessary to reach a resolution., Even if you have to force yourself to say the words, “I accept your apology,” this is a large step toward creating a sense of forgiveness for yourself.


Accepting an apology can be difficult. If you are making your best effort to forgive someone, you can say, “I accept your apology and I am working toward forgiving you, but it’s going to take time.”

, If you must or want to maintain a relationship with this person, then your behaviors must demonstrate that you are serious. Your relationship will improve when you go through the process of forgiveness.This includes not holding grudges and bringing up the past.It also includes your willingness to laugh and be lighthearted around the person. Moving past a conflict is a huge relief. Let that motivate your actions toward being fair-minded and resolved.


As time passes and progress is made, you may notice you are still allowing feelings of betrayal to affect the way you treat the person. Perhaps it happens during heated arguments or discussions. You may not have processed your hurt feelings and still have some work to do. This is a normal reaction and can be managed by talking about your feelings with the person involved, or someone else.

Ask how you can improve the situation.,
Consider your words before you speak.,
Encourage positivity.",How to Overcome the Guilt of Gossiping About Someone Who Trusts You2," If you gossiped about a friend and have been struggling to rebuild your friendship, approach them again with an offer to address any outstanding issues. Similarly, if you and a colleague haven’t been able to get back on good terms, reach out to them. If they are still harboring injured feelings, it may help to reiterate your regret about previous issues. However, if some time has passed, try to focus on moving forward as friends, or simply working together cooperatively. At some point when you have privacy together, say something like “I hope there’s not still any negativity between us. It feels like there might be, and I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to regain your trust?”

, Take time to think about what you want to say before you say it. There’s nothing worse than doing something you’re feeling bad about all over again. Prevent this by recognizing when you’re speaking about someone else unnecessarily, even if you’re not saying anything negative.If possible, evaluate most of what you say before saying it, by asking yourself: Is what I’m about to say true? It is worth saying? Is it kind? You’ll likely notice yourself saying a lot less generally, and will stop gossip well before it leaves your mouth.
Especially in the context of group discussions, take a minute before chiming in to think about what you might want to add.

, A great way to get over feeling guilty about doing something negative is doing more of the opposite. In fact, try engaging in some intentionally positive “gossip.” When someone does something that impresses you or is worthy of recognition, spread the news around. Even when simple, positivity goes a long way.Say things to friends and co-workers like, “Hey, did you hear that Gary kicked a home run in every kickball game so far this season!?”
Similarly: “Becky has really been going above and beyond the last few weeks. If you’ve noticed too, make a point to thank her for effort next time you cross her path.”

Ask yourself why you gossiped.,
Determine whether it was personal.,
Deal with the reason why you gossiped.,
Address personal insecurities.,
See a mental health professional.",How to Overcome the Guilt of Gossiping About Someone Who Trusts You3," You said something unnecessary, disrespectful, and potentially hurtful, and you know you shouldn’t have. Whether it was accidental or intentional, there’s a reason you feel guilty. To help identify why you said something negative – and to prepare to give an honest apology – think about how you feel about the person you spoke poorly about.


Was there a specific thing that the person you gossiped about did recently that you didn’t like? Are you angry or annoyed with them for any reason?
Is this the first time you’ve spoken about them negatively, or has this happened before?
If you’ve spoken poorly of this person before, recognize that your behavior may indicate negative feelings towards them that you should address.

, While the gossiping you took part in may “mostly” have been an accident, feelings of guilt may indicate that there may be more to the story. Of course, maybe you simply spoke without thinking, or something “just slipped out.” Determine whether or not you were intentionally attacking someone, or just failed to think before you spoke to determine how to go about overcoming your guilt.Be honest with yourself. You likely already know whether you were intentionally trying to disparage someone’s image. If this is the case, you need to address either your own feelings about this person or the relationship you have with them.
If you truly do not harbor animosity towards the person you gossiped about, you may have simply been trying to “fit in.” Another source of gossip is the temptation to share information that will get you attention. If this may be why you’re saying negative things about other people, the issues you need to address are more personal.

, To overcome your guilt and prevent yourself from potentially gossiping again, you need to deal with why you gossiped and do something about it. If it may have stemmed from how you feel about the person you spoke poorly about, you’ll need to work to improve your relationship with them.Feeling resentment towards the person not only increases the chance that you might engage in further gossip, it can also cause you frustration until you resolve these feelings. Try to identify the reason why you said what you did. For example, do you really dislike the person? If so, why? Were you feeling jealous? Do you disagree with the person on certain things?
To overcome negative feelings about what happened, try talking to the person about why you said what you did. For example, you might say something like, “I think I said that about you because I was feeling jealous of your recent promotion.”

, Everyone wants to seem interesting and intriguing to those they interact with, especially those they want to impress. These desires strongly affect how we act around other people. However, if you wind up regretting things – such as gossiping – you’ve done to get attention, insecurity may be negatively affecting your behavior.In other words, you may be gossiping for the sake of impressing or amusing others – potentially without even realizing it.
Lots of people struggle to develop and maintain self-confidence, and almost everyone falters from time to time. However, don’t let insecurities continue to affect your behavior. Set up a time to meet with a therapist soon.

, If you still feel guilty, you should see a mental health professional to address any residual negative feelings. In particular, you may need to talk about how you can forgive yourself. In some cases, consulting with a professional may be necessary in order to identify the root cause of your feelings, as well as the potential steps to regain a positive sense of yourself and your place in the world."

Practice empathy and compassion.Both empathy and compassion can be learned.,

Shift your thoughts from resentful to grateful.,
Make a list of the benefits of letting go of resentment.,
Don't give up trying.,

Diffuse your anger.,
Rebuild trust.,
Appreciate the learning experiences.",How to Forgive2," As with any new skill, you need to practice. If you are able to treat people the way you would like to be treated, you are more than half-way there.


Take the opportunity to practice compassion when out in public. If you see someone struggling getting into the doorway of a store, rush to open it. If you see someone that looks like she is having a bad day, smile and say hello. Your goal is to allow others to feel the impact of your good deeds.
Expand your empathy by talking and, most importantly, listening to people outside your social circle. Try to strike up a conversation with a stranger once a week. Go beyond small talk and try to (respectfully) inquire about their lives and experiences. This will broaden your worldview and help you become more understanding of others., Fear, insecurities and an inability to communicate are the impetus of many hurtful behaviors. Some people don’t understand why they act certain ways because they have not explored the deeper inner-workings of their own behavior. This does not excuse the person’s actions.


You must tell yourself that you are not responsible to help or make this person evolve into a fully developed human being. Wish the person well and do not let it prevent you from moving on toward forgiveness.
Make an effort to understand what happened and why the person acted the way he did. You can do this by discussing the matter with the person, or someone you trust. Also, go online or to a bookstore or library to research the subject. Information is power and learning about the underlying motives of human behavior is interesting.

, You have probably been holding strong beliefs about a situation in which you were wronged by someone. Many times a person’s perspective is askew and needs to return to a balanced state. It is important to keep things in perspective, especially if yours is causing you harm.


For example, if the conflict is occupying your thoughts on a regular basis, then it is taking up too much of your time. Questions like: In comparison with a serious life or death situation, is this issue really that big of a deal? Is this matter worthy of taking all my time, which is robbing me of time I could be spending enjoying my life? Think about your answers and make a decision to shift your perspective and not allow the conflict to consume you.
You might be avoiding social situations with people you enjoy because you do not want to see a person who betrayed or hurt you. This perspective is hindering your involvement with people you enjoy, which robs you of a positive experience. Be brave and accept invitations to attend. You don’t have to talk to the person while you are there; but if you do cross paths be civil and refrain from lengthy discussions.

, It is true that resentment only harms you because you are the one harboring the negative feelings toward another person. To combat feelings of resentment, shift them to feelings of gratitude. The higher amounts of gratitude you have will decrease feelings of resentment. Your reward will be an improvement to your mood, which will likely be appreciated by others.Asking yourself the following questions will help shift your thoughts and result in you feeling less resentful:


How do I feel when I think negatively about this person?
Do I want to hurt myself?
Can my thoughts alone hurt the person?
Your answers were likely: bad, no and no. Use your answers to form a more grateful response: I deserve to feel positive feelings, take care of myself in a positive way, and keep myself safe from harm.

, Let go of what is holding you back. Some people learn to hold on to resentment and the role of the victim and allow it to influence many parts of their lives. These people believe that they are the victims of other people’s actions, even when there is evidence to the contrary.


Question yourself if you are that type of person. If the answer is yes, then you can un-learn this behavior.
Letting go of feelings associated with a conflict involves identifying a negative feeling, then examining the benefits you would experience if you were free of that negative feeling. For example, you would feel free, light, relieved, able to focus on good things, able to stop holding on to resentment, able to feel like your life is back on track. The goal is to show yourself with an overwhelming amount of evidence that your life will be better if you let go and move on.

, If you try to let something go and it continues to eat at you, then you likely need to process more feelings about the situation. This may include talking with a trusted friend or family member, writing, or going for a hike to physically work out your emotions.


It can be upsetting if someone tells you to, “just let it go” if you haven’t reached a level of resolve about the matter. Take a deep breath and say, “I’m working on letting it go, but I’m not there yet.”

, You can learn to let go by rediscovering your playful side. When you play it allows you to be free from the negative thoughts you harbor about a conflict.


For example, you could go to the beach and fly a kite. It would require you to pay close attention and will give you a sense of fun and accomplishment when you launch it and make it fly. It provides an excellent distraction that will allow you to look at the situation differently. As they say: laughter is the best medicine. Play and laughter will help you remain positive and optimistic through difficult situations.Schedule time in your calendar at least once a week to play and have fun.

, Remaining in a state of anger and upset is unhealthy. Processing feelings of anger through physical activity or artistic expression are good alternatives for reducing anger, stress and anxiety. Anger must be released to move you toward feeling forgiveness.


Consider running, hiking or lifting weights to expend the energy you have pent up over the issue. The physical exercising of your body will help blood flow and increase endorphins that increase feelings of pleasure and lessen pain.Meditate by yourself or in a group. Meditation has been used for centuries by many cultures to overcome negative thoughts that may be causing your to be angry, and cultivate positive ones.Creating a painting, sculpture or digital work of art might be just the right thing to shift your focus toward creating art that allows you to process your anger., When we let others into our lives we take a risk. Those same people can betray the trust that you have built together. An essential part of the forgiveness process is allowing someone to earn back your trust.


Allow the person to show you they are reliable, truthful, and sincere. Create opportunities for the person to show you. When you give a little, you may receive many positive rewards in return.
For example, consider accepting his invitation to go to the movies. This allows the person the opportunity to show up on time, treat you with respect and have a good time. Without your willingness to accept his invitation, you would not be witness to his sincere efforts to earn your trust.
If the betrayal has to do with lying about where he went, suggest that he check in with you via text or call you to let you know where he is.
Remember to acknowledge when someone is making an effort to earn your trust. Consider telling him you appreciate every effort.

, People and opportunities come into your life to teach you something. Each experience prepares us to be smarter and more in tune with what we want out of life. We learn from the good and the bad.


Sit down and make a list of the things you learned from the situation you are processing. Perhaps you learned to not co-sign for a loan for a friend who has a history of poor financial habits. You may have learned that some people would rather party than pay rent; or that roommates can be slobs and ruin any opportunity to get a cleaning deposit back from the property owner.
Don’t forget to write about all the positive things that happened. It is easy to see only the negative when we are in the midst of all the pain; but no situation is all bad. Perhaps you learned to interview potential roommates to ensure they share the same study habits and housekeeping skills. This will help you have a more peaceful living situation in the future.

Find a therapist.,
Set therapeutic goals for yourself.,
Enhance your support system.,
Forgive and accept yourself.",How to Forgive3," If you are having difficulty forgiving someone and it is impacting your life in a negative way, perhaps it is time to seek professional help from a counselor or therapist. Therapies intended to promote forgiveness have been successful in helping people overcome past hurts and achieve peace and resolution.Obtain a referral or suggestion from your physician, trusted family member or friend. However, if that is not feasible, contact your local department of mental health about counseling options.
If you feel you and your therapist are not a good fit, look for a different therapist. Every therapist is different and finding one with whom you feel comfortable is essential.
Look for a therapist who practices cognitive behavioral therapy.Your therapist will help examine and dispel the negative thought patterns that you have developed.
Consider spiritual counseling. Many people find comfort in seeking help from spiritual leaders who can guide them toward forgiveness. The power of prayer has been successful toward healing and alleviating feelings of guilt and shame, which are motivators for people seeking forgiveness for various reason., Commit to changing your behavior. In both psychotherapy and physical therapy, you will benefit from setting goals.Engage in the process by allowing yourself to be open and vulnerable. Don’t abandon the process just because it gets difficult. Your hard work will pay off and leave you with a healthy sense of accomplishment.


Identify your objectives. For example, would you like to feel more at peace toward a family member who betrayed you? Tell the therapist that this is one of your goals.
Reward yourself when you reach your goal. Your motivation will increase if you reward your accomplishments.Adjust your objectives rather than give up.
Continue to make new goals as it will keep you engaged in life.

, Surround yourself with people who care about you. This includes family, friends, and co-workers. Branch out and meet new people to expand your circle of support. You have learned so much through the therapeutic process that you feel resourceful and confident. A good support system will help you reduce stress and may even boost your immune system.Exploring your interests may lead to joining groups that allow you to meet new people, and experience new situations.

, Personal struggles can leave you feeling bad about yourself. You may feel guilty for not taking care of yourself in a situation or you unfairly blame yourself for what happened. You can learn to manage feelings of guilt and shame rather than try to eliminate them.


If you have chosen to participate in cognitive behavior therapy, it will help you examine your thoughts and develop new more effective ways of thinking about yourself."

Accept what you cannot change.",How to Become Positive Through Forgiveness," Forgiveness is a choice you must make consciously. If someone has wronged or hurt you, the bad feelings may fade with time. However, if you do not actively engage with feelings of resentment, they may remain present long term. To begin reaching a place of forgiveness, decide to forgive.Think about why you want to forgive. Remind yourself that you want to be more positive, understanding, and compassionate. Think about all the energy that goes into holding onto resentments. For example, maybe you're angry at a co-worker you used to be friend with and it's taking away a lot of your energy at work.
Then, decide you are going to forgive. Keep in mind it may not be easy, and at times you will struggle. However, it's important to make this choice to begin your journey. For example, decide you're going to forgive your co-worker for the sake of your own sanity.;
, You do not need to send this letter unless you're planning to actively repair a broken relationship. However, many people find it helpful to write out a letter forgiving those who have hurt them. Getting your words out of your head can help you abandoned negativity and move forward.Begin the letter by stating you are forgiving someone. For example, ""I forgive you for everything you have done to hurt me.""
From there, write out everything you're still mad about. Get into specifics about what the person did and how it made you feel. For instance, ""For a long time, I was angry that you left me for someone else.""
End the letter wishing the person well.
If you want, you can send it to the offending party. However, the act in and of itself can be cathartic. Unless you genuinely want to reestablish a connection with someone, you do not need to send your letter.

, You cannot always control someone else's behavior or actions, or whether another person changes. If you want to become positive through forgiveness, you need to focus on changing your own mentality. Forgive yourself for holding onto to resentment and feelings of anger. This will help you feel more compassionate to those around you.You want to take power over your emotional life through forgiveness. If you're struggling to forgive someone else for causing you pain, shift focus. Think about how to approach forgiveness from a place of self-compassion.
For example, think things like, ""I forgive you for reminding me I feel unimportant. I know that I deserve positive treatment.""

, If you're comfortable reaching out to someone who has wronged you, it's worth it to reach out to that person. Telling someone how they hurt you, and how it made you feel, can help you feel a sense of closure. The person may also offer an apology, which can help greatly with your ability to forgive.Tell someone directly how they hurt you and why it's bothering you. For example, ""When you cheated on me, it made me feel less valuable as a person. It's affected my ability to have healthy relationships.""
Listen to what that person has to say. They may offer an apology or insight that can help you empathize and forgive.
If you're not comfortable talking face-to-face, you can always send the letter you wrote.

, Frustration can lead to negative thoughts and feelings. Do not pressure yourself to fully forgive before you're ready. Accept there may be some negative thoughts for a long time, and you're not going to be perfectly positive overnight. Try to give yourself a break and take the time you need to forgive.For example, you start trying to forgive your mother for a fight just after it happened. Do not expect feelings of forgiveness will occur instantaneously just because you want to forgive her. It may be months before negative emotions pass by.

, You will not be able to forgive overnight, and at times you may feel frustrated, upset, or angry. When you run into a common roadblock to forgiveness, cope with it accordingly.Think about times you have hurt someone, and remember how they've forgiven you. This can make you more eager to forgive others.
Accept forgiveness is a long process. Remember that it's going to take time, and this is normal.

, Sometimes, motivating yourself can help you sustain the energy to become more positive. If you're struggling to let go of a grudge, remind yourself of its negative effects. This will make you more enthusiastic about abandoning grudges.Grudges can make you angry and bitter. You may go into new relationships with a negative attitude, affecting your ability to meet new people and make new friends.
You may be unable to enjoy the present if your mind is preoccupied with past grudges.
Grudges can also cause you to become depressed and anxious.

, If you're unable to stop negative feelings about someone, try to approach the situation from a place of empathy. Pause and reflect on the person's behavior. Why did they behave the way they did? While it's okay to be hurt by someone, and you should be able to express this, it can help you forgive them and feel more positive if you understand their perspective.For example, maybe a friend was not being reliable for a long time. They never returned phone calls and missed many major events in your life.
Think about that friend's circumstances at the time. Maybe they were going through a rough time and we're struggling to maintain relationships. Perhaps, in a similar situation, you also would have reacted negatively.

, Part of being a more positive person is feeling better about yourself. In addition to forgiving others, forgive yourself for your own flaws and imperfections.Everyone has past regrets. You may have treated someone poorly, missed an opportunity, or made another regrettable decision or action.
Try not to dwell on such things. When thoughts of past regrets creep in, think something along the lines of, ""I made the best decision for myself at time.""

, When you experience negative thoughts about another person, do not try to push them away. If you're actively trying not to think about something, you will only end up thinking about it more. Instead, acknowledge how you're feeling and then let it go.If you feel something negative, place a name on the thought. For example, ""Right now, I'm feeling angry at my dad.""
Then, allow the thought to pass by without lingering on it. Remind yourself that, while you cannot necessarily control the thoughts you experience, you do not have to engage with them.

, If you experience a negative thought, find a positive thought to replace it. It's normal to have certain resentments in life, and it can help to actively engage with them by looking for a silver lining.For example, you think something like, ""I am angry at my dad for not calling me on my birthday.""
Replace this with a positive thought. For example, think something like, ""It's good to experience these feelings because they help the two of us work through our issues together.""

, Loving-kindness meditation can help you feel more positive and forgiving to those around you. To start, find a quiet place and sit in a position that's comfortable for you. Imagine a variety of people who love and care about you. Picture them standing on all sides wishing you well.From there, send those good feelings outward. Picture several people that you live and wish good things for them. Think things like, ""I wish you love. I wish you happiness.""
Then, picture neutral people. These are people you do not know well or have strong feelings about either way, like a co-worker or a grocery store clerk. Think similar positive thoughts about them.
Last, picture someone who has wronged or hurt you. Wish them the same good thoughts, even though you may have negative feelings about them.

, At the end of the day, the only thing you can change is your own mentality. You cannot force others to change. Do not think of forgiveness as a means to help someone else better themselves. Think of it as a way to better yourself and learn to be kinder and more compassionate."

If you are in a situation where you feel pressured to contribute in a group setting, then ask for space. Try saying something like, ""There are a lot of great ideas in this meeting. I'm going to think them over on my own for a bit and give my input at the end of the day.""
Plan on having some alone time before and after you have a group activity to allow yourself to decompress.;
, If you are surrounded by people, it will be necessary for you to speak up in order to manage stress and overwhelm. Some introverts may be able to relate to your unique needs. However, not everyone—introverts and extroverts included—will understand how you function at your best. That’s why you have to tell them.If a parent, coworker, or friend is overwhelming you or making your stress worse, say “I really need to be alone right now so I can think” or “I’d appreciate it if you gave me some time to collect my thoughts.”

, For example, at work you might go outside, to a bathroom, or into an empty office. When you start feeling stressed out, get some distance from your usual environment and the people in it that may be contributing to your stress.


If you are at work or school, go in an empty office or class room, plug in your headphone and do some deep breathing exercises.
If you are at home, you sanctuary may be in your bed or snuggled up on the couch with your dog. Retreat to this place for a short while and recharge.

, In the age of technology, everyone is connected around the clock. If this nonstop connection of emails, app notifications, and social media friend requests is contributing to your stress, take a break from it for a few hours or a few days. There are a host of benefits that come with unplugging from technology.


These benefits include getting better sleep, feeling more present in the moment, reducing pain symptoms, increasing productivity, and improving memory retention and mood.If you've never unplugged before, simply choose a full day or a few hours to do it. Let's say you start on Saturday at 8pm and unplug until Sunday at 8pm. Let friends and family know what you are doing in advance so that they don't worry when you don't answer calls or texts.

, Get away with just your thoughts by escaping into the natural world. Being outdoors can provide much-needed healing and quiet from the over-stimulation you may receive in the modern world. Go for a hike. Sit out near the lake. Take your dog walking around the neighborhood for some fresh air.


Research shows that your mood is significantly benefited by spending time in nature. Studies have shown that people who are depressed, stressed, or anxious transform into states of calm and balance after regularly being in natural environments.So, maximize from these benefits by scheduling in a weekly nature break to fend off stress before it gets out of control.

, Are you suffering from chronic stress and could really use an extended period to rest and rejuvenate? Get some R&R by traveling on your own. If you enjoy going to new places and experiencing new environments, you will likely feel replenished by getting away from it all and going on a solo adventure.


Book a flight to a faraway destination that you’ve always wanted to go to but didn’t because friends or family weren’t interested. Or, gas up your vehicle and go on a road trip to see various major landmarks.
Just be sure to use safe practices when traveling alone, such as not venturing too far away from your hotel at night, not exposing your cash, and listening to your gut when someone makes you uncomfortable.Millions of people travel the world alone each year—so can you!

, Deep breathing is an easy-to-do relaxation technique that counteracts the body's stress response. By controlling your breaths, you naturally offset feelings of stress or anxiety and feel more calm. Try the 4-7-8 approach to deep breathing.To practice this approach, sit down comfortably in a quiet room. Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose, noticing the hand on your abdomen rising. The hand on your chest should remain relatively still. Hold the breath for 7 counts and then exhale for 8 counts. The hand on your abdomen should slowly deflate with your belly. Repeat the entire process several times for best results.

, It offers a wide range of mental health benefits, including helping you understand your thoughts and feelings better as well as giving you an outlet to identify problems and brainstorm solutions. Some introverts may not be as likely to go to friends or family for advice, so a journal acts as a personal confidant and sounding board.


Grab a notebook and pen and start by venting your frustrations on the page. After you have unloaded most of your worries, go back and read over what you wrote. Do you see any patterns of repeating issues or sources of concern? If so, take a minute to write out a few ways you can address these issues moving forward.

, A fun and interesting way to relieve stress is by turning on some of your favorite music. Music does wonders for the emotions and the physical condition. Studies show that choosing music that you find relaxing is an easy and highly accessible way to manage stress.Research tells us that certain types of music are especially helpful with relaxation. Go for Celtic, Native American, Indian stringed-instruments, drums, flutes, and sounds of nature like rain or thunder mixed with light jazz or classical music. However, don’t feel limited by these options; you can select any sort of tunes that feel soothing to you.

, Meditation offers long-term protection against stress and relieves acute stress, too. There are a variety of ways to practice this technique. You can repeat a mantra or chant, you can sit in complete silence, or you can radiate positive feelings out towards someone in particular or the universe as a whole.To practice basic meditation, choose a place to go where you can sit quietly without distractions for 10-20 minutes. Sit in on the floor on a cushion with your legs crossed. Rest your hands on your thighs. Take several deep, cleansing breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Now, close your eyes or rest them on a point in the room about 10 feet ahead of you. Focus on your breathing as you inhale and exhale gently. Try to clear your mind of any competing thoughts. When your mind wanders, avoid judging or criticizing yourself and merely re-focus your attention on your breath.

, Adequate rest is incredibly vital to mental health and well-being. However, it can be easier said than done when you are dealing with stress. Being stressed out can make it hard to sleep, and not sleeping can worsen the effects of stress.Aim for 7 to 9 hours of shut-eye each night. Increase your chances of getting quality sleep by:Going to bed and waking at the same time each day and night
Avoiding naps longer than 20 to 30 minutes
Shutting off electronic devices a few hours before bed
Avoiding caffeine in the hours before bed
Making the bedroom environment comfortable by lowering the temperature and dimming the lights

, If you find yourself caving to others’ demands on a regular basis, you may need to learn the art of boundary-setting. Boundaries are consequential to leading a healthy life with reduced stress, and they also are the foundation of healthy relationships.Think about what you want and whether your life circumstances are aligning with that. Listen to your thoughts regarding your relationships or work demands. Do you feel like you have too much responsibility? Do you find that others don't respect your need for personal space? Now, notice your feelings. Do you feel frustrated? Angry? Ignored? Use this information to guide on the types of boundaries you need to set.
Identify your limits. Recognize the actions and behaviors of those around you that make you uncomfortable or overwhelmed.
Communicate and enforce your limits. Let those around you know when they are violating your personal space or crossing a boundary. For example, if you asked your parents to give you advanced notice before visiting, point this out when they show up unannounced. Say, ""Mom? Dad? I like when you all come over to visit, but it would help me out if you could call first just so I have time to prepare. Can you do that for me?""

, If you must take part in an activity or event that drains you, follow steps to prepare yourself mentally and physically. When you do this, you decrease the odds of you having a stress meltdown, and build better coping mechanisms for difficult situations.For instance, if you are invited to a social gathering, ask if an understanding friend can join you there to keep you calm. Do deep breathing exercises in the days leading up to the event. Visit the location beforehand to feel comfortable with the environment.

, Introverts may feel stressed out when they have to constantly switch back and forth between dissimilar tasks. You may lose focus and require a great deal of time to return to full productivity. To minimize this issue, batch together similar tasks so that you don’t have to adjust to new demands.For example, if the dishes need washing, the mail needs sorting, the bills need paying, and the carpet needs vacuuming, put the paperwork tasks together and the cleaning tasks together. This allows you to boost productivity and increase your focus on the tasks at hand.

For example, you may start to have problems sleeping, notice changes in your appetite or weight, disengage from activities or friends, or not leave your home. Be aware of your feelings and how they affect you.Keep a journal to write how you feel. Write down any changes to your behavior or feelings and how you are coping with the stress.;
, After a tragedy, it’s easy to feel pessimistic and discouraged. However, keep a balanced attitude by recognizing that there are good people who want to help. Not everyone in the world is evil, greedy, or violent. Acknowledging balance can empower you to see the world around you more wholly and not narrowly through sad or angry eyes.Remind yourself of people or events that are comforting and meaningful to you. For example, reflect on the time a stranger helped you find your wallet or the way your grandma bakes you cookies when you’ve had a hard day.

, If the stress of violence is too much to handle, be careful not to take on additional stressors. If watching the news makes you anxious or fearful, don’t turn on the television. If driving or going shopping feels threatening, ask a friend to accompany you. Do what you can to feel safe and minimally stressed.If there’s someone who causes you stress or will increase your stress levels, spend time away from them during this time. If this is not possible, limit the time you spend with them or make it clear when you do not wish it discuss a topic. Say, “I need some time away from talking about this, please.”
If you begin to avoid leaving your house out of fear, such as by ordering groceries online because you are afraid to go to the grocery store or by making excuses why you can’t meet with friends, then seek professional help.

, If you don’t feel safe at certain locations, find places that make you feel safe and secure. For example, you may feel safe at your home or at a friend or family member’s home. Perhaps you feel safe at church, synagogue, or another religious or spiritual place. Find places where you feel secure and know that you can go there when you feel threatened or scared.


You can also have people to call when you feel unsafe. For example, if you feel scared, call a sibling, teacher, neighbor, or friend. Say, “This really scares me and I want to talk about it.”
If you want to feel safe yet don’t want to talk about the violence, say, “So much is happening and I feel really affected by it. I need a friend to help keep my mind off of things.” This can help you feel supported and less alone.

, While you cannot make mass violence go away, you can make adaptations on your behalf to tolerate the situation better.Focusing on violence and potential threats can make you feel overwhelmed, scared, and worried. While you may not be able to control the violence, you can control things within your own life.


Instead of focusing on what you cannot control, focus on what is within your control, such as what you eat, how you respond to people, and what action you take.
If you tend to turn to bad habits, focus on finding ways to cope with stress helpfully. For example, if you turn to alcohol, find an alcohol-free social activity to do with friends like a game night or movie night. (Make sure that your friends are aware of your desire to avoid alcohol and are not drinking themselves.) If you want to drown things out with television or video games, take a walk instead.

, Have people you trust to talk to about the experience and your stress. It’s also important to have times when you can connect with others and talk about things that don’t relate to violence. Have friends and family members who you know you can lean on in times of stress to talk to, cry with, and also distract you from troubles when you need it.Even if you don’t live near family or friends, write emails or make phone calls to stay connected. Being connected to others is important when you are under stress.

, If you’ve lost someone or are affected by a tragedy, take the time to grieve. Grieving looks different for everyone, so do what you need to do to cope with your loss effectively. You may want to surround yourself with friends or wish to spend some time alone. Whatever you do, honor your feelings and experience.If you’re having difficulty in your grieving process or feel like you can’t do it on your own, reach out for support. Ask friends or family members for help or reach out to a therapist. You can also get involved in a support group.

, If you suffer from an anxiety disorder, depression, or other mental health diagnoses, you may be more sensitive to external stressors. Stressors like mass violence can lead to worsening symptoms.If you have a history of mental health problems, be extra aware of how you feel and how you cope with the stressors around you.


Stay on any prescribed medication and continue treatment. Now is an important time to stay extra careful of your mental health. If you notice any changes in your symptoms, contact your medical or mental health provider.

, If you’re experiencing trauma, it can be beneficial to talk to a therapist. A therapist can provide you with a space to express yourself and share how you feel without feeling judged or shamed. Whatever stress the violence causes you, a therapist can help you learn to cope and relax more effectively.


If you’re struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a therapist can help you understand what you’re feeling and help you to work through your symptoms and trauma., It’s likely that you are not the only person affected by mass violence and that others feel stressed or worried about it, too. Connecting with other people can be helpful in sharing support for one another. Especially if you feel like you lack a social group or friends and family to support you, a support group can be helpful in building connections and feeling united with other people during difficult times.Look for a support group through a local mental health clinic, community center, or ask for recommendations from a friend or physician.

, Escaping stress through drugs and alcohol can bring immediate relief, but the long-term effects are often harmful. Drugs and alcohol may feel like an easy escape, yet stress will wait for you and come back at full force.If you’re feeling stressed around mass violence, find other outlets that do not include drugs or alcohol.

, One healthy outlet for stress is through a relaxation practice. For 30 minutes each day, find a quiet place to calm your mind and emotions. Let go of whatever is happening or has happened and focus on relaxation in both your mind and body. This can help lower stress, stabilize moods, and decrease depression.Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation. Get into a routine of practicing relaxation every day in order to cope with daily stressors and to reduce overall stress levels.

, When you feel overwhelmed or like stress is getting you down, focus on something that brings you gratitude. Reflect on things, people, or experiences that you appreciate in your life. Especially if you feel hopeless, practicing gratitude can give you a different perspective.When you’re feeling down or discouraged, change your thoughts to something you are grateful for, even if it’s something small. Focus on the food you have to eat or the sound of birds outside.
Get in the habit of writing in a gratitude journal daily to highlight the positive things in your life.

, While exercise may be the furthest thing from your mind during times of stress and violence, it can help you manage stress and feel better. Exercise can help you to relax and relieve tension in your body. It can also help your mind to think more clearly and more positively.Go for a run or a hike, or if you’re scared to go outside, do some exercise at home. Put on some music and dance to it, or do an at-home workout with some weights.

, Keeping your body and mind healthy is a great way to resist stress and stay healthy. Eat a healthy and balanced diet and don’t skip meals. Avoid turning to sugar or caffeine as a comfort as these can make you crash in both your mood and your energy. Reducing and minimizing sugar and caffeine intake can help you sleep better and feel more relaxed.Do your best to engage in healthy sleep habits such as avoiding screens around bedtime and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Not getting enough sleep can lead to irritability and a drop in the ability to think clearly.

Draw an outline of a doll on a sheet of paper with a sharp pencil and cut it out.,

Pin the right sides of the 2 doll fabric pieces together with sewing pins.,
Sew the 2 doll fabric pieces together, using a thread that matches the fabric.,
Reach inside the open side of the fabric dolls and stuff the doll with your fabric stuffing.. Like the shape and colour, the stuffing can also make your stress doll better to use - if you're a kicker or a puncher, soft, squashy material will work for you - a squeezer might prefer uncooked rice so the doll feels grainy.,
Stitch the opening closed.",How to Make a Stress Doll," This will be your pattern. When drawing your outline, think about things that will make your stress doll easier to use. It may be helpful to consider that:


Larger dolls are easier to use, because they're better for punching or just squeezing like a stress ball.
Making the shape of your doll very simple can help - rather than making a detailed and precise sketch, try to make the doll round shaped or long, making it easier to use so that various bits and bobs of the doll don't get in your way.;
, Remember that the fabric you use can be symbolic and helpful, rather than just anything. For example, fabric in a calming color, such as blue, may help you remember that things will settle eventually. Or you can use a more violent colour such as red, to help get rid of the anger and stress and so you feel like the doll means something. You can also cut the 2 sides of the doll out in different colours, so one side may be an angry/stressful colour, and then the next side calm, so that you can use the angry side and then the peaceful.

, Check for any inaccuracies in your cutting or overall shape and fix them quickly. When pinning, be sure to line the edges up carefully.

, Remove any pins that you come across as you are sewing. Leave a small section, at least 1-inch long, open.

, Make sure that you stuff the doll well, but are able to sew up the side.

, If you want, you can draw a face or other features on your doll or just leave it blank. Remember that no design is right or wrong - all that matters is that the doll works for you.

Work on strategies to tackle stress triggers.,
Develop good time management.,
Don’t think you have to do it all alone.,
Understand that there is no silver bullet.",How to Live a Stress Free Lifestyle1," You need to take stock of your stress in order to make changes in your life that lower it and can help you to handle it more effectively. Spend some time monitoring your stress levels and note down how often you feel yourself becoming stressed over a week. Of course the amount of stress you experience will fluctuate depending on what is happening in your life, but monitoring your stress over an initial set period is a good way to get you started thinking about it.


Signs of stress include raised heart rate and sweating, as well as tightness in muscles, headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath.If you feel these signs think about what has caused this reaction.;
, Once you have begun to monitor and pay attention to your stress levels you need to try to identify specific stress triggers. Stress can come from many places. What triggers your stress? Your job? Your relationships? Your finances? Your children? Pinpointing where your stress is coming from is the first step toward dealing with it.As well as the obvious negative events, positive things in your life like getting married or buying a house can trigger stress.Once you have identified these, map them out on paper so you can visualize your stress points.
You might like to separate them out into short-term and long-term factors.

, Once you’ve identified the sources of your stress, you can start trying to deal with the problems. Begin by identifying what aspect of the event or trigger you can control and focus in on what you can affect. A common cause of stress is simply piling up obligations and tasks that leave you with little time to relax or get some relief.You can tackle this by cutting down on your commitments and deciding which you really want to give time to. You can rank them according to importance.Look through your schedule and mark ones that you can step back from in order to give yourself more time to relax and have fun.

, As you scale back your commitments, take this opportunity to organize your time more and book in gaps where you don’t have to be somewhere or do something. Here you will get a clearer picture of what exactly you want to spend your time doing, which will be beneficial to you more broadly. Don’t be afraid to delegate or defer tasks.Plan out your time, but keep some flexibility. Having a time plan that is too rigid can heighten your stress.
Leaving empty spaces in your schedule will give an opportunity to relax. Even half an hour or your own in the evening can help., If you are suffering from stress and anxiety don’t think you have to endure it on your own and just battle through. Try talking to a trusted friend or family member about how you are feeling. Communication is very important and it can help you release tension. You don’t have to sit down for a serious conversation and spill your innermost secrets.Just venting about things that are stressful can ease the pressure.
If you think it could be helpful to talk to a professional, consider contacting a qualified counsellor or therapist. Sometimes it’s easier to talk to a stranger., Monitoring your stress levels, finding your stress triggers and beginning to take action tackle them can all help you to lower your stress over time. There are, however, no immediate perfect remedies to a stressful lifestyle. Try to incorporate these practices while keeping a sense of humour about the trials and tribulations of modern life. Seeing the funny side can be a big help that makes you more resilient to the inevitable setbacks."

Try out some meditation.,
Do some relaxed deep breathing.,
Attempt deep muscle relaxation.",How to Live a Stress Free Lifestyle4," As well as making improvements to your general lifestyle and cutting back on your commitments to secure some time for yourself, you can try some specific relaxation techniques to help you unwind. Meditation is an ancient practice that is aimed at calming your mind and helping you become at peace with yourself. Try just sitting quietly while being aware of your breathing.


As thoughts pop into you head, try to return your mind’s focus to your steady breathing.
Alternatively, focus on an object you have placed in front of you, or you could try to visualise something calming, like a gentle sea.You might find it hard at first but you will improve the more you practice meditation.

, If you find it hard to stick with the meditation you could practice some relaxed deep breathing. Sit in a comfortable chair which supports your head, or lie down flat with your palms up and your legs a little apart. Fill up your lungs without forcing them, breathing in through your nose. Count to five as you breathe in.


Breathe out through your mouth, slowly counting to five again. Repeat this with a regular and controlled rhythm.
Breathe without pausing or holding your breathe, and keep doing this until you feel calm and relaxed.
Try to do this for three to five minutes, two or three times daily., If you have some more time then you can try practicing a deep muscle relaxation session. This will take around twenty minutes and it stretches and relaxes different muscles which releases tension from your body and mind. Once you have a warm and quiet place, sit or lie down and concentrate on steady breathing. Going through each in turn you will release the tension from your face, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, legs, wrists and hands. Repeat each exercise a couple of times before moving on.


Begin by pushing together your eyebrows, as if you were frowning, hold for a few seconds and then release.
Next move onto the neck by gently tilting the head forward, with your chin down towards your chest, holding for a few seconds, before lifting your head back up.
Pull your shoulders up towards your ears, hold there, then relax them.
For your chest, breathe slowly and deeply into your diaphragm then breathe out slowly. Allow your belly to deflate as the air is exhaled.
Then stretch your arms away from your body, reaching forward and holding, before relaxing.
With your legs stretched out, push your toes away from your body, pull them back towards your body, and then relax.
Finally stretch your wrists by pulling your hand up towards you, stretching the fingers and thumbs and holding before relaxing."

Keep your argument to three main points.,
Move ahead.,
Avoid future issues.",How to Keep Composure," In many stressful situations, you might be tempted to perceive personal persecution or insult when none exists. For instance, sometimes at your place of employment, a coworker may make a decision that you disagree with or find to be inappropriate. However, do not take this as a personal affront to you but instead as a business decision. Assure yourself that everyone has their own ideas and that those ideas will inevitably be at odds with yours on occasion. Differing ideas are not necessarily meant as an insult against you.
Don’t allow your emotions to be manipulated or controlled by decisions made by others that are not personal.;
, Think about the times you have reacted because of a burst of emotion in the past. Ask yourself whether or not these bursts of emotions have ever truly made a bad situation better. More often than not, the answer is no.


Consider how your emotional outbursts usually go. Think of the rule, not the exception. Once or twice, throwing a fit may have made things better. As a general rule, though, reacting to a sudden burst of emotion will complicate things even more.

, When a person gets upset, it becomes easier to assume that those involved in the problem are behaving in the worst way possible, even before confirmation of that behavior is received. Oftentimes, however, the behaviors and motives you might be tempted to assume exist are not actually true, so you'll work yourself up for no real reason.Similarly, when one thing goes wrong, it's easy to assume that things will continue to go wrong. Making that assumption can cause you to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. You may create more problems simply by anticipating them.
For example, if you just went through a messy breakup, you might assume that all of your mutual friends will turn against you after hearing your ex's side of things. Your panic may cause you to distance yourself from those friends, and you may inadvertently cause the same sort of problems you were afraid of.

, Ask yourself what really has you feeling so upset. A certain situation may have acted as a trigger, but that trigger may not actually address the real problem. Only by identifying the real problem can you hope to solve things.


For instance, the trigger of your stress might be a last-minute assignment handed to you by an instructor or boss. The assignment itself might not be the source of your tension, though. You might be personally frustrated because the assignment cuts into time you wanted to spend with a loved one, or you might be professionally frustrated because your instructor or boss regularly puts unfair demands on you in this type of manner.Address the issue to avoid future problems. If these last minute assignments do frustrate you, have a talk with your boss about giving you more notice about deadlines.
Remember also that you CAN say no. You don’t want to make it a habit of saying no to your boss very often if your boss is the issue, but you can exercise that right occasionally, particularly if you have other plans.

, Keeping the stress and frustration inside of you will often cause you to maintain a high level of anxiety, making it impossible for you to maintain any real composure. One helpful way to vent is to call up a friend, relative, or trustworthy colleague and rant to that individual about your frustrations.

, Many people find it helpful to write down their frustrations in a list, poem or story. Take some time away from the situation to jot down the emotions you are feeling. If you are angry at a person, you could write them a letter, but do not send it. Just use this as a mechanism through which to express yourself.


Keep the letter or note out of sight, and consider destroying it once you feel calm.

, Ask yourself how an unrelated party might view the current issue or how you would view this issue if it were happening to someone else instead of you. Be honest, and use your conclusions to help guide your reactions.


For instance, if you are feeling upset because someone cut you off in traffic, take an impersonal approach. The person could be elderly or could have just received terrible news. Don’t assume their motivations were to bother you.
Also ask yourself how someone you admire might handle the same sort of situation. By thinking about how a role model will react, you can temper your own reactions and form yourself into the “you” you want to be.

, Breathe in through your nose slowly and exhale through your mouth. This increase in oxygen to your body will help to calm you so that you don’t react aggressively or inappropriately.


When you panic, your breathing automatically becomes shallower and more rapid. Intentionally slowing your breathing down and taking deeper breaths can reverse the panic response altogether., Physical stress can pile on top of situational stress, making you more likely to overreact to the situation in question. Get your mind off the situational stress and focus on fixing your physical stress for a few minutes through exercise. Take a few moments to do some exercises at your desk if you are at work.


You might also go for a walk.
If there is a gym at your work or nearby, consider setting up a membership there and going on your lunch break or before work. This is a great way to relieve tension regularly throughout the week.

, If you only have a few minutes, correct your physical ailments as best as possible by standing up, stretching slowly, and taking a short walk around your desk or room. Stretch muscles that are stiff from lack of activity and soothe muscles that are sore from too much activity., If you are feeling dehydrated or lightheaded, drink some water and have a snack. If it is nearing lunch time, get out of the office to go have lunch somewhere. You can go alone if you’d like to have time away from others to think or you can go with friends to vent.


Try to have healthy foods as they tend to improve your mood and give you more energy. Fast food makes you feel sluggish.

, Sometimes, the best thing to do in a hectic situation is simply to step away from it. Spend some times doing something you enjoy to get your mind off the problem you're facing. Doing so can change your overall mood and help you re-approach the problem from a calmer standpoint later on.


For instance, if you are stressed out because a coworker has said something offensive to you, you can say “excuse me for a moment” and head to the restroom or to your office to cool down.
Even a short break is better than none at all. If you can only afford to walk away for five minutes, then walk away for five minutes. If you can give yourself more time, then give yourself more time.
One option is to completely unplug yourself. Step away from your computer, put your phone on silent, and go somewhere to do an activity that has absolutely nothing to do with the digital world. Technology is great, but it keeps people so connected that it can feel difficult to escape unless you set it aside momentarily.
If you cannot break away, another option is to spend a few minutes on a website or digital activity that makes you happy., Spending too much time on unproductive activities can increase your stress. If you still don't feel that you've gathered your composure after taking a short break, spend a longer period of time working on something unrelated to your stress yet still productive.


This works especially well if you find something that you've been meaning to do, but have continued procrastinating on. Clean out your files. Organize your bedroom or office. Finish the book you started reading and never finished.

, Thinking about the things you're thankful for can lift your mood. The key is to focus on the actual sources of gratitude, not to make yourself feel guilty about the lack of gratitude you feel in the face of other difficulties.


Identify the things in your life that you are happy for--people, pets, a home, etc. Meditate on those sources of happiness for a few minutes. Maybe look at a picture of your family or your friends.

, Instead of thinking about all the bad consequences that come with a bad turn of events, think about all the possible good consequences that may develop from it. Consider your present difficulties as opportunities.


For example, if you just lost your job, your initial reaction will likely be steeped in fear about the future. Now might be a good time to think about the complaints you had regarding your old job and consider the fact that you no longer have to deal with those issues.
If you lost your job, now is also the time to start thinking about the possible courses of action you can pursue now that you no longer restricted by your old job.

, More specifically, think about how you will view this incident in the future. The things that threaten a person's peace of mind are often rather short-lived. When viewed in that light, it might be easier for you to devote less energy worrying about your problem.


If imagining yourself 5 or 10 years in the future seems difficult, think about yourself 5 or 10 years in the past. Consider the sources of stress that consumed you back then. Usually, you will be able to see that the things that seemed like such big deals back then no longer seem as important to you today.

, If you have have an issue with someone in your personal or professional life that has caused you stress, you should address it with them. Share your frustrations with them without ascribing blame. Keep your voice at a normal, unraised level and show them respect.You might say something like “It wasn’t cool the other day how you cut me off in the meeting. It feels like you do that a lot and I feel frustrated because I’m not able to share my ideas with you.”

, Though you may be a person who wears their heart on their sleeve, if you are hoping to remain composed, you must keep your face and body language in check. You can display aggression and anger simply by your expression and how you position your body. Instead, mirror gestures that are positive, open and inviting.Don’t have your arms crossed and don’t furrow your brow together or frown.
Sit instead with your arms in your lap or by your side. Keep a neutral facial expression, neither frowning nor smiling.

, You don’t want to bombard the person you are upset with with massive amounts of grievances. Instead, focus on a few key points that highlight why you were upset. If you overwhelm them, they’ll be less likely to respond positively and more likely to be defensive.For instance, if you feel upset with your partner after an argument, you might say something like “I wanted to talk about our fight. It really bothers me when you interrupt me when I’m speaking, try to shift blame to me, and insult me in fights. I don’t think it’s healthy and I’d like to proceed forward in a more constructive manner.”

, Once you've managed to regain your composure and sort out your feelings, the next thing to do is to press forward. This might mean trying to solve the problem, or it might mean walking away from the problem completely.


When rebounding into action, focus only on the things you have control over: your schedule, your actions, and your interactions. Don't fixate on things you can only wish might happen.
Look for practical solutions. Ask for a hectic deadline to be extended. Seek professional counseling if you're struggling with a difficult relationship or an addiction.

, Many issues that we have in life can be avoided. As far as it is possible with you, try to live a life that is peaceful and drama free. You will feel happier and less stressed. Do your part to create a drama free life!


For instance, if you have road rage on your commute to work in the mornings, you can try leaving a few minutes earlier so you have more time to get to work. Don’t sweat the small stuff!
Another potential issue that can possibly be avoided is coworker conflict. If you often get into arguments with a coworker who regularly interrupts you in staff meetings, you might pull them aside to have a discussion about it to avoid these issues in the future. You could also have a conversation with your supervisor who may be able to address the situation, as well.

This will allow you to plan your whereabouts and to know which areas need to be avoided if you wish to get around without being overly concerned.;
, Just because protests are taking place, that should not prevent you from carrying on with your social/work plans (except if the circumstances are truly extreme). Try to keep a plan B for everything; let that be the location of a social hangout and/or the route to take to get to your desired destination.

, If things get out of hand, or if you are simply too worried to take your chances when trying to get out to shop, keep a stock of the things you might need to survive, or even to host friends, such as food, bottled water, cell phone credit, and medication.

,, If you need transportation on a daily basis (finding a taxi or a bus can be stressful in Cairo), try to make a deal with a taxi driver. Pay him on weekly/monthly basis, depending on your income and needs. This way you will ensure you will not have to waste time every morning arguing about the cab fare.

, Have like-minded friends, wherever they come from. Local friends can also help you understand the culture a little better.

,, Save emergency numbers on your cell phone device, as well as on your computer. If you can hang them on your refrigerator, it is wise to keep the contact number of your cell phone network provider's customer service department, the nearest hospital, police station, and pharmacy. Almost all food places, even grocery shops, deliver here, so keep their numbers too, in case of emergency.

,, As soon as you arrive to Egypt, make it a priority to let the embassy know your name and your whereabouts. They could pass you some useful information and help in case of trouble.

, Egyptians are very friendly and welcoming, however, they are fiery. Try to keep calm and do not let anyone drag you into an argument. If the situation escalates, do not just walk away (as it is a sign of disrespect). Instead, say you are late for something or just a simple ""OK"" or ""whatever"" will do.

, Sign up for a yoga class, fitness class or join an expatriate club (the Maddi and Heliopolis areas are full of such clubs).

, Hold these on some Friday nights. It is best to invite friends, who live nearby, to a meal/drink at your place, instead of wondering around the streets of Cairo.

, Focus on the reason you are here. Whether you are studying or working, try to reach the goals you set for yourself. That can help to keep your mind off chaos.

Convince yourself of this truth: Right here and right now I am okay.",How to Make a Gratitude List," This is an important part of reflecting on the things that matter to you know and in an ongoing way. Too much focus on the past and the future can raise feelings of disappointment, anxiety and even fear. You don't want any of those sorts of feelings interrupting your thought flow when creating your mental gratitude list.;
, If you have a great memory, this could be in your head (in which case, it is a ""mental gratitude list""). However, many people prefer to document their list in some way, such as using a notebook, journal or vision board. Whatever you choose, make sure that it is something you will use and refer to regularly, so it must be easy to access.


You can decorate the item you store the gratitude list in if wished; doing this can be part of the process and helps to make it something you get joy from.

, Unlike a gratitude journal, a list is a short, punchy and easily read/remembered/viewed format. While a journal can include a list, it can also include lengthy paragraphs and essays, which the list format avoids. Always use bullet points, tables or some other form of listing that works for you and keeps the listed items short and to the point.

, For example: I can see, or I have a home.


You might like to tailor your gratitude list to particular roles in your life. For example: 10 Things to Be Grateful for as a Mom; 7 Things to Be Grateful for as a Colleague; 18 Things to Be Grateful for as a an Adult Child, and so on.
Be careful to avoid listing too many things that you ""own"". Objects can form part of the list but shouldn't be the bulk of it. Think about experiences, relationships, emotions, the world around you, the things that happen, etc. These are infinitely more rewarding than stuff.

, Once you think of one thing it becomes easier to think of other things to add to the list. You begin to realize that anxieties, worries, fears do not accurately describe your life; in fact, whatever is bothering or upsetting you is more accurately a much smaller thing when looked at within the whole, whether you know the source of the concerns you're experiencing, or not. Chances are too, that the source of the your worries can be perceived in such a way as to properly place them right-sized alongside other aspects of your life, many of which you are now grateful for.

, Or, you could make a video, an infographic, a chart, a poster, a 3-D model, a song, etc. However you wish to record this gratitude list, go with the flow. If it's to be a mental gratitude list, remember it as best you can, for easy recall when needed.

, There are tricks to staying grateful and grounded, and it may help you to include these triggers as part of your gratitude list recordings. These include:


Stay in the now. The moment is right now, your current experience matters.
Focus on what needs to be done today. Try to feel that you are doing everything possible today to prepare for anything that is to come. The key is to keep coming back to the day, to the hour, to the moment. It takes practice, but it works.
Try to be mindful of where you are and what is happening. If you are physically safe it is probable that right here, right now you are otherwise okay as well, barring illness or extreme circumstances. Anything else is in the future.
Tell yourself that in the moment, all is well. Imagining worst case scenarios is only helpful in as much as it causes you to be prepared rather than scared. In the moment, nothing in the future has happened yet. It is the truth. You might still have trouble ignoring the future, but you can admit this truth enough to breathe and concentrate on being grateful, which ultimately will help you face the future anyway.
Treat yourself with kindness, especially when you step out of your comfort zone.
When it seems as if everything is going wrong, allow yourself the time to step back and focus on what is going right.
Remind yourself often that gratitude is about being aware of what you have, not of what you do not have.

, If your list is in a tangible form, add things to make it more vibrant and fun to use. Even if you've made a mental gratitude list, you can stick up some Post-It notes around the house with some inspirational sayings or comments, to remind you of the importance of gratitude.

, This requires imagination and willingness to care for yourself (the list is the first self-care practice, the inclusion of acceptance is the second self-care practice). It takes practice, but with practice comes a lot of peace of mind. Non-illness related anxiety, worries or fears cannot live in the same mind with gratitude and acceptance. The peace is not forever; it comes when you can place yourself successfully in the moment. The key is, when you fall out of the moment, to do your best to bring your thoughts back into the moment. With practice, the time you spend with a more peaceful mind can last longer and longer. But the key is to keep coming back.

, Then, acceptance is simply the admission that everything is the way it is right now. You might wish you could change things, but if you truly cannot change things right now, then denial of the fact that you cannot causes emotional discord.


It might help to note that you don't have to like something to accept it. But acceptance is the answer to virtually any problem. Admittedly, this is a challenge, so work on it and keep referring back to your gratitude list.

, Practice. Accept that things are the way they are right now. You don't have to like it. Practice. Anxiety cannot live in the same mind as gratitude and acceptance; acceptance need not be rushed.

Or, maybe you don't know how to talk to the cute new boy that keeps catching your eye in geometry class. Think long and hard about what is causing your stress so that you can develop a strategy to overcome it.Sources of teen stress may include:


school work or demands
parents who are going through a separation or divorce
medical conditions
dealing with physical and emotional maturation
death of a family member or friend
learning disorders
moving to or transitioning to a new school
first experiences with dating and romantic relationships

, Share what's stressing you out with someone who cares about you. This can be your parents, a sibling, your best friend, or a school counselor. Sometimes, just talking things over can make you feel better about a stressful situation. This trusted person may be able to offer you good advice or a new perspective for looking at the stressful circumstance.If what's stressing you out is your home life, you may feel more comfortable discussing the matter with your friends or the school counselor. On the other hand, if the issue relates to school, it may be a good idea to talk things over with your parents, an older sibling, or the school counselor.

, If you feel hesitant to share your feelings with someone else, write it down in a journal or diary. Choose a notebook that you love and unload your thoughts and feelings on those pages. This diary/journal can serve as your confidant and a wonderful ""listener"" about topics you are not quite ready to share with others.


Set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to write down what you're thinking or feeling. Journaling can deliver many mental health benefits in addition to stress reduction, such as easing the symptoms of anxiety and depression., The Stress in America survey revealed that many teens experience stress levels that rival those experienced by adults.If you are a teen who's dealing with stress, you need a few techniques on hand that calm you down.


To practice deep breathing, lie on a couch or bed or sit with your back straight in a chair. Close your eyes. Begin breathing in deeply through your nose, slowly and fully as your stomach rises. Focus on each breath and how it feels. Then, exhale slowly from your mouth allowing your stomach to fall. Repeat this exercise as needed.

, You may not even notice the tension is there at first, but, over time, the tension may progress into muscle aches or pains.


To practice muscle relaxation, sit comfortably in a chair and allow yourself to breathe slowly and deeply. Starting at one end of your body, tense all the muscles in a muscle group. For example, contract your toes until they are clinched. Hold the contraction and notice how it feels. Then, suddenly release them and notice how it feels when you let go of the tension. Continue deep breathing, and move up to the next group of muscles.

, If one area in your life - or maybe many of them - seems to be overwhelming or frustrating, take a step back and do something you enjoy. We all need breaks to recenter us. Remove yourself from the stressful situation for awhile and take out time to have fun or just chill.


Listening to music, swimming at the local pool, reading a thrilling novel, seeing a movie with a group of friends, and lying around on the couch with your dog can all lift your spirits.

Control your breathing.,
Maintain a positive attitude.,
Be prepared.,
Get perspective on your situation.,
Take action to improve the situation.,
Take a break.",How to Handle Stressful Situations1," Rapid, shallow breathing is the body's natural response to stress. When you find yourself in a stressful situation, concentrate on slowing your breath, and breathing deeply. This will help calm your body's physiological response to stress, returning you to a more normal state.Counting slowly to 10 while breathing deeply is another tried-and-true method for reducing your physiological response to stress.;
, When we allow ourselves to become negative, thinking and speaking as if the worst is bound to happen, we increase our feelings of stress and anxiety. Focus instead on the possibility of positive outcomes, and think about how those outcomes might be achieved. You can use positive self-talk to reduce anxiety, and maintain positivity. Simply remind yourself, in your head or even out loud, when appropriate, that the situation you are in will pass, and that you are safe, and capable of handling yourself.
Remember that even when you have trouble controlling how you are thinking, you can still control your body language, and how you speak to others. Smile, make eye-contact, and speak calmly and positively.

, If you are anticipating a stressful situation in your near future, such as a presentation, performance, interview or examination, make sure you take plenty of time to prepare yourself. Preparing in advance will relieve pressure, and make it easier for you to be calm and focused.How you prepare will depend on the situation you're preparing for. Preparing for a presentation, for example, would include making a plan for the presentation, preparing the presentation itself, and rehearsing it, alone or with a friend, until you are comfortable delivering it.
Practicing visualization techniques can help you prepare emotionally for any stressful situation. Just take some time to breath deeply, and imagine yourself successfully navigating the situation with ease.

, Take a moment to step back from the situation, and evaluate just how important it really is in the grand scheme of things. Remind yourself that stressful situations pass, and are often not nearly as important as they seem while we are experiencing them.Think about the things which are really important in your life: your home, loved ones, dreams and goals, etc. Reminding yourself of what's really important can help you gain perspective on more banal worries like work- or school-related stress.
The way we respond to stress can seem quite humorous when we consider how unimportant the situation prompting the stress actually is. Feel free to laugh at the situation, and yourself, and share your sense of humor with those around you.

, Many people find themselves feeling paralyzed in moments of great stress, overwhelmed by the intensity and urgency of the situation. Remind yourself that you have the power to take control of your situation, then take steps to solve it, rather than complaining or simply trying to weather the storm.When stressed, be solutions-oriented. Rather than focusing on how stressful your current situation is, focus instead of brainstorming a plan of action to solve the situation, or think about the consequences of the situation and how you should prepare for them.
For example, if you are involved in a stressful conversation or argument, try to understand what is bothering the other participants, ask them what they feel they need to happen to resolve the conflict, make your own feelings known, and propose solutions to the conflict, rather than becoming angry, or resorting to name-calling or other negative language.

, Stepping away from a stressful situation is often the best way of coping with it. Take a moment to go outside for a short walk, or sit down with a favorite beverage. Try your best to let go of the situation, as this will help relieve the mounting tension which we feel when undergoing stress over an extended period of time, letting you come back at the problem with fresh energy and perspective.Be sure to let others know that you are only taking a short break, and that you intend to return to continue working on solving the situation. If others are also experiencing a lot of stress associated with the situation, encourage them to take a break as well.

Vent your frustrations.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Be social.,
Make time for your interests.,
Enjoy physical touch and affection.",How to Handle Stressful Situations2," During times of great stress, it is common to feel worries, anxieties and frustrations piling up in our minds to the point that they feel in danger of exploding. Without becoming overly upset or emotional, take some time to tell someone you trust about how you're feeling. Simply tell your confidante what situations have been causing you stress, and how those situations make you feel, rather than complaining, blaming others or casting judgment.
If no one is available to vent to, and you are feeling pent-up frustration that is preventing you from relaxing, try writing it out in a journal instead.
Consider going to a counselor or therapist. Having a neutral third party to express your frustration to can be a remarkably effective tool for battling stress.

, After experiencing stress, your body needs time to recuperate. Failing to get enough sleep can, over time, increase your levels of stress. Make sure you're getting at least 7 hours of sleep every night, and talk to your doctor if you are having trouble getting to sleep, staying asleep, or if the quality of your sleep is poor., This will promote the production of endorphines which naturally combat stress in the brain. Take some time to get outside for a walk, play a favorite sport, or go to the gym for a workout. Focusing on exercise allows you to physically release the built-up tension from a stressful episode, and promotes deep breathing and a sense of physical wellness.It's important to choose a type of exercise you enjoy and are comfortable with, so that the exercise itself doesn't become a source of stress.
Always consult a doctor before starting a new exercise program.

, While many people respond to stress by isolating themselves, interacting with others can, in fact, be greatly therapeutic. Planning a social outing, getting involved with a club or community organization, or simply sitting down for a pleasant conversation with family or friends can help you disconnect from stressful situations and focus on more positive, constructive interactions.Sport and exercise clubs are great options, since they combine the stress-relieving benefits of social interactions and exercise.
Volunteering is another great option. Satisfaction from helping others will distract you from your own stress, and increase your feelings of optimism and positivity.

, Spending time doing and learning about the things you enjoy is an essential part of taking care of yourself. Make it a priority to spend time every day doing something just for you, whether simply enjoying a book, movie or t.v. show, or pursuing a craft, hobby or intellectual curiosity. Focusing on what you enjoy will distract your mind from stress, and connect you with yourself in a deeper way., While we often underestimate its importance, few things are as soothing as simple physical touch. Affection requires little concentration or thought, and connects us to our positive, loving emotions. Getting a massage, giving someone you love a hug, or enjoying physical intimacy with your romantic partner are all wonderful ways of relieving the physical tension associated with lots of stress."

Accept that stress is a part of life.,
Identify sources of stress.,
Avoid stressful situations.,
Get organized.,
Adopt a healthier lifestyle.",How to Handle Stressful Situations3," While there are many productive steps you can take to reduce the overall stress you experience day-to-day, it is important that you realize that, no matter what, stressful situations will occur in your life. Accepting what you can't change about the world will ensure that you aren't wasting energy and time worrying about problems you can't solve., This is crucial for developing your understanding of the role of stress in your life. Make a list of situations, both specific situations you have experienced recently or anticipate in the future, and general types of situations which tend to cause you stress. This list will help you recognize what situations to avoid, or prepare for, in order to reduce the amount of stress in your life.Journaling can be a powerful tool for identifying stress, since it is often difficult to recall at a moment's notice all the stressors in one's life. Taking time every day to record how you felt, and what stressed you out on that day will provide you with a record to draw from later as you think about reducing stress in your life.

, Sources of stress can be pretty much anything, from particular circumstances (like being stuck in traffic, or being under-prepared for a presentation) to particular individuals (work colleagues, schoolmates, etc.), but once you've identified which sources are causing stress in your life, you can take steps to avoid them. Think positively about what steps you could take to avoid interacting with these stressors in the future. For instance, if your daily commute to work by car is a significant source of stress, consider biking or using public transit. If a certain person in your life is often a source of stress, limit your interactions with them, and avoid engaging with them when you must interact.
Remember, no matter how well you prepare, there is no way of totally avoiding exposure to stress.Simply avoid what you can, and you'll have more energy to deal with the situations you can't avoid.

, Chaos and disorder in our personal lives is a common source of stress, and being disorganized can make already stressful situations even worse. For those who struggle with organizing time, finances, or personal or work space, focusing on becoming more organized can be a tremendous help relieving stress.Start small, and simply make a list of areas in your life you feel could be better organized.
Don't try to change too much too quickly. Disciplined organization is a skill that may take a long time to learn. Focus on making small changes at first, like making a budget for your finances, or cleaning up your office or home.

, Poor diet and exercise choices can severely exacerbate feeling of stress, preventing you from feeling well and healthy. Taking steps to eat healthier, and enjoying regular physical activity, can pay remarkable dividends in you sense of well-being, and in your overall ability to cope with stressful situations.Living healthier doesn't mean living like an athlete or personal trainer. Make small changes, and stick with the ones that help you. Going for a daily 20 minute walk in the morning, drinking more water, and avoiding fatty or high-calorie snacks between meals are all great options.
Avoiding alcohol and caffeine can help, since these chemicals can negatively impact your body's response to stress.
Don't make any drastic changes in your diet or exercise practices without first talking to your doctor. Be sure to ask them for recommendations and advice.

, If you can understand what is causing the stress, you might be able to assist. Additionally, talking to you, may allow the victim to release his mind blocks and worries. Remember the completely stressed person may have deep fears that are hard to break through. You may be fueling the situation more if you are not careful. Sadly, failing to understand this situation, you may fall victim to your own developing stress. Be careful and be watchful.Observe every little expression and movement.

, For example, your husband has just hit his thumb with a hammer, he is going to be under a lot of short term stress. Now is not the time to barge in and try to help. Just give him some space. You can help in a few minutes, perhaps arriving at the scene with an ice bag. If on the other hand, the problem is more systemic, you might not be able to help much either in the short term. Listen to the problem. Try to understand the source of the stress. Try to be supportive.

, If your wife and the mother of your children is stressed because she has a major presentation to give at work in three days time, maybe you spearhead taking care of the dinner, bath, story and bedtime routine for a few days.

, If your daughter is stressed that the ankle she just sprained is going to keep her out of the volleyball game this weekend, she may be right about that. But you can help her see the bright side. Maybe sitting out the game will give her the chance to get a head start on those college applications. If on the other hand, your aunt is feeling a little stressed because she just got a cancer diagnosis, nothing you can say is going to make her feel all better. But you can let her know you will help her to evaluate treatment options. You can offer to round up the help she may need to manage her transportation to doctors appointments etc.


Explain that stress makes the problem worse. Due to stress he or she may suffer more and lose more than necessary. Explain that managing stress can put a stop to those extra problems. Ask the person to take good deep breath and set their mind to devising a positive plan forward.
Share your own story. In some cases, your friend or relative might benefit from hearing about your similar trials with life. Don't share your experiences in detail but tell that you have faced such things in life too. It is your being calm and relaxed mode/state that helped you overcome the situation with good solutions. That should let the victim understand that he/she can have better scope of thoughts when relaxed and calm.

, Get involved and take charge of some of daily chores that might be adding to your friends situation. This is hard but if you walk an extra mile at work/home, the person stressed finds it relaxing and understands that he's got good company. Sometimes the situation ends up with you getting the help yourself! It may be for good or bad. Better to be careful and cautious. If it is for your loved ones, you'll not step back, right?

, If the situation is particularly severe, you may need to suggest professional counseling to your relative or friend. If you meet resistance, make an appointment yourself, and at least get some professional help about how you can manage the situation, or about how you might be able to interest the stressed person in seeking help.

, If you are feeling an immense amount of pressure, excuse yourself or grab a few minutes alone to calm yourself. Deep, diaphragmatic breaths can evoke your body's natural relaxation response and lower heart rate and blood pressure.A few minutes of this exercise can bring about calm and recenter you to focus on managing any stressful situations.


Deep breathing can be done anywhere. If you are a beginner, however, aim to find a quiet spot where you can sit comfortably and undisturbed for a few moments. Take a normal breath. Follow up with a deep, cleansing breath in through your nose that causes your lower belly to rise. Hold the breath for 1 or 2 counts before exhaling slowly, letting your lower belly deflate as the air passes out through your mouth. Repeat the cycle several times until you feel more relaxed.

, Stressors that you can control are those that you can take some sort of action on to alleviate immediately. Focus on those. Trying to control things that are out of your control only cause more stress. If you can't control a situation, then you must move on to what you can control. When you’ve picked out the element that you can control, you can try to eliminate the pressure., Once you separate the solvable problems from the unsolvable, brainstorm for a solution. Use the COPE method for effective problem-solving.Challenge yourself to figure out each of your problems, the source of these problems, and your desired outcome.
Make a list of Options to resolving each problem. Consider the pros and cons of each option, selecting the one that will help you reach your desired outcome.
Create an action Plan to following through on the solution within a realistic time-frame.

Evaluate your progress. Determine if you are happy with the results. If not, go back to your list of options and revise your action plan.

, Repeat something like “Keep calm and carry on,” “This too shall pass,” “Make it work” or “I will accept the things I cannot change.” Consider getting an app that lists these mantras, changing your desktop image to the mantra or listening to a song with your favorite mantra, like “Hakuna Matata” or “Every little thing is gonna be alright.”, Mindfulness is the practice of focusing wholeheartedly on the present moment. Being mindful can improve both physical and mental health.Practicing mindfulness through meditation is an important tool in your stress-management toolbox. Here's how to do it:Find a quiet, comfortable spot where you can sit without distractions for several minutes. Sit erect without perching or leaning back. If you are on the floor, cross your legs. If you are on a chair, position your legs in 90-degree angles. Drop your hands atop your thighs.
Close your eyes or position your gaze at an uninteresting space on the wall ahead of you. Take a deep cleansing breath, in through your nose and out through your mouth. ""Follow"" your breath, simply noticing each inhale and exhale.
Eventually, your thoughts will wander from your breath. Acknowledge this without dwelling on the thought or criticizing yourself - just return your attention to your breath.

, If you are often under great pressure, you may not even notice when your body starts to become tense. Practicing this exercise can help you recognize what your body feels like when it's tensed and relaxed.


Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet touching the floor. Place your hands on your thighs. Take a deep breath, letting your lower belly inflate with the inhale. Release the breath.
Starting with your feet move up throughout your body tensing each muscle group, holding the tension, and then releasing the tension. As you hold the tension, notice what it feels like. Then, when you release the tension, also notice what that feels like.
Practice this exercise for 15 minutes daily or whenever you encounter tension and stress.

, When you're under a lot of pressure the tendency is to force yourself to work nonstop to make up for lost time or beat a deadline. However, taking an active break can rejuvenate you in the areas of attention, creativity, and result in greater productivity.Set your cell phone timer to vibrate and take a 2-minute break for every hour of work.


What can you do during an active break? Stretch. Drink water. Walk around to a different area of your workplace. Even better, take a quick walk outdoors and get some fresh air., We frequently feel under heavy pressure because we are keeping busy rather than keeping productive. One way to reduce stress and get more done is to organize your daily tasks by order of importance.


Each morning - or the night before - make a list of your to-dos. Write down all the tacs you need to get done that day.
Next, take any particularly large tasks and break them down into smaller steps.
Finally, mark items on your list by priority using the A-B-C method.A - tasks that are significant to your professional and/or personal growth; tasks in support of important people in your life; tasks that are both urgent and important
B - any tasks that are important, but do not have the urgency factor
C - tasks that it would be nice to do, but not important


Finally, start working on your daily to-do list completing your priority A's first.

, You may be responsible for putting undue stress on yourself by trying to stay in control of everything. Delegating some tasks others allows you to continue to perform well in high-stress environments without making sacrifices in the standard of work you provide.If you are new to delegating, choose a relatively small task from your to-do list. Think of a person who already has the skills, or is willing to learn how, to perform this task beautifully.
Clearly state your specific needs and any details or deadlines associated with getting the task done. Check in on the person's progress regular without micromanaging or being judgmental.

, One of the most practical skills you can learn to reduce pressure and find greater success is exercising your right to say ""no"". You may think saying ""no"" will cause you to miss out on opportunities or shut you off from them in the future. In fact, learning to say ""no"" helps you reprioritize opportunities so that you are using your time, resources, and skills most effectively.Decide when it's important to say no by asking yourself:Is this new commitment something I feel strongly about? Is it important to my goals? If not, pass on it.

Is this new commitment a short-term stressor or will it be adding weeks and months of additional stress to my plate? If it's short-term, take it. If it's long-term, only take it if it is extremely meaningful to your personal/professional growth and worth the burden.

Am I saying ""yes"" out of guilt or obligation? If so, don't do it.

Do I have time to sleep on this and weigh the pros and cons without having to make a snap decision? If so, sleep on it.

, Feeling stressed out can lead to you bingeing on unhealthy foods in the junk food category.However, appropriately managing stress means fueling up on the right foods. Pass on the sugary snacks and enjoy a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and low-fat dairy., Exercise reduces blood pressure, manages stress and helps release hormones, such as serotonin that help you keep a positive outlook.Get both aerobic (i.e. biking, running, walking, etc.) and strength training exercises for optimal health.

, Caffeine can help you focus, but you may already be over-stimulated from the pressure. Alcohol can reduce anxiety in small quantities, but it actually increases stress on the system after one or two drinks., Hobbies are a wonderful way to distract you from stressors, give you something to look forward to, and develop connections with other hobbyist. If financial troubles are plaguing you, you may even be able to use your hobby for profit.Think about some things you once liked to do or are interested in doing. Make sure it's something that will actually relieve stress rather than contributing to it. Plus, ensure that you will participate in this hobby regularly.
Suggestions for hobbies include writing, painting, playing a musical instrument, volunteering, gardening, and playing sports.

, One of the main ways people suffer from internal stress is due to perfectionism. Having high standards often builds good work ethic and character. Nonetheless, perfectionists frequently set standards that are so high, they prove unreachable - or are reached under great pressure. Aim to get the job done well without fretting over the unnecessary details.


Learning to be more realistic in your thinking and goal-setting can help you overcome perfectionism. Recite realistic statements such as these when you catch yourself setting impossible standards or criticizing your abilities:No one is perfect.
All I can do is my very best.
Making a mistake does not make me a failure.
It's okay to not be at the top of my game sometimes.



, Perfectionism may also make you feel as though making mistakes is the end of the world. Asking yourself how bad a mistake really is might help you to recognize that making mistakes are actually fundamental and can even help you grow. If you catch yourself freaking out over the following, ask yourself:Will this matter in one year? Five years?
What's the absolute worse that can happen?
If the worse happens, can I handle that?

, Get a hold of that voice in your head, and turn negative, critical self-talk into thoughts that are more positive and life-giving.


Each day take note of self-criticism.
Note the situation or stimulus that caused the thought. What was your behavior? Feelings?
Write down the exact thought as it came to you. (i.e. ""I will never get promoted."")
Write down what happened after the thought. How did you feel? How did you act?
Decide how you would respond to a friend. Would you correct him? Would you tell him about all the strengths he has? Practice this same courtesy to yourself.

"

Express your sorrow or concern.,
Be a shoulder to lean or cry on.,
Avoid cliches.,
Stick with the truth.,
Listen actively.Before you go to see your grieving friend, clear off the rest of your day's calendar so that you can be fully present with her.",How to Help Someone Who Is Grieving1," As soon as you learn about the loss, reach out to your friend and let her know you are aware of the situation and that you care. Your friend will be thankful that you acknowledged her pain.Use your level of closeness with the person to determine how you reach out. For example, if your best friend just lost a family member it may be appropriate to immediately go over. However, if your coworker lost a spouse, it may be proper form to send an email or call the following day.;
, Offer to come over and just sit with your friend. Many people find it hard to say the right things after a death or important loss. However, to your friend, the most important thing is that you are present with her during this difficult time. If your friend cries, encourage her to express her emotions. Rub her back or pull her in close so that she can cry on your shoulder.

, There are many optimistic platitudes often shared with grievers to make them feel better. Sadly, most of these statements do nothing to help with mourning and may only enrage or upset mourners. Such statements include the following:It was meant to be.
He/she is in a better place.
It could have been worse.
I know how you feel.
It was God's plan.

, As opposed to dishing out generalized statements about what the person is going through, aim to stick to the facts. Try to put yourself in your friend's shoes emotionally. How would you react to such a loss? How would you want to be comforted?


Saying something truthful like ""I am so shocked"" or ""I am here with you. I won't leave you"" may be more effective to show your concern while not minimizing or generalizing the situation. Even if you have been through a similar situation, you can't compare grief or pretend as if you know what the other person is going through., Let your friend express their feelings in whatever helps. Try to understand and acknowledge what she is feeling.


A response isn't required unless your friend asks a question. You can merely nod to show you are listening and sit in silence. Turn in her direction. Make eye contact. Squeeze her hand or rub her should when she struggles to speak.

Offer to help with the memorial.Your mourning friend may need help with a variety of tasks the first several days or weeks after a loss.,
Answer and make phone calls.,
See if your friend wants you to stay over.,
Assist with household chores or errands.Everyday tasks might fall to the wayside after a serious loss, but these things will still need to be done.,
Organize a meal train.,
Help with any children or pets.It might be challenging for your loved one to manage his children or pets after a significant loss.",How to Help Someone Who Is Grieving2," One important and often heartbreaking task is planning a funeral or memorial service for the deceased. Offer your assistance in any way that you can on such a difficult task. Even if you don't make any decisions, your presence may comfort your friend.

, Immediately after a devastating loss, everyone your friend knows may be trying to contact him. Volunteer to act as a gatekeeper, relaying certain information to the outside world of extended family, friends, and co-workers. Doing this can shelter your friend from some of those overly optimistic platitudes while giving the family privacy., If your friend lives alone, or the loss left her home alone, offer to stay with him. He might feel uncomfortable sleeping in his home alone or may just be comforted knowing there is someone there to talk to.

, Ask your loved one what chores or errands need to be completed. Make a checklist and get started ticking off items.


Common chores might be paying bills, picking up groceries, sending off or bringing in mail, and cleaning up the home. Just be sure to check first. Your loved one may not want certain personal items touched or rooms disturbed. He or she may want things left how they were before the person died.

, A great way to help out your friend and her whole household is to coordinate with other friends or relatives to set up a meal train. Doing this minimizes the need to have to prepare meals during this time of grief. Below are a few tips to organizing a meal train:Ask your friend if it's okay for you and others to prepare some meals for her
Find out about any food allergies or intolerances
Ask everyone involved to be specific in what they will be preparing/bringing
Offer suggestions to others who are involved, such as buying a restaurant gift card or picking up groceries that include easy-to-fix frozen meals or sandwich/salad ingredients

, Offer to look after them by picking up the children from school, helping with homework, and making sure they get a warm meal. Take any dog(s) out for a walk and feed the pets as needed.

Accompany your friend to the memorial.,
Help your friend remember the good times they had with this person.,
Celebrate important dates.,
Stick around.,
Help your friend have fun again.",How to Help Someone Who Is Grieving3," Seeing your face in a crowd of strangers or distant acquaintances can help your loved one feel stronger, less alone, and more capable of saying goodbye. A funeral or memorial service may help to remind mourners of value of the deceased person's life, views death from a spiritual standpoint, and inspire the living to come to terms with the reality of death. This benchmark is a significant part of the mourning process., If you knew the deceased person, share a story or memory that you have about him or her. If you did not know this person, ask your mourning loved one to tell you a story that helps you understand how special this person was to him.


Talking about the loss can reassure mourners that even though the person is gone, he or she remains a part of their emotional life. Don't be afraid to say the person's name. Doing so can ease your loved one's worry that his deceased friend or family member will be forgotten.Look through photo albums or newspaper clippings. Watch old family videos. All of this can help your mourning loved one process the grief.

, Though the person has passed it does not mean you can't do things like celebrate their birthday or special anniversaries. If a holiday meant a lot to that person, remember him or her by lighting a candle or revisiting old stories or photos portraying his life. You can even memorialize the deceased on a special day by planting a tree or having a remembrance gathering of family and friends., In the days and weeks following a loss, your grieving friend may constantly be surrounded by others who care for him. However, over the long haul, people fall back into their regular routines, forgetting that things are never the same in the lives of mourners. Be one of the people that sticks it out and continues to visit with and check on your mourning friend in the months and even years that come after a loss., Take your friend out to do something fun like going to a museum or a movie. This won't make them forget about their sadness but it will help to refocus his mind on something else for a short while. Many mourners feel guilty about laughing or smiling. You can be of service by helping your friend see that it's okay to enjoy life. In fact, his lost loved one would probably want him to be happy and live a full life.


Don't expect much the first time. Your friend may continue to be sad even when doing exciting activities. However, if you are persistent, you may help him see how nice it is to have fun again.

Try to be sympathetic towards the patient.,
Listen attentively to what they tell you.,
Give them as much of your time as you can.,
Try to take their mind off their problems.,
BE PATIENT with them.,
Remember they are depressed, so do not expect any happy-go-lucky behavior from them right away.,
It's all about your attention, love and patience.",How to Help Melancholic People1," Ask about his/her problems.;
, Simply listening can help a lot, even if you cannot help them solve their issues. Sometimes knowing that someone cares is enough to lessen life's blows.

, They are in need of some attention and tender loving.

, Take them bowling, clubbing, hiking, any activity that they really like.

, It is crucial to know that these people require time to return back to a normal state. It will take months, even years. They will not revert back to normal overnight, so your patience and dedication play a major role in improving their mental state.

, They may be cynical and easily agitated, and they are probably emotionally unstable and vulnerable. Their words will sometimes not make much sense.

, These people are in need of attention and a sympathetic ear. The more attention they receive, the faster their healing is likely to be.

Accept the inevitability of change.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Learn from your experiences.,
Allow yourself to live in the present.",How to Get Through Life1," There is nothing more constant than change. Seasons, weather, trends, technology - you name it; it is steadily changing. Know that nothing lasts forever. If you are experiencing hard times, they won't endure. On the flip side, if your life is currently exceptional, be thankful for the good, but recognize that harder days will surely come again.One way to stop seeing change as all ""bad"" is to recognize that you yourself and everyone you meet is constantly evolving. Whether you saw them the day before or weeks ago, each time you meet a person, you are seeing a newer, changed version. Time has passed. They have encountered new experiences, thought new ideas. Humans are not fixed in time, and neither is life.;
, If your expectations are too high and unrealistic, you will continually be disappointed by the outcome. When they are too rigid, you don’t leave room for growth or change. When you set expectations that are more reasonable, you have higher self-esteem and are better equipped to handle whatever comes your way.An example of an unrealistic expectation may be ""I need to make all A's in college"" while a more realistic expectation may be that ""I need to put in a lot of effort to do well in college"".
You can improve how you manage expectations by regularly reassessing whether they are achievable by you, and by exploring a range of options rather than being focused on only one outcome.
If another person is placing unrealistic expectations on you, talk to the person and explain how the pressure to perform is affecting you. You might say something like “When you expect this out of me, I end up ___”.

, Experiential learning is learning obtained through action, or through discovery and exploration. You can rattle off facts to students and they will likely forget. You can actively teach subject matter and they may remember. But, if you involve them and allow them to experience the subject matter, they can learn. In education, students engage in experiential learning by following a 6-step procedure. This same procedure can be used outside the classroom.


Experiencing/Exploring- In this case, this step simply means “living” and collecting experiences.
Sharing/Reflecting- Discuss your reactions and observations about certain life experiences with friends, a counselor, or in a journal. Think about what happened and what you discovered.
Processing/Analyzing- Determine what was important about a certain life experience. What problems occurred? How were those problems resolved? Were there any recurring themes?
Generalizing- Connect one experience with others to uncover trends. Acknowledge whether any real life principles emerged.
Application- Decide how you can apply what you learned from one experience to a similar or different situation.

, Try not to focus too hard on the future, nor dwell on the past - you might miss the things that are happening right now.


To practice living in the moment, engage in mindfulness. Mindfulness can be carried out at any time or in any place. It is the act of focusing on the here and now.
If you are a beginner, mindfulness meditation can be carried out by sitting in a comfortable chair. Place your hands face down on your thighs. Focus your gaze on either the floor 4 to 6 feet away or the wall ahead of you.

Breathe deeply. Just sit and orient yourself to your environment. Notice any sounds, smells, or sensations on your skin. Continue breathing and direct your attention to your breath as you gently inhale and exhale.
If you notice yourself being caught up in thoughts, simply acknowledge the fact that you were thinking, and then return your attention to your breath. Complete this exercise for 20 to 30 minutes daily. With practice, you can perform mindful meditation wherever you are to live in the moment."

Recognize their loss.,
Raise the topic.,
Be open about appropriate details.,
Share memories of their father.,
Encourage them to remember the good things about their father.",How to Help a Child Handle Father's Day After a Father's Death1," When children lose a parent, the sadness runs deep. On holidays like Father’s Day, that loss is even more evident because other children do have their fathers present. Reassure the child that you know they will have a hard time with the day, but that it’s okay to be sad sometimes.Say things like, “I know today is going to be challenging, but we should try to have a good day and remember your father.”
Many people who lose their parents at a young age express having lost their childhood, or bearing a burden too large for a child. It is important to realize that young children do not even realize how much their loss is affecting them.;
, Even if your child does not talk about losing their father, that does not mean they are not still thinking about it. Your child might still be feeling the pain of the loss, but feel unsure about how to communicate these feelings. Therefore, you might want to raise the topic to let your child know that you are thinking about it too and to open up a conversation about it.


Try saying something like , ""I was thinking of Daddy earlier today because it's Father's Day. Have you been thinking of him too?""
This will give your child a chance to express how they have been feeling.

, Sometimes, children are sheltered from the details surrounding the death of a parent. This is usually done to protect the child from emotional harm, but can have devastating results. Children will be naturally curious about their lost father, and about how he died. Answer those questions as best you can to help the child work through the grieving process and come to terms with their situation.The way that you talk to your child about death will depend on their developmental age. For example, if your child is very young, then they might not have a concept of permanence yet, so using brief, simple examples can help. For example, you might explain to a preschool age child that when someone dies, it means they cannot see, breathe, eat, or think.However, an older child may already understand what death means, so you might not need to explain what it is.
You might not want to share gory details, but to say something like “Your father died in a car accident” gives some closure.

, The child may have lost an active father recently, or not remember their father at all. Either way, it helps to talk about him. Tell stories of how you knew their father, what games he liked to play, what things he liked to eat, and how loved his children.A comment as small as “This was your father’s favorite meal,” will let the child know that you are thinking of their father.

, Everyone has good and bad traits. In general, and on Father’s Day especially, encourage your children to remember the good things about their deceased father. Not only does it give them something positive to cling to about their dad, but it reaffirms their own positive self image.Be sure to say things like “Your father really loved you.”

WATER.,
Decreased caffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that may lead to insomnia, and melancholics definitely do not need that.,
Healthy/Organic food: Vegetables in the diet have been shown to improve one's health.,
Teas: These days we have a wide variety of exotic teas, herbal teas, infused teas, flavored, etc.",How to Help Melancholic People2," Water is essential for human life. Adequate hydration helps people to have a better metabolism and health in general. Some studies have shown that adequate water intake i.e., 9-12 glasses of water daily, can help achieve a happier life.

, Coffee or energy drinks are not a good idea for such people. See below for a discussion on teas.

, A happy tummy leads to a happier life.

, Lemon grass and green tea have great antioxidant properties and are good not only for depressed people but for anyone. Black tea contains caffeine, however, and should be avoided.

Recognize the power of optimism, and choose it.,
Identify negative thinking.Optimism can be yours if you only change what you are telling yourself.,
Challenge unhelpful thoughts.,
Create positive affirmations.,
Practice gratitude.,
Shift your perspective.",How to Get Through Life2," They say your attitude, not your aptitude, determines your latitude. In other words, how high or far you go in life is strongly connected to how you choose to look at life, situations, and people. Adopting a positive attitude can actually improve your physical and mental health as well as your longevity., In an effort to think more positive thoughts, you must become aware of your negative self-talk.


Grab a sheet of paper and fold it in half sideways. On the left side, write down every self-limiting and negative belief that comes to your mind. These might include “My life is horrible” or “I will never find someone to love”.
Over the course of several days, “listen” to your thoughts. Notice those that make you feel badly or particularly negative and add them to the list., Negative beliefs may have the power to drain you of hope. But, when you put a magnifying glass up to these beliefs, you may realize they aren’t very rational. For each self-defeating belief on your paper, ask yourself aloud these questions to dispute them:Can I rationally support this belief? Since you cannot predict the future, you cannot rationally say you will never find someone to love.
What evidence exists that this belief is false? Have you ever loved someone in the past?
Does any evidence exist that this belief is true? Again, you cannot predict the future.
What are the worst things that could actually happen if this “bad” situation occurred? If this happened, you would be alone.
What good things could happen if this “bad” situation occurred? You could potentially learn to love yourself more and live out your passions.

, Affirmations are positive and helpful statements describing a desired goal that are repeated to leave an impression on the subconscious mind. Grab your folded paper, and, on the right side, write down an affirmation that transforms those negative, self-limiting beliefs into positive, transformative beliefs. Repeat these statements regularly.


“My life is horrible” is transformed into “My life seems bad right now, but the tough times are making me stronger”
”I will never find someone to love” is transformed into “Right now I'm feeling lonely, but it won't always be this way.”

, A mindset of thankfulness can help you to develop a more positive outlook. Rather than dwelling on your burdens, focus on your blessings. Grateful people are have better physical health, enhanced psychological health, increased levels of empathy and decreased aggression, sleep better, have higher self-esteem, and more likely to build new friendships.Show more gratitude by:


Writing it down. Start a gratitude journal.
Tell others when you appreciate them.
Meditate and focus on a spirit of thankfulness.

, Sometimes, we get completely caught up in the crises of our lives. Getting ""caught up"" can prevent us from looking at a situation objectively, and, thereby, finding a workable solution. Instead, we just get lost in the drama of it. Take a step back and observe your life from the lens of an outsider.Imagine that something happening to you is actually happening to a coworker or a close friend. How would you advise that person to handle the situation? Do you notice any negative thinking or unrealistic expectations?

Surround yourself with positive people.,
Develop your spirituality.,
Contribute by helping others.,
Ask for help when you need it.",How to Get Through Life3," Being around positive people breeds positivity within you. What’s more, no matter what you go through in life, a strong support group can help keep you grounded and hopeful. When you are around people who have a healthy outlook, this increases your chances of being happy and successful.Seek out the positive influencers in your life. These are the people who practice gratitude and actively seek out joy in everyday life.
Discontinue relationships or distance yourself from negative influencers. These are the people who dwell on problems or burdens. They often don’t laugh or smile and their sour moods may be contagious.

, If you believe there is a reason for your life, a higher purpose, then getting in touch with your spiritual side may offer protective factors against hard times.


Individuals who describe themselves as spiritual or religious often make healthier lifestyle choices in terms of diet, avoiding risk behaviors like driving without a seat belt, and refraining from smoking, drinking, or using drugs. What’s more, spirituality also provides us with a social support system that encourages us and helps relieve stress.Spirituality doesn't have to be related to organized religion or philosophy; it can mean whatever you want it to mean. Develop your spirituality by practicing forgiveness, engaging in self-reflection, using nature and art to get in touch with a higher power, and practicing self-compassion., Connecting with others can produce positive outcomes on both sides when connections are forged through charity. Helping others can improve our satisfaction with life, give us a sense of purpose, enhance feelings of self-efficacy, reduce stress, and lift our moods.Not sure how you can help out? Here are some ideas: Babysit for your neighbors who don’t go on dates much. Teach your young cousin how to play an instrument. Volunteer at the local soup kitchen. Donate toys to needy kids over the holidays.

, Getting through life becomes less difficult when you know when and how to ask for help when you need it. Asking others for help can strengthen bonds and also help friends or family members feel more competent.We often mistakenly assume that asking for help makes us look weak, or underestimate others’ desire to help.Think about a few tasks with which you could use assistance.
Recount offers for help you have received in the past.
Match your specific needs to the abilities or interests of those who have offered help. For example, if you have a friend who loves baking, and you could use help planning a party, she would probably be thrilled to help.
Finally, be direct. Requests for help often go unmet when they are ambiguous. For instance, you are much more likely to get help if you ask “Could you help me getting the kids to their games every Saturday morning?” rather than “Could you help me with the kids games sometimes?”

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Eat well.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Perform self-care activities often.",How to Get Through Life4," Adapting a habit of regular physical activity can do wonders for your life. Working out on a consistent basis gives you a lift in the energy department, helps you have a more positive outlook, assists you in controlling weight and fighting illness, and increases your lifespan.Find an activity, or several, that you enjoy and get moving. A few ideas include jogging in the neighborhood, attending group fitness classes, rowing, or hiking.

, Consuming a balanced diet of real, whole foods can help you feel great and keep your body functioning optimally. Select foods from each of the food groups, including vegetables, fruits, proteins, dairy, and whole grains.Be careful to enjoy certain foods only in moderation, such as fast foods or sweets.

, Strive for between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night for maximum health and wellness. When you don't consistently get good quality (and quantity) sleep, you are more prone to accidents, less likely to fight off illness and disease, and more likely to make unhealthy decisions, such as eating junk food late at night. Make sleep a top priority for better physical, mental, and emotional health., Self-care activities are those that nurture your spirit and soul. These activities elevate your mood, help your reduce stress, and give you the resilience needed to get through tough situations.Think of activities you enjoy doing because they help you recharge. You might love taking luxurious bubble baths or getting a manicure. Maybe you simply like going to the park and walking through nature. Whichever activities rejuvenate your spirit, make time for them often.

Hold a dinner in his honor.,
Go to his resting place.,
Bring a picture with you for the day.,
Attend a sporting event.,
Take time to reflect.",How to Help a Child Handle Father's Day After a Father's Death2," If you remember a specific meal that their father liked, plan to have that for Father’s Day. You could invite friends and family over for a barbeque, or just go out to their father’s favorite restaurant. If the child is interested, you could let them help cook the meal., You can take the child to their father’s final resting place. This might be a cemetery, or a mountainside where his ashes were scattered. Either way, it can help a child to go to the physical place that they associate with their father. This will give them a sense of closeness to him., Instead of going to Dad, you could bring him with you. Wherever you and/or the child go that day, bring a picture of their dad. This will give them the sense that they are spending time with him in some way. Looking at the picture(s) also serves as a way to recognize their father., If there is a particular sport that the child’s father enjoyed, take them to a game. Cheering for a favorite team will make them feel close to their father again. If their team is too far away or the sport is not in season, watch recordings of old games and have a sports party., Turn on some music that the child’s father would have enjoyed, or just sit quietly. Allow both of you time to think about the man that you knew and miss. You can also reflect by writing in a journal or making some form of art.For example, you could encourage the child to draw a picture of themselves with their dad.

Expect emotions to be high.,
Make an effort to recognize the child’s father.,
Plan a fun event for later in the day.",How to Help a Child Handle Father's Day After a Father's Death3," Expecting a child to cope calmly with the loss of their father is unreasonable. You should be prepared to talk to them and help them control their emotions, especially on a holiday as specific as Father’s Day. Having the day planned out will help you predict when the child might have the most intense emotions.For example, you might be met with resistance or outbursts over what to eat for dinner. Instead of making this a big deal, try to help the child understand their anger.

, The child will feel better knowing that their father has not been forgotten. Allow them the space to memorialize their father in some way, and make an effort to do the same. Be sure that they actually see you giving their father recognition of Father’s Day. Some ideas might be:Plant a tree in his memory.
Do charity work in his memory.
Talk to him in some way.
Do activities that he would enjoy.

, Teaching children to grieve is important. Teaching them to come to terms with that grief is also important. Plan a fun event for the end of the day to lighten the mood after Father’s Day. Explain to them that it is okay to feel sad and that it was good to recognize their father, but now it is okay to let go of the sadness for a while and have fun.You could plan a trip to the park or the zoo in the evening.

Acknowledge your loss.,
Learn about the stages of grief.,
Find a support system.,
Take care of yourself.,
Live your life.,
Celebrate your loved one.",How to Grieve and Move On1," Losing a family member or friend is one of the most difficult things you will ever go through. The mourning process can be long and intense. It is important to allow yourself the time and space necessary to grieve. You need to recognize that you have suffered a powerful loss.Don't try to immediately move on. In order to heal, you should allow yourself to experience the range of emotions that go along with a loss.
Acknowledge that you have lost someone important. It's fine to say to yourself that you've lost your sister and your life is going to take another course.
Give yourself time to figure out how your life will change. It will take a while to adjust to your new normal.;
, Everyone grieves differently. But there are some stages of grief that most people go through. Learning about the process can help you realize that what you are experiencing is normal.Denial is the first stage. You might experience this situation cannot be real.
Many people move from denial to anger. You may ask yourself whom you could blame. Bargaining is the next stage, in which you might often think that you can stop this event to happen when you make a change.
It is common to move from bargaining to depression. Typically, this stage can last for a while.
Finally, acceptance is the last stage of the process. That doesn't mean that you won't be sad anymore, but that you have reached some level of peace.
Remember that everyone experiences these stages differently. You might not go through each step, or you may experience them in a different order. The key is just to acknowledge where you are in the process.

, Grieving can be an intensely personal process. After all, you are the only one who truly knows what you have lost. However, it is important not to completely isolate yourself during the grieving process.Reach out to others who knew your loved one. It can be a great comfort to be around others who loved the departed.
If you lost a close friend, connect with others who considered that person a friend. If you find yourself feeling sad, pick up the phone and ask this friend if he wouldn't mind talking about your loss.
Consider joining a support group. Most hospitals and community centers offer a wide variety of these types of organization.
Ask your doctor for a recommendation. For example, if you have lost a child, ask if there are local groups for grieving parents.

, When you are grieving, it can be difficult to focus on day to day tasks. However, it is really important that you remember to keep yourself physically healthy. You won't be able to heal emotionally if you aren't taking care of your whole self.Take a shower and get dressed. On the days when you feel like you can't cope, sometimes going through the motions of regular life can help you feel like you can manage.
Get some exercise. Physical activity produces endorphin, which can elevate your mood. Go for a walk or take a yoga class.
Eat well. It can be easy to forget to care for yourself when you're sad. But you will feel mentally and physically better if you eat properly. Try a hearty bowl of your favorite soup.

, One of the most important pieces of moving forward is to remember to keep living your life. This means continuing day to day activities, like going to work. It also means continuing to celebrate milestones, such as holidays and birthdays.It can be easy to resist moving on when you are grieving. And that's fine, you don't have to move on immediately.
You should, however, try to find activities that you still enjoy. If you've always loved reading, try picking up a book.
Maybe you recently lost your brother. If the two of you enjoyed watching baseball together, it might be difficult for you to still enjoy that activity. But when you feel ready, try cheering for your brother's favorite team in his honor.

, Thinking happy thoughts of your lost loved one can help you heal. Don't be afraid to remember that person. You also don't need to avoid talking about them.Acknowledge special occasions. For example, if you lost a spouse, cook his favorite meal to mark your anniversary.
Do something to honor your friend. If she was an animal lover, consider making a donation in her name to the local humane society.
Celebrating your lost family member or friend can help you feel connected to that person. It's also a great reminder of the good times that you had together.

Experience your emotions.,
Anticipate grief coming out in unexpected ways.,
Confront your own beliefs about death, dying, and the afterlife.,
Adjust to changes.,
Acknowledge relief and guilt.",How to Handle Anticipatory Grief1," It’s common to have mixed emotions when anticipating grief. You might feel sad, anxious, angry, depressed, or in denial. If you notice your emotions emerging, let yourself experience them. Don’t push down your emotions or try to ignore them. Acknowledge them and express them.It’s never fun to deal with painful or difficult emotions. Let your feelings out by playing or listening to music, journaling, and bringing awareness to how you feel.
Avoid numbing your feelings with alcohol, drugs, binge-eating, over-exercising, or other compulsive and possibly destructive behaviors. It is tempting to try and escape the pain by engaging in mood-altering substances, but this will only lead to greater difficulties in the future.;
, You might experience grief in strange or unexpected ways, and notice that you tear up or cry in response to mundane things, oversleep, overeat, or experience other changes. If you feel like you have no control of your emotions or surprise yourself in your moods, know that it’s okay to experience grief in these ways. Recognize that the grief may come out in these ways., Questions about why good people die, what happens in death, and how much a person suffers might arise in your grief. You may derive comfort from a spiritual or religious tradition. You may wish to lean on traditions for strength and comfort during the difficult time.Get involved in a spiritual and religious center as a way to get support.
If the person is in hospice care, they may offer resources for you (and your loved one) as you explore these concepts.

, One difficult part of anticipatory grief is adjusting to the changes that come from loss. For example, you may begin to adjust your life to not having the person in it any longer, or take on new roles as a result of their absence. You might feel like by adjusting to these changes that you’re accepting your impending loss and feel guilty.It’s okay to meet your needs and live your life during this time.

, Some people feel relief as their loved one nears death. Perhaps you’ve been under strain from caretaking for your loved one and now you feel relief that the end is near. This might lead to feelings of guilt over the perceived burden of caretaking. Feeling relief is normal and nothing for which you should feel ashamed of or guilty. It’s okay to acknowledge your feelings and not feel bad about them.


You can feel relieved of stress and duty and still love your loved one. Just because you feel relief does not mean you don’t care about someone.

Write down your feelings.,
Laugh and smile.,
Have a good cry.,
Try to look at the bigger picture.,
Distract your mind.,
Read.",How to Get Happy when You're Sad1," Consider buying a journal that you can designate just for writing down your thoughts and feelings. Often it is helpful to document your feelings of sadness in writing in order to better make sense of them. This will help you get ""in tune"" with yourself and achieve a deeper level of self-understanding.Journaling - even for 20 minutes a day - works to clarify and organize your thoughts about your sadness, which may help you to better pinpoint the reasons why you are feeling sad. It also helps you keep track of your behavioral and emotional patterns. Additionally, some research has found that journaling can even help your physical health and strengthen your immune system because it works to reduce stress.While writing, concentrate on what you are writing, not how you are writing it. In other words, don't focus on your grammar or spelling. An example of a journal entry may look something like this: ""I have had a particularly rough day today - my sad thoughts about the divorce will not leave me alone. Sometimes I’m not sure if I should even still feel sad about it because even though it happened a year ago, the marriage had been dead for a long time. I know that. But I do worry that I'm stuck in the past and that my kids are suffering for it. I'm also angry at myself for not being able to let myself let the sadness past go. People get divorced all the time, so why am I having such a hard time? Talking with my sister helped the last time I had a rough day; I think I’ll call her. I know tomorrow is another day.”;
, Studies have shown that the very act of smiling can improve your mood and make you feel happierIn addition, laughing releases endorphins, those brain chemicals that enhance your mood.Even though you may not feel like it, even using those small muscles that facilitate laughing and smiling can make you happier. So, try faking it. It may be forced at first, but laughing or smiling could trigger a funny or happy memory and cause a real laugh or smile to occur.If you want to try smiling or laughing without the effort, try watching a funny movie, reading a humorous book, or spending time with a friend who you know is likely to make you smile.

, Even though you may not want to cry because you are trying to feel better and want to feel happy again, sometimes crying can improve your mood. If you feel the urge to cry, then don't hold back and instead let the tears out when you feel like it. The act of crying might make you feel better and more relieved, as the act of purging the tears can create the sense that you got the sadness ""off your chest"".


Studies suggest that a majority of people who cry feel better than they did before they cried. In part this is because crying is one of the body's natural ways of ridding itself of stress hormones.However, although it can be helpful to cry to reduce stress and improve your mood, it is important to know that not being able to control your tears may be a sign of a more serious emotional or hormonal issue.If you find that you cannot stop crying, you should seek professional help from a physician or therapist.

, What else is in your life that makes it worth living? Try to think about all of the other things that you value in life, such as your friends, family, and health, and you'll see that you probably have much to be happy about and thankful for, even if you don't feel very happy or thankful in the moment. Numerous studies have shown that gratitude is deeply connected with happiness.Think about good memories.If you've lived through them once, you can have them again. That's the beautiful thing about memories; just because things may seem bad right now doesn't mean that they'll be that way tomorrow.
In the case of sadness based on a minor life event, such as getting a bad mark on an assignment, put the event into perspective and consider whether you'll feel sad in 10 years and whether the event will even matter then. Consider using that old phrase, ""don't sweat the small stuff.""Make an effort to find one thing to be happy about each day. There are lots of challenges on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram that use hashtags such as ""100happydays"" or ""findthelight"" to encourage people to find little moments of happiness and gratitude in their everyday lives.Even if your sadness is based on a traumatic life event, such as the loss of your spouse, reflecting more broadly on your life may be useful. For example, you may find comfort in remembering the good memories with your now-deceased partner as well as a sense of happiness and gratitude that you had him in your life, even as you grieve the loss that was too soon.

, Sometimes when we are sad, it's hard to think of anything else. However, dwelling on your sadness can actually do more harm than good and can increase feelings of helplessness and powerlessness.Pleasant distraction can help you focus on something other than your sadness and also reduce your stress - scientists call this ""flow"". You're not avoiding your problems, but instead engaging in an activity where you forget time and place.Here are some examples of ways in which you can distract your mind:


Listen to music. Resist the temptation to go for the sad music. Try listening to energetic, jumpy, soulful, or happy tunes, along with songs that inspire you or remind you of good times. Music can be and is used as a very effective therapeutic tool.Look at some of your childhood pictures or photos from trips, graduations, and major life events. If a funny one pops up, don't push it away. Savor it. It'll help remind you that life passes by quickly and that there have been a lot of happy (and funny!) moments in your life along with the sad ones.

, Lose yourself in another world or in the past. Books transport us to places we've never been often, those places are more adventurous and romantic than the places we're currently in. Whether you're reading historical fiction or a steamy romance, being absorbed in another world will help you relax your mind and place our focus elsewhere. Just six minutes of reading can help reduce your stress level by two-thirds."

Enjoy the freedom.,
Insist on a positive mentality.,
Find alternatives to hometown comforts.,
Set specific days to contact home.,
Have some comforting possessions around.,
Write an old-fashioned letter!,
Have something to look forward to.",How to Get Rid of Homesickness1," This may sound like terrible advice, but enjoying yourself is the best way to get rid of homesickness. Moving somewhere new offers you the chance to choose how you want to spend your free time. Focus on yourself; it’s important to do every once and a while, and being somewhere new provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Tricks to enjoying the solitary life include:Exercise. Get your heart rate up every day, however you prefer to do so. Jogging is a great way to see your new neighborhood from a personal perspective. This will teach you about your new environment and make you feel more comfortable.
Carry something to keep you occupied. If you keep a journal, always have it with you. Or, carry a book or magazine. Reading and writing are great ways to both occupy your mind and express your thoughts.
Do that thing you’ve always wanted to do. Skydive. Or, if it’s more your pace, go to an art museum. Think back to the last time you thought to yourself, “I’d like to try that.” Whatever it was, here’s your chance!;
, Don’t confuse being alone in a new place with automatic loneliness. There’s no rule that states being alone means you must feel lonely. Remind yourself of this, out loud if you have to. Other helpful things to tell yourself include:My time alone is only temporary.
I may want to be somewhere else today, but it will get better here.
Everybody feels lonely from time to time.
I am strong and creative enough to handle some time alone.
There are people in the world that care about me, however far away.
I’m hanging out with myself right now, and that’s probably something I should do from time to time.

, If you’re missing the familiarity of your favorite coffee shop back home, or are worried about how to find a mechanic you can trust, reflect what it was about those places you liked. Go out and find comparable versions of these places in the city where you live now. Searching for something like a new favorite coffee shop will make it more apparent what sorts of space you enjoy to be in.


For instance, you may realize that natural lighting is really what you need to focus, and the coffee shops you had been going to since you moved were darker than you were used to. If you find a sunny, well-lit place with a similar ambiance to the spot you miss, you may end up with a new favorite. Plus, the search will facilitate meeting a bunch of baristas (who can be great sources of local knowledge) and seeing a few new neighborhoods!
Recognize that finding comfort living in a new city requires a lot of knowledge about that place. Explore and expose yourself to what your new city has to offer – including the countless new exercise opportunities, restaurants, nightlife options, and public transit systems. You’ll find yourself comparing these to those you’re used to. This will increase your comfort in your new city and provide you with equivalents of the places you had most enjoyed in your previous home town.

, Plan a particular day, once a week, to call home. While this may feel like it is not enough, it will give you the time and space to start developing new social connections in your new environment., If only subconsciously, reminders of the places and people you miss will put you more at ease.Even if reminders of home come with a twang of longing, your comfort with familiar items will make you more comfortable where you are now. Place photos of friends and family or items that were in your room back home in places you’ll see them frequently.

, Write to an old friend that you haven’t spoken with in a while. It will be deeply meaningful to the recipient, and you’ll be surprised by how much you enjoy the process of writing a letter by hand. If a friend is willing, commit to writing back and forth. One letter a month will keep you in touch, establish a way to get your thoughts on paper, and give you something to look forward to receiving.

, Looking forward to something helps keep you in a positive frame of mind. If you’re missing home with particular potency and are able to visit, plan a trip in advance. This will calm you down in the meantime, give you something to look forward to, and supply you with a dose of home itself.

Understand sadness.,
Know the difference between sadness and depression.,
Reflect on your emotions.",How to Get Happy when You're Sad2," Sadness is part of a larger experience of grief. It is a painful emotion that is usually temporary and generally stems from external factors, such as a breakup, fight or disagreement with a close friend, moving away from family, or loss of a loved one. Sadness is a normal emotion that most people feel at various points in their lives.The sadness stemming from a grief reaction can affect your concentration, appetite, and sleep., It is important to know how sadness differs from depression because the treatments for each are themselves different. Unlike sadness, depression does not usually have an identifiable external cause; it is just something people feel. In comparison to sadness, depression is a more serious problem that causes low mood, too little or too much sleep, weight loss or gain, increased or decreased appetite, low energy, disinterest in the world around you, avoidance of social situations, poor concentration, and feelings of worthlessness.One of the key differences between depression and sadness is the ability to experience pleasure, love, and hope. When people are sad, they can usually still experience moments of happiness or pleasure. However, in cases of depression, many sufferers feel themselves unable to experience pleasure, hope or anything at all and become emotionally flat. Moreover, for depressed people, their sadness is like a cloud hanging over them from which there is no escape; they have a tendency to ruminate and dwell and feel unable to simply ""get happy.""Depression is also long-lasting and can be something that an individual struggles with for months, years or his entire life, whereas sadness is usually transient and temporary. If you find yourself unable to cope effectively with your sadness such that your daily functioning is negatively impacted and suspect that you may in fact be suffering from depression, you should consult a mental health professional. Treatment for depression can involve psychotherapy and medication, so it's important that you assess whether what you are feeling is more chronic than occasional sadness in order to receive the proper treatment.

, Has something happened recently in your life that helps explain what you've been feeling? For example, did you just experience a breakup or a loss in your family? Identifying the cause of your sadness will better help you understand and move past it. Reflecting on the external factors will also confirm that you are experiencing a normal reaction of sadness to something that happened, and not chronic depression.


In addition, knowing what is making you sad will also help you determine the appropriate methods to alleviate your sadness. The sadness you feel after you've broken up with your boyfriend of 3 months, for instance, will be quite different than the sadness you feel if your husband of 10 years has recently passed away.
If you have a suffered a major loss or trauma, it may be useful to consult a mental health professional who can work with you to develop coping strategies for your sadness and grief. According to the Holmes-Rahe Life Stress inventory, the most stressful events that affect individuals' mental and physical well-being include the death of a spouse, divorce, marital separation, and the death of a close family member. In such cases where sadness is likely to be more extreme, the techniques described below may be useful in conjunction with therapy.

Exercise.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Do something spontaneous.,
Participate in a hobby.,
Take a shower or a bath.",How to Get Happy when You're Sad3," Go for a walk, a jog, or a bike ride. Play a team sport. Do anything that gets you up and moving. Exercising will make your body release endorphins, those ""feel-good"" chemicals that enhance your mood and inhibit the body's stress response.Any type of exercise or physical activity which requires you to expend energy and contract your muscles will trigger your body to release these helpful endorphins. So even if you don't feel up to a spin class or 5k run, just cleaning the house or going for a 15-20 minute walk can help your body start releasing the endorphins you need to feel happier., Scientists have confirmed that what and when you eat can affect how you feel and your moods. If you're feeling sad, try eating a low-fat, low-protein, but high-carbohydrate snack, such as a toasted English muffin with jam. When high-carbohydrate foods aren't overtaken by the presence of protein or fat, they allow for a release of the amino acid tryptophan into your brain. Tryptophan then turns into serotonin, a neurotransmitter than improves your mood, and all within 30 minutes.You could also have carbs such as air-popped popcorn or a slice of whole wheat bread. But be sure to skip foods high in protein, like cheese and poultry. These foods suppress serotonin because all of the amino acids in them compete with and ultimately block tryptophan from releasing into your brain., Sometimes a consistent and boring routine can make you feel bad.Do something out of the blue (but without making any rash decisions!). Go visit a friend or a museum, surprise your Mom with lunch, or take a weekend trip outside your city or town. By mixing things up a bit, you may rediscover your passion for life.


You could even shake things up by creating small ""disturbances"" in your everyday schedule. For example, do things in a different order in the morning. Make coffee after your shower, for example. Leave earlier for work. Just break out of that daily routine for a bit and see how you feel. Sometimes the routines that we become accustom to, while initially comforting, can become a trap., Channel your negative or overwhelming emotions into some other activity. Do something you enjoy and that relaxes you, such as painting, photography, poetry, or ceramics. Find whatever makes you feel at peace and helps transport you ""away"" from your daily struggles. This doesn't mean that you can ""escape"" your sadness, but it does mean that you are better able to cope with it by making time for yourself to do something that you enjoy.


You could also take up a new activity. Maybe you've always wanted to try yoga but never got the chance. Throw yourself into something new to reinvigorate your life; trying out a new activity or hobby can also be a great way to meet other like-minded people.

, You'll be amazed at how much of a lift taking a shower can give you. Consider making your shower colder than you would normally. Cold showers can be very beneficial and healing; research has suggested that they can improve circulation and blood flow, reduce stress and tension, and boost your mood. The cold releases endorphins into your blood stream and brain and gives you a feeling of rejuvenation and positivity.If you're more inclined to baths, try putting some Epsom salts (about 1-2 cups) in the bath. In addition to helping detoxify the body and reduce tension, Epsom salts are reported to trigger the release of endorphins, and thereby reduce stress and improve mood."
"
Talk to a friend.,
Go out and socialize.,
Spend time with a pet.,
Focus on others.",How to Get Happy when You're Sad4," A major factor in happiness is social contact and support.Talking to a friend about your sadness or the situation that has caused your sadness can help lessen the pain because you will know that someone cares about you and your feelings. Talking out loud can also help you ""air out"" your emotions and clarify exactly what you are feeling because it requires you put those feelings into words. Your sadness is no longer abstract, but becomes real, something that can be named and discussed, through its articulation in words.Research has shown that people who experience major life stresses, such as the loss of a partner or job, come out the other side of the ordeal more easily if they have a network of friends and family on whom they can draw and rely.You may also learn something from talking to a friend. For example, maybe your friend has experienced similar feelings or a similar situation and can offer you support and advice. Alternatively, your friend may be able to help you look at your situation from a different angle and may be able to suggest methods of coping that you had not yet thought of. If you're going through a break up, for example, maybe your friend reminds you of all of the times you called her complaining about how your boyfriend was inattentive and selfish. In this sense, your friend can help remind you of the reasons why you broke up with your boyfriend when you're stuck being sad about the breakup itself.
Friends can also help you feel supported and alleviate the feeling that you are alone. They offer you a place to be heard and understood. In addition, simply talking with a friend may improve your mood since you will likely end up smiling and laughing at some point!

, See a movie, go for dinner, or head out for a bike ride with friends or family. Along with distracting yourself, social interaction outside will help you get out of your own head for a few hours. Just talking with others - even exchanging menial pleasantries - and a change of scenery can improve your mood.If you're a loner by nature, don't overdo it with the socializing as this might make you more stressed and anxious. Aim for limited, low-key social interaction, like running an errand, grabbing groceries, or getting a pedicure with a friend, rather than a long night of bar-hopping with friends., If you don't feel like being social with other human beings, consider spending time your cuddly pet! Cuddling or petting a favorite animal can help improve your sad mood by meeting the basic human need of connection and closeness.Research has shown that spending time with dogs increases the concentration of endorphins, chemicals that interact with the receptors in your brain to trigger positive feelings and improve your mood.Additionally, animals are particularly adept at sensing our moods through our body movements and tone of voice, so they are often “in-tune” with how we are feeling., Giving your time and energy to help others will not only help you stay busy, but will also give you a sense of reward and purpose, making you feel better about yourself and your situation.Find a volunteer activity that you're passionate about such as helping out at a homeless shelter or food kitchen, caring for or walking stray dogs, or volunteering at a senior's home.Even doing something small for someone else, like letting someone go ahead of you in the line at the grocery store, can make you feel better. Acts of kindness increase your sense of well-being because they are concrete things that you can do, and not just think."

Seek to surround yourself with others.",How to Get Rid of Homesickness2," You will find a new hairstylist sooner than later. Finding new friends is admittedly harder. Allow yourself to miss the people that had made your life so comfortable before you moved – and recognize that there will not be perfect equivalents for those people anywhere else in the world. Don’t let this diminish the quality of your life in your new home.


Recognize that a new city offers not only new friendships, but entirely new networks and communities to dive into. Don’t hesitate to do so. If you’re missing one or two people in particular, call them in the evening to share stories about your day with one another. You’ll find that you have more to talk about – and more positive, mutually enjoyable conversations – when you have new, exciting experiences to talk about!

, Though it may not feel like it, there are groups of people wherever you’ve moved that will be thrilled to meet you. Whether based on a shared history or shared interests, seek out those that congregate according to criteria that you also share. For instance:


If you went to a large university and have moved to a big city, there are probably alumni meetups. If a quick search doesn’t bring any hits, contact your alumni center and they’ll know if there’s an organized alumni group in your new city.
If you’ve moved to a new country, seek out those that have also moved there from the country you left behind.
Go out on a whim. There are some great websites designed around organizing meet ups based on similar interests or even just casual social interaction. Check out Meetup and Reddit, which both have platforms to meet people in cities around the world.,, If someone invites you out, go! Don’t worry about immediately becoming friends with everyone you meet. You’ll likely meet plenty of people that you don’t develop a relationship with. You can still enjoy the interaction, and the more people you meet the more comfortable you’ll be putting yourself out there., Here’s a great to both provide yourself with some familiar aromas and flavors from home, and develop genuine relationships with people in your new life.Friendship based on breaking bread together is older than the written word.

Even if no one comes to mind, talk to someone you know who has lived somewhere on their own before.Not acknowledging the way you feel can lead to longer-lasting or more severe homesickness.

, Ask yourself, “What is it that I’m actually missing?” Consider the possibility that you may simply be missing your old self, and aren’t used to this new version of you that you’re becoming.

Put things in perspective.,
Focus on the positives.,
Find common ground.,
Appreciate your right to participate in elections.,
Accept the outcome.",How to Handle Stress and Negativity During Election Season2," Remind yourself that regardless of the election results life will go on. Some of the candidates may make extreme election promises and they may try and implement them upon election; however, there are certain checks and balances in place. For example, in the United States there are three branches of government, so Congress or the Supreme Court could prevent certain legislation from passing.Avoid thinking solely of the worst possible outcome.
You can also look back on the tensions surrounding previous elections and realize that the country was able to come through them and move on.

, Think about the big picture. Regardless of the outcome of the election, many aspects of your life will remain unchanged. Try and create a list of things that you enjoy doing in your daily life, that you will continue to enjoy despite the election results. This will help you understand that although you may not agree with the policies of a particular candidate they will not be able to negatively impact all areas of your life., Elections can be polarizing for the citizens of a country. In order to attract votes, candidates can often put down the other candidate and party. This often causes divisions between people who support these parties. Rather than focusing solely on the political and ideological differences that each party represents, try and find common ground with people who have opposing views.For example, even though you and your friend support different candidates, you may agree on a few specific issues.

, Take some time to reflect on the fact that you get to participate in the democratic process. For example, in some countries citizens are not able to vote for their government. It is also important to remember that not all populations have always been able to vote, even in democratic countries. For instance, at different points in the past people have been denied the right to vote based on their sex, race, property ownership, etc.


Think about the fact that at least you are able to contribute to the outcome of the election. This will make you feel as though you have some form of control.

, Regardless of whether the candidate you supported wins or not, it is important to learn to accept the outcome of the election. Remind yourself that other voters' opinions are as valid as your own, and that the results are representative of a majority of preferences, not just your personal preference.Allow these results to motivate you and inspire new ideas for involvement in your community. Start thinking about what you can do locally to inspire the sort of change you want to see in your community rather than waiting on politicians.

Learn about each of the candidates.,
Volunteer your time.,
Engage in constructive debate.,
Make sure you vote.",How to Handle Stress and Negativity During Election Season3," Read the platform of each candidate and determine which candidate’s plan aligns the most with your views. You can also watch debates to get a better idea of their leaderships styles. Pay particular attention to the issues that are most important to you. Make sure that you support a candidate who shares similar views concerning these particular issues., Rather than just sitting at home stressing about the impending election, actively get involved. Channel your energy and try and make a positive change in an issue you care about. You can volunteer your time in order to actively support one of the candidates. This will allow you to work as a part of a community that is making a difference in your area, regardless of election results.For example, you could canvass for one of the candidates by going door-to-door explaining the party platform.
You could also try donating money to one of the candidates.

, If you have friends or relatives who support a different political candidate than you, talk with them about the upcoming election. Try and understand their position, even if you don't necessarily agree with it. Then explain to them why you support a different candidate.


This type of conversation and debate can lead you to see the opposing side in a more positive light and you may be able to learn something new.
Only try this when you are calm and level-headed enough to have a thoughtful discussion without letting your emotions get the better of you. Do not enter trying to defend your points or persuade someone else to see things your way. Talk to create mutual understanding and acceptance of different opinions.

, Voting is an important part of the democratic process and allows you to have your voice heard. By casting a vote you are actively participating in the outcome of the election. Make sure that you register to vote well in advance of the election date. You should also educate yourself about all of the candidates on the ballot, not just the presidential candidate. This will ensure that you make informed decisions."

Get out of town.,
Walk through a doorway.,
Push the thought away.,
Bore yourself.,
Count your blessings.",How to Forget Your Troubles1," Try leaving your neighborhood for a few days. You do not have to spend a ton of money or go to an exotic location. Sometimes a slight change in location is all you need to stop worrying and forget about your troubles. Visit a friend in another near-by city.
Book a bed and breakfast in the country for yourself.
Look for a host through a couch-sharing site and check out a new town through the eyes of a local.;
, We’ve all had this experience: You remember that you need to call your credit card company, so you head into the kitchen to grab your phone. Suddenly, in the kitchen, you can’t recall why you went there. One study has shown that by simply heading into another room, we are prone to forgetfulness. Interestingly, you can harness this forgetting power to temporarily forget your troubles as well.When you have a troubling thought, simply get up and walk through a doorway into another room.
Repeat this anytime a troubling thought appears.

, If there is a specific thought that you’d like to forget, you can force yourself to do so through “active forgetting.” Just the same way you can train yourself to remember something, studies show that you can train yourself to forget.Anytime an unwanted thought comes to mind, push it away.
It may help to say, “No. I’m not going to think about that.”
Repeat this tactic again and again. Just as with remembering, forgetting will require a bit of practice and time.
You will begin to forget details of this memory. Eventually the memory will become very dull.

, Repeat a troubling thought so much that it becomes boring to you. Diffuse the power of troubling thoughts by making them commonplace. Isolate a bothersome thought or idea and repeat it out loud over and over again.For example, if you are troubled by your performance at work, you can say, “I will lose my job. I will lose my job, I will lost my job.”
With enough repetition the troubling thought will become strange, dull, or even comedic.
With practice, this thought will no longer bother you.

, Shifting your focus to what you are grateful for is an excellent way to forget your troubles.Cultivating gratitude shifts your perspective away from worry and toward a more positive interaction with the world.


Any time you find yourself troubled, stop and list five things you are grateful for.
You might be grateful for your family, your health, a roof over your head, your good memories, or a good opportunity.

Once you’ve consulted official guides, feel free to browse independent sources like personal blogs and forums. Talk to people as you go about your day as well. Ask people if they know about any interesting events that are coming up.
You can also download a variety of mobile apps which take your geographical location into consideration and search for activities and events in the area.Be sure to check out your local newspaper for events as well.;
, If there’s a natural attraction or historical landmark within a couple hundred miles, you can take a mini-vacation and visit for a day. This will add some refreshing variety to your routine while helping you appreciate your local landscape more thoroughly.


If you have a car, you can search for day trip destinations accessible from your location using various interactive tools and websites.If you’re stuck with public transportation, check out your options with local bus and train lines that offer same-day return service.

, Taking a nature hike or bike ride along a scenic trail has many benefits, including stress relief.It’s not only useful for mental health, though: stretching your legs in nature can also make you feel liberated from the close confines of your small town.


No nature hike nearby? Not a problem! Walking around your neighborhood or town still has many health benefits, and it still gets you out of the house and makes you feel like you’re exploring the area., Making your local exploration agenda into a competitive game can be a great way to visit new places, talk to new people, and learn little-known factoids about your community.Depending on how elaborate you want the game to be, the preparations can be a bit demanding, so have your friends take turns doing the planning.


You can do this the old-fashioned way by typing up a list of tasks and printing them for all your friends, or you can use specially designed apps or web-based services to facilitate the fun., Touring the town’s bar scene can be an insightful (and fun!) way to learn about local history and culture. Your town might already have an agency that runs guided pub crawls, or you might be able to find a suggested itinerary from knowledgeable locals online.Just keep the agenda manageable by paying attention to walking distance between bars and scheduling meal or snack breaks.


If your town doesn’t already have a service offering guided pub crawls, make your own! Ask a tourist board official what the oldest bars in the area are and if there are any spots of note that you should include.
The bars you visit will most likely be glad to host you—after all, you’re bringing them good business—but give them a heads-up if you have a big throng so they can be prepared., One of the best ways to learn about a local culture is to explore its music scene, so check out newspaper, library, and community calendar listings to find shows in your area. Even if you can’t find a ticketed event, you can pop into a small coffee shop gig or jam session


Be open-minded about your options! Just because classical music isn’t your thing, don’t shun the local orchestra’s Mozart concert or touring violinist. Live music affords a unique experience and benefits which reach far beyond the actual music, so consider that concert even if it’s not on heavy rotation in your Pandora., While the brick-and-mortar library might seem like a thing of the past, these institutional dinosaurs are actually invaluable information resources and centers of community.Your library will store a wealth of travel books and information, but it will also house rare historical archives and local records that can shed a whole new light on your small town perspective. Ask a librarian to help you find the most interesting stuff and keep track of your historical journey.
Information isn’t the only thing your library has to offer. Libraries offer free classes, host local artists and exhibits, put on free concerts, and hold other community events, so ask for a copy of their calendar and other public services to make sure you’re taking full advantage of your library’s offerings. If there is a college in your town or nearby, then they may also offer these types of activities.

, Whether you’re traveling abroad or traipsing your familiar streets, eating at local establishments is one of the best ways of experiencing a culture.And just because there’s no Michelin-starred chef in your neighborhood, doesn’t mean that your town’s culinary scene lacks flavor.

Take up a sport.,
Join an online community.,

, Learning new things and skills will enrich your life in many ways: not only will the added knowledge improve your mental health and satisfaction from life, but you’ll meet new people and expand your social world.Your library or YMCA will offer a selection of free or low-cost educational courses, so check out their offerings online or in person.

All online communities are not created equal. While websites like Tumblr, Pinterest, and Reddit host many thriving and positive online communities, they also have their share of junk.

If you are suffering from depression, recognize that you are not alone and begin to consider the roots of your feelings. Consider if the following issues could be at the root of the problem:Body issues—many begin to experience depression out of fear or anxiety of having to wear shorts or bathing suits during these months.
Financial issues—financial pressures can be more intensive in the summer when most are going on vacations, which are typically costly.
Heat—changes in weather can be at the root of your problem. The heat in many sectors of the world can be so intense that it can significantly lower your quality of life.
Loneliness—such as from seeing people around you go out and do things with other people.;
, Though thinking about these issues is a helpful first step in understanding the issue, you can take it a bit further by writing out your thoughts in a journal or a diary. Many people process their thoughts better when they are on paper; this will also give you the opportunity to revisit your thoughts later to see if your mood and depression have improved or worsened.


Write out thoughts like “I feel like I am the only person who feels sadness during the summer and like I can’t share these thoughts with others. But the heat really affects me and makes me want to avoid the world.”

, Though you may feel like this depression is unique only to you, know that others may be undergoing a similar issue or may be willing to listen even if they are not. Take some time to discuss your feelings with a friend, family member, or other confidant. Be open and honest with them. They may be able to help you or find ways for you to overcome your depression. Let them know what they can do to help you, such as spending time with you, and then you can return the favor to them sometime.


You might say something like “Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something. I know that most people love it but I tend to get a little blue during the summer. Do you ever feel like that?”
Even if they say no, you can say “I was just wondering. It’s just that I have some body issues and the summer is so beach and pool focused that I find it hard to cope with sometimes.”

, Fighting summertime depression can be multipronged. Perhaps it’s the heat and financial issues that are troubling you. Carve out ways to address these issues so that you can make it through the summer as happy as possible and overcome this depression.


If your issues are financial, make a plan to save in the months approaching the summer. Consider getting a part time job if there are certain things that you must pay for, like summer daycare. Cut out any unnecessary spending and consult a financial advisor. They can provide you with advice on how to have more financial stability in general.
If you have body issues, work on being more body positive. There are body positive blogs out there as well as a body positive community. Know that nobody is perfect; we all have our individual hangups and problem areas. If it is bothering you at other times of the year, consider exercise and having a healthy diet. Seek out a professional such as a personal trainer to help keep you accountable.
If you have issues with the heat, try to stay indoors as much as possible. Wear light and airy clothing. Stay away from dark clothes. Keep your hair up or cut it short during the summer. Wear open toed shoes. Find enjoyable affordable indoor activities to enjoy during the summer, such as bowling, going to the movies, and visiting museums.

Many professionals are trained to address SAD in others, so make a few calls to professionals in the area to see if they are trained to discuss this.Remember that seeking help is never a bad thing; therapy has benefited millions of people.

, Sometimes, depression can arise because during the summer, there may be less or more to do than in the other months. Setting up a schedule for yourself can help alleviate either some of the lapses you have in time or some of the more overwhelming aspects of your schedule.Try to fill your schedule with fun activities if you feel that you don’t have enough to do. Don’t wait to do this. Do it ahead of time s you will have plenty of activities lined up.
Take some unnecessary tasks off of your plate if you are feeling overwhelmed and work on prioritizing tasks or activities.

, Often times, people suffer from SAD because some negative experience or experiences occurred during that particular season in their life in the past. Though these issues may be difficult to get over, you should take some time to think about them, journal them out, and talk to others or a professional. In addition, work to create new memories during the summer to replace this old and bad ones.Do fun things with friends or take a memorable trip. If you are dealing with the anniversary of losing a loved one, then see if one of these activities can commemorate them in some way.
Reflect on the positive memories that you have had in past summers.

, Sometimes, people begin to feel depressed because they stop sleeping regularly and enough. You may feel that you have so much to do or so many things on your mind that it is affecting your sleep pattern. However, you should remember that you cannot be at your best unless you have gotten a sufficient amount of sleep. The recommended amount per night is eight hours.Commit to going to sleep at the same time each night to assure that you are sleeping enough. Create a routine for yourself to help train your brain to know when to sleep. If insomnia goes on for a long time, then talk to your doctor about treatment options.
Make a sleep schedule even for the weekends. You don’t want to sleep your entire day away or throw off your schedule for the weekdays.

, Exercise is a great home remedy to address depression and other mental and physical health concerns. Consider joining a gym or doing some simple exercises around your home.

See if another friend or family member will do it instead and offer to help out., Enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables that are best during the summer, like strawberries. Consider getting darker blinds if the sunlight bothers you or if you are looking for solutions to the heat., Yoga and meditation are great ways to relax and destress. Go to a yoga studio or take classes at your local gym. You can also find yoga videos online. Meditation is also a way to cope and to recenter yourself to positivity. Meditate on mantras or quotes that are salient to you.Do yoga with a friend.
A mantra you might meditate on is “I will be happy. I will be positive.”

, Perhaps your depression is rooted in feeling that you don’t have anything fun to do during the summer. Plan a vacation with friends or even set up a few movie nights if you want to be more cost effective.Many cities offer free and fun events downtown during the summer. See what your city offers and make plans to go.

, Spending time with friends is a great way to overcome the summertime blues. Keep in touch with your friends during the summer by calling and texting them regularly and making plans with them to hang out.Accept their offers to hang out and resist the urge to stay home alone feeling blue.
Consider joining a community where you can meet people and make friends, such as a church or other spiritual group or special interest group in your community.

, If you feel that your depression is associated with the debilitating heat that often comes with the summertime, work to stay indoors when you can and stay cool when you cannot. Make plans to hang out with your friends that will be indoors like going to the mall or to the movies. Stay in the shade when outdoors., One sign or depression is when a person stops doing the things that they typically enjoy. Push back against the urge to quit or be reclusive; continue to do the things that you love so that depression doesn’t overpower you. Take breaks when necessary but don’t lose sight of the things that make you ‘you.’If you enjoy certain sports that are typically played outside, see if you can find ways to do that inside, instead. For instance, there are quite a few indoor soccer arenas.
Be open to new activities as well. If people invite you to join them in activities, then say yes.

, You may be feeling frustrated with yourself for being depressed or for not having more ‘get up and go’, but remember that beating yourself up will only make you feel worse. Work to forgive yourself for this depression and also recognize that it is not your fault. Try your best to enjoy your summer, but also make time to take care of yourself."

,, You really don't need a lot of money for those.

, And if you live together, you could make double the money, so paying the bills will be much easier.

, You can make decorations for any occasions, or even seasons. Making presents by hand will make others happy too.

, This will save money. Or just get off the grid, you'll help to save your environment this way too.

, Countries with bad economies often don't utilize environmentally friendly ideas. Recycle your garbage, get together with your neighbors and clean your immediate area. Doing something good is always fun!

, Money isn't what people are looking for anyway. Everyone is looking for ways to enjoy their life. Some have bigger perspectives others don't. Having bigger goals in life often require having more money, but it depends on you to achieve your goal not your countries economy.

, Countries are not physical boundaries, they should not contain you. We all are at home here on the whole planet.

, Spending money can be enjoyable, but there are so many things you can do without having a lot. You can always try to work your way out of a bad economy anyway, make enough money to move to another country and start a life there. It's never too late to change.

, For many people around the world who struggle with a bad economy every day, song and dance provide a way to come together and have fun without spending anything. If you don't have the means to play music or instruments, you can make your own! Learn to sing and beatbox. Any flat surface can become a drum. You can even make a rubber band guitar from a cardboard box! If you're not musically inclined, now is a great time to learn. Get some family and friends together, and start making music. Sing and dance along. Learn some new songs and dance moves together. Get everyone involved.

, What did people do before they had electricity, running water, and even houses? How did they live? What did they eat? How did they spend their days? People are remarkably adaptive. Research your local history and ask: What were people doing 50 years ago? 100 years ago? 1000 years ago? Try to replicate some aspects of their lifestyle--odds are, it won't cost you a dime, and you'll gain valuable insights into people of the past. Share these interests with your family and friends; kids are especially curious about low-tech, do-it-yourself projects.


hunting and gathering (e.g. ricing, yucca)
growing your own food
making clothes & textiles
making shelter
food processing (canning, cider making, wine making)

, During hard times is when many people explore their spirituality; some people renew it, some people refine it, and some people change their views altogether. Whatever is your journey, take the time to dwell on your purpose in life, and be thankful for what you have. Pray, meditate, or do whatever it takes to remind yourself that you're lucky to be alive. Live in the moment.

Be aware of your thoughts.,
Accept that loneliness is natural.,
Avoid detrimental behaviors when alone.",How to Enjoy Loneliness," You don't always have time to reflect on yourself and your life when you're with people a lot. Social relationships can be fun, but they take up a lot of brain space. Instead of viewing loneliness in a negative light, focus on what you can learn from being alone.Think about your future goals. Where do you want to be a year? In five years? How can you go about achieving these goals? What could you be doing better?
If you're around people, you can distract yourself from asking these kinds of difficult questions. However, when you're alone, you can force yourself to confront them. This way, you can learn to alter your course as necessary.;
, Many people fail to enjoy loneliness because they spend their time ruminating or stressing out. Do not focus on the fact there are not other people around. Consider all that you can do during your alone time. Work on cultivating a new skill or taking up a hobby.Reading can be a great solitary experience. If you're feeling lonely, find solace in the world of books. Fiction books in particular can take you to imaginary places and may alleviate your loneliness.
Write. Many people find writing to be an excellent solitary experience. If you have to be alone, take time to get some writing done. You can journal your thoughts, work on creative writing, or write to your friends.
Do other artistic endeavors. You can take up drawing or painting for example.

, You do not have to wallow in loneliness. Instead of seeing it as a negative, think about a new skill you could learn. Maybe you wished you studied history in college. Try reading up on history online and watching historical documentaries. You can stave off feelings of loneliness by spending your time learning new things.Try enrolling in an online college course. This can give you something to do when you're feeling lonely. You may even be able to find certain classes or lectures available for free online., Taking care of another living being helps you realize there is more out there than your own worries. Maybe people who are coping with loneliness find comfort in an animal companion. If it's within your budget, consider adopting a pet to care for.If you're allergic to dogs or cats, or if they're not allowed in your building, you can look into getting another type of pet. You could, for example, try getting a fish or a turtle.

, Nature tends to provoke feelings of solitude. If you're feeling lonely, exposing yourself to nature can make you learn to value solitude. If you take a long walk in the woods, for example, you may realize solitude can be invigorating.If you live in a big city, it may be harder to expose yourself to nature. However, you can always go to a park for a day or drive out of the city to a nearby nature reserve.

, People tend to view loneliness as inherently negative. This can make it more difficult to enjoy loneliness. Evaluate how you feel about loneliness. If you can change your mindset a little, you may find it easier to enjoy solitude.Loneliness is not all negative. Keep in mind that many people choose solitude, or wish they had more alone time. You may, for example, envy your married friends, but many of them may miss the personal insight and reflection that comes with alone time.
Think about how you can interact with your feelings. When you're around people, there is always something to distract you from feeling what you're feeling. When you're alone, you have the opportunity to truly experience your feelings. This can lead to valuable insight.

, In the modern world, many people feel bombarded with social interaction. You may feel tethered to a Facebook page or overstimulated in a big city. Try to see occasional feelings of loneliness as a refreshing change of pace rather than a burden.As you get older, you will have more obligations. Marriage and family can make alone time rare. Try to embrace the alone time you have now. You may miss it in the future.
Think about all you can do with your alone time. You can work on cultivating a new skill or invest in a creative project. These things may be harder to do during times when you're not feeling lonely.

, In the past, people were expected to start families very young. In the past, you may be part of a large household as early as your late teens or twenties. Instead of thinking, ""I'm sad because I'm alone"" think of it more positive terms.For example, ""I'm so lucky to have alone time. One hundred years ago, I would probably be responsible for a family by now and not have all this time for personal growth and reflection."" You may stop seeing loneliness as inherently negative.

, Loneliness can affect one's feelings of self worth. If you spend a lot of time alone, you may start internalizing feelings of loneliness to the point you feel that you are actually alone. Remind yourself it's normal to feel lonely, but it does not mean you're alone.Everyone feels lonely at times. It's a normal part of the human experience. Certain situations, like moving to a new city, can increase your feelings of loneliness.
Remind yourself that you're not alone. You are experiencing a feeling of loneliness. However, this does not define you. Remind yourself of all the people who care about you and that everyone experiences feelings of loneliness at some point.

, It's easy to get caught up in unhelpful thoughts if you're alone a lot. Loneliness can be enjoyable, but you need to keep aware of your thoughts. Avoid letting yourself slip into unhelpful thought patterns.Challenge unhelpful thoughts instead of succumbing to them. For example, you think everyone is judging you one day. Say to yourself, ""Is this really rational, though? Most people probably don't spend a lot of time judging other people.""
Every morning, review your thoughts. Scan for unhelpful thoughts. If you notice anything counterproductive, try to question it before you start your day.

, People tend to think of loneliness as a problem that needs to be fixed immediately. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or weakness when we are alone. Try to remind yourself loneliness is natural. No one goes through life never experiencing loneliness. Remind yourself what you're feeling is natural and inevitable. This will help prevent you from feeling bad about yourself for feeling lonely.You could ask your friends to share their stories of loneliness, as this can help you realize you're not alone.

, Drinking alone or using non-prescribed medications is not a good idea when you're alone. This can be physically dangerous, and make your loneliness worse. You should also not watch too much television, as TV can sometimes become a substitute for socialization.If you're feeling bored, find something productive to do. Go for a walk or clean your house instead of watching television, drinking, or using drugs.

Pace yourself.,
Remove distractions.,
Choose a good study spot.",How to Get Rid of Study Stress1," Creating a good study plan is essential to stress free studying.

Keep up with your class assigned reading.

Turn off the tv.

, Being in an environment that will help you to stay focused is another great way to promote study success. This environment will depend on what usually works best for you. Experiment with different types of environments to find what works best for you.

For example, you might find that you can focus better when you are in a quiet environment, such as a quiet corner in the library or alone in your bedroom. Or, you might find that you study better when there is some background noise and commotion, such as in a coffee shop or at the kitchen table in your home.
Avoid studying in places where you typically relax or sleep.For example, studying on your bed might not be a good idea because your brain associates your bed with sleep. By studying there, you might get tired while studying, or you might start to have trouble sleeping because you have been studying in bed.

Try self-massage.,
Use tools.,
Treat with heat.,
Use pain relievers.",How to Get Rid of Stress Balls on Your Neck1," The simplest method to try is rubbing your own neck. Massage the tense spot to relax the stressed muscles by gently kneading the sore area. Begin by applying gentle pressure to the ball.Use the tips of your fingers to rub the stress ball using a tight circular motion. Repeat this motion for a minute or two to see if it provides any relief. You may also simply rub back and forth.If the massage feels painful, you're probably rubbing too hard. Start with a gentle touch, increasing pressure as needed.
If this method helps, massage the area from one to five times a day. Each session should last for approximately five minutes, as you do not want to overdo it. You want to avoid putting extra stress on your muscles.;
, Although many people find relief just by massaging the stress ball with their fingers, it's important to play around with different massage techniques to find what works for you. Many people find using a basic tennis ball to be beneficial.To use the tennis ball technique, lie down on the floor and place the tennis ball beneath your neck, at the approximate location of the stress ball. You can also do this leaning against a wall.
Adjust your body positioning until you feel a ""good"" pressure at the location of the knot. The tennis ball should not cause pain.
Move your neck and body up and down and from side to side, allowing the tennis ball to roll over the stress knot. This helps to release tension from the muscle and loosen the knot.
Make sure that your neck is a natural neutral position when using a tennis ball. If you find that your head is hanging down on the ball (which may further stress your muscles), simply place a small book on the floor and the ball on top of that. This brings the ball up to your neck instead of your neck arching or extending to reach the ball on the ground.
If you find that a tennis ball is too soft, you can progress to a lacrosse ball, which is more firm and may be more beneficial to those with chronic stress balls or more muscle mass
Many stores also sell self-massage tools, such as wooden rollers or foam rollers. These can be used in the same manner as the tennis ball.

, Heat has been shown to relax tense muscles. At home, you can use a heating pad to increase blood flow to the stressed muscles. When your muscle has been tight for an extended period of time, it begins to lose blood flow. This causes further stress and pain. Applying heat will relax the muscle and relieve pain by increasing blood flow to the area.Hold the heating pad against the stress ball in your neck for a few minutes, twice per day. If you do not own a heating pad, soak a clean towel in hot water, wring it out and use it as a hot compress.
Take regular hot baths. Hot baths can be beneficial for relieving stress balls in the neck, for the same reason as hot compresses.
Give yourself neck support by placing a towel or bath pillow at the edge of the tub. This will help you avoid causing additional stress to your neck.
Adding Epsom salts to the water will make your bath even more beneficial. Epsom salts are used to relieve muscle pain and reduce inflammation. For best results, dissolve one to two cups of Epsom salts in your bath before you hop in.

, Head to your local drug store to look at over-the-counter muscle relaxers. You can find creams, gels, and solid ""sticks"" (like deodorant) that can help ease your tension. Make sure to ask your pharmacist if she can recommend a product.Be sure to carefully read the instructions and dosage directions before applying any products to your skin.
Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Aspirin and Tylenol can also reduce muscle soreness.

Sleep and eat well.",How to Develop a Plan to Manage Stress," As you begin to develop a plan to manage your stress, it can feel like an overwhelming task. Before doing anything else, try a free-association or stream of consciousness exercise. This exercise involves not censoring your thoughts but rather writing them down as they happen.


For a very short amount of time (approximately two to three minutes), write out everything that is causing you stress.
Don't stop writing until your time is up. Doing it quickly prevents you from focusing on each specific stressor, so that you can get as many of your thoughts as possible onto paper.
Write any thoughts or feelings that surface about your stress or stress management as well.;
, To manage your stress, try to identify what you are stressed about and where it's coming from.Review your free-association, and make a list of your the things that cause you stress. Try to not get overwhelmed with what is on the list, but rather use this as an exercise to organize your stressors. Additionally, making lists can help to reduce anxiety and promote creativity.Feel free to write your stressors out with paper and pen, or consider typing your list on a spreadsheet to make it easier to move things around later, if needed.
Don't worry too much about the order at this time.

, As you look at your list, try to narrow any broad categories of stressors down to specifics. For example, work may be stressful for you, but what specifically is causing your stress at work? Breaking down the source of your stress into specifics will help you choose a more precise and effective solution.Ask yourself if there is a specific factor about your work that is the actual stress source or if it is more of a general stress about working. For example, if you work at a call center and enjoy the job itself, maybe you are stressed by long work hours, by your boss, or by the cold calling portion of your job.Ask yourself if your stressors might be related to particular people, places, tasks, responsibilities, thoughts or feelings.
If you remove what you have identified as a specific stressor and your feelings towards that broader topic improve, you are on the right track.

, Evaluating your stressors and having them all written in front of you is a big step! If you are feeling your stress increase by just looking at this list, then take a break. Make sure throughout the planning process you are managing any additional stress that may surface. Take a break and try one of the following activities:


Go for a short walk.
Have a glass of cold water and focus on the act of drinking water for a few moments.
Do a short relaxation exercise such as deep breathing.

, Going back to your list, consider each stressor one at a time. Try to determine what ones are a big stressors for you and what ones are small stressors.It can be easy when you are stressed and overwhelmed for everything to feel like a disaster, when that might not be the case. You may be able to remove some items from your list if you determine they are just a result of being overwhelmed. Also, beginning to determine if stressors are large or small in your mind will help when it comes to prioritizing and creating your action plan later on.


Use your thoughts as well as you own body reactions and responses to help you determine the importance or severity of each stressor.Notice your urges to avoid anything during this process.The stronger the urge to avoid it the more heavily weighted that stressor probably should be.

, Evaluate what resources you have available and how you can take advantage of them. Put the list of stressors aside and create a new list of resources for yourself. The purpose of this activity is two-fold. It will hopefully aid in a reduction of stress by acknowledging all of the ways you have to help yourself through this stressful time. It will also provide you with a list to match resources to specific stressors. Resources can be anything that you feel helps you cope with stress including:


People, such as friends, family, or therapists.
Activities, such as spiritual practices, hobbies, or relaxation exercises.Online tools and resources.

, Experiencing stress is unpleasant. This causes many people to try to ignore their problems or their stress with the false hope that maybe it will “just go away.” Unfortunately this usually only causes more stress in the long run.Take some time to organize your stressors, make plans, and address them one by one.

, Begin to divide the list into categories or rank them by importance. Prioritizing helps you put your stressors into perspective and helps determine a clearer action plan based on what is most important. You can determine whether a specific stressor is really a concern that you need to deal with right now or not. You may decide that the least important stressor on your list is no longer relevant in comparison to the other stressors. Try prioritizing by:


Listing them in order of the most stressful to least stressful. Rewriting your list or working within a digital document may be helpful at this time.
Label them in a ranking system or 1, 2, or 3; where 1 is most important or most stressful, and 3 is the least important or least stressful. Place a 1, 2, or a 3 by each item on your list.
Split them up by categories such as work, finances, schools, friends, family, etc. and then prioritize each category.

, To avoid getting overwhelmed, take one stressor at a time and try to remove the other stressors on the list from your sight. Look at your resources list and choose one (or several) resources to help you deal with this stressor. Whatever the stressor is, choose a resource that can aid you in resolving the issue.


For example, if your bills are late and you are getting notices, make a plan to call your providers to set up reliable payment plans. You may also want to visit a financial adviser to help with managing your finances, or talk to a family member about finance management.
Ask yourself the following questions to help you develop a specific plan. What actions will occur? Who will carry them out? What resources are needed? Who should know what?If a task is too large or feels overwhelming, break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.Reorganize your list so that you can focus on one small piece at a time.
Be specific and realistic in making your plans and solutions to set yourself up for success.

, Create realistic goals when putting together your solutions. Don't set unrealistic timelines and action plans. Realistic goals are those that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. These are also known as SMART goals.For example, if you are stressed about finding a job, then a SMART goal might be something like, “Complete three job applications today.” This goal is something that is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. It will help you to move in the direction you want to go, but it will not overwhelm you as much as setting a goal like, “Complete 20 job applications,” or “Get a job by Friday.”

, Add dates and times to work on each item, and then add dates for review or follow up to see if your plan for managing stress is working.If you find that a solution is not working, then replace it with another. You may also find that some action plans are working and those original stressors are gone. In such cases, remove the stress from the list.

, Stress can build up a great deal of anxious energy in your body. Stress can also negatively affect your physical health. Exercise not only gives you an outlet for anxious energy, improves your physical health, and reduces other mental health difficulties like depression, but it can also help clear your mind so you can concentrate and think better.This makes exercise a great resource for you that can be adapted to specific schedules and stressors.Plan a time to exercise. Commit to a certain time, length of exercise, and how many times a week. For example, “I will commit to exercising in the evenings, for 20 minutes, six days a week” and “If I have trouble concentrating or feel overwhelmed, I will walk around the block twice.”

, Have trusted friends or family members around that you can confide in about your stress as well as about your plan to manage it. Use your social coping resources to help reduce your stress and prevent stress in the future.If your friends and family members offer to help or want to comfort you, let them.


Additionally, take some time out of the hard work you are doing, to relax and have fun with your friends. Being social is a stress release in itself.

, Sometimes an overabundance of stress comes from having the nature of a people-pleaser and a reluctance to say no.Wanting the people around you to be happy is a noble goal, but not being able to say no to others does come with some potential risks, including stress. Try not to build your stress up on yourself by over committing to too many projects or responsibilities.


Know you have the option to say no.
If you must say yes, set a time limit. “I can help you, but I only have an hour before I have to leave.”
Don't offer excuses and don't apologize for having to say no.
Realize that you are not responsible for other people's happiness.

, A great way to reduce your stress and prevent stress in the future is to begin practicing mindfulness.Mindfulness is additionally helpful in how flexible your practice can be. There are quick techniques you can use in the moment and then there are longer practices you can use, such as meditation, to reach deeper relaxation.


The 5-4-3-2-1 Sense Activity is a quick in-the-moment mindfulness activity you can do anywhere. Practice this by being mindful of your present environment and name five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.Meditation is a longer, deeper mindfulness practice that can help you learn to quiet your mind and relax your body., Another way to reduce and prevent stress is to engage in active relaxation techniques. While it typically feels like stress is an overwhelming and insurmountable fact of life, there are, in fact, ways we can calm ourselves down with some effort and practice. Active relaxation involving make a conscious effort to relax your mind and your body. Try the following techniques.



Deep breathing exercises such as 4-8 breathing. Breathing from the diaphragm, breathe in through your nose for a count of 4 and slowly out through your mouth for a count of 8.Long, warm baths or showers. Providing yourself with some pampering is an active and sensory-filled way to relax yourself.
Visualization and guided imagery is a technique where you use mental images or scenes which calm you as a source of relaxation., Make sure, as you are managing your stress and working towards a more stress free future, that you are taking care of yourself as well. Feeling tired because of a lack of sleep, or sluggish from having too much sugar or fatty foods, will only increase your stress. Begin with the basics of getting good quality sleep and eating healthy. Be aware of foods that can increase your nervous system responses and your anxiety or stress, such as caffeine.


Try and get an average of eight hours of sleep a night. Go to bed at around the same time every night so your body can adjust to a more regulated schedule. Leave your bed for sleeping and not for homework, watching TV, or using your phone.Make sure you are eating enough meals having enough fruits and vegetables, and drinking plenty of water. Work on reducing your intake of caffeine, sodas, and sugary foods and drinks."

For some days, ignore that person, don't give advice or reply to the words which would turn the conversation into a fight. Let it be. I mean, you deserve better people to talk to. And not lock horns with people who talk about things that are a waste of time. After some days, the person will automatically feel ashamed of himself and things will get better.

, Do things that you've been longing to do and you are not getting time. Have some me time. And also take time out for social work. You will feel better after helping people. You will gain respect and gratitude.

, Organize your work in such a way that you can handle the daily burden. Set timings. Do preparations.

, After some time you should be left out without any negativity in your mind. What's more, now you'll be able to think better.

, Stress is not made for you. Don't run away from it. Fight it.

Look at yourself in a positive light.,
Avoid comparing yourself to others.,
Consider the strengths that often go along with anxiety.,
Try new things.",How to Find Your Strengths when You Have Anxiety1,"

Remind yourself that you do have strengths and good qualities, even if you’re not perfect. Instead of focusing on your normal, human mistakes, think about the times you’ve succeeded at something.The way you talk to yourself has a big impact on your self-image. Talk to yourself in a kind, encouraging way, and don’t say anything to yourself that you wouldn’t say to a friend.
For instance, instead of saying to yourself, “I’m terrible at this,” tell yourself, “I’ve never done this before, but I’ll get better with more practice.”;
, When you’re too worried about how you stack up to other people, it’s easy to lose sight of your own unique strengths. Focus on yourself, and don’t try to compete with people whose personalities and life experience may be completely different from yours.For example, if you compare yourself to a friend who doesn't have anxiety, you are being unreasonable. They don't have the same experiences as you, so it's an unfair assessment.

, Living with anxiety isn’t fun, but there are a few positives to the situation. Anxious people often have good personal qualities like self-control, bravery, kindness, and cautiousness. Think about whether your anxiety may have instilled some positive character traits in you.For instance, if you often have anxiety in social situations, you might be very forgiving of others who aren't social butterflies.

, Give yourself room to grow by getting out of your comfort zone. Put yourself in unfamiliar situations, learn new things, and give yourself permission to fail. Expanding your horizons will give your self-esteem a boost, and you might discover some of your strengths at the same time.For example, you could travel somewhere new or pick up a part-time volunteer job.
Pushing yourself outside your comfort zone might be difficult at first, but as you practice doing it more, it will get easier.

Avoid laughing at someone else's expense.,
Resist the urge to use laughter as avoidance.,

Work on changing your outlook.",How to Ease Stress with Laughter," Some people just have a great sense of humor. If you're interested in reducing your stress with laughter, try spending time with friends or relatives who make you laugh on a regular basis.Keep in touch with funny people on a daily basis, even if it's just a text message or phone call.
Get coffee together, have dinner together, or just meet up to walk through the park. You'll probably end up having a great laugh and you'll get to spend time with a close friend or family member.;
, Comedy is a genre that is meant to induce laughter. If you're feeling stressed, watching a funny movie or listening to a stand-up comedian's routine can help get you laughing and feel less stressed while being entertained.If you're at work or school, try watching short-form comedy clips on your computer or smartphone. This is a great way to get a laugh in when you're short on time.Listen to comedy radio or stand-up albums while you commute to and from work. This is an entertaining and relaxing alternative to listening to the news or to talk radio.
If you live in an area where comedy shows are performed live, treat yourself to an outing at the comedy club., If you need a quick laugh at work or school, try keeping little items that make you laugh at your desk or in your locker. For example, you might hang up funny photos, comic strips, or souvenirs from humorous occasions., Laughing to ease stress doesn't always require you to laugh at comedic situations. Sometimes the best little laughs throughout the day come from minor situations that are absurd or otherwise silly. For example, finding humor in the way a sports fan takes victories and losses so seriously or chuckling at the absurdity of certain reality TV shows might help lighten your mood.Don't be cruel in your laughter. Instead, try to find levity in situations where people take themselves or their circumstances unnecessarily serious.
You can laugh at yourself when you goof up or do something silly, but make sure you're not being self-deprecating. If the gist of laughing at yourself involves thoughts like, ""That was so stupid of me,"" you may need to reframe your perspective.

, Jokes are a great way to lighten a tense situation. You can learn jokes and tell them to others to make them laugh, or you can simply read jokes to make yourself laugh during stressful moments throughout the day.You can find jokes by searching online or reading a joke book.
Make sure the jokes you read are appropriate, especially if you intend to read them at work or tell them during social situations.
Avoid jokes that discriminate against or put down marginalized groups of people. This includes jokes that are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, or xenophobic.

, You can find ways to laugh each day within your own social circles, but for some people that may not be enough. If you're coping with more serious problems that are causing you stress, like a debilitating illness or significant life trauma, laugh therapy may be a healthy addition to your medical treatment.Laugh therapy works with small groups of individuals coping with similar problems.
The goal of laugh therapy is to help one another heal and reduce overall levels of stress.
You can find laugh therapy groups in your area by searching online or asking your doctor or therapist about adding this to your treatment plan.

, If you have a close friendship with a colleague or neighbor, you might feel comfortable teasing one another about certain topics. However, you should never laugh at someone else's expense, nor should you make fun of qualities that someone might feel self-conscious about.Never make fun of someone's weight, age, race, religion, ethnicity, or appearance. Even if a friend jokes about these qualities in themself, it may not be appropriate for you to do so.
As a general gauge, ask yourself whether someone might be hurt or offended by a given joke. If you think the answer is yes, it's best to pass on that joke.

, Some people use laughter to avoid addressing or even acknowledging serious problems in their life. This use of laughter is not a healthy way to cope with stress since it actively avoids the underlying problems you're coping with.It's okay to turn minor problems into jokes, but if you're joking about serious life changes or trauma you might be doing more harm than good.
You can only safely laugh about big life problems once you've dealt with those issues head-on and learned from the experience.

, If you're struggling to cope with serious emotional or psychological trauma, laughter will not be enough. You may need to work with a therapist or take prescription medications to help manage serious conditions like anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and PTSD.


If you feel nervous, anxious, or stressed much or most of the time, you may need the help of a mental health caregiver.Ask your doctor about working with a therapist. You can also find therapists in your area by searching online or checking your local phone book.

, If you're feeling really stressed, laughter may not be enough. Many medical professionals recommend using relaxation techniques to help manage stress and cope with difficult emotions.Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing each muscle group in your body in succession, then releasing the tension. Try to hold each muscle group's tension for at least 5 seconds, then let your muscles relax for about 30 seconds before repeating.

Meditation involves focusing on your breath to release stressful or upsetting thoughts and emotions. Breathe in slowly through the nostrils while counting to five, hold the breath for five seconds, the exhale slowly while counting to five.

Yoga and Tai Chi involve coordinating your breath with slow, deliberate movements and stretches to achieve a calming sense of well-being.

, Inadequate or unrestful sleep can drastically affect your stress levels.Over time, this can increase your risk of developing significant, long-term stress-related problems like anxiety or depression.Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, though some individuals may need 10 or 11 hours of sleep to feel fully rested.Teenagers typically need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, though some may need 11 hours. School-age children need between 9 and 11 hours of sleep, but some may need as much as 12 hours of sleep each night.

, Exercise is an excellent way to cope with stress.Exercise helps burn off excess energy and releases endorphins that make you feel good. It can also have a meditative effect when you're struggling to process a stressful event.Any type of physical activity can help manage stress, even if you don't have a lot of time. For example, if you can't manage an hour of gym time, make time for several 10-minute walks or ride your bicycle to work to get a quick, relaxing workout in.Opt for activities you enjoy. For example, if you hate jogging, try a yoga class, swimming, or roller skating instead.
It's important to work up to a fitness level gradually over time. Talk to your doctor before beginning or intensifying any workout regimen to ensure your body is healthy enough to handle physical activity.

, Social support is tremendously important if you're dealing with serious stress problems. You can find social support by reaching out to friends, relatives, or even coworkers who you trust and with whom you have a good rapport.Build your social support network with people you can trust.
Think about which trustworthy people in your life are most easy to talk to. For example, a relative who works full-time and has several children at home may not be as easy to reach as a single friend who works part-time.
Let the people in your support network know about stressful events in your life. Ask if you can call, text, or visit them during troubling times.
Make sure you also ask your friends and relatives how they're doing and spend time talking or hanging out when things are going well in your life, too. That way they won't feel like you're only contacting them when you need help.

, Many people pile on unnecessary stress by taking a perfectionist attitude. You may feel like everything needs to be done perfectly all the time, whether it's at work, school, or just keeping the house in order. While this type of outlook may help you feel more productive at work, it can be very damaging over time.Try to observe your thoughts and stop yourself whenever you find yourself thinking, ""I need to,"" ""I must,"" or ""I have to."" Catch yourself any time you find yourself thinking other people or situations need, must, or have to be a certain way.
Wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it against your skin anytime you engage in these ""should"" thought patterns.
Once you catch yourself and snap the rubber band against your wrist, try to actively replace that thought with something more positive and accepting.
For example, you might think something like, ""I wish things were different, but the situation is what it is. I can't change it, so I'll find ways to accept it and make the best of it.""
If you're really struggling with how to change your outlook, a qualified therapist may be able to help. Ask your doctor whether therapy may be right for you.

Write down which activities or situations make you feel best.,
Reflect on those situations that you anticipate the most.,
Recall your most noteworthy achievements.,
Pay attention to the skillset you use at work or school.,
Keep a journal.",How to Find Your Strengths when You Have Anxiety2," Think about the times you feel most energized and engaged, and try to pinpoint what you like about those situations. The activities that make you feel most like yourself probably make use of your strengths. Make a list of the ones you come up with.For instance, if you feel most alive when you work on a project with other people, communication and teamwork might be a couple of your strengths.

, Which activities do you love writing down in your planner? If you find yourself looking forward to particular events, activities, or challenges, it’s a good bet that they involve your strengths.For example, if you look forward to going back to school every year, learning is probably one of your strengths.

, Look back over the last few years and think about your achievements, big and small. Identify the ones that make you feel best about yourself and your abilities. Then think about whether those achievements have anything in common.For instance, if you’re proud of winning a dance competition and acing a big test, one of your strengths might be staying cool in high-pressure situations.
Consider keeping a running log of your achievements.

, Your “work personality” can give you valuable information about your strengths. Ask yourself which of your skills and abilities serve you best as you complete your everyday responsibilities, and think about your go-to strategy when you need to solve a problem.For example, if you get your projects done by working quickly and efficiently on your own, your strengths might include being self-directed and motivated.

, Writing in a journal regularly is a good way to track your behavior and feelings, which can give you insight into your strengths. Make a habit of writing daily or weekly, and look for patterns in your thoughts and actions.This can be a good counterbalance to your anxious thoughts and behaviors.

"
"
Ask for other people’s opinions on your strengths.,
Notice the times when you are praised by others.,
Take a quiz.",How to Find Your Strengths when You Have Anxiety3," Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to get an accurate look at ourselves. Ask your friends, family members, and co-workers for their honest opinion on your strengths. Pay attention to patterns and similarities in their replies.Ask a wide variety of people to get a well-rounded picture of your personality. For instance, instead of just asking family members, try asking an old friend, a co-worker, and a classmate as well.
Some people may give you constructive criticism or tell you about your weaknesses as well. Don’t ask for anyone’s opinion unless you are prepared to deal with this.

, As someone with anxiety, you may not often focus on your strengths or think about how to build on them. Ask yourself what kind of positive feedback you get from your friends, bosses, and teachers. If people frequently point out that you’re good at something, it’s probably one of your strengths.For example, your best bud might say, ""Gee, I wish I was as creative as you. My art project was terrible."" This demonstrates that they think you're creative, which may be a strength of yours.

, Character self-assessments can help you get a more objective look at your personality. The University of Pennsylvania’s VIA Survey of Character Strengths is one well-known questionnaire for finding your strong points. University career centers also usually offer tests that help you identify your strengths.Answer the questions honestly, or your results won’t be accurate.

Aggravates allergic and inflammatory skin conditions

, Not only it fuels the skin conditions but also plays havoc with normal skin beauty and makes it look dry dull and lifeless.


b) Increase production of stress mediators /hormones in body
Pituitary ACTH stimulates adrenal cortisol and glucocorticoid production. Stress influences cellular and humoral immune responses by releasing glucocorticoid, catecholamine, and CRH prolactin, substance P, and nerve growth factor and POMC peptide secretion as well as by altering cytokine profiles (Elenkov and Chrousos, 1999) initiating a chemical cascade or chain reaction of skin and body damage.
c) Depletion of feel good hormones in the body
The neuropeptides can create inflammation and an uncomfortable skin sensation, such as numbness, itching, sensitivity or tingling.
Neuropeptide also travel to the brain and ultimately increase the reuptake of neurotransmitters – meaning that stress depletes the chemicals that regulate our emotions, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
Darkening of Skin and reduced immunity.
Neorpeptite also trigger Melonocyte Secreting hormone (MSH) which increase melanin and darkens the skin. Since melanocytes (melanin secreting cells) are linked to Langerhans skin cells linked to immunity there stress also weakens the immune system and makes it prone to free radical damage and diseases.
Stress can also impair the ability of the skin to act as a protective outer layer. Stress can make the skin more permeable, more sensitive and more reactive, which is why dermatologists recommend the use of over-the-counter moisturizers to enhance the skin barrier function.
Skin becomes more prone to inflammation and infections. If stress compromises the skin’s barrier function, more irritants, allergens, and bacteria can penetrate the skin and cause problems. Specifically, stress can make a person’s rosacea more red or acne lesions more inflamed and more persistent. It can worsen hives, fever blisters, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.
Stress has Psycho social affects and could make us complex, socially withdrawn, lethargic, lack of enjoyment/sleep and taste in food, sex and other pleasurable activities until our quality of life goes worst.

Find a private place.,
Create a safe place in your mind.,
Imagine how your safe place feels.,
Bring the feeling of your safe place to tense areas of your body.,
Spread the feeling throughout your body.,
Relax and stay awhile.",How to Destress in 10 Minutes1," Using your imagination to surround yourself with calming imagery can help you reduce stress.To begin, find a private place to relax for ten minutes.


Find a quiet place where you can be alone. It be on your break from work, in your car (parked), in the bathroom, or at home.
Turn off your phone so that nothing will distract you. This is time is for you and you alone. Think of it as a 10 minute vacation from daily stressors of life.;
, Focus your mind on a place you feel safe and calm. It could be a beach in Hawaii. It could be forest, a campground at night with the crackling of fire, any place that makes you feel calm. It can be real or imaginary.You can use any imagery that focuses your attention on feelings of relaxation. Your safe place can be a memory of any place that makes you feel relaxed. Or you can imagine a fantastical place, like in the clouds or in the stars.

, Try to imagine, as vividly as you can, the physical feeling of your safe place. Imagine as many sensory details as you can.Think about how the salt of the ocean smells. Imagine the feel of sand on your feet, the sounds of the waves crashing in your ears, the warmth of the sun on your skin. Involve all your senses in creating your visualization experience.

, Notice places in your body that are holding tension and stress as you visualize your relaxation place. Consciously bring all the sensations of your imaginary retreat to the areas of your body that are physically stressed.For example, many people hold a lot of tension in their shoulders and neck. If you are imagining you are on a beach, focus the rays of sunlight, the salty air, or the feelings of being in the water on to your shoulders. Feel them relax into the visualization.

, As you breathe and imagine yourself in your relaxation place, start a full body scan. Start at your head and move all the way down to your feet.Concentrate on your head being in your relaxation place, and breathe. Next, focus on your shoulders, and breathe. Become conscious of your arms, torso, midsection, and hips all being fully immersed in your visualization. All the while, breathe deeply into each part of your body. Then focus on your legs, knees, calves and finally your feet.
Breathe yourself into your visualization while you continue to take in the sights, sounds, the feelings, and smells of your imaginary haven.

, This technique can help you feel less stressed in as little as 10 minutes. You can also use this technique when you have more time. There is no such thing as over-doing it on relaxation!


Once you feel some relief from stress, open your eyes. Take a few minutes to adjust to your surroundings, then continue with your day.

For others it may be more subtle, or they may try to suppress their feelings until stress is expressed physically in the form of fatigue, muscle aches, tightness, pain, headaches, and sometimes even GI problems. Irritability and overreacting to small annoyances are other subtle signs of stress.Try to identify how you experience stress.


Once you have identified your personal symptoms of stress and what it feels like to you, it can help you identify triggers. So if you notice that every Sunday night you experience significant stomach pain, GI issues, or nausea, then possibly Monday morning work or school is a significant stressor.;
, An important step in reducing day-to-day stress is identifying its causes. Throughout your typical day, take note of what things cause you the most stress. You may even want to keep a journal in which you jot down stressful events.You may find certain things only cause a minor amount of stress. Getting out the door on time, for example, may be a little stressful, but not a major cause for concern.
Other things may cause you a lot of stress. Maybe morning traffic really stresses you out. Maybe you dislike engaging with a negative colleague at work. Take note of any moments when your stress level spikes and you notice those symptoms of stress in your body or mood.

, There is a lot of stress you simply cannot control. You can't, for example, choose your co-workers or control morning traffic; however, there are some stressors you may be able to avoid.For example, maybe you frequently go to bed stressed. Think about what you do before bed. Maybe you watch the news and get anxious and upset over what's going on in the world. You could listen to the news on your radio in the morning and watch something pleasant at night.
If you really dislike something like grocery shopping, try going when you know the store won't be crowded. You can even order groceries online.
If someone at work stresses you out, you can lessen contact. Try avoiding the break room when you know that co-worker is present. Keep conversations short and professional in order to avoid getting sucked into small talk.
You might even be able to eliminate the stress of traffic by seeing if you can go into work earlier to miss the rush or if there are other options like taking the train.

, In the moments when you feel stressed out, perspective is important. When faced with day-to-day stressors, take a moment to consider the bigger picture.Remember, stress is temporary. The factors causing stress will pass. If you're worried about a report for work, think to yourself, ""By the end of the week, it'll be done. I won't have to worry about it anymore.""
Accept that you're feeling anxious over something. If you try to repress stress, that can actually make it worse. While accepting your anxiety, keep reminding yourself emotions are fleeting. You can repeat some kind of mantra like, ""This too shall pass,"" to help combat your stress.

, Throughout the day, try to say and think nice things about yourself. If you have a positive attitude overall, you will be less prone to feeling stress.Never say anything to yourself you would not say to another person. For example, you may find yourself thinking things like, ""You're so stupid and that's why you screwed up,"" or, ""No one is going to like you, so why bother going out?""
Replace these phrases with more pleasant ones. Think things like, ""I will get through this. I am competent,"" and, ""You're going to have fun tonight because you're pleasant to be around.""

, One of the biggest causes of stress is overcommitment. This is often caused by social relationships. You may feel like you have to say, ""Yes"" to everything. If the PTA board needs someone to help organize a meeting, you'll say, ""Yes."" If a friend needs you to watch her cat for the weekend, you'll say ""Yes."" Identify when you should say, ""No.""Know what your limits are. If you have too much on your plate a certain week, it's okay to turn down extra commitments. Just because you reasonably could do something doesn't mean you have to, especially if it's going to cause excess stress.
For example, you have a busy work week and some social commitments on the weekend. Your friend, who is a 30 mile drive from you, wants you to check in on her cat while she's away. Technically, you could do this, but it would cause a lot of stress.
You do not have to commit. You are never obligated to do someone a favor, especially if it's at the expense of your emotional wellbeing. Say something like, ""I'm sorry. I can't this week. I have too much on my plate. Good luck finding someone else.""

, Socialization is important for stress management. Your life should not revolve around work or school. Carve out some time each week to spend with close, valued friends.Choose people who do not stress you out. If you've had a long week at work, do you really want to spend Friday night with a friend who's always dramatic? Instead, select people who energize you rather than drain you.
You can talk about your stress to others. This can help you vent and get it out of your system. The people who care about you will be happy to listen. If you need to talk about your week, have dinner with a few good friends on a Friday night.

, Some people are difficult. Whether it's a friend, family member, or co-worker, there may be someone in your life who simply causes you a lot of stress. Set firm boundaries with this person to reduce your overall stress load.Do not feel guilty about setting certain boundaries with someone. You should never put your emotional wellbeing behind someone else's need for contact. If you feel drained in someone's presence, that person may be taking advantage of you.
Be direct and assertive without being hostile. You can let someone know which behaviors cross a line. For example, your friend Mary sends a lot of negative texts each day and does not seem to respond to any kind of feedback or advice. It's okay to text something like, ""Mary, I care about you as a person, but I don't have the energy to deal with these texts all day. I am sorry you're going through this, but I think you need more support than I am able to give right now.""

, Oftentimes, empathetic people are prone to stress. If you care about the people in your life, you may worry about them as well. Try to remember that care and worry are two different things. It's okay to care about someone, but do not let that care slip into the realm of excessive worrying.If you care about your friends and family members, there are things you can do. You can visit your elderly grandmother. You can call your brother if he's had a rough work week. You can send your cousin a care package if she lost her job. These are examples of caring.
Worrying is different from caring. You can worry all day, at work or school, about a friend or family member; however, you are not accomplishing anything by worrying. Nothing is getting done. Care for the people in your life but try not to obsess over their problems, especially during times when your mind should be elsewhere.

, Simply focusing on your breathing is a classic relaxation technique. One major benefit is you can do this anywhere. If you're stressed at work, for example, take a moment to breathe slowly and methodically.Before you begin breathing, try to interrupt your thoughts, get comfortable, and release tension from your muscles.
First, focus on your breath. Be aware of your current breathing rhythm. Shift from fast and shallow breathing to slow abdominal breathing.
Place your hand on your chest and the other over your navel. Breathe in a way that the hand on your navel rises. You want to breathe slow enough that you take six deep breaths in a minute.

, This technique involves tensing and releasing various muscles in the body. It can be done to unwind after work or school. It can also be done before bed to help prep you for sleep.Moving from your head to your feet, tense muscle groups for about five seconds and then release. Notice the difference you feel when your muscles are no longer tense.
For example, tense your shoulders, count for five seconds, and then release. Spend about ten seconds paying attention to the new feeling in your shoulders before moving on to your arms.
Continue the exercise until you've tensed and released the muscles in your body from head to toe.

, Trying to laugh even just a few times a day can have great effects on stress. Watching funny cat videos on the train to work or finding your five-year-old's endless ""why"" questions amusing rather than annoying seem small, but it begins to set up a mindset in which you try to find the joy or irony in even they tough things in life.Laughter raises and then lowers your stress response, leaving you feeling more relaxed. It also releases endorphins, which are ""feel good"" hormones., Guided imagery involves imagining a peaceful scene utilizing all your senses. You can try simple visualization. For example, when you feel stressed, take a mental vacation to a pleasant place. You can also find many recordings that can guide you through relaxing imagery.Audio programs are available online. You can download some and put them on a portable electronic device. When you feel yourself getting tense, listen to the guided imagery program.
Really commit to using all your senses. Imagine how a given scene feels, sounds, smells, tastes, and looks.

, A local community center may offer these types of classes. Yoga, meditation, and tai chi can help you better regulate stress by channeling your energy to the present moment.If you can't find a class in your price range, try to see if you can find routines online. A site like YouTube, for example, can provide many options for yoga routines.

, Simply moving around throughout the day can greatly reduce your stress level. If you don't exercise regularly, begin an exercise program. This can help you better manage your emotions and may eliminate some stress in your life.Pick an activity you enjoy, as you'll be more likely to stick to it. For example, if you enjoy long and aimless walks, try to walk a few miles a day after work.
Ease into any new routine. You will have to start small, especially if you haven't exercised regularly in awhile.
It's a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise program, especially if you have a chronic heart condition.

, Poor sleep can worsen existing stress. Make a commitment to getting a solid block of sleep each night. You may find yourself feeling less stressed throughout the day.Stick to a sleep schedule. This will help your body's natural circadian rhythm. You'll feel tired at bedtime and energized in the morning. Even on weekends, try to wake up and fall asleep at the same time each day.
Choose a relaxing bedtime ritual that you engage in away from bright lights. For example, read a book or do a crossword puzzle. Bright lights from electronic screens can make it difficult to sleep, so put these away when you start getting ready for bed.
Make sure your bedroom is sleep friendly. Block out any unwanted noise and keep the temperature between 60 and 67°F (15.6 and 19.4°C). You may have to get a fan or air conditioner.

, If you're very busy especially, you may not actually make time for yourself to relax. Many people see fun and relaxation as self-indulgent. For your emotional wellbeing, however, relaxing should be a priority.You probably have more time than you think you do. Find a chore or obligation you could cut down on. For example, maybe you don't need to do the dishes immediately after dinner. Let them sit in the sink overnight, and take that time to do something you enjoy.
You can read a book, watch a movie, go for a walk, or call a friend. Do anything that helps you unwind. It's important to incorporate fun and levity into your day-to-day life.

, If you're not eating healthy, this can affect your mood. Try to cut out things like sugar and processed food and replace them with whole wheats, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables.Try to eat three meals a day. Never skip breakfast, as this can set the tone for a stressful day. If you're in a rush, at least grab a banana or a cup of yogurt on your way out the door.
Eliminate things like tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol. These can all raise your stress level.

Walking in nature can help boost the stress-relieving effects of mindful walking. Many people find nature peaceful. It can be a good escape from a busy, city life. , Mindfulness is just another word for paying attention.As you walk, take note of how your body feels. You aren't trying to change anything at this point, just be conscious of the feelings in your body.Don't just walk with a flurry of racing thoughts going through your head. Instead, pay attention to your body and your environment as you walk. Mindful walking is about giving yourself a break from all the stressful thoughts that may be going through your mind.Notice how your feet feel with each step. Be aware of your posture; if you are standing up straight or bent forward or hunched over. Notice if your hips feel tense or tight. Take note of how you swing your arms. Notice how you breathe while you are walking.

, After you've taken stock of your body feels, focus on the world around you. Pay attention to colors that are around you. Focus on your environment, whatever it may be.Look at the scenery around you, the buildings if you are in the city, or the nature if you are somewhere that has plants. Look to see if there is anything on the ground, or what the sky looks like on this particular day.
Try to immerse yourself fully in the objects that are all around you, rather than thinking about other things.

, Once you get used to being present in your body and environment, begin to shape your breathing and posture. Stand straight and take deep breaths.


With each step, imagine that there is a string holding you up from the crown of your head. This string goes through your entire body and is connected to your feet.
Become aware of your breathing, and consciously take breaths from the bottom of your belly.
Walk as quickly or slowly as you want and your ability allows, while remaining aware of your movements, environment, and breathing.

, If you find your mind drifting to thoughts about anything other than walking, breathing, or your surroundings, notice your thoughts and let them pass. Return your attention back to your feet, the imaginary string holding up your head, and your surroundings.


You may have to practice returning your attention back to walking, but that is a part of the exercise. All that matters is that you are noticing your thoughts, then returning to mindfully walking.
It doesn’t matter how many times your mind may stray back. The only thing that is important is that you are walking with the intention to relieve stress. Just keep returning your mind’s attention to your walking.

Practice belly breathing.,
Take grounding breaths.,
Try full body breaths.,
Use a podcast or internet video.,
Combine breath work with visualization.",How to Destress in 10 Minutes3," Breath work can help relieve stress quickly and in any situation. Deep breathing lowers blood pressure and heart rate and oxygenates the body. All these help promote feelings of relaxation. Belly breathing is just what it sounds like: breathing from the belly.Place one or both hands on your belly and breathe right into your hands. Many of us only breathe into our upper chest cavity, which actually activates the stress response. This cause more feelings of stress.
Take ten minutes to sit comfortably with your hands on your belly and just breathe.
Try to focus your mind on your breath, letting all your stressful thoughts pass through your mind as though they are cars on a highway.
Listen to the sounds your body makes as it breathes. Feel the rise and fall of your belly underneath your hands.
Pay attention to the places in your body that are holding tension, such as your neck, shoulders, arms, or knees. Breathe all the tension through your hands into your belly.

, Grounding breaths are a type of deep breathing in which you imagine the stress in your body leaving through your feet. Here is how it's done:Sit with your feet planted firmly on the ground. Imagine there is a string holding up your head from above. Now, imagine two heavy, metal rods that are attached to the bottoms of your feet and connect you to the earth. Feel the heaviness of the rods weighing your body down.
Focus on your feet and breathe from the top of your head all the way down to your feet, all the way down through the metal rods and into the earth.
Once you have done two or three breaths like this, imagine all the things you are stressed about flowing from the top of your head out through the bottoms of your feet. Let them flow down through the metal rods and into the ground.
For example, lets say work has been particularly stressful for you. Imagine all the stressful things about your work flowing out of your head and down through the rods. The task that kept going wrong, your irritation with a coworker, and the problem with the printer should all flow into the ground.
Give yourself permission to release your responsibilities for these 10 minutes. Your goal is to be in your body and let go, clear your head, and lighten your mood.

, This type of breath work focuses on your entire body and helps to relieve stress physically. It helps encourage healthy spinal and organ movement, as well as the flow of oxygen and lymphatic fluid throughout the body.It is a process of breathing deeply, imagining the break entering each part of your body. As you do, you'll release the stress in each area. Here's how it's done:Begin by belly breathing.
After taking a few deep belly breaths, begin relaxing yourself from head to toe.
Breathe into your head, noticing your skull, forehead, eyes and ears. Consciously relax any tension you might become aware of in these areas.
Next, focus on your shoulders. Then move down your arms, and elbows, and imagine breathing out through your hands.
Breathe into your torso, feel and relax your rib cage, sternum and digestive organs.
Breathe into your hips, and again, keep noticing and breathing away any tension you might become aware of.
Breathe into your thighs, relaxing and releasing. Then breathe into your knees, calves and finally your feet.

, There are many guided breath work videos and podcasts available on the internet. Do a quick internet search, try out some different styles of guided breathing and see if they work for you..


Having a voice and instruction to keep your breath focused can help you stay focused.There are also apps that you can download on your mobile device so you can take your guided breath work videos with you anywhere. This can be a great place to start practicing breath work if you are finding it difficult to focus and sit still.

, This combination can be very useful when dealing with stress. It is also easy to combine these two techniques.


For example, you might imagine you are inhaling a cleansing color, such as white or blue, and exhaling a grey plume of smoke. With each breath, try to feel the cleansing color absorbing into every part of your body. When exhaling, imagine all stress being released in the grey plume.
This method of breath work can be helpful if you have had some kind of stressful conflict at work or in your personal life. It also works well if you are feeling overwhelmed by your responsibilities, or just over burdened by life in general.

Realize that stress and worry are intertwined; the more you prepare, the less you will have to worry and stress about.,
Read the notice for the audition carefully.,
Prepare your monologue.,
Practice, practice and practice.,
Rehearse your monologue a few more times the night before your audition.,
Try meditation or exercise.,
Prepare your clothes so you won't have to deal with it in the morning and have your dinner.,
Before you go to bed, read a book or magazine.,
Wake up when your alarm goes off and do a quick exercise.,
Fuel up.,
Avoid last-minute stress.,
Before going on stage, take a deep breath.,
Push anxiety and stress out of your mind as you perform.",How to Deal with Stress in Acting Auditions," You're likely to be nervous about your audition regardless of how well you prepare; however, being well prepared can help you feel confident that you're not missing anything. It can help you avoid worry and stress at the last minute.;
, Make sure you don't miss anything out. Ignoring the small print could result in disaster when you show up in full costume when it was clearly specified not to.

, Sometimes directors will give out a monologue for you to perform and sometimes you may have to prepare one yourself. Go for a monologue that goes with the kind of play you're auditioning for. For example, if you are auditioning for Hamlet, you wouldn't pick out a monologue from Hairspray.

, Find as much time as you can for practicing. Read a line a few times then put down your paper and try to repeat it as far as you can go. Remember, don't just say the lines, act them! The director/s are looking at your ability to portray a character, not to simply stand there and read a couple lines.

, However, don't spend the whole night dwelling and stressing. If you've prepared well in the previous weeks, you won't need to do much last-minute rehearsal. After a few practice runs, put your script or notes away and try to clear your head.

, Doing something physical can help divert your attention and get your mind off the stress.

, Make sure you don't have anything too heavy as you don't want to wake up the next morning with a stomach ache.

, Avoid watching TV, as this works up the brain and makes it harder to sleep. Set your alarm to go off at least two hours before your audition if it is in the morning. Set it for earlier if the audition area is a long way from your home.

, This will get your blood pumping and will wake you up faster. Another good idea would be to splash cold water on your face.

, Don't skip breakfast, as it is the most important meal of the day. It will give you your needed energy. Eat something healthy and avoid fast food or pizza

, Get to your audition at least 15 minutes early unless it is impossible. This will show the director that you are organised and keen to audition.

, Remember that whatever you are going to do you are going to do great! The directors will be impressed and you will feel much better with yourself.


When you are on stage, introduce yourself and explain what monologue you are doing. Don't talk too much; remember, there are other people.
When the director tells you to go on, look down at your feet and get into character. Then, suddenly, transform and show the director that the person standing on stage is completely different than the one they just spoke to.

, Focus on the words and emotions, rather than where you are or what you're doing. If you are embarrassed, then focus on something in the room and avoid looking at the audience."

If you have a concrete sense of what you will be tested on, the future test will feel less vague and more like something you can handle.If you aren't clear on anything, ask your teacher. Teachers would much rather answer questions than have their students proceed without understanding what's expected.
Make sure you have read your syllabus and any information your teacher has given you before asking the question. Your teacher won't be pleased if you send her an email asking when the test in if it's specified on page 1 of the syllabus.;
, There is a phenomenon in psychology called context-dependent memory. It refers to the idea that we are best able to remember things in environments similar to when the information was encoded . A related phenomenon is called state-dependent memory, which means that our memory is better when we learn and retrieve information in similar bodily states.If you will be in a quiet room during your exam, try to simulate those conditions while you prepare. This is using context-dependent memory to your advantage.
As an example of state-dependent memory, if you prepare for your exam using caffeine, your memory on test day may be better if you have a similar amount of caffeine then, too.Use this knowledge and know that you are taking evidence-backed steps to maximize your exam score; keep that in mind if you are feeling stressed about your upcoming exam.

, Do not just rely on your memory or your course book. Take your class time seriously by taking notes summarizing what your teacher has said. If you are feeling exam stress, you can review your notes; this will help you remember things that happened in class that you didn’t even take notes on, further giving you a sense of mastery over your material.


When taking notes, focus on jotting down keywords and key ideas, rather than trying to take dictation. Copying out the exact sentences is not as important as getting down the main ideas.Review your notes weekly. This will help you learn the material and transfer it to long-term memory. When it comes time for the exam, you'll feel much better prepared.

, Do not just cram for an exam last minute; this will surely lead to exam stress. Break up your study time into chunks over days, or weeks even. When you ""chunk"" your study time over the course of a longer period of time, such as a few days or weeks, you will retain more of the information.If possible, because of state-dependent memory, try to study at around the same time of day as you will be taking the test. This way you will be similarly tired/awake when you study and when you take your test. You will be used to how you feel when dealing with your course material on test day.

, Think about the kinds of factors that allow you to be most comfortable and relaxed as you prepare for your exam. When setting up a dedicated study space:


Track the level of light in the room. Some people study better with light, others study better in dimmer light.
Examine your work space. Decide whether you work better with a bit of clutter or if a clean, fresh work space is what you prefer.
Pay attention to background noise. Does music help you concentrate or do you need a quiet environment in which to study?
Find an alternate place to study such as a library or coffee shop. A change of scenery can give you a fresh look at the material and also provide additional resources., According to psychology studies, the average human brain can only focus on one task effectively for about 45 minutes. In addition, research in neuroscience suggests that focusing on the same thing for too long diminishes the brain's ability to accurately process it., Be sure to drink plenty of water. Aim for at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of water per day. Not drinking enough water can make you feel sluggish and stressed.Caffeine can make you feel anxious, which can contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety. Have a cup of coffee or a cola if you like, but don't go overboard.Experts recommend getting no more than 400mg of caffeine per day for adults.Kids and teens should limit themselves to about 100mg per day (one cup of coffee or 3 colas).A cup of herbal tea can help you feel more relaxed and stay hydrated. Peppermint, chamomile, and passionflower are good choices., If you are feeling stressed about an exam, be sure to reward yourself for your study time. This will motivate you to continue studying and may even reduce stress.For example, after studying hard for an hour, take a break and play on the internet for 20 minutes or watch an episode of a TV show that you enjoy. This will help you get your mind off the exam while acting as a motivational carrot that may help you pick up studying again after your break.

, Regular aerobic exercise can relieve stress, so if you find yourself a nervous wreck before an exam, go for a run or hit the gym.When you work out, listen to upbeat music that keeps you motivated throughout your workout.
For other ways to beat stress, see this handy wikiHow: Relax Before a Final Exam in College.
Meditate or do yoga after your upbeat excercise. This lets the mind focus and calm down

, When you eat unhealthy foods it can make you feel negative, which can interfere with your exam preparation. Therefore, it is important to eat right if you want to have the best odds of doing well on your exam and not stressing about it. Try eating lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.Avoid too much sugar or heavily processed food.
Part of eating healthy involves having a balanced diet. Try not to eat too much of only one food source. You can usually get variety in your diet by changing up the type of cuisine you eat every couple of nights.
Try having a bit of time to do yoga or meditation after other excercise to calm your brain down. Remember to breath in through your nose and out through your mouth heavily.

, Not getting a full night’s rest can contribute to feelings of fatigue, stress, and anxiety.If you have trouble sleeping, try making your bedroom pitch black. Block out sounds by changing your environment and/or wearing earplugs.
Get into a routine and follow it every night. Take note of how many hours a night of sleep you need in order to feel refreshed in the morning; get that many hours of sleep every night.
For example, if you tend to be in bed by 10:30 PM then read for 30 minutes before falling asleep, stick to that schedule as often as possible. In this way you will train your body for sleep.See this helpful wikiHow, Sleep Before Final Exams, for more advice.

, It may be the case that you have something like ADHD or other learning disability that impairs your ability to perform well on an exam. This may be stressing you out but know that schools often have resources to help you excel in school.If this is a concern for you, be sure to reach out to a school counselor or teacher for how to proceed in getting help.

, Without a proper breakfast your energy levels will quickly crash and may lead to stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Be sure to have a healthy, energy packed breakfast on exam day. Try eating foods that provide long lasting energy, such as eggs or oats. Avoid foods that are high in sugar, which will give temporary energy but may cause you to crash mid-exam., Being dehydrated negatively affects how efficiently the brain works. Be sure to stay hydrated before your exam; drink down some water with breakfast!If you're allowed to, bring a water bottle with you to your exam. Thinking is thirsty work! Just don't be surprised if your teacher asks to examine the bottle, as some students have tried to cheat by writing answers on bottle labels.(Don't do that -- cheating is never worth it, and if you get caught, you'll be in way more trouble than you would if you'd just done poorly.

, As tempting as it may be, don't have too much coffee/caffeine before your exam. Caffeine can increase feelings of anxiety and stress. If you are going to be stressed during your exam, caffeine will only exacerbate these feelings and make them more difficult to keep in check.That said, do not drastically change your typical caffeine intake on exam day. This can cause withdrawal symptoms that may interact with your stress to make you feel especially negative.Caffeine in limited quantities may have a positive effect on your memory, so if you usually have a cup of coffee with breakfast, go ahead., You may be nervous about the test itself so there is no need for extra stress from fear of being late. Plus, by arriving early you will be sure to get the seat that you like., Before answering any exam questions, figure out exactly what is expected of you. Skim the test to see its content and give yourself a rough idea of how long each question will take to complete. Ambiguity can cause stress, so, by knowing how long the test is, you will reduce your stress.

, Take your time going through the exam. If you get stuck on a question for a long time, instead of getting stressed about it, keep in mind that it is just one question on the exam. If possible (if the way the test is structured allows it), skip that question and return to it at the end if you have time.Keep an eye on the clock and give yourself five to ten minutes to go over your answers to check for any mistakes or to guess on any questions that you initially skipped.

, Reduce your anxiety by chewing on some gum. This will keep your mouth busy and can act as a release for your anxiety., It doesn’t hurt to ask for clarification on something. She may or may not answer your question as it may give you an unfair advantage over other students, but you lose only a few seconds by raising your hand and asking., Once you realize you are suffering from anxiety, use some or all of the steps below to alleviate it. Test anxiety can appear in the form of a number of symptoms including:


Cramps
Dry mouth
Nausea
Headache
Rapid heartbeat
Restless thoughts
Mental blackouts
Trouble concentrating

, With your eyes closed, take three large breaths, then pause, exhale, and repeat the process. Large, deliberate breaths not only help relax the body, but also increase the flow of oxygen to the brain. Use this technique both before the test and during difficult areas of the exam.Inhale through your nose for a count of 4. Try to hold your breath for a count of 2, then slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of 4.

, For example, tighten your shoulders and slowly relax them, repeating the process in other tense areas of your body. Tightening muscles before relaxing them enhances the body's relaxation awareness, which relaxes the body even more., If allowed, get up and get a drink of water, use the bathroom, or simply stretch your legs if it will help you regain focus and decrease anxiety.

, Keep in mind that, in the grand scheme of your future, doing poorly on one exam will likely not be that impactful. We often overestimate how bad things will be and how poorly they will make us feel.Keep that in mind if you find yourself getting stressed out in the middle of your exam. It is probably not the end of the world if you do poorly. Life will go on and you can study harder for the next one!


If you catch yourself stuck in a negative thought loop, try to detach from it. Ask yourself: what's the worst that can really happen if I don't do well on this test? Try to remain logical about it. Can you really handle the worst that could happen? Chances are, the answer is yes.You can also think of alternatives if you find yourself stuck worrying over how important this exam is. You may be able to retake it. You may be able to make up your grade with extra credit. You can hire a tutor or study with friends for the next exam. This isn't the end of the world.

, Easier said than done, of course, but, try to keep in mind that once the exam is over, you can’t go back and change anything about how it went. So, avoid asking your friends what they put for certain questions if you think that will just stress you out.To avoid ruminating, or getting stuck in that ""broken-record loop,"" try the following tips:


Let go of the things you can't control. Ask yourself, ""what about my exam can I change at this point?"" If it is nothing, do your best to let it go.View your mistakes as opportunities to learn. From this perspective, getting a exam question wrong isn't something to be worried about.Try scheduling a worry break. Set aside 30 minutes and let all your worries out during that time. Think hard about the things you are stressed about. Then, once that 30 minutes is up, let it go.Exercise can also help you to get your mind off of your exam after it is done.Consult the wikiHow article Calm Post Exam Nerves for some more tips.

, Clear your mind from thinking about the exam by doing something you enjoy; try to pick an activity that you typically get lost in.


For example, if you get absorbed when you watch a movie or read a book, do that. If you get really into sports when you play them, get outside and play some sports!

, You can learn from your mistakes; remember that ultimately the goal of an exam is to assess your level of knowledge on a topic. This helps you to identify your strengths and weaknesses regarding your course content.Instead of being stressed about this information, try to view it as an opportunity for an accurate assessment of your knowledge, which you can then use to improve yourself.
Remember that your performance on an exam is not indicative of your worth as a person. You can do poorly on an exam and still be a good student.

, Eat some pizza or sushi or candy or buy yourself a new shirt; whatever treat you like that makes you happy for a few moments. Exams are very stressful but you made it through. Now relax a bit with something you enjoy then start preparing early for your next exam!

Focusing on the moment means not being stuck on past experiences, thoughts, or thinking patterns.To help you tune in more to the present, bring your thoughts and awareness to now. Sit quietly and focus your mind on what’s happening right now.


With practice, you can train yourself to focus on something more productive than feelings of regret.
Practice attending to your breathing. Focus on your breath, noticing your inhales and exhales.

, Chances are, if you’re caught up in regret, you’re not living presently. Focus on one sense at a time. For instance, start with sight and look around to observe what you notice. Really look with your eyes: notice colors, textures, movements, and contrasts of light and dark. Then tune into your hearing: listen to any noises occurring around you, from the hum of the air conditioner or footsteps across the hall. Slowly engage each sense one by one and bring yourself back to the moment.


By focusing on your senses, you’re allowing yourself to bring yourself back to the moment and distance yourself from regret.

, Learn to stop applying judgments and evaluations to yourself and to all of your actions. Don’t put yourself in the category of “good” or “bad” and instead, learn to accept yourself as you are. Accept that you are learning and growing every day, and each day is a step closer toward being a kinder, better version of yourself. Practice self-compassion by experiencing kindness, mindfulness, and connectivity with others.

Practice caring for and about yourself. Treat yourself like you would treat a best friend. Care about your own thoughts, feelings, actions, and reactions. When you feel like you’re not good enough, ask yourself, “What would I say to a friend feeling this way?”

, If your regret centers around someone who is deceased yet involves people who are living, sort out any unsaid apologies.If you can take action on something, do it, even if you feel embarrassed or ashamed. It’s best to say what needs to be said than to live in regret.


For example, if someone in your family died and there were problems with other members of the family, sort any issues that can be sorted.

, While regret may seem to be fully negative, there can be positive aspects to feeling regret. Regret can be functional, such as encouraging an addict to seek recovery. Regret can help you take another look at your choices and reconsider how you want to live moving forward. It can encourage you to look at your actions and see how they lead to negative consequences.

Then, you’re left with a choice: do you want to continue living in this way or would you like to make a change?

Regret may lead you to think about how you treat people in your life. For example, if someone you love died, you may regret not visiting enough or making time for this person. This can lead to a different approach to relationships where you begin to prioritize people in your life in a way that you never have before.

, Recognize that life exists as a journey, with many intersecting paths along the way. Instead of getting down on yourself or feeling like you’ve made mistakes, acknowledge that you’ve had opportunities to learn and grow. Perhaps the growth didn’t happen in the past, but recognize that it is happening now.If you regret not spending enough time with someone before he or she died, acknowledge the time you did spend together. Reflect on the positive aspects of the relationship, both what you cherish and what the other person cherished.

, While you cannot change the past, you can be grateful for it. Affirm the good memories and aspects of your relationship with this person. Even though the person has died, gratitude allows you to experience and celebrate the lasting effect of the person’s life in this present moment.

Think about what positive aspects this relationship had in your life and in this person’s life. Express gratitude for the role each of you played in each other’s life.
Giving gratitude has many lasting physical, emotional, and social benefits. Gratitude can also block negative emotions as it’s impossible to feel both grateful and upset at the same time.

Consider looking for a dance class.,
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Find the right environment.,
Choose how you want to dance.,
Select your music.,
Get water.",How to Dance to Relieve Stress1," If you are new to dancing, or if there is a certain type of dance you are interested in (for example, ballet or swing dancing), you might want to learn proper technique by enrolling in a class. This can help you keep from getting injured, and you’ll also get to learn a new skill.


A dance class is a great opportunity to meet new people and get good exercise.
Dance classes for people of all ages are offered at dance studios or through community recreation programs.;
, You will probably want clothes that provide a free range of motion that you don’t have to fuss with while dancing. In order to be focused on a full expression of movement, you will not want to be wearing clothes that will hold you back in any way.


For example, you may wish to wear athletic wear, loose-fitting clothing, or clothes with elastic waistbands.
Wear whatever footwear you find comfortable. If you are at home, you may wish to kick off your shoes and socks and dance barefoot.

, You may wish to go out dancing with a group of friends, which can be a great social activity, as well as stress relief and great exercise.If you are self-conscious about your dancing, you may prefer to dance at home. If you are concerned about what others think of your dancing, you won’t relax enough to let go of all the stress you are feeling, and that defeats the purpose!Consider these suggestions for dancing at home:


If you want privacy, lock the door or close the curtains.
Clear a space free of obstacles. You will need room for kicks, for jumps, for spinning around -- however you feel like dancing!
You may wish to dim the lights, particularly if you are dancing to slow, calming music.

, Do you want a slow, gentle, relaxing dance session, or fast, furious, and energetic? How you decide to dance may be dependent on your current mood and the feelings you wish to achieve.


How are you feeling right now? Take some time to check in with yourself. If you are feeling stressed out because you are angry, you might want faster-paced music. If you’re feeling sad, maybe you want slower music.
What kind of mood do you want to create? For example, say you had a hard day at work and argued with your boss. Perhaps you have some anger you are still holding onto from your confrontation, so you decide to blast some loud, empowering, energetic songs to get all your frustration out.
Consider the time of day. Do you want to dance to get energized and focused at the beginning of the day, or do you want to dance to relax and calm down at the end of the day? If you are a person who has a difficult time falling asleep at night, you may wish to forego energetic music at the end of the day for slower, calmer dancing.

, Choose music based on your mood and what kind of dancing you would like to do. You might have some tried-and-true favorites you always enjoy dancing to, or you may want to look for something new to better help you express yourself.


Spend some time finding songs you love to dance to beforehand. That way you will be ready to dance when the mood strikes!
You might wish to have playlists ready to go, named things like “Dancing to Relax Playlist” or “Up Tempo Energetic Dance Playlist.”
You can often find ready-made dance playlists at different streaming music services.

, Have a glass of water nearby to stay hydrated. You will get thirsty, especially if you are dancing to fast music!

Think about the reasons you are stressed out before you figure out how to fix it entirely.,
Deal with your Stage Fright.,
You are not at the mercy of them, they are at the mercy of you.,
Know the monologue.,
Memorize the monologue.,
Have a relaxing day before the auditions.,
Stop reading about how to cope with it and relax.,
Deep breathing, slow your heart rate down.,
When you get to the audition room, study the space.",How to Cope with Stress in a Monologue Audition,";
, For most people, all the stress can be pin pointed to the fear of doing it in front of others. Don't let the confidence of others fool you - every actor, old or young, new or experienced, is uncomfortable with the presence of an audience. And for a good reason. People inevitably will judge you based on your appearance, character, and acting. You are putting yourself out there for the world. But you need to get past that and stop caring about what they think of you.


Imagine this: Stop wanting to change everything about yourself and present yourself to the world. Walk in there, do your best, and if you are not what they're looking for, then that's fine. That's life and you gave them what you had. If they want want you, they'll call you back.

, Think about that. What every you do in the one to two minutes will monopolize everyone else in the room. They are forced to listen to you and respond to what you offer.

, As simple as this sounds, know it in your dreams. Your sleep. You will need a full two weeks or more to memorize it and a week to truly understand it. Don't try to memorize it at first glance, try to understand it. Print out two copies and mark one up with notes about acting and beats or places to pause. The other, color code it with markers into sections. Draw pictures about the sections. Draw the characters, their expressions and body language, the set, imagine it happening on a stage. Make sure you have read the play, and make sure you know all the information about it before it is asked.

, As discussed above, memorizing takes two weeks. Cramming a monologue into short term memory will stress you out more and cause you to forget it easily. There are many memorizing techniques, but perhaps the best for your brain is to start on the first line. Memorize it. And the second, and the third. Then recite them all three times. Move on to the next three or four, memorizing them individually. Recite it from the beginning three times. If you have memorized it, recite it constantly perfectly.

, Exercise, drink lots of water, and do not drink any energy drinks. Get a good night sleep for the energy you will need.

, Every one auditioning will be nervous, but look at it as an opportunity. The window will open for a minute, and it will close.

, Treat the day like any ordinary day, just conserve your energy.

, Study how it will become the environment of the monologue. You will become 1/2 actor and 1/2 your character. Be more of your character than anything.

Consider slowing down.,
Create the right mood.,
Express yourself through the music.",How to Dance to Relieve Stress3," When many people think about dancing for stress relief, they think about blasting loud music and bouncing around to the beat.

Dim the lights if possible.

, Use stretching movements with your arms and slow bending exercises to release the stress of the day from all parts of your body. Slowly move to the music. Think of stretching, expanding, and breathing.


Forget the problems that caused you the stress. Focus on the music and the movement of your body.

, It is not uncommon to become out of touch with your emotions to the point that sudden strong emotions, like sadness, surprise you.An important aspect of coping with a sad time and keeping sadness at bay is to know yourself and know your emotions. One way to access or explore this is to write. Write whatever you feel motivated to write. Write letters, poetry, songs, or journal. Try the following.


If your sad time involves a person, write a letter to them but don't send it.

Realize some of the causes of short-term stress.,
Know some of the causes of long-term stress.,
Do not use drugs or abuse alcohol in order to deal with stress.,
Know that stress can ultimately be prevented.",How to Control Stress1," Stress is physical or emotional tension or discomfort brought on by any perceived threat to our well-being.While some stress can be good — planning your wedding, for example — other types of stress can be hazardous to your overall health. In this article, we'll examine ways to curb the negative kind of stress.;
, Be on the lookout for both physical and emotional signs of stress. Here are some common ways stress affects people:


Physical signs
Tension
Loss of appetite
Weight gain or loss
Sleep problems
Headaches, back pains, and stomach problems
Non-physical signs:
Feeling numb towards one's feelings
Feeling powerless
Anger
Sadness or crying
Inability to focus
Worry

, Short-term stress is fleeting but powerful. Just because we know it's fleeting doesn't make it any less immediate. Short-term stress can be caused by :


Arguments
Feeling overwhelmed with too much work in too little time
Accumulations of small problems, like running late or getting a parking ticket

, Long-term stress is more pervasive. In some cases, it can be brought on by a positive event in one's life, such as getting a promotion or having a child.Long-term stress is arguably more hazardous to one's health because it can stew and fester for such a long time. With long-term stress, the sympathetic autonomic nervous system (ANS) initiates a fight or flight reaction semi-permanently, without ever letting the parasympathetic ANS relax the body and fully take over. Here are some of the common causes of long-term stress:


Death of a loved one or someone close to you
Experiencing a long-lasting illness or caring for someone with a long-lasting illness
Financial difficulties
Chronic problems at work or at home

, Dealing with stress is a difficult arrangement. Sadly, taking drugs or abusing alcohol in order to deal with stress doesn't do anything to fix the stress. In the long run, using drugs and alcohol as a crutch actually creates more problems than it solves., It may seem like stress is a constant in your life, but there are ways to keep stress from encroaching on your happiness in the first place. This is more than just stress management, or what you'll find below; this is stress prevention. How do you do it?


Plan ahead. If you have a bout of short-term stress before every midterm, for example, it's worth planning ahead. Start studying a couple days before you normally do, and study when your concentration is at its peak. Plan out your social engagements so that you have a break every so often. Planning ahead will sometimes prevent stress altogether.
Create an order of operations. Assign priorities to certain tasks, and get the high-priority tasks done first and the low-priority tasks done later. Signing up for health insurance and signing up for the latest soccer tournament should not have equal priority. Prioritize accordingly.
Prepare for potentially stressful events. If you know a stressful event is on the horizon, prepare for it mercilessly. That way, when it comes time to give a presentation, for example, you'll feel confident that you have what it takes to deliver it effectively.

Ask yourself: Is there really anything I can do about the situation?,
Learn not to sweat the small stuff.,
Fight stress with physical activity.,
Try meditation and breathing exercises.,
Get social.,
Distract yourself.,
Focus on the positive.,
Be simple.,
Try managing stress with music therapy.",How to Control Stress2," Take a step back. Look for some perspective. Sometimes, we get stressed about situations over which we have absolutely no control, like being stuck in a traffic jam. Letting the mind know that it's okay to relinquish control may be all you need in order to fight stress. So if you find out there's nothing you can do about your suddenly stressful situation, try not to worry about it.

, Related to but distinct from the issue above, this method is all about using perspective to reduce stress. Life is full of problems — some of them big, some of them small. People who successfully ward off stress are often good about letting the small stuff slide and focusing on the truly important things.


Remind yourself of everything that's good in your life. Even in the disastrous event that you lose your job, there's still something to be salvaged. Remind yourself of everything you have, whether it's a loving husband or wife, grateful children, or attentive family; good health and safety; a roof above your head and a floor beneath your feet; or enough money to make sure you have the basics covered. Reminding yourself of all the things that you do have will make not stressing about the small stuff that much easier.
Remind yourself of the times you have been happiest in your life; memories which put you at ease and calm you down. These memories can have a powerful relaxing effect.

, Feeling stressed? Then get on a bike and pedal out that anxiety. Put on your running shoes and jog around the track. Change into your trunks and take a couple laps around the pool. Controlling stress is sometimes as easy as getting up and moving about.

, When stress takes over, the sympathetic ANS pumps adrenaline and other hormones into the body to prepare it for action. Usually, the parasympathetic ANS eventually takes over and calms the body down. You can help the parasympathetic ANS take over by practicing meditation and breathing exercises.


Combine meditation and breathing into one exercise by doing the following: Sit down comfortably and close your eyes. Begin taking slow, measured breaths. Take note of where in your body the breaths originate. After a while, let your body breathe entirely on its own while still focusing on the breath. Notice which parts of the body your breathing moves: From your hands and feet to the top of your head. If you begin to think about anything other than breathing, set your concentration back on those breaths and how they affect your body., After getting stressed out, it's tempting to try to isolate yourself from people. But evidence shows that being around trusted and amicable people can help ease stress.It doesn't necessarily have to be your friends or family, although they are great social motivators; it can be acquaintances or simply people around in, say, in a coffee shop. Being around the right sort of people can do wonders for managing your stress.

, If your aim is improving concentration, distracting yourself probably isn't a very good idea. But that's not your aim, is it? Distraction can be an effective way of temporarily ignoring stress if you eventually use another method of controlling it (instead of just ignoring it).


Distract yourself by helping someone else. Change a stranger's tire. Help someone out with a buck. Help a senior across the street. Simple acts of kindness can reverberate if you let them.
Distract yourself with art. Beautiful images, videos, music, and games can all be used to keep you from fixating on a stressful event.
Distract yourself with a hobby. Pick your favorite thing to do in the world and do it. Chances are it's healthy and fun, and you're probably pretty good at it.

, It may sounds Pollyanna-ish, but it truly helps some people. There's almost always a silver lining in stressful situations. On a sheet, divide the situation into possible positive and negative outcomes. Then do something symbolic to the negative outcomes, like ripping them apart or burning them up. Take the positive outcomes and let them inform your thinking instead of the negative outcomes.

, Our modern lives can be pretty complicated and demanding. It's easy to feel like the world is guiding us rather than the other way around. In order to feel like you have more control over your own decisions, try simplifying aspects of your life. Take that vacation you've been putting off for five years. Set aside time to relax with a warm cup of tea. Take walks with your family. Try filling your life with simple things. It's those simple things that often have the most powerful effects.

, Music therapy is a breakthrough concept with a simple idea. Combine relaxation with music in order to fight stress, dementia, speech loss, rising blood pressure, and much more.Scientists have found that music therapy helps people calm their mind and body through its order, rhythm, and predictability. Find a nice spot to let loose, turn on some relaxing music, and help control your stress/

Make a stress-journal.It may sound a little counterproductive to dwell on your stress in a journal, but it's actually healthy if you learn to deal with stress.,
Start sharing your thoughts.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Carve out enough time in your day to sleep.,
Reward yourself, but don't rely too much on incentives.,
Ask for help.,
Reach out to a professional if these tips don't help you.",How to Control Stress3," Keep a journal with you at all times and write in it whenever you feel stressed. In your journal, jot down:


What caused the stress (if you're unsure, take an educated guess).
How you felt/feel, either physically or emotionally.
How you responded to the stress immediately.
What you did in order to make the stress go away.

, Being in a stressful situation can make you feel like you're alone on an island. Luckily, you're not. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, whether they are friends, family, co-workers, or acquaintances, can make you feel like a burden has been lifted from your shoulders.

, When your body is running low on fuel, or is only running on the wrong kind of fuel, it's hard to muster up energy to fight stress. During this time, stress can seem particularly frightening and be particularly exhausting. Therefore, it's important to get a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Here are the foods you should generally try to avoid in order to reduce the effects of stress:High-fat foods. Foods high in trans and saturated fats, like butter, certain cheeses, and fast foods, can sap our energy while increasing our risk of heart attack. Not a good way to fight stress.
Simple carbohydrates. Carbs like white bread, white rice, and baked goods (cakes, muffins, etc.) are processed quickly by the body and stored as fat. Better to stick with complex carbohydrates instead — foods like whole wheat bread and pasta, as well as brown rice.
Sugar. Sugars are simple carbs which enter and leave the body quickly, meaning they give us a quick jolt and then cause us to crash. This crashing can contribute to a sense of anxiety or stress.
Caffeine. We supplement much of our diet with caffeine from coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Like sugar, caffeine can cause us to crash if the body experiences a sudden drop-off. Having too much caffeine can also impair the body's natural sleep cycle.

, Stress and inadequate sleep can form a vicious cycle. On the one hand, a survey said that 2/3 of subjects associated their sleep problems with stress.On the other hand, another study found that for each hour of sleep you lose during the night, your risk of stress increases 14%.In other words, stress causes sleeplessness, and lack of sleep causes stress.

, It's okay to reward yourself when you manage to do something stressful. This gives us an incentive to work through difficult situations in order to do what we know is right. But don't rely on incentives in order to get you through stressful times. It can be unhealthy to always need an incentive. Sometimes you buckle down and do something because you want to do it or you know you should do it.

, Actively solicit the advice of others and entertain their ideas. You never know when another perspective will really hit home. Asking for help may mean putting aside your ego, but it's worth it. People are generally keen on lending a helping hand. (It makes them feel good about themselves.) Learn take advantage of that largesse.

, In some cases, chronic stress takes hold and doesn't let go. It can lead to anxiety and depression, which spawn a host of other problems. These need to be dealt with promptly in order to make sure stress levels don't hit an unbearable level.


If you feel like your stress is causing you to undergo significant lifestyle changes or is keeping you from doing things you would otherwise do, seek out the help of a professional.If you feel like your stress is causing you to self-medicate with drugs and/or alcohol, seek out the help of a professional.

Check-in with yourself.,
Try to get calm.,
Pause to think.,
Be clear and concise.,
Learn to listen actively.,
Be nice.,
Try being more assertive.,
Negotiate a compromise.,
Pay attention to your non-verbals.",How to Communicate More in Times of Stress1," In stressful times, you’ll want to know your triggers and make sure you’re relatively calm before communicating with others. If you’re too angry or too distracted, you may shut down and not listen to others as well or say what you mean.Check in with your body for these clues to see if you’re too stressed to talk:Muscle tightness
Stomach ache
Clenched fists
Rapid or shallow breathing
Flushed face;
, If you notice any clues in your body that you're too stressed to interact with others, try to get calm first. Practices like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing may help with stress management long-term, but might not be easy to implement in the moment if you feel like you're in the middle of a crisis. For quick stress relief, try to engage or focus in on one of your senses. By focusing in on a sensory experience, you'll feel more calm and reinvigorated to face the problem at hand. For example, you might try:Rubbing your neck and shoulders.
Petting your dog.
Lighting a favorite candle.
Sipping a hot tea or coffee.
Going for a short walk.

, You should also give yourself some time to calm down your thoughts before communicating with others. It’s important you’ve thought through what you need to say in order to get your points across to others well. This is particularly important during times of stress or crisis, when people may be more emotional, impatient, or prone to misunderstand you., Be specific about what you need or about what the problem is. Do not get off track and bring up more than one point at a time, or you'll confuse the other person. Try to speak with an even, clear tone of voice in order to get your point across more effectively and avoid upsetting who you're with.You can say, ""I need to talk about how we spend our money now that I've lost my job. I am worried about spending too much and wanted to brainstorm with you what we could do differently. Can we talk about this?""

, If you want to communicate effectively when you're stressed, you’ll need to learn to listen well, too. To truly listen, you’ll need to try to understand both the words and emotions behind what someone is saying. Listening well will actually lower stress for both of you and leave you both feeling like you understand each other. To listen well, you should:Avoid checking your phone or looking at other things while they’re talking.
Avoid interrupting.
Nod, smile, or say “yes” periodically to show you’re following along.
Reflect back what they said to make sure you understand.

, Being nice and showing empathy toward others will improve communication. You don’t have to agree with everything they say or feel, but try to put yourself in the other person’s position to understand them better. Some patterns of communication that are not nice and that you should avoid include:


Judging
Criticizing
Blaming
Name-calling
Telling someone how they “should” feel

, Being assertive is essential to communicating well with others, but does not mean you have to be mean. When you assert yourself, you're able to calmly and honestly express your needs, as well as listen to and respect what others need. To be more assertive, remember to:Value your own opinions, needs, and wants just as much as anyone else's.
Say ""no"" and know your limits.
Ask for help and feedback.
Recognize and seek clarity on the other person's needs or emotions.

, Sometimes in order to reduce stress for everyone you’ll have to reach a compromise. A compromise may be especially useful and beneficial to you and your relationship with the other person if the other person is more passionate about their point of view.Compromising shows that you've been listening, that you care, and that you're invested enough to work with the other person to find a solution that you both can live with.For example, you can say, ""Maybe I am being overly concerned about our spending. I'd be willing to cut down my spending on going out to eat and going to the movies, if you'd be willing to spend some time with me helping to budget for and plan meals. What do you think?""

, Make sure that your nonverbal behavior, including body language and tone of voice, matches with what you’re saying. Adjust your tone of voice so that you’re not yelling and making the other person scared, uncomfortable, or more stressed.Some other non-verbals to attend to:


Pacing
Clutching objects
Crossing your arms tightly
Making poor eye contact

, You might not be able to put out every fire at work, but try to resolve any conflicts that arise as quickly as possible, particularly during times of stress. This will ensure people feel safe and cared for at work. This will also show that their concerns are valid and answered., Encourage coworkers and employees to contribute suggestions to how the workplace could be changed.

, To reduce stress, hold regular meetings with your staff or coworkers. Make time to solve problems, build up your team, and recognize everyone’s accomplishments.Keep in mind not to have wasteful or unproductive meetings, which can make the situation more stressful and communication worse.

Make family meetings a tradition.,
Avoid blame.,
Cool off when you need to.,
Check in for understanding.,
Reassure your family.",How to Communicate More in Times of Stress3," Before and during times of stress, whether it’s something stressful occurring within the family or within the larger community, holding regular family meetings is an easy way for each family member to have time to share their concerns. Holding family meetings builds trust and allows a safe space for each member to get support. Successful ways to plan family meetings include:

Make the first part of the meeting fun and encouraging before moving into serious topics.
Keep the meeting brief.
Make everyone feel welcome to join the meeting, but don’t force them to come.
Let everyone have a turn speaking.
Come to a consensus or compromise based on what everyone can agree to.

, Avoid placing blame or using judgmental language toward your family members. Avoid statements that begin with “you,” which can sound like you’re accusing your family member of something. Instead, try expressing yourself with “I” statements. These statements look like:Name your feeling, “I feel…”
Name the situation, “when you…”
Explain how their behavior affected you, “because…”
Ask what you need in the future, “would you please…?”

, Know what your stress signals are and when things are getting too heated between family members to keep talking. Make sure you take a break when communication is too difficult, otherwise you might get trapped in blaming or criticizing other family members and not really listening to them. Take a break to do something fun or relaxing to reset.


You can say, “I think we all need to take a break for 15 minutes and come back to this later. Why don’t we go outside and play with the dog?”

, Don’t ever assume that you’re understanding what the other person is saying without checking in with them first. Checking in will help to avoid misunderstanding.You can ask:“What did you mean when you said…?”
“Did you mean/say…?”
“You feel___. Did I understand that right?”

, Especially if you have young children, it’s important to focus on the positive and be confident. State your assurance in your family’s ability to make it through the stressful time/situation.

Help your kids and other family members focus on the positive things that are going well. Remind them of everyone’s unique personal strengths and contributions to the family. Make sure they know you’re sticking together as a team."

Improve your mood with food.,
Improve your mood by getting active.,
Improve your mood by relaxing.,
Improve your mood with some of your favourite activities or try a new one.,
Improve your mood with a smile.",How to Chase the Blues Away," Eating junk food may be fun, but it will not help to get you out of your funk. There are some other choices you could make, however, that can help boost your mood:Coffee: A U.S. study, including 50,000 women conducted over 14 years, showed that women who drank coffee regularly suffered the effects of depression less than non-coffee drinkers. Yippee, another good reason to enjoy your morning coffee!
Salmon and sardines: Omega 3s found in seafood such as salmon and sardines increase the amounts of the neurochemicals dopamine and serotonin in your system, which help in the regulation of your mood. These levels can also be increased by consuming walnuts and ground flax seed.
Saffron: This spice can be used in rice or to make steeped tea, and has been found to make serotonin more available to the brain, providing you with a feel-good effect. This natural effect is similar to the effects of the antidepressant prescriptions fluoxetine and imipramine.
Carbohydrates: The reduction of carbohydrates is the focus of many diet plans. The downside to this idea is that you can get depressed or anxious when you are low on carbohydrates. Try opting for a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet that includes low-fat dairy, whole grains, fruit and beans.
Dark Chocolate: Yeah, finally something sweet! Dark chocolate contains an antioxidant that combats cortisol, which acts as a stress hormone. While all chocolate contains this antioxidant, dark chocolate contains more cacao, so it has higher levels. While this is a tasty way to cut your cortisol level, remember that chocolate also contains more calories than other options, mentioned above!;
, Even with the most positive of attitudes, we can all have a bad day! It is easy to skip your workout routine, because you just are not in the mood. In fact, that is one of the last things you should do! Exercising is not only beneficial to good health and burning calories, it also supports a positive frame of mind. Here are ways that exercise works to improve your mood:Exercising builds muscles and muscles need oxygen. As you workout, your oxygen flow is improved as your muscles build, leaving you feeling energized and positive.
The oxygenated blood that helps to build your muscles also improves how your brain functions. During exercise, there is increased communication between your brain and nervous system. This makes your brain sharp and gives you an invigorated feeling.
Aerobic exercise increases a number of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain, including epinephrine and dopamine. These chemicals promote a positive and energized mood after a workout. Doing aerobics regularly can even change your brain chemistry, making some people feel addicted to exercising.
Socializing is a great way to improve you mood. Join an exercise class. You will meet some new people and get some exercise at the same time. You could also meet up with a friend to go for a jog in the park or swim some laps at a local recreation centre.
Set realistic goals for yourself when you are exercising. If it has been a number of years since you have participated in a regular workout, or never exercised on a regular basis, start with small goals. Setting aside some time to exercise will also provide an outlet for you to escape the pressures of work or a busy home life.

, Sitting down to read a good book is always a great way to relax. There are also different relaxation techniques that can do yourself to help you relax when you are stressed out or feeling blue.Take time to meditate. Sit on you bed or the floor cross legged (or sit in a chair if you prefer). Close your eyes and repeat to yourself ""I love myself"" or ""I am at peace"", keeping one hand on your abdomen. Feel the air filling your lungs. Continue to breathe in and out, synchronizing your breathing as you repeat your mantra.
Practice some relaxation techniques. Take some deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly, concentrating on the sounds of your breathing. Close your eyes and completely clear your mind of all other thoughts.
Get in tune with your body. Lay down and and close your eyes. Take the time to assess and feel how stress affects your body. Start at your head, work slowly down to your neck, then your back, until you reach the tips of your toes. This will both relax you and make you realize how being stressed or sad affects your body.
Use a decompression technique. Wrap your neck and shoulders with a warm towel for ten minutes. With your eyes closed, relax your face, neck, chest and back. Take a tennis ball or foam roller and place it in between your back and a wall. Apply careful, but firm pressure onto the ball. After about 15 seconds, move the ball to another area and hold it again for 15 seconds, and so on.

, Sometimes you find yourself working so hard to make everyone around you happy, or get a whole bunch of things accomplished at work or at home, you forget to take a little 'me' time..


Treat yourself by looking forward to a long, luxurious bubble bath at the end of your day. Burn some of your favourite scented candles, keep the lighting low and just lay in the bubbles and relax.
Take out your problems physically. No, that does not mean going and socking the guy in the eye who hurt your feelings at work. Try going to the gym and getting your frustrations out on the punching bag. Maybe you could go for a walk and throw stones into a pond to rid yourself of what irritates you.
Make a phone call or visit close friends or family members. Sometimes members of your family can be your closest confidantes. They may even provide you with input from similar experiences that they have had in their lives.
Create yourself a jar of positivity. Take an empty jar and some slips of paper. Write little notes that prompt amusing memories or small anecdotes that make you smile. When you are having a funky day, stick you hand in the jar and get ready for a chuckle.
Play some of your favourite music and dance they blues away. Be as corny as you want, and if you dance in front of a mirror, you will be guaranteed a smile. If you want to sing as you dance, wooden spoons make great microphones!

, Come on, SMILE! IT'S GOOD FOR YOU! As the saying goes: ""It takes 37 muscles to frown and 22 muscles to smile, so SMILE. It conserves energy!"""

Sadness is common after break-ups, losing a job, or failing a test. Sadness may also occur if you have been stuck in an unsatisfying routine. Sadness is different for everyone, but typically lasts for no longer than 6 months after the event that triggered it.You may be experiencing clinical depression if your sadness occurs nearly every day and is accompanied by feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, fatigue, lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed, difficulty focusing, and/or suicidal thoughts.You should consult with a doctor or mental health professional right away if you experience any of these more significant symptoms.;
, While it may be tempting to force yourself to be happy and distract yourself from sadness, denial of sadness is not a realistic approach to feeling happier. Sadness is an important and normal experience of life. Putting pressure on yourself to be positive or upbeat all the time can be damaging.


Ignoring or denying your sadness can lead to problems later in life including pain, fatigue, and difficulty coping with further losses., Sharing your feelings and experiences of sadness with others you trust may provide some comfort and relief. Not only is having healthy connections and relationships with others an essential component to feeling happier in life, isolating from others when you are sad can leave you and them feeling worse.If you’re not sure who to talk to, consider friends you are close to, your spouse/partner, a counselor or other mental health professional, siblings or other relatives, and people you know who have shared similar experiences.
If you’re not sure how to share your feelings or are uncomfortable, start with simple statements like “I feel…” From there, try to keep the focus on yourself, rather than accusing or blaming the other person for anything. For example, “I feel sad when you don’t spend time with me” versus “You never have time for me anymore!”, This may not be easy or feel natural at first, because we tend to feel grateful for good things that happen to us, not necessarily things that make us sad. However, regularly expressing gratitude can help build resilience and help you cope with difficult/sad times in the future.

Some ways to practice gratitude include:

Remember past times in your life that were difficult, think about how you made it through, and ask yourself how you have changed or become stronger because of those struggles.Write down concrete things you are grateful for and acknowledge what you do have.Help other people in need by volunteering your time or resources. This can give you a sense of appreciation of what you have, versus focusing on what is bringing you down., Happiness does not come from objects or experiences. Happiness is a lifelong process and is created by cultivating a healthy sense of well-being, contentment with the ups and downs of life, and healthy relationships with others. It may take years to achieve and may require being vulnerable to working through your emotions, changing your habits, and pushing yourself to be open.In American culture, we may also be taught to delay happiness until we’ve achieved our goals or reached certain milestones. It may be more helpful to try to think of happiness and well-being as something you should invest in now, rather than something that will come to you later., Sadness during rough times often leads to automatic negative thoughts, such as thinking that nothing will get better or calling yourself names. These types of thoughts will only keep you stuck in sadness. Some ways you can confront negative thinking patterns include:


Recognize the common types of negative thoughts. All-or-nothing thinking occurs when you tend to only see things in black-and-white terms. Overgeneralizing occurs when one sad event makes you feel defeated. For example, “I’m never going to get this right.” Mental filtering happens when you focus only on the negative details of an event.Keep a record of your daily thoughts. You can write them down in a daily journal at the end of the day, or you can keep track of them on paper or on your phone as they occur throughout the day.After you’ve written down your negative thoughts, examine any evidence that they are true and try to think of times and examples where these thoughts were not true.Talk to yourself kindly. Use less strong and harsh language. For example, instead of thinking “I’m never going to get this right,” instead tell yourself something like “I am human and it is okay to make mistakes. I may not get it right this time, but I will learn for next time.”, To feel happier, you will need to feel fairly healthy in body as well as in mind. Some ways you can look after your body include:


Getting regular exercise. Exercise releases endorphins (chemicals in your brain) that help elevate and shift your mood. Exercise can also be fun and distract you from thinking about whatever has caused your sadness.Eating healthy foods and reducing alcohol consumption. When experiencing sadness, it may be tempting to numb feelings with unhealthy comfort foods or alcohol, but these ways of coping may end up making you feel worse.Getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night. Less than this may lead to mood and relationship problems, poor work productivity, and increased health problems such as heart disease., Planning for the future and setting goals you want to see yourself achieve can give you back a sense of control, purpose, positivity, and hope.Keep a journal of goals you would like to achieve in the next few days, in the next few months, in the next few years, and in the distant future. Focus on writing down goals that are simple, meaningful to you, achievable, and realistic., Consider cooking, journaling, coloring, drawing, gardening, or playing an instrument. These activities are all ways for you to explore more about yourself, feel increased self-confidence and mastery, and form relationships with others.You do not have to be talented or an expert at what you’re doing to feel the happiness boost creativity will give you.
If you’re unsure where to start, think back to what you enjoyed as a child or young adult.

, Mindfulness exercises like meditation help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judging them.Meditation helps teach you to be still and with regular practice, may help shift the brain toward focusing more on positive feelings.If you are new to meditation and not sure how to start, first start by choosing a time and space where you can sit in quiet and not be disturbed. You can sit on the floor or in a chair, whatever is most comfortable for you. Choose how long you would like to meditate for, but if you’re new to meditation it’s best to start with short sittings of five to ten minutes. As you meditate, you will simply focus on your breath and any sensations in your body. You might notice your mind start to wander. Let any thoughts come and go without judgment and return your focus to your breath.If you are having difficulty with meditating on your own, you can find guided meditations online.

, If you’re feeling sad, you may have trouble cultivating happiness in more meaningful ways, so sometimes just distracting yourself can be helpful. Find something that is enjoyable to you, such as watching a funny movie, listening to your favorite music, dancing, etc."

, If you are feeling really sad and you're on the verge of tears, try to excuse yourself from a large crowd of people, such as going to the bathroom or finding a silent place without many people. Your emotions might overwhelm you and it's best just to take deep breaths.


Concentrate on breathing in and out and repeat this action until you've calmed down a little.
Concentrate on something else that's not your source of sadness, such as a funny video or a picture that cheers you up.
Pop outdoors briefly. Sometimes you just need to breathe and give yourself some fresh air.

, If you can, confide in a friend and they can help you to calm down, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed and ready to cry. Your friends don't want you to be sad and they'll know how to help. Even if they don't, just being there for you and knowing that you have their support is important. Other people you could talk to include teachers, counselors or an office manager.

, Even looking up some funny things online and showing them to others will lighten the mood and as the cliché says, laughter is contagious and always the best medicine.

, This might be drawing, gaming, playing music or doing whatever your talent is. Find something that you enjoy doing.

, Find a person who makes you feel happy, and go see what they are doing. Maybe you can help them, or talk about their day. Sometimes focusing on someone else can get your mind off of your own troubles.

, It will help you to feel better. It's unhealthy to bottle up your feelings and caring people are always willing to listen. There is always someone who will listen and people do care about you and your well-being. You are not a burden and neither are your problems, so one of the best things is to express your feelings openly.

Don't be afraid of meeting people. Some are nicer than they appear, trust me. Don't judge someone for their style. I have actually met some pretty nice ""preps"". While we're on the subject of 'Don't judge people by their appearance', not everyone you meet is going to be attractive to you. And that is okay, that's how this screwed up world works. You have an opinion, hooray for you! Just because someone wears skirts doesn't make them a slut, just like if someone wear black lipstick- it doesn't make them hate everything. That's personality, not appearance.

Find that girl/guy you've been dreaming of and meet them. Nothing is going to happen if you just sit there. Get up and talk to them. Stares mean nothing unless they actually try to say something to you.

, Yet another thing to keep in mind- You're not in a fairytale so stop living in one. You can't expect someone to do something or say something. Are we the Sims? No. Are you god? No. There is no such thing as a ""Happy Ending"". In fact, that's also a complete fallacy. You want to get something done? Go out and do it. But stop expecting someone to be something they're not.

, Be happy. Enjoy the little things. You never know if it's going to end so make the best of it. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

, You can be fulfilled by yourself. Something other than boys/girls/whatever you're in to that makes you happy.

Most people can't dedicate themselves to being absolutely grouchy about everything, unless your name is the Grinch, or Oscar, but even they have moments of sunshine. Focus on the thing that bugs you more than anything else, and the thing about which you know the most to complain about. Some popular grouch archetypes:



The Political Grouch. Right or left, the political grouch always has a good idea of who's to blame. Crooked politicians, corporations, welfare states–whatever you blame for the ills of society, do as little research as possible and ramp your fiery rhetoric up to 11. The political grouch is usually a talk radio and cable news addict, always opinionated, and rarely silent. You must be heard! Patron Saint: Ted Nugent.

The Pop Culture Grouch can be found stalking the comment streams of YouTube videos, particularly on videos by current pop singers, complaining that music isn't as good as it used to be. This grouch will then typically list bands from 10 years ago and claim that these bands are better. Also applicable to art, books, movies, or television, the cultural grouch is a curmudgeon of the highest order, usually obsessed with the idea the past was better than the current. Patron Saint: Your Uncle Carl.

Environmental Grouches are noble souls. Angry about topics from animal rights to global warming to the plight of the bees, environmental grouches are easy to pick out at most farmer's markets. Dedicated to fermenting small batches of cabbage and growing their own kale to stick it to corporate farming, these grouches are sometimes kind of a bummer at dinner parties, but are serious outdoorsy sorts with a purpose. Patron Saint: Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

The Bourgeois Grouch likes to Yelp savage reviews of expensive restaurants, tell ""horror stories"" about what happened at the airport on the way back from France, and Tweet about how long the line is at the pour-over coffee stand. No amount of luxury makes the bourgeois grouch satisfied, and thus the bourgeois grouch spends lots of time shopping online for clothes with trust fund money. Then blogging about it. Patron Saint: Everyone on whitewine.com.;
, Every grouch needs a soapbox. Eventually, your close friends and loved ones will likely want to kick you to the curb if you can't control your grouching in their presence, so it's important to find a willing audience. Good venues for your grouches, gripes, and complaints include:



YouTube. Start vlogging and recording your epic rants about whatever it is that drives you crazy. It's important that you also actively engage with your comments stream and defend yourself against ""trolls."" Trolls will be a problem.

Twitter. Can you condense your gripes into 140 characters? Craft haiku-like complaints to channel your rage in the right direction.

Blogger. Blogger is probably the grouchiest blogging platform. Start one around your theme and start unleashing your rants on the Internet.
Analog methods. Forget about the Internet–it's the death of culture, anyway, right?! Write your congressman handwritten screeds and manifestos, and send long critical complaints to the local newspaper. Leave comment cards at restaurants. Slip them into pairs of pants at malls you hate. Leave a long paper trail.

, If you want to be a full-time grouch, you've got to be able to whip yourself into a dark frenzy at a moment's notice. You might be sitting quietly in the park, reading a nice novel, when you need to channel your rage in a second? The whales! The liberals! The Kardashians! Whatever it is that pokes your mad button, conjure it and keep yourself grumpy, however nice the day.


At parties, try your best to find the bad side of everything. Be the downer of the party. If someone mentions a recent trip to Greece, bring up the economic crisis. If someone orders tuna, talk about a video you watched in which dolphins are slaughtered by tuna nets. If someone drives by with a rattling bass in their car speakers, launch into an unsolicited screed on music.

, Being around negative people make other negative people worse. A recent sociological study about how communities divide on ideological lines showed that people with measurably similar attitudes, when placed in a room and instructed to debate a particular issue they all agreed upon, all emerged from the room having pushed their viewpoints more extreme, as a way of making themselves stand out from the others. It's the natural instinct of the grouch to one-up other grouches, pushing themselves farther away from the thing they're grouching against.Compete against other grouches regularly. Grouches are usually competitive and take winning super-seriously. Whether it's a board game, tennis, or your bankbooks, if you want to keep yourself in grouch mode all the time, make a point of regularly competing against others and being a bad winner and a sore loser. A grouch should be grumpy even after winning a hard-won match. Find something to complain about in everything.

, Start to internalize things that may or may not have anything to do with you. If there's a way to make it about you and take personal offense to a comment, snub, or failure, grouches will do it every time. Find hidden motivations in people's language, even if it might not be there.


If someone keeps talking about how annoyingly small the new BMW cup-holders are, they're probably bragging and trying to put you down, if you don't have one of the new models. Even if you do have one, there's probably some hidden message. He's got bigger cups! Always find a way to take it personally.
Michael Jordan, to psych himself up for games, used to tape negative comments opposing players had made about him into his locker. He would just dwell on the negativity. If nobody had made any negative comments, Jordan would invent perceived slights.

, All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. It also makes him a grouch. One good way to be a constant grouch is to never stop working. Work extra hours every week as a way of becoming totally absorbed and obsessed by labor. When you get off work, only talk about work.


It's also a good idea to be a miser, like Ebenezer Scrooge, that classic grouch. Pinch every penny. Give none to anyone, and spend none on yourself. Just enjoy watching it pile up, greedily. Taking the occasional swim in your money pool is an acceptable diversion.

, Nobody ever got to the top by being nice. If you want to climb the ladder of the grouches, find influential grouches that you'll be able to bond with. If you fancy yourself a budding John Oliver, you've got to find your Jon Stewart. If you like to think of yourself as a bourgeois grouch a la Kim Kardashian, find the right field for it. Try to go the way of the Hills and secure an internship at Teen Vogue, then find yourself some upper-crust grouching buddies.

, It is a good idea to grouch with a certain measure of charisma, or nobody's going to want to listen to it. There's a reason that someone like Oliver, a political grouch of the first order, is more than a YouTube comment-streamer. He's got the ability to bring people into his rage and get onboard with his gripes.

, Most grouchy professions involve you finding some kind of way to channel your grouches into production. A grouch needs a stage. Amateur grouches might be satisfied with getting their frustrations out in the comment stream and in letters to the editor, but if you want to go pro, you've got to find a larger way to reach an audience. Fortunately, there are lots of career options available to committed grouches.

, Newspaper, as well as radio, television, and new media like podcasting and web production are ripe fields for grouches. We enjoy watching someone complain, especially if they have a great perspective, a healthy dose of charisma, and some serious rage. Start by writing opinion pieces and editorials to rally the troops and then expand your dubious media empire into a global enterprise. Your journalistic skills are nowhere near as important to your success as your ability to gripe on command. Notable journalist grouches include:


Maureen Dowd
Glenn Beck
Keith Olbermann
Jonah Goldberg
Rush Limbaugh
Rachel Maddow
Ann Coulter
Ariana Huffington

, What are stand-up comedians really, but people who's grouchiness is amusing? If your rage is hilarious, take it to the stage and start performing rehearsed monologues and funny anecdotes related to your chief gripes about the world you live in. Bonus points: you've got to have thick skin and work tough crowds on a regular basis, making it likely that you'll have something to grouch about at the end of the night. Check out grumpy stand-up comedians like:


Jerry Seinfeld
Marc Maron
Bill Hicks
Wanda Sykes
Joan Rivers
Lewis Black
George Carlin
Chelsea Handler

, Picture a classic novelist: sitting at a long oak desk, a glass of scotch and a cigar simmering next to a busted typewriter, stacks of dusty hardbacks lined up behind. Probably there is a painting of a shipwreck on the wall. What's the writer doing? Ripping pages in half angrily and throwing them into the garbage. Committing yourself to the craft of writing is a great way to be a grouch. You can throw the grouching into your masterpieces and grouch about the process afterward. Notable literary grouches include:


Ayn Rand
Fyodor Dostoyevsky
Anne Sexton
Ernest Hemingway
Norman Mailer
Charles Bukowski

, Berating back-line staff, insulting fans, wearing sunglasses indoors, rockstars are the epitome of grouches. We expect rockstars to be jerks, on some level, and that ""bad"" quality is partially what makes the music seem dangerous and exciting, when done properly. Court some controversy. Write some angsty anthems, scream them into the mic, then smash your guitars and you'll be well on your way. Classic rocker grouches include:


Lou Reed
Axl Rose
Ted Nugent
Courtney Love
Frank Black
Anton Newcombe
Lily Allen
Henry Rollins
MIA

, Anger and grouchiness can have a measurable physical affect on your body. An experience of anger triggers your ""fight or flight"" response, triggering the release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, as well as lowering your metabolism, channeling blow flow to your muscles. Your temperature will rise, your blood pressure will increase, and your breathing will quicken.Over time, this can manifest itself in long-term problems like high blood pressure, migraine headaches, and weight gain from stress-related hormone release. It's even linked to heart disease.It's very important to learn to relax, at least some of the time, to stay healthy.


Try meditating when you feel yourself getting angry. When you feel that familiar grouch impulse coming at your full-force, take a few deep breaths, sit quietly, and clear your mind. Even if you're not feeling angry, try to control your breathing and focus on just sitting a few times a week to calm your mind and keep your stress levels low.

, If you're in an angry situation, it's good to walk away. There's nothing wrong with closing the door on your problem temporarily and letting some air in. Letting anger fester may give you pleasure as a grouch, but if you're risking violent outbursts or emotional turmoil, you need to know when to cool it down.In the short term, get outside and go for a walk. If your coworker is just driving you crazy, get out of the office. If your partner is nagging you to death, head to the store and clear your head. Change the view for 10 or 15 minutes and let yourself calm down some.In the long term, you might need a more significant change of location. If you're filled with nameless rage having to hear about everyone's new jam band line-ups and artisanal vanilla bean carts, maybe it's time to leave Portland and move somewhere a little more down-to-earth.

, The only way to make negativity dissipate is to Try to articulate how you're feeling and communicate it with someone. Whether a close friend, family member, partner, or psychiatrist, you need an ear if you're feeling angry and want some relief. You might not be able to ""solve"" the problem of your anger, but learning to voice it is the best way to release it.


Shutting down completely and keeping your frustration to yourself is the worst way of coping with anger. Isolating yourself will increase your feelings of frustrating, making it very hard to cope and calm down. It's important to talk with someone, frequently.
A common misconception is that frequent outbursts of emotion are better than ""holding it in."" Studies show we rarely experience catharsis from short outbursts of anger, making the occasional tantrum no better than the anger-concealing code of silence.In some cultures, women experience a tremendous pressure to mask their anger, staying positive all the time for risk of being labelled a ""bitch."" Men, on the other hand, are expected to be grumps, and never develop communicative coping skills necessary to process their anger. It's important to understand the cultural dimensions of your relationship with anger, to better approach it in a healthy way.

, Anger can be a tremendous energy-giver. If you're experiencing frustration that you're not where you want to be in your career right now, or that your relationship is going sour, or that you have to live in a dumpy town you'd rather be able to leave, channel that anger into good work. Take solace in creating and in improving your skills. Whether it's a hobby you're cultivating at home, or the work you're doing for a living, use that work to get rid of your extra angry energy.


That's not to say you should take out anger at home on your coworkers, anymore than you should take work frustration out on your family. If you're frustrated because of work, channel that energy into seizing every minute at home to distract yourself from it.

, One of the most efficient and healthy ways of processing anger is to exercise it out. You might not think of jogging or doing Tae-Bo as the most ""relaxing"" way to spend your time, but a spike in aerobic exercise has been shown to increase GABA neuron transmitters in the brain, which quiet other neurons, keeping them from firing as easily.The result of this? You're much calmer after exercise.


Play a competitive sport like tennis, basketball, or flag-football to keep your finger on the pulse of your competitive grouchiness, but to work of some of your deep anger in the process. You can get worked up about the game, as long as you're working hard.
Try a new high-intensity workout routine when you're angry, like the Spartacus workout, P90x, or CrossFit to work yourself into a healthy frenzy. You'll be so worn out afterward you won't have the energy to be angry.
Try more meditative exercise, like yoga or hiking if you want to center yourself and workout at the same time.

, Grumps often struggle with substance abuse problems, self-harm, violent outbursts, and other risky or self-destructive behaviors, as an attempt to process or mask the anger by anesthetizing it. There's nothing wrong with your feelings of grouchiness or anger, frustrating through they might be, as long as you learn to process them in a healthy way, and not channel that rage into destruction.

Forgive yourself.,

Make better choices.",How to Start a New Life with a Negative Past," Think about what it is that you want to achieve that will make your future better than your present and past circumstances. Write down clear, concise goals you can work towards. Make sure your goals are realistic, specific, measurable, time-based and achievable.


Consider also the things that you DON’T want in your life.
Start work on one goal at a time.
Break your goals into small, manageable steps. These will help you accomplish your goals over time.;
, Think of people who will be a good influence on you and help you accomplish your goals. If you’re moving to a new place and don’t have many friends, consider maintaining contact with some of your old good friends and also making new ones. Reach out to family who have been loving and supportive of you in the past. Nurture your relationship with them; be honest, trustworthy and kind -- this will show them you want to turn over a new leaf.


Your support system can include figures of authority in your life such as your teachers. Seek their advice and follow through on it, if you believe you can confide in them. Such connections can also help you out in the future when your life is more stable and you need someone to put in a good word for you, such as for a job application or a college reference.

, Distance yourself from friends who were negative influences in your life. If such people are not also trying to start over in life, then they might pull you back into habits, behavior or activities that made your past negative.These friends might also mock you and tease you for trying to leave your old ways behind. Ignore them and focus on improving your life.


Make sure you have people to talk to and to support you through this transition.

, Make sure the goals you set take daily living into account. At the beginning of every day, reflect on your schedule for that day and what it is you have to go through, what you need to do to prepare. At the end of the day, reflect on how your day was and what progress you made. It’s okay if it wasn’t as much as you’d like. What matters is that you keep trying.


Your negative past probably spanned a long period of time. Whether you’re trying to leave your old ways behind or to distance yourself from a negative situation created by others (e.g. an abusive relationship), things probably won’t become completely perfect overnight. Negative habits, behaviors, and methods of coping with stressful situations all take time to develop and time to be replaced with positive, alternative ones., You have direct control over your thoughts, your emotions, your behavior and your life.Make the decision to follow your goals and improve your life. Actively choose what to do next. Every morning, look in the mirror and say confidently, ‘I control my life. My choices today make a better tomorrow.’No matter who was responsible for the events of your past, you have to take responsibility for improving your present and future. Remember that you can only control yourself and your actions but that your actions affect others and the future.It can be easy to sit back and blame others for the way you are -- don’t use that as an excuse to continue living a life you’re not satisfied with.

, A therapist will offer you a confidential, non-judgemental space to work through your thoughts, concerns, and problems and help you better define and work towards your goals.Therapists have the skills and resources needed to help you put your life into perspective and see things from angles that may not have occurred to you or others.


Therapy is not only for those who face problems with mental health. Anyone who wants to can benefit from speaking to a counsellor or therapist. If you are uncomfortable going to a therapist/counsellor because you’re afraid people will make fun of you, discuss your fears with someone you trust, someone you know has been to therapy or research online to understand the process of therapy better.

, Try to separate yourself as much as you can from your old way of life. It can be difficult if you’re trying to turn over a new leaf but are going to be living in the same place and attending the same school or staying at the same job. You may have to face consequences of your past behavior before your reputation improves.


You will have to keep trying your hardest to show that you have changed: let your actions speak for themselves.
Accept any punishments that are dealt to you by authority figures (e.g. your principal or boss) and try to perform to the best of your ability. This will be a way of showing that you can accept responsibility for your actions.

, You may have grievances with others that are making your present difficult or miserable. Perhaps you had a big fight with your brother and he doesn’t talk to you anymore. Working toward a better relationship may improve your situation and give you peace of mind.Accept if you were to blame for anything that made the situation worse.


Apologize and indicate that you want to make things better. Tell your loved one that you’re sorry for what happened, explain how you think you hurt him and why this was wrong. Then tell him how you can make it better. A simple script to follow is:

I’m sorry for…
This is wrong because…
In the future, I will…
Will you forgive me?Your loved one may not forgive you immediately. Keep trying.

, When you take responsibility for your life, you may be feeling guilty about the part you played (or the part you think you played) in making it negative in the first place.Consider discussing this with a trusted friend. Explain how you feel and why you think you’re feeling that way.


Your friend might be able to show you a different perspective. If you don’t want to talk about it, try writing your thoughts out, then responding in writing as you would to someone you love. Be honest and forthright.
Making mistakes does not decrease your worth or make you a bad person.Everybody makes mistakes.

, It may have taken you a long time to reach a point in your life when you decided you needed to start over. Alternatively, you could have been in a negative family situation since you were born and then decided that you needed to make life better. Whatever your case, try to determine the contributing factors to the situation.


Think about things people said and did, patterns of behavior (your own and others’), tones of voice, and patterns of your own thinking.
Make a list of negative things you tend to repeat to yourself. Find evidence for and against this thought. Look for facts, rather than opinion. Ask yourself what makes you think this way.

, Put systems in place that will ensure that you don’t repeat the negative things that happened in the past. Create plans to follow whenever you notice feelings that trigger behavior that you regret. For example, perhaps you’ve noticed that when you feel sad, you tend to drink alcohol: form a plan for dealing with your sadness that will keep you from drinking.


Talk to a friend and ask him to help you with this problem. When you’re feeling sad, you can call him and ask them to come over. You can both play a sport or do something different. You could even try to talk about what is making you feel sad to help you deal with the situation.
Try to come up with more than one plan to follow in these situations in case something prevents you from following your original one.

, If you understand why things happened the way they did, try to think of solutions that will prevent history from repeating. If other people are the reason that your life was negative, it can be more difficult to change the situation. For example, if you’re a teenager and your parents make your home life difficult, maybe you can encourage your parents to seek help for their lifestyle.


You know your loved one best. It can be difficult to convince others to seek the help they need to better their life. Think of ways that you can help him yourself, consult with others on how best to approach the situation or read psychology articles related to your issue.

, You can’t simply stop doing things -- you have to start doing other activities to replace them.For example, if you had a habit of coming home from school and smoking in your room, form a routine that will help you achieve your goals instead. Plan ahead and ask a friend to help you, if you like. Once you come home, wash up, eat lunch then immediately leave for the public library to study.


New habits may be harder to form than new routines. Start by consciously engaging in behavior that you want to become habit. Take for example, trying to maintain your personal hygiene. Make a conscious effort to brush your teeth before going to bed and after waking up in the morning. Set a daily reminder on your phone to help you or ask a parent to check that you’ve brushed your teeth. Once this becomes habit, you’ll feel uncomfortable if you don’t brush your teeth at these times.

, In your day to day life and in the long run, keep your goals in mind when you’re making decisions. Think about how your decision will affect your day and your future. Remember the poor choices you’ve made in the past. Choose that which is better for you.


Sometimes, you might make a decision that would have worked for you in the past but doesn’t any more. Maybe playing video games used to refresh your mind and now it doesn’t bring you that same peace of mind. This is okay. You can outgrow anything.Don’t force yourself to do something that no longer serves you well.

Write your thought(s) down.,
Imagine the thought.,
Stop the thought.,
Practice.",How to Stop Thinking of Something or Someone1," Your thoughts are distracting you from your daily activities and causing you unhappiness, anxiety or worry, so the first thing you must do is put them on paper. Write down all your upsetting thoughts in order of the most stressful to the least stressful.


For example, if you keep thinking you might lose your job, your list could look something like this: 1. How will I be able to pay my bills and take care of my child? 2. What if I can't find a new job? 3. I'll be so embarrassed if I'm escorted by security out of the office with my belongings in a box.
You're going to begin your practice with the least-stressful thought.;
, Sit or lie down in a private place. Close your eyes. Imagine a situation in which you might have this stressful thought.

, Set a timer, watch or other alarm for three minutes. Then focus on your unwanted thought. When the timer or alarm goes off, shout ""Stop!"" That's your cue to empty your mind of that thought. Think of one intentional thought (the beach, etc.) and keep your mind fixed on that image or thought for 30 seconds. If the upsetting thought comes back during that time, shout ""Stop!"" again. Practicing meditation or yoga may help calm and clear your mind.


You can stand up when you say ""Stop"" if you'd like or snap your fingers or clap your hands. These actions reinforce the ""Stop"" command and further interrupt your thought.
Instead of using a timer, you can tape-record yourself shouting ""Stop!"" at one-, two- and three-minute intervals and use the recording to do the thought-stopping exercise. When you hear your recorded voice say ""Stop,"" empty your mind for 30 seconds.

, Repeat this exercise until the thought goes away on command. Then try the exercise again and interrupt the thought by saying ""Stop"" in a normal voice rather than a shout. Once your normal voice is able to stop the thought, try whispering ""Stop."" Over time, you can just imagine hearing ""Stop"" inside your mind. At this point, you should be able to stop the thought whenever and wherever it occurs. Once you've achieved that level of control, choose the next thought on your list and continue thought-stopping.


This method will not stop unwanted thoughts immediately. What it does do is help ""put brakes"" on these thoughts and gradually lessen the hold they have over you.
In this practice, there also has to be acceptance that these thoughts are here at present and to tolerate them. Thoughts can be very distracting, distressing, and when a person feels out of control about it, it is all the worse. But accepting the fact they are there, present, and to be less reactive about it actually helps them go away.

Get active.,
Do something mentally strenuous.,
Laugh.,
Talk it out.",How to Stop Thinking of Something or Someone2," Engaging in a sport that requires you to focus on your body and/or eye-hand coordination is a good way to clear your head. Plus, exercise brings the added benefit of producing the brain's feel-good neurotransmitters, endorphins, which will improve your mood.

, Challenge yourself mentally by completing a Sudoku or crossword puzzle, solving complicated math problems or following a complex set of instructions to complete a project. The mental focus it will take to do these kinds of activities will leave you with no time or mental energy to think your unwanted thoughts.

, Laughter can take your mind off worries. When we laugh, our brain is engaged--it's instructing our body to make a series of gestures and sound. Laughing helps reduce stress, so if your recurring thoughts are causing you anxiety, laughter really is good medicine. Hang out with friends who simply crack you up, rent a funny movie or try a laughter yoga class. You can even find therapists who specialize in ""laughter therapy,"" which teaches people how to openly laugh at things that aren't usually funny and to use humor to cope with difficult situations.

, Often the best way to get a thought out of your head is to share it with someone else. Turn to a friend or family member who's a good listener and tell them what's on your mind. If you feel as though your difficulty in dealing with your unwanted thoughts is more than a friend can help with, turn to a professional therapist or counselor who can work with you.

Practice acceptance.,
Use focused distraction.,
Throw them out.,
Check for a lesson.,
Give it time.",How to Stop Thinking of Something or Someone3," If you've tried just not thinking about someone or something, you know it's not really possible--if it were that easy, you wouldn't be reading this article. In fact, research has found that it is better to accept your unwanted thoughts rather than to push them away. In one study, participants who practiced acceptance were less obsessive, had lower levels of depression and were less anxious than those who tried thought suppression. Accepting your thoughts, does not mean you have to like them or even agree with your thoughts. You simply have to accept them as part of your current reality. Allow them to exist and make no effort to try to control or change them. By doing so, you take away their power, and they begin to occur less frequently.

, You may have already tried distracting yourself to get the thoughts you want to avoid out of your head, but have you tried focused distraction? Studies suggest it is better to distract yourself with just one thing rather than jumping from one thing to another trying to divert your attention from unwanted thoughts. Aimless mind-wandering is associated with unhappiness, so choose a specific task, book or piece of music to concentrate on and give it your full attention.

, In a study published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers found that when people wrote down their thoughts on a piece of paper and then threw the paper away, they mentally discarded the thoughts as well. Some counselors might instead recommend a worry jar where you can place these thoughts. , If you are having obsessive thoughts, try treating the situation as a lesson. Ask yourself what the lesson is and what you can learn from your mistake. Try summing it up in just one sentence or less and write it down.

, When a situation or person has a big impact in life, it often takes time to truly process it. This can be especially true if you have never experienced a situation before, such as finding out someone cheated on you, witnessing a death, or being in a car accident. Going over and over this in your mind is a natural way to process it. And each person is different--needing time to come to terms with something does not mean you are weak or lacking than someone who does not.

Help others.",How to Stop Feeling Like Your Life Isn't Good Enough," Believe it or not, this can be the first step to feeling your own power. If you don't see yourself as worthy or good enough, you might not recognize the effect you can have on others. Truth is, no matter who you are, you have the power to positively (or negatively) impact the world. Your lousy mood can be contagious; however, happiness and positivity are, too. Research shows that doing something kind for someone else increases the 'feel-good' chemical in our brains, known as serotonin. So, even when you're not feeling too great, try to be nice to others - you'll feel better in the process.Take a moment to make eye contact. Ask others how they are doing today, or offer a sincere compliment. Try to remember names, and ask friends or coworkers about their loved ones.
Give people the benefit of the doubt. You don't know what's happening in their lives. You might be the one and only person to treat them like a human being today. You may not realize how just one kind word or smile - even from a stranger - can lift someone's spirit.;
, Going through the motions of feeling happy and content can actually lead to contentment. Just as doing something kind for others can make us feel better about ourselves, pretending that we are in a great mood can, too. If you wake up one morning feeling particularly low, try to stop the cycle by channeling positive energy. Look in the mirror and smile at yourself. It may feel silly, but it works. When you go out into the world and others ask you how you're doing, answer as if it's the best day of your life. Say things like ""I'm having a marvelous day"" or ""The day just keeps getting better and better.""
Projecting happiness can result in a self-fulfilling prophecy. After you've spent an hour or so smiling and commenting on how great a day you're having, you'll eventually find that you really are having a good day. In fact, research shows that just faking a smile and arranging your facial expression in this way can invoke some of the same autonomic changes that a genuine smile can deliver. For example, holding a pencil in your teeth activates the smile muscles, and, in time, you will find that you are feeling calmer and more happy., Sometimes you may undervalue all the good things in your life because you are focusing on superficial possessions like a car, your looks, or your house. Superficial things can be fleeting. Fortunes can be lost. Nonetheless, some traits like love, honor, integrity, and honesty are enduring. Learn to appreciate natural beauty, good character, true friendship and your family.


Develop a list of positive adjectives that describe yourself and the people around you. Reliability, trustworthiness, compassion. All of these are terrific traits that may go overlooked. Identify what you value in yourself and other people, and then make an effort to notice when these traits are being displayed in yourself and in others.
Try to compliment others on their values rather than their looks or possessions (you can still do this but also include some value-based compliments). Say to a friend, ""I really appreciate how I can always depend on you to be honest with me. Even when your opinion differs from mine, I can count on you to be straightforward. Thanks.""

, How you're feeling about yourself and your life may come down to what you're telling yourself in your head. Your self-talk can make or break you. Positive self-talk brings confidence, increased self-efficacy, and a greater mood. Negative self-talk, on the contrary, results in a vicious cycle of depression, anxiety, and poor self-esteem. Follow these strategies to transform your self-talk:Be conscious of your thoughts. Ask yourself whether they make you feel better or worse?
When you identify a negative thought, work to change it into a more positive statement. For example, consider these thoughts: ""I am worthless. I will never find a job I like."" They are clearly negative and block future growth and opportunities. Alter such statements into more positive, hopeful thoughts like: ""I have many talents and gifts. I must find a job or past-time that enables me to further develop my talents.""
Talk to yourself how you would talk to a dear friend. You would not belittle or criticize a dear friend. You would show this person compassion and recall positive characteristics the person is discounting. Show yourself the same compassion.

, When you compare your life to that of others, you downplay your own accomplishments. Comparison is the thief of joy. And, you will never feel like your life is amazing, if the standard you are measuring your own success by is that of someone else's. There will always be someone else who is smarter, faster, or richer. Still, there is only one you. Take a moment to recognize all the wonderful things you bring to the table.


After considering some of your strengths, write them down on little pieces of paper. Tape a few to the mirror so that you can see them as you get ready each morning. Put one in your wallet and in your car's sun visor. Think of these as little reminders of all you have to offer.
If you find it difficult to identify your strengths, do a self-exploration activity to uncover them. Grab a pen and paper and reflect for a few minutes on a good experience that has happened in your life. Think about how you handled this experience and how your excellence was demonstrated. Consider which activities and projects you enjoy doing most. These are those that portray your strengths.

, When you compare yourself to other people and their lifestyles, it is very easy to get caught up in thinking they have it better than you. First, it's unrealistic to compare your life to another person's, and second, you have no idea what their lives are really like beyond the glitz and glam. Outward appearances can mask an incredible amount of pain, debt, sorrow, anger, frustration, loss, boredom and who knows what else. Don't believe the hype. Famous people are still people., As described above, all people have both desirable and undesirable traits. When you find yourself dwelling on your own flaws, but overestimating everyone else's strengths, you need to stop and perform a reality check. Examine your self-talk and listen closely to what you are telling yourself. Challenge irrational or negative thoughts like ""Everyone seems to have nice clothes but me."" If you look around yourself, you are certain to find an exception to such a statement.

, One reason you may not feel good about your life is because you are not putting all of your skills and talents to use. Find ways to be purposeful in your life. For instance, if you enjoy creating music, offer to perform for a religious or nonprofit organization.


On the contrary, you might feel dissatisfied with life because you are not being challenged. Think about ways you can kick your life up a notch, whether that is by learning a new language, picking up a new hobby, or teaching others skills you've already mastered.
In addition to challenging you, hobbies help you to strengthen social bonds and enhance your self-esteem and self-efficacy., Gratitude is the one thing that most people who feel a low sense of self-worth lack. If you can look outside your own world, and see how good you really have it, you will feel much more like your life is worthwhile. If you don't have a terminal illness, have had something to eat today, and have a bed to sleep in tonight, materially speaking, you have it better than 70% of all the people in the whole world.Start a gratitude journal or download an app on your smart phone to regularly record all the things you are thankful for. Do this regularly to start seeing all the positives in your life.

, Think back on times when you felt truly alive and meaningful. Maybe you were there to support a friend going through a hard time, or maybe you made someone else feel special and loved. Recall the feelings you experienced during these moments. Notice that you have significant things happening in your life on a regular basis that point to your value.

, You may not have family, in this case, you must cherish the relationships you have with close friends. If you have children, a spouse, parents, siblings, or best friends you are highly fortunate. Scientists have discovered that those without rich social relationships have a 50 percent higher likelihood of premature death.Since maintaining healthy relationships with family and friends is integral to your long-term health, do what you can to strengthen these connections. Let friends and family know you appreciate them and the roles they play in your life.

, There is nothing that will make you feel like you are valued, needed, and essential like volunteering to help and serve others who are less fortunate than you. Help the elderly, coach at an after-school children's center, feed the homeless, help build a home for someone (Habitat for Humanity), or collect toys for orphanages at Christmas time.


Volunteering allows you to: reduce stress, exercise your usefulness, strengthen your immune system, and make a difference in your community."

Productive regret can help you learn to change your behavior for the future. Unproductive regret, where you completely blame yourself, can create chronic stress which leads to health problems.


Regret can be over things you have done or not done. For example, you could regret acting a certain way during an argument, or you may regret not taking a job offer.;
, These may be different from person to person, but feelings of regret include: sadness, loss, remorse, anger, shame, and anxiety.Identify these feelings related to regret. For example, you may have the thought of a past deed and then you think about this event for the majority of the day. This can leave you feeling defeated and hopeless. You may think about what you did or said, or you may think about what you wished you had done differently to change your current situation.


Constant rethinking and regretting can cause anxiety. This may lead to worrying about future decisions that you might regret later.

, Think about what's causing your regret. People can feel regretful for a number of reasons. Typical regretful experiences include:Lifestyle: Many people regret moving to a different country or may wish they hadn't turned off a house offer. For example, you moved from Canada to Australia because you wanted a warmer life. But just months later, you have found it impossible to find work, have experienced life on the streets and feel homesick every single day. You wish you hadn't made the move down under.
Work: People may regret not following a different career path and pursuing their dream jobs. Or they may regret turning down job offers or promotions. For example, you dread going into your office job everyday and frequently wish you had not turned down the opportunity to be a co-owner in your own business.
Family: People may regret not settling disputes with a family member or friend, especially if the other person passed. Or they may regret not spending more time with older family members. For example, you moved across the country for your spouse’s job. You never made enough effort to stay connected to your grandmother through calls or visits. Now that your grandmother has passed, you regret not putting more effort into staying connected.
Children: People may regret starting a family. For example, you started a family because you wanted to make your spouse's dream come true. 1 year later, you are getting no enjoyment from parenthood and your relationship with your partner has suffered for it, you wish daily you had become a dog foster like you wanted to. Keep in mind however that many Mom and Dads experience postpartum depression following the birth of a baby, get professional help if you think you might have this.
Marriage: People may regret the timing of their marriage or their choice of partner. Some may even regret getting married at all. For example, you married your husband/wife because your family liked and approved of them. After 5 years of marriage, you have found that you share no interests. You often think about what your life would have been like if you had married your long-time girl/boyfriend who your parents did not like.

, CBT exercises teach you to change your habits and patterns of thinking. You can soon start changing your feelings of regret, shame, and anger. Instead, you'll focus on emotionally healing any harmful, unproductive thoughts you have.


CBT works to reduce and replace your feelings of regret and anxiety, instead of simply telling yourself to stop thinking about the past., With regret, people often wonder “why” they acted or didn’t act, and this is often where people become stuck.List your regrets and any questions you keep asking yourself. For example, you might wonder why you acted the way you did.Go through your list and change the ""why"" questions into ""what's next?"" This will help you overcome the feeling of being stuck.


For example: You might ask yourself, ""Why did I snap at my child so much last week?"" For ""What's next?"" you could say that you know you have very little patience left after work. In the future you could take a 5 minute break before engaging the children.

, Regrets can be important learning tools for the future. Try to look for the lessons learned and recognize that life lessons make you wiser. For example, if you regret not treating your spouse with respect, you may have learned that disrespecting your spouse makes you feel terrible. Having this knowledge makes you a wiser spouse and person., What you regret may also be things you have learned about yourself and others. Having this knowledge decreases the chances of making a similar choice in the future. Make sure to apply the wisdom you've gained.


For example, if you've learned that disrespecting your spouse makes your spouse feel distrustful, don't do it again in the future.

, While you can not change what happened in the past, you can choose how your past affects your present and future.


For example, you can't change how much or how often you drank in college, but you can make the choice not to let the regret make you feel guilty now or let it affect your future choices.

, Beating yourself up over things beyond your control would be considered unproductive regret. But, productive regret can be positive if you are moved to improve yourself or act on opportunities. Once you're aware of a missed opportunity, be it educational, financial, or emotional, you're more likely to correct the mistake in the future.If you find yourself ambivalent about taking a new opportunity, ask yourself if you'd rather worry about a wasted opportunity or take a chance. By trying something new, you're minimizing future regrets.

, You're not the only one feeling regretful about something. Consider what others may be going through. Remember that empathy helps you to better understand the feelings of others. This may require you to challenge your own prejudices and truly listen to others.For example, if you regret heavy drinking during your years in college, you may have a deep understanding of how you son feels after a night he's not proud of.

, You may think about regret in terms of the following statements: ""I should have...."" ""I could have...."" ""I can't believe I...."" ""Why didn't I....."" Change these statements into statements of gratitude. You'll think about the past differently and start to lose the regret. When you catch yourself thinking a regretful statement, change it to a statement of gratitude. This can help you start thinking about the past in a positive light.


For example, change ""I should have gone to college,"" to ""I am grateful it's not too late to go to college."" Or change ""I could have tried harder to stop drinking,"" to ""I am grateful that I can try to do better now.""

, Regret can cause resentment towards yourself and others.Instead, learn to forgive yourself. Not only will this reduce your feelings of regret, but it can improve your self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem is critical to many areas of your life, including relationships.


Don't simply try to remove the regret. Instead, own up to your mistakes and feelings, but allow yourself to move on., The exercise of writing a letter will help you practice forgiving yourself.This emotional and cognitive tool will start to healing your feelings of regret. Write a letter addressed to your younger or past-self and in the letter talk to your younger-self like you might talk to your child or close friend. This will make sure that you are compassionate towards yourself.


Remind your younger-self that you deserve the best in life even if you made mistakes, because you are human and it is ok to make mistakes.

, An affirmation is a positive statement to encourage, uplift you, and make you more compassionate towards yourself.Having compassion for yourself makes it easier to empathize and forgive your past-self, which can reduce feelings of regret. Tell yourself, write, or think the affirmations. Some examples of affirmations include:


I am a good person and deserve the best despite my past.
I am human and make mistakes, and that is ok.
I have learned a lot from my past, and I am worthy of a bright future.

Consult a counselor or therapist.",How to Calm Stress," Deep breathing can activate the body’s calming response. These are the kind of breaths that expand your belly when you inhale. As you exhale, imagine the stress leaving your body. Squeezing something like a stress ball in time with your breathing can help you focus on your rhythm.If your stress is high, and you are having trouble slowing your breathing, try offering some resistance to slow down the breathing process. Purse your lips, clench your throat, or breathe through another object like a straw to cut down on the amount of air flowing in and out. This will force you to slow down your breathing in order to get the air you need.If you have a little more time (that is, you aren't surrounded by other people expecting something immediately), you can take a little more time to breathe properly. Find a comfortable position, sitting, standing, or even lying down if possible. Breathe gently and regularly, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Repeat for three to five minutes. By focusing on your actions, you can stop thinking about what is stressing you.;
, Even faking happiness can trick you into feeling happy. Put a smile on your face, even a goofy grin, and it will be hard to stay as stressed.Relaxing your forehead, especially the area between your eyebrows, is another good facial muscle to force into a less stressful position. A furrowed, or tightened brow, is a common sign of anger or stress, so forcing it into a relaxed state can help to diminish those feelings., Many times, you can feel the stress in specific parts of your body. This is common if your stress involves your physical health, but also the case if your stress is from worrying. Giving yourself a gentle massage in some areas may also help to calm you down.Find an area of your body that feels tense, and gently massage it to relieve some of the tension.If you are not comfortable giving yourself a massage, then consider visiting a professional massage therapist.

, Listening to some of your favorite music may help you to calm down as well.Slow, quiet classical music is generally best, though it's always good to find something you enjoy. If heavy metal or arena rock helps you release tension and ignore your stress, go for it.Keep CDs or a music player nearby, and take the effort to turn it on if you start to feel stressed. Get into the habit of listening to music when driving, walking around, or doing anything that doesn't require you to communicate with others.Singing along can also be a good way to engage your brain in something other than your stress. If you can’t get any music to sing along to, humming your favorite tune or just singing out loud without the music can work just as well.Just be sure to take note of your surroundings, and try not to sing so loudly at the office that you distract others.

, Although aromatherapy is not a proven method of stress relief, some studies have shown that aromatherapy can have a significant effect on stress.If you find aromatherapy helpful, then it may provide another stress reduction option for you. Try keeping some relaxing essential oils nearby to inhale when you are feeling stressed.Lavender has been used in aromatherapy studies and it seems to reduce stress.Try wearing a lavender scented lotion or adding a few drops of lavender essential oil to the edge of your sleeve so that you will be able to smell it all day.

, Working up a sweat is a good way to release some physical tension. Exercising causes your body to release endorphins, which are your body’s own natural painkillers. Exercising can also make it easier to fall asleep at night, which can also help to reduce your stress levels.Try to work in a few minutes of exercise when you're feeling stressed, or perhaps set aside some time every day to do some physical activity. For example, you could take a brisk walk around your neighborhood, go on a bike ride, or hit the gym right after you get off of work.

, Distracting yourself has been found to be effective at reducing stress in certain situations as well.If you are feeling stressed about something, then try to find a way to distract yourself for a little while.


Sometimes a simple chore like washing dishes, organizing a closet, or anything else that requires your concentration, can help to take your mind off the things causing you stress. This will allow you to relax and refresh.

, Not getting enough sleep can contribute to stress and it may also intensify symptoms of other psychiatric disorders.That is why it is important to make sure that you are getting enough sleep and taking the occasional nap may help. There are a number of companies that allow their workers to nap, or even provide a space for them to do it in.Find a quiet, comfortable place that you can make as dark as possible. Figure out how long you intend to nap. 10-30 minutes is good for a power nap, though you may want a little longer if you are really tired. Set an alarm, and make sure that when it goes off, you get up and back to work. Don’t forget to block out a little bit of time for you to fall asleep before setting the alarm.
If you are at work, and can’t get comfortable, consider taking a nap in your car or going home for a nap during lunch if you have time. You can keep a sleep mask in your car to help block out the outside light and maybe even play some soothing classical music on your car stereo.

, Worrying about something can be healthy, a reminder of something that needs to get done. Recognize that your stress is your body sending you a message, and consider what you need to do to resolve its causes.Sometimes stresses are signs of negative situations in your life. They could come from toxic friendships or troubles at work. It may also be stress brought on by getting too much in the way of negative substances, like alcohol, caffeine, or junk food. Identifying these stresses can help you address them by changing your behavior.Your stress may also be the result of cognitive distortions, where you incorrectly interpret the world around you. Try to stop negative thoughts and change negative thought patterns such as catastrophizing (only thinking of the worst case scenario) or filtering (where you ignore potential good aspects and focus on the negative). Recognizing that you are making these mistakes can help you find ways to move past them and calm your stress., Spelling out all the things you need to get done can help focus your mind on what is out there, and perhaps let you know it is less than you initially feared. Plus, as you accomplish things, you'll be able to cross them off the list, which always feels good.It's possible that your to-do list is too long, that you notice more things on there than you have time to accomplish. This can clarify your working conditions and help give you reasons to turn things down. Your first responsibility is to your own health and time, and if you don't have time for something, it's good to know that and say no to additional tasks.

, Not getting enough sleep at night can contribute to stress, but getting enough sleep at night may help you to feel calmer during the day. This may be because getting enough sleep can benefit your emotional health.Keep in mind that eight hours of sleep per night is considered ideal, but some people need a little more or less.
Depriving yourself of sleep can make your stress levels worse, so make sure that you make sleep a priority. Go to bed at the same time every night and develop a bedtime routine to make it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep.

, Using relaxation techniques can reduce the effects of stress on your mind and body and help to produce a sense of calm. Relaxation techniques take your mind off of other concerns by turning your awareness to your own body. There are several common relaxation techniques, and they can all help reduce stress. Pick the one that makes you most comfortable.Autogenic relaxation. This refers to focusing on something that comes from you. Think of an object or repeat a mantra in your mind. This should be a place, object, idea, or statement that gives you some happiness and allows you to relax. By thinking of this other thing, you take the focus off of your stress
Progressive muscle relaxation. This exercise involves you slowly clenching and relaxing the muscles in your body. Tense for about 5 seconds, then relax for 30, thinking not just about moving your muscles, but how it feels when they are relaxed. It can help to start in one part of your body, maybe down at your feet, and work your way up your body, tensing and relaxing all your muscles in succession.
Visualization. This involves you forming mental images to take your mind to a relaxing place. As you visualize, think about the way your different senses feel the place you have gone. For example, if you are visualizing yourself on a beach, include thoughts about the sound of crashing waves and the feel of sand between your toes.

, Schedule some time during your day or week, maybe 30 minutes, to be concerned about the stressful things you are facing. That way, if you start to feel stressed while working on something, you can easily tell yourself it's not time for that, and stay focused on what you need to do.During your worry time, try to use problem solving to find solutions to some of your worries that you can control. For example, if your boss is angry and overbearing, then you can decide to look for a new job. If you are worrying about problems that you cannot control, then look for ways to reduce your stress instead.

, The best way to improve anything is to practice. Find things that stress you out, like doing certain kinds of work, or waiting in long lines. Every once in a while, deliberately choose to do those things, and practice ways to relax in the process. This can prepare you for the times you aren't ready for those situations, training your mind and body how to react properly., If stress and anxiety is proving too strong, and you are unable to calm yourself effectively, either in the moment or in general, consider talking to a mental health specialist. Sometimes talking to a trained person can help you work through the things causing you stress in a way you can't do on your own."

Consider reasons why you don’t want to go.,
Talk to your counselor if you don’t feel like going.,
Make a change to make continuing therapy easier.,
Look for a new therapist if you feel uncomfortable.",How to Attend Stress Management Counseling2," Even if therapy is helping you, you may have times when you do not want to go. This is normal, but it is important to consider why you don’t want to go so that you can talk to your therapist about it. Some questions you might ask yourself include:When did you start feeling this way? Can you connect it with a specific session?
Do you ever feel uncomfortable talking with your therapist or during your appointments?
If you are on medication, do you think it is affecting the way you feel in negative ways?

, Sometimes therapy may get tough and you may not feel like going to an appointment or at all. If this happens, then it is important to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.Call your therapist or talk to him or her in person. Try saying something like, “I have been feeling like quitting therapy because I was bothered by ___ after our session last week.”
Don’t abruptly stop going to therapy if you don’t feel like going. Make sure that you talk to your counselor before you make any decisions.

, If there is something changeable about going to therapy that is causing problems for you, then you might need to change something to continue with your stress management counseling. This might be something simple that would be easy to change.For example, if the time of day is bad for you, ask your counselor about meeting at a different time. If the fees are too expensive, ask your counselor if he or she offers a sliding fee scale.

, It is important to feel comfortable with your therapist. If you are not feeling comfortable with your counselor, then you can always look for a new counselor.Although it might be a little uncomfortable to end your relationship with a therapist, being honest about your feelings is important. Try saying something like, “I appreciate the help you have given me, but I think I am going to start working with a different therapist.”

Identify your stress triggers.,
Avoid triggers when possible.,
Reframe your thought patterns.,
Laugh more.,
Solve the problems you can.",How to Attend Stress Management Counseling3," Before you can start stress management treatment, you need to work with your counselor to figure out the different kinds of triggers for your stress. Triggers can take many forms and will be different for each person. These triggers fall into four categories, which are:


Internal, which are the ones that relate to your personal feelings, goals, or expectation
External, which are stressful situations that happen to youAcute, which result from specific and situations that are new and unpredictable
Chronic, which results from continuous exposure to stressful situations, There may be stress triggers in your life that you can avoid. Work with your counselor to figure out which triggers you can remove from your life. This may be hard, especially if there are people in your life causing you stress.If there are people or certain situations that you can’t or don’t want to remove from your life, work with your counselor to figure out how you can make them better.
For example, if your friend’s constant discussion of wedding preparations are causing you undue stress, then you might ask her not to discuss her wedding planning as much when she is around you.

, When you go to counseling for stress management, you can learn how to reduce your stress by changing your thought patterns. Your counselor may use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help you identify your stress triggers and then turn them around to more positive ones.


Once you view the stressful situations in a more positive light, you will be less stressed on a regular basis.
For example, your counselor will help you take your stress reaction to getting stuck in traffic and turn it around to a more positive one. Instead, you can learn to think about it as more time to listen to your audio book, listen to your favorite music, or make phone calls.It may be hard to go straight from negative stress to positive. Try to make the situation neutral at first by thinking about how the situation will not affect your enough for you to stress about., A good way to relieve stress is to have more humor in your life. When you are stressed, you may be less likely to allow yourself to find humor and joy in your life. Work with your counselor to learn to laugh at yourself and the situations around you instead of getting too wrapped up in the stress.


Try to see humor in being cut off in traffic or other stressful situations.
If you can’t, go in search of humorous things, such as jokes or comedies, to help you laugh when you are feeling too stressed., Some of the stress triggers in your life can be solved and taken care of by you. Work you’re your counselor to determine which triggers you can come up with a solution to solve. Then work with your counselor to come up with a targeted stress management, problem solving scheme for those triggers that will lessen your overall stress.


This is especially true of internal triggers, which you put on yourself.For example, you may be stressed because you may be up for a promotion at work. Instead of stressing about the situation, come up with a plan that helps you perform your job so you know you are doing your best. Once you accept there is nothing else you could be doing to secure the promotion, you can let the stress go.

Write down your stressors.,
Find your happy place.,
Come up with a mantra.,
Do mindful deep breathing exercises.,
Exercise.,
Practice stress relief techniques every day.",How to Attend Stress Management Counseling4," When you are dealing with stressful situations, they start to build up and fester, making you more stressed. Talk to your counselor about the benefits of keeping a journal. Write down every activity, thought, or event that makes you stressed. Once you start getting your stress out, you can work with your counselor to let those stresses go.


You can also work with your counselor to identify places to change your thought patterns from the way you respond to stress., Work with your counselor to create a mental place where you are happy and free from stressors. Then, when you find yourself in a normally stressful situation, mentally take yourself away from the stress and go to your happy place.


This will help you relax in the moment and let the stress fall away.
Transitioning to this will not be easy. Work with your counselor to learn ways to push away the negative situation so you can find your happy place.
Your happy place may be a cabin in the woods, a ski resort, a boat on a lake, or any other place that makes you relaxed and happy., When you are dealing with stress, it may be hard to stop doing it. Work with your counselor to come up with a word or phrase to say to yourself to stop stressing about a situation. Ask your counselor for help learning how to come to push stressors out of your mind without them backing up.


The phrase you pick can be as easy as “No” or something more like “Don’t do this to yourself.”
Once you determine your word or phrase, say it to yourself or out loud whenever you find yourself stressing about things., When you are in a stressful situation, try doing deep breathing exercises. Work with your counselor to learn how to visualize your stress leaving your body as you exhale.


The breathing exercises have the added bonus of calming your body as well as your mind., Exercise helps boost your mood and reduce your stress. After a hard, stressful day, go for a run, do some yoga, go to a dance class, or take part in any physical activity that you enjoy doing. Work with your counselor to determine ways you can expel even more stress when you exercise by using positive thinking techniques to push away stressful thoughts.


This has the added benefit of improving your health as well.
Try to exercise at least three times a week to get the mood boosting help you need., After all the hard work you and your counselor have gone through to relieve stress in your life, you need to make sure you stick to your coping strategies every day. Find time to do something that helps you reduce stress every single day, even if the say wasn’t that stressful.


This can be as simple as listening to your favorite song, watching your favorite TV show or movie, taking a long walk, or talking to your best friend. It depends on your personal preference.
This will give you an overall better attitude and help you combat triggers when they do start to stress you out."

Learn different cognitive distortions.,
Identify how you overthink.,
Take note of how you're feeling.,
Challenge your automatic thoughts.,
Replace cognitive distortions with real facts.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Find ways to distract yourself.,
Explore your thoughts in writing.,
Do things that make you happy.,
Alter your view of failure.,
Try not to dwell on the past.,
Realize you can't predict the future.",How to Survive Overthinking," Before you can begin to address or cope with your habit of overthinking things, you'll need to learn what kinds of thoughts occur when you're engaging in this damaging behavior. Any time you find yourself indulging in painful, unpleasant, or self-doubting thoughts, you are on the road to overthinking because of cognitive distortions. Likewise if you find yourself listing reasons to not do something, or otherwise making excuses for your self-doubt.The most common cognitive distortions include:


All or nothing thinking - believing things are absolute and seeing every situation as being black or white.Overgeneralization - seeing one negative event as a continuous cycle of defeat or embarrassment.Mental filtering - dwelling only on negative things (thoughts, feelings, outcomes) while ignoring all the positive elements of those situations or scenarios.Discounting the positives - believing that none of your admirable qualities or accomplishments matter.Jumping to conclusions - either assuming that other people are reacting/thinking negatively towards you without any real evidence (called ""mind reading"") or believing that an event will turn out badly without any evidence for this conclusion.Magnification or minimization - blowing bad things out of proportion or reducing the importance of good things.Emotional reasoning - believing that the way you feel reflects an objective truth about yourself.""Should"" statements - chastising yourself or others for things that should or shouldn't have been said/done.Labeling - turning a mistake or shortcoming into a character attribute of yourself. (For example, turning the thought ""I messed up"" into ""I'm a loser and a failure."")Personalization and blame - internalizing fault for situations or events you aren't responsible for, or blaming others for situations/events that they had no control over.;
, There are numerous ways to overthink, many of which are caused by cognitive distortions. One form of overthinking is the thought pattern known as ""catastrophizing."" Catastrophizing occurs any time you automatically predict a negative outcome to some event or series of events, and jump to the conclusion that such an outcome would be devastating and unbearable.Catastrophizing is a combination of jumping to conclusions and overgeneralizing.


Try to identify which cognitive distortions affect your overthinking the most. Write down the thoughts you experience, and try to label which thoughts could fall into the category of cognitive distortions.Practice learning to recognize your ""overthinking"" thoughts in the moment, as they arise. Simply naming them when you become aware of them may be helpful. Try silently saying the word ""thinking"" whenever you begin to overthink - it may help ground you and break you out of your spiraling thought pattern., It's easy to fall into ""autopilot"" mode during the course of your day. But if your day is filled with situations that have the potential to induce anxiety, you may be walking blindly into a situation that will cause you to overthink and catastrophize.


Try mandating a personal ""check in"" for yourself. Assess how you're feeling as you enter different scenarios and situations that tend to evoke your pattern of overthinking.Identify any instance in which you begin to indulge patterns of overthinking.Don't judge yourself for it, just acknowledge it before you work to change it., Once you've identified an incident of overthinking or catastrophizing, you can now begin to challenge the validity of those thoughts. Challenging those thoughts by remembering that thoughts are not facts may help you break out of your pattern of overthinking.Thoughts do not always reflect reality, and they are oftentimes warped, uninformed, or simply wrong. By letting go of the infallible perception of your thoughts, you'll be more capable of considering other possibilities, or at least accepting that your overthinking isn't always right.Examine what (if any) real, objective evidence you have to support the cognitive distortions and patterns of overthinking that you're experiencing. There is a good chance that you will not be able to come up with any real, compelling evidence that the thoughts you're experiencing have any basis in truth.Try silently saying to yourself, ""These are just thoughts, and they are not truth.""Repeating this mantra may help you disengage from the spiraling thought patterns you're stuck in.

, If your patterns of overthinking are spiraling out of control, it may feel difficult to break out of that thought pattern. However, once you learn to recognize that the thoughts you're experiencing are not factual, you can then fairly easily replace that thought pattern with a more realistic one. Tell yourself, ""If I accept that my assumptions and overthinking are not grounded in facts, then what are the facts in this situation?""


Even if a situation ended badly, you can focus on what to do differently next time as an alternative to dwelling on what you should have said/done in the past.It won't come easily at first, but once you retrain your brain to process situations differently, it will eventually get easier.
Try asking other people who are aware of the situation for their input. Sometimes asking a trusted friend, relative, or colleague whether you're overreacting or overthinking things can help you realize that there's no reason to continue thinking that way.Try positive self-talk to replace self-doubt or overthinking.The way you talk to yourself (and think about yourself) can affect how you feel. So instead of criticizing yourself or ruminating on bad thoughts, try to focus on the things you did well and continue to do well., Many people who suffer from overthinking and cognitive distortions find relaxation techniques to be helpful in breaking out of harmful thought patterns.Relaxation techniques can also have physical benefits, like lowering your heart rate and blood pressure, slowing down your breathing rate, and reducing the activity of stress hormones in your body.There are numerous types of relaxation techniques, including:


Autogenic relaxation - repeat words or suggestions to yourself internally to help you relax. You might imagine a tranquil environment and then repeat positive affirmations, or simply focus on your breathing.Progressive muscle relaxation - focus on tensing, holding, and then relaxing each major muscle group in your body. Start at the head with your facial muscles and work your way down to your toes (or vice versa), tensing and holding each muscle group for five to ten seconds before releasing the muscles' tension into relaxation.Visualization - let your imagination form calming mental images, and visualize a serene place or situation.Mindful breathing - place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. While sitting, lying, or standing (whichever is most comfortable and convenient), take slow, deep breaths in, forcing the air into your abdomen instead of just your chest. You should feel your belly expand outward as you inhale. Hold the breath for a few seconds, then exhale slowly until all of the previous breath is gone. Repeat as many times as needed until you begin to feel calm.Meditation - similar to mindful breathing, meditation focuses on the slow, deep inhalation and exhalation of breath coupled with an element of meditative mindfulness. That may mean reciting a mantra (a word or phrase that helps you remain calm/focused) or focusing your attention on physical sensations, such as the feeling of sitting where you are, or the sensation of breathing in and out through your nostrils., If you find yourself constantly doubting yourself or overanalyzing situations, you may need to find a more active way to break out of that thought pattern. Try distracting yourself with a positive, healthy alternative. For example, you can try meditating to ground yourself in the present moment. Or, if you enjoy crafts, try taking up knitting or sewing to occupy your mind whenever overthinking thought patterns take over. If you play an instrument, pick it up and play for a bit. Find what comforts you and grounds you in the present moment, and use that activity as often as you need to., Writing is a very effective way of processing your thoughts, analyzing patterns of thinking, and finding ways to move past those thoughts. One writing exercise that many people find helpful is to take 10 minutes to explore the nature of your overthinking thought patterns in writing.Set a timer for 10 minutes.In that time, write as much about your thoughts as you can. Explore the people, situations, or time spans that you associate with those thoughts, and whether those thoughts have any bearing on who you were, who you currently are, or who you hope to be in your life.Read through your writings when the time is up and look for patterns of thinking. Ask yourself, ""Have these thought patterns influenced how I see myself, my relationships, or the world around me? If so, has that influence been a positive or negative one?""
You may also find it helpful to ask yourself, ""Have these thought patterns ever really helped me? Or have the number of missed opportunities and sleepless nights outnumbered the occasional time I was right?""

, Many people who overthink things avoid going out or having interactions out of fear that something may happen. Even if you're not yet able to break out of those thought patterns, it's important that you don't let your overthinking dictate your decisions. If there's something you want to go to (for example, a concert or a party), stop finding reasons not to go and force yourself out the door. Otherwise your overthinking will prevent you from doing anything, and you'll almost certainly regret it.Tell yourself that the regret you'd feel over missing out would be stronger than the regret over having a less-than-perfect time.Think of all the times you took a risk at trying something new and it paid off. Then think about all the times that staying home or being afraid of trying new things has gained you anything. You'll quickly see that taking that risk of failure was valuable because it led to good things.Remind yourself that you can always leave early if you aren't having a good time. The important thing is to go and see whether or not you can end up having a fun and meaningful experience., Whether you're afraid of trying something because your overthinking has led you to believe you'd fail, or you can't stop replaying the memory of a time you failed at something or in some role, you need to recognize that sometimes things just don't work out the way we'd like them to. And that's not always a bad thing. A lot of what we perceive as failure is not an ending, but a beginning: to new options, new opportunities, and new ways of living.Recognize that behaviors may fail, but people (namely, you) do not.Rather than seeing failure as the end of something good, try thinking about it as a new opportunity. If you lose your job, you may be able to find a better job that gives you more satisfaction. If you start a new art project and it doesn't turn out the way you hoped, at least you got some practice out of it, and you might have a better idea of what you'd like to do differently next time.Try to let failure motivate you. Put more effort and concentration into doing better next time, or spend more time preparing for future events., An important part of overthinking is to recognize that you cannot change the past, and that dwelling on it over and over will not help change anything. While learning from the past is an important part of growing and maturing, overthinking and ruminating on mistakes, missed opportunities, and other elements of the past is harmful and unproductive.Once you learn the lesson you believe you need to learn from a past event, try letting go of the memory. Don't consciously think about it, and any time you find yourself thinking about it try to distract yourself or snap yourself out of that thought pattern. Focus on the present moment, which you do have the power to change., No one knows what's going to happen, and your overthinking mind certainly isn't going to predict the future any better than the rest of the world. But many people with overthinking minds tend to believe that they know what will happen in advance: that trying out for the basketball team will only result in failure and humiliation, or that asking someone out will result in an awkward and devastating rejection. Yet without trying, how do you know? What are you basing your assumptions on? More likely than not, those assumptions are unfounded and are setting you up to fail by assuming from the start that you will.Remind yourself that no one knows what the future holds, and if you suffer from an overthinking mind, your ""predictions"" are mostly built from self-doubt and fear of the unknown."

Meditate.,
Get enough sleep.,
Think about the decision.,
Contact people you trust.",How to Choose a Path to Health and Happiness," At least once a day, sit down in a quiet place and try to clear your mind of everything. This may take a while - especially when you are stressed - but it gets easier with practice, like most things.

Do not wake up earlier than normal to meditate, because this may make you more stressed than if you didn't meditate at all.
Try to focus on something constant (like your breath or a low hum).
It is recommended to meditate for at least ten minutes daily.;
, Statistics say that you should get eight hours of sleep, but statistics also say that the average person gets about seven hours of sleep a night. So don't be worried if you don't get enough sleep. Don't think about how you aren't getting enough sleep, because that will make you more stressed and you won't be able to fall asleep.

Eat your dinner at the same time every day. Make sure you eat it before eight o'clock for guaranteed health and happiness.
When you are eating your dinner, make sure it is regularly enough that you don't have to snack afterward because eating before going to bed makes it harder to fall asleep.
Get more than one hour of exercise everyday, before you eat dinner. 30 minutes of exercise daily is deemed to be enough by many, but you should do as much as makes you happy and healthy.
Try your best not to look at any electronics for an hour before you go to bed (electronics make the stimuli in your eyes tell your eyes to keep open to see something)

, If you think for any reason that this decision will hurt you or somebody else, you should reconsider. Be sure you are calm and in the right state of mind before making decisions, especially big ones.

For in the moment decisions that aren't extremely important like what you are going to have for lunch, this does not apply.
If it is a big decision that you have to make right then, think about if it does more good or bad to you and others.

, Again, if the decision is something as small as what you are going to have for lunch, this does not apply.

If you have time to call somebody about an important decision, call them.
Make sure that the person you are calling is somebody you know you can trust to tell you the right answer even if they may be jealous. Be sure to consider jealousy when you are asking for advice.

Avoid processed foods when possible.,
Eat natural or whole foods.,
Limit your soda and alcohol consumption.,
Limit the amount of alcohol you drink.,
Eat a balanced diet when you can.,
Try to keep your diet varied.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Combat Stress with Good Nutrition1," When food is processed, important nutrients get stripped away. When your diet consists mainly of processed foods, you may find that you have a nutrient imbalance because your body is not getting its daily requirement of vitamins and minerals. When you do not get the nutrients you need, your body counteracts this imbalance by getting your nutrient supply from different parts of your body, which causes your body stress.


There are many types of processed food, but some common processed foods include refined flour, white sugar, and trans and saturated fats.;
, Natural or whole foods refer to foods that have been processed as little as possible and are free from additives and other artificial substances. These foods are generally packed with natural proteins, complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals that your body needs to function efficiently and remain stress-free.While there are many whole foods out there, some of the most common whole foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains.

, Soda is laden with caffeine, refined sugar, and, often, high fructose corn syrup. These ingredients, when taken in excess, can do some harm to your body, and can especially put stress on your kidneys.


Because of this, try to keep the amount of soda you drink to a minimum, and consider cutting it out of your diet entirely.

, Drinking a small amount of alcohol may help prevent heart disease and stroke, but excessive drinking can be harmful and stressful for your body. The amount you limit yourself to depends on your gender and age; women of all ages and men older than 65 should stick to one drink a day, while men 65 and younger should limit themselves to two drinks a day.One drink refers to 12 fluid ounces (350 ml) of beer, five fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces (44.4 ml) of distilled spirits., A balanced diet refers to one that includes all of the major and minor nutrients your body needs to remain healthy and stress-free. A balanced diet includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.


It is advisable to consult a dietitian with your particular individual requirement for these nutrients because they differ depending on your weight, height, physical activity, sex and other factors. But, generally, 60 % of your total energy requirement should come from carbohydrates, 20% from proteins and another 20% from fats.

, Eating in variety means making sure to consume nutrients from different kinds of sources. Variety ensures that the body is getting all the nutrients it needs. Having a balanced and varied diet supplies your body with sufficient nutrients that help to prevent physical stresses.


For example, let’s look at your protein for the day. If you had an egg for breakfast, try having fish for lunch and another protein, like a chicken breast, for dinner.

, Staying hydrated helps your body with processes like digestion, transporting nutrients, temperature regulation, and removing waste. When you become dehydrated, these processes can slow down and cause your body stress.


The amount of water you drink each day depends on the amount of exercise you do, and what sort of temperatures you are exposed to. As a general rule, adult women should try to drink roughly 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water a day, while adult men should drink around 3 liters (0.8 US gal)."

Draw something that comforts you.,
Just draw.,
Be somewhere where you feel calm.,
Have fun.",How to Relieve Stress by Drawing1," Content does not matter as much as the connotations you associate with whatever you choose to draw. If you find mountains or trees relaxing to be around, try your hand at drawing your very own. Other likely candidates include:


Your pet. Or your imaginary pet.
Flowers, leaves, or bumblebees.
Fruit, or other particularly attractive edibles.
A building or place you admire or have positive memories in.
Made-up combinations of animal parts. For instance, draw a dog’s head on a pig’s body with a turtle’s legs and tail.;
, Experiment drawing with different colors, patterns, and moods. Believe it or not, drawing can help induce physical relaxation by decreasing your blood pressure, slowing your respiratory rate, and lowering your pulse.Color your illustration with bright, exciting colors.
Draw patterns. Start with variations of circles, as they're easier and more soothing to draw. Simply cover a page in a pattern. Losing yourself to abstraction can be a very effective method of providing yourself with a healthy distraction and can boost creativity and memory too!Draw your subjects smiling. Whether mountain, human, or animal, add a smiley face. Sure, it’s silly – but you’ll probably smile back.

, Choose somewhere with minimal distractions. Definitely switch off your phone, and avoid areas with television or computers.


Somewhere private is best, as your drawing will not be inhibited by the presence of others, and you will be less likely to be interrupted.
Get outside. Simply being outside will calm you down. Drawing outside can also give you inspiration and ideas of things to draw.

, Let yourself enjoy the process. Don’t worry about the final product and don't judge your artistic abilities. Lose yourself in the experience of creation!Sitting down to draw for just a few minutes can rekindle your youthful spirit. You'll get a boost in energy and may even feel more open-minded for the rest of the day. Expressing ourselves visually allows us to circumvent some of the barriers we put up as we age, and to access our less critical, less judgmental side more easily.Mount your work. Hang it up somewhere it will catch your eye. Put it in your room or near a doorway you use to leave your house for unexpected boosts in your mood.

Eat more protein.,
Consume complex carbohydrates.,
Up your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Limit your caffeine intake.",How to Combat Stress with Good Nutrition2," Your body generally needs more protein when you are psychologically stressed. Stress can cause the death of cells and tissues, so your body needs an increased amount of protein to repair this damage. In addition to this, tryptophan, another protein, is needed to make serotonin, which is a chemical your body releases that makes you feel happy.


Protein-rich foods include poultry, fish, meats like beef and pork, nuts, eggs, beans, peas, and soy products like tofu.The amount of protein you should eat is roughly 0.8 to 1.0 gram (0.03 to 0.04 oz) per kilogram of healthy body weight per day.

, Serotonin is a chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter and is a hormone that can help you to feel relaxed. Carbohydrates prompt your brain to produce serotonin. There are two types of carbohydrates—the simple and the complex. Simple carbohydrates are digested quickly and contain refined sugars and few vitamins and minerals. Complex carbs and help you to feel full for longer, which means you will feel less inclined to snack (which many people do when they are stressed).


Sources of complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and pasta, beans and legumes, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes., Stress may weaken the immune system and increases the body’s antioxidant requirement. The commonly known antioxidants are Vitamin C, E and beta carotene. These antioxidants fight free radicals that can form in your body when you are stressed.


Good sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits, kiwi, papaya, green peppers, cabbage, spinach, broccoli, kale, cantaloupe and strawberries.
Vitamin E on the other hand is found mainly in germ oils of wheat, corn, cottonseed and soybean and fish oils, nuts and apricots.
Beta carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin A, is present in milk, butter, egg yolk, liver, spinach, grains and yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.

, Caffeine has a half life of four to six hours which means that it will take its full effect after six hours have passed. Because of this, it is important to avoid drinking caffeine after 2 PM, or else you could have a hard time falling asleep, which in turn could make you more stressed the next day. Caffeine can also take an effect on the following hormones, which in turn can make you feel stressed:


Adenosine: Caffeine can inhibit your body’s absorption of adenosine, which calms the body. While this may make you feel alert in the short run, it can cause problems with your sleep cycle later.
Adrenaline: Caffeine pumps adrenaline into your system, giving you a temporary boost, but making you fatigued and depressed later. If you take more caffeine to counteract these effects, you end up spending the day in an agitated state, and might find yourself jumpy and edgy by the time night comes around.
Cortisol: Caffeine can increase the body’s levels of cortisol. Cortisol is the “stress hormone”, which, as the name suggests, can make you feel very stressed.
Dopamine: Caffeine increases dopamine levels in your system, acting in a way similar to amphetamines, which can make you feel good for a short period of time. However, after the caffeine wears off, you may feel “low”.

Try to avoid skipping meals.,
Carry a healthy snack with you whenever possible.,
Avoid buying unhealthy foods.",How to Combat Stress with Good Nutrition3," Skipping meals can actually make stress-related symptoms worse. Common stress symptoms that can increase when you skip meals include headaches and stomach aches. Instead of skipping meals, try to fit in at least three meals each day, or space out your meals and eat four to five smaller meals throughout the day.


Skipping meals may also force you to opt for quick-energy sources like candies and other sweets instead of healthy meals. These quick-energy sources may spike your energy levels for awhile, but will ultimately cause you to crash and feel hungry and fatigued.

, Stressed people tend to absently munch, so it is sensible to always carry a healthy snack with you to avoid buying whatever is available (which is generally junk food). Ideas for healthy snacks include:


Fruits that can easily be eaten and handled like bananas, oranges and apples.
Whole grain cookies, sunflower and other seeds.
Carrot and celery sticks.

, One of the most effective ways to avoid unhealthy foods is to simply stop buying them. If you don’t have cookies in the house, you will be less inclined to absently munch on them.


Instead, fill your house with healthy snacks. However, be careful not to excessively snack on these foods. Just because they are healthy does not mean you should overeat.

Draw whatever is stressing you out.,
Release emotion onto the page.,
Keep an illustrated journal.",How to Relieve Stress by Drawing2," Be detailed and don't hold back. Draw literal or metaphorical representations of scenarios that indicate the sources of your stress. Creating a visual equivalent of what you’re facing is a powerful way to affect your feelings, and even help conceptualize solutions.Destroy the representation of your stress. Scribble all over it, or tear the page into tiny pieces. Use your hands to make the act of destruction especially satisfying.
Throw it all away! Just the act of metaphorically throwing your stressors away can be powerfully therapeutic.

, Without intending to draw anything in particular, simply apply your drawing utensil to a blank sheet of paper. Close your eyes. Focus on whatever emotions you’re feeling and would like to get rid of.Once you’re focused on an emotion, allow it to pass through your arm and hand onto the sheet of paper. Allow your emotion, not your mind, to dictate the movement of the pen or pencil. Whatever comes out on the page is simply an expression of what you’re feeling.
Since visual art is nonverbal, you don’t have to struggle to try to express yourself with words. Evoking feelings through creative expression can literally help you release emotions you’re holding in.Recognize that the illustration itself is insignificant. Focus purely on the act of drawing. By doing this, you’ll be more mindful of the present moment. This allows your mind to clear itself and calmly begin to recalibrate your emotions., You can conceptualize the journal in a certain way, or as a catch-all for your drawings. You may want to focus on drawing everything you feel positively about in life. Alternatively, you may simply want to draw everything that frustrates you. Or you can simply attempt to draw things that you find aesthetically pleasing. Keep a specific version of an illustrated journal in which you draw about feelings or ideas that come to you in specific contexts. For instance, keep a dream diary by your bed and attempt to draw what your imagination conjures in your dreams.

Listen to music while you draw.,
Take a drawing class.,
Keep your drawing materials with you.",How to Relieve Stress by Drawing3," Music can powerfully affect your mood by relaxing and inspiring you. Consider your music selection. Soft, rhythmic music (ideally without lyrics) will be especially effective in putting your mind at ease.


Vary the music depending on your mood – faster music can energize you as long as it doesn’t distract you or make you uncomfortable.
Play songs you know well. Lyrics can be welcome if you already know them. Singing along or mouthing the words without thinking can have a calming effect that distracts you from whatever has been stressing you out.

, You don’t need to achieve a certain level of ability to benefit from the mood-improving and calming aspects of drawing, but getting better can make drawing even more rewarding.Community colleges often have low cost classes taught by well-qualified teachers, and classes often meet in the evenings.
Lots of communities also have arts councils that will also offer fun-oriented, open-enrollment classes in drawing and other creative mediums.

, Keep at least a note pad and pen or pencil with you so you can draw whenever inspiration (or stress) strikes. As you go about your day, jot down ideas of what you’d like to draw later on. Simply visualizing yourself drawing will both calm you down and increase the satisfaction you derive once you get the chance to do so!

,How to Relieve Stress1,
"
Be aware that stress begins with our perceptions.,
Identify types of thinking that lead to stress.,
Reframe your thoughts.,
Challenge your negative thoughts.,
Try writing down two categories of information about the problem impacting you.,
Keep a journal.",How to Relieve Stress2," Your body has a very efficient reaction to dangerous events that pumps up your ""fight-or-flight"" response, allowing you to jump out of the way of an oncoming car and save your life.This reaction causes your heart to pound, your pulse to quicken, and your muscles to tense. But you may also unconsciously perceive that this reaction is necessary for non life-threatening situations, such as traffic jams, looming deadlines, or family issues.You must learn ways to counter your body's stress response so that you can ""put the brakes"" on and allow your body to relax., You may be experiencing unproductive, negative thoughts that lead to worrying, which can trigger the release of stress hormones.This is a response that is appropriate if, say, you run into a stressful situation like a bear in your path, but may not be appropriate when traffic is making you late to work. Identify common stressful thoughts by noticing if they fall into these categories:""Should"" or ""Must"" statements: You have a strict list of things you ""should,"" ""must,"" or ""should not"" do, and feel stressed out or anxious when you do not follow these rules.Catastrophizing: You expect the worst-case scenario or blow things out of proportion. Even small problems are ""horrible"" or a ""disaster.""All-or-nothing thinking: You see things only in black or white, as good or bad. Instead of acknowledging the complexities (or ""gray areas"") of being human, things are either wrong or right and there is no in between.""What if""ing: You find yourself having an internal conversation about things you fear, such as ""What if my child is hurt?"" ""What if I fail?"" ""What if I'm late?"" and so on., Sometimes, a stressful situation is just a matter of perspective. Pessimism, for example, is an excellent example of avoidable stress we put ourselves through. Instead of focusing on the negatives and the problems that are causing you anxiety, concentrate on the positives.Negative thoughts lead to a negative mood state and positive thoughts lead to a positive mood state. When you feel down, pay attention to your thoughts. What have you been telling yourself? Try to spin negative thoughts into positives.
For example, you may think to yourself ""I'll never finish all my work."" Change this thought by spinning it: ""If I work at a steady pace and take regular breaks, I can knock this work out in __ hours.""
When you change your viewpoint, you can change your level of stress altogether. Do your best to see things in a positive light, and avoid cynicism at all costs.

, Another way to combat stressful thoughts is to ask yourself whether there's really any truth to them. Disputing and disproving your thoughts can help you view your thoughts objectively instead of immediately accepting them as truth., Make a column for evidence of/for the stressful thought and another for evidence against it.Or, if you don't have paper or time, try to do this exercise mentally.


Write the evidence in the appropriate column. So if you're catastrophizing because you're been running late (and you are thinking ""I'm going to be fired""), your ""for"" column might look like: ""I was late twice last week and they're not going to tolerate me being late again;"" while your ""against"" column might look like: ""My boss said he understands that I have to drop my son off at preschool before I can drive to work,"" ""We have a time and attendance policy that allows me to be late a certain number of times, and I'm nowhere near that point,"" and so on.

, Although keeping a journal may seem strange or tedious, writing down your thoughts on a regular basis can help keep you stress-free. When you feel bogged down with some emotional or mental stressor, write about it in your journal. Getting it out on paper will give you a sense of relief you might not otherwise find.Write honestly and without fear. Your journal is only for you: no one else needs to read it or see what is stressing you out. It is a safe, judgement-free place to get out all your worries, emotions, thoughts, and feelings.Once your thoughts are down on paper, they will no longer be taking up space in your brain.
Journaling can help you experience clarity and see the source of your stress.
Write out your problems to organize your thoughts. When your thoughts are not organized, you can't think clearly, which leads to confusion and stress. If you have a problem and can't decide between two solutions, make a two column pros and cons list (for and against), such as dividing a sheet of paper down the center to compare two ways to handle that situation.

Accept that stress is unavoidable.,
Avoid stress when you can.,
Be better organized.,
Learn to say ""no"".,
Learn how to delegate.",How to Relieve Stress3," You can take steps to reduce your stress and learn how to cope with stress, but you will never be completely rid of stress.Stress serves a purpose as a healthy response to overwhelming stimuli or perceived threats, and it can be dealt with in an equally healthy fashion.Stressors that may be unavoidable include school work and exams, busy days at work, new babies, getting married, or moving. Some of these are actually good things, but can still be a source of stress in your life.
Learning healthy stress management techniques can help you ""turn off"" your stress alarm system so that you are not in a constant state of stress as you move through life., Seems obvious, right? Sometimes staying away from what is stressing you out is harder than it sounds. If you know particular person or activity is the origin of your stress, cut them or it out of your life, or limit your exposure as much as possible. There are at least seven culprits of unnecessary stress; beware of falling prey to these issues.Stressing about money you have spent (e.g. overspending at the mall, lending money to family or friends, etc.)
Having clutter in your home or office space
Being pessimistic
Being late
Spending too much time comparing your life to others' on social media
Waiting until the last minute to complete a task
Ruminating about past events

, Oftentimes, stress arises from feeling overwhelmed. Use a planner to keep track of your ""to-do lists"". Clean your desk and visit Pinterest to find useful ways to manage your paperwork and household chores. Being organized and getting your priorities straight can help you break responsibilities down into manageable pieces and focus on the things that really matter to you., You cannot do everything you are asked, so why keep pretending that you can? Indeed, the more you promise and don't deliver, the less people will perceive you as being reliable. Instead, be assertive and learn to say ""no"" politely, but firmly. Keep track of your schedule to clearly acknowledge when you do not have the time or resources to take on extra tasks.


Assertive people maintain eye contact, speak in a clear and non-threatening tone while standing up for themselves. If you know that you are already overbooked, say so. It's okay to say ""no"" when you do it in a way that also respects others.
Some people take on too much out of fear of missing out on new and exciting opportunities. Yet, they end up not performing as well as they would because they are dividing their energies between so many different tasks or activities. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of new obligations, and decide if the effort will be worth it considering your current workload., As with trying to do everything, never delegating is about you trying to have control and not trusting that others can do their job as well as you can. Learn to let go by giving more credence to the abilities of others. Giving up tasks may seem stressful in theory, but will free you up for more personal time. Find reliable people in your life that you can trust with tasks that you are too stressed or anxious to manage."

Clean up a bit.,
Take a few minutes to get ready.,
Listen to some music.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Change your environment.,
Talk to new people.",How to Relieve Stress4," Even the most steadfast of souls will waver in an ever-messy environment. If your home, office, car, or work space is overly messy or dirty, it is certainly having an effect on your mental well-being. Take a few minutes to clean up your most unorganized areas, and your mind will breathe a sigh of relief. Tips for reducing clutter are as follows:Toss items that are rarely used and have no value rather than stockpiling them.
Gather as a team (i.e. spouses, families, or roommates) and take on cleaning together. Group effort makes the process go by quicker and with more fun.
Sort through papers and mail and toss or file as needed. Develop a regular schedule of doing this to prevent papers from piling up.
Designate places to store frequently used items so they can be easily retrieved when you need them.
Clean your work space after each work session to prevent clutter from getting out of hand.

, It’s hard to feel prepared for the day when you haven’t taken time to get yourself ready. Spend a few extra minutes in the morning to prepare yourself for the day's events. Take an extra long shower, put on your favorite outfit, and go into the day ready to take on anything.

, Music has shown to have a very strong effect on mood and mental state. Calm yourself down by listening to your favorite soothing music. Although you may prefer heavy metal or rap, try listening to something a bit softer and slower for the best effects. Keeping music playing in the background while you work, study, or just go about your daily activities is a great way to subconsciously alter your stress levels.


Researchers have found that music can change brain functioning in similar ways as medication. So, regular music really can help to ""cure"" stress and anxiety. , That’s right, what you smell can actually alter your stress levels. Scientific studies have linked the scent of lavender and oranges to reduced stress and anxiety levels.Use a lavender scented air freshener in your home, office, or car, or spritz a bit of the essential oil onto your hair and skin before you head out the door in the morning. You can also dab a bit of the essential oil onto your temples to relieve a stress-induced headache., If making little changes isn’t enough to cheer you up, try moving to a completely new place for a bit. If work or studying is too difficult in your office or at home, relocate to a cozy coffee shop or a park. Having a new environment will help you to move your thoughts away from your stressors, and give you a chance to breathe and recover from your anxiety., It's possible the people you talk to are stressors. Don't completely take them out of your life, but try meeting some different folks. They can offer a new perspective on things you never even thought about, or get you involved in new stress-reducing activities."

Know that most students will switch majors.,
Think of your college major as a jumping-off point.,
Understand your career path will shift in unexpected ways.",How to Stress Less About Your Career Path when Preparing for College1," As many as eighty percent of college students will graduate with a major that is different from the one they declared at the beginning of their college careers. This means you can relax a little instead of feeling that the decisions you make today are final.You can limit the stress of possibly switching majors by focusing on core and introductory major classes during your first year.
Many core and introductory courses can transfer easily into your new major if you decide to switch.;
, Don’t look at your college major as a permanent career decision. Instead think of it as a place from which you will jump into the working world. Your career will build upon the knowledge, skills, and experiences you gain in college, but that does not mean your major will define your path in life.Try to enrich your knowledge, skills, and experiences beyond your major by taking elective courses in other subjects, participating in internships, and seeking out new experiences like studying abroad or taking a gap year.

, No matter how well laid your career plan might be, chances are it will change over the course of your lifetime. You can stress less about choosing the perfect career path by knowing that the type of work you do will shift during your life.For example, a theatre major who intended to have a career in performance might end up as a successful project management specialist in the arts sector.

Talk to people who can help you.",How to Combat SAT and ACT Stress," While the SAT was originally conceived as a test that you couldn’t study for, those days are long gone. Both the SAT and ACT are predicated on significant preparation by test-takers, and are not conducive to “cramming” or “binge” studying. Don’t start preparing the night before, or the week before; give yourself several weeks if not months to properly and methodically prepare.By starting your preparation early, you can pace yourself, working on a single section for perhaps an hour per day. This can help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed by the totality of the preparation required.
Thorough preparation need not break the bank, even though there are tutoring and other options that can set you back hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Look for free preparation resources on the official exam websites and elsewhere, then consider paid options as needed.;
, It doesn’t need to be an either/or situation — many people take both the SAT and ACT exams. However, if you need or want to focus on taking just one, consider the differences in the exams and decide which is better suited to your strengths.


Some people consider the ACT to be more user-friendly and straightforward, and thus somewhat less stressful. Another new version of the SAT is being unveiled in 2016 to supposedly address some of these concerns (and deal with falling behind the ACT in terms of market share).The ACT is an achievement test, meant to measure what you learned in school, is longer (with 5 sections), and is completely multiple choice except for the optional writing test. You are not penalized for wrong answers. The SAT is still more of an aptitude test, meant to determine your reasoning and verbal abilities. It has three sections, including a (now optional) writing component, and penalizes wrong answers., To become a better foul shooter in basketball, you take lots of practice free throws. To get ready for your high school musical, you run through your part over and again. To get ready for the SAT or ACT, you should take numerous and frequent practice tests. This is the best way to familiarize yourself with the content, format, and “feel” of taking these exams.Practice test books and websites abound for both the SAT and ACT. Look for free practice tests on the official websites.Over time, try to increasingly replicate the test-day experience while taking practice tests. Time yourself closely, and take the practice test at a time of day and location that approximates the conditions in which you will take the actual exam.

, Some people seem to have a knack for taking standardized tests, while others seem to naturally struggle with them (even if they have the same command of the material). No matter where you fit on this scale, plotting out a test-taking strategy tailored to either the SAT or ACT will help you to answer as many questions as possible as effectively as possible.No matter whether you are taking the SAT or ACT, never leave ""easy"" questions (ones to which you know the answer) blank. Answer them right away, then circle back to tougher questions as time allows. Use a process of elimination for tougher questions; if you can rule out even two possible answers, you will significantly improve your odds of making an ""educated guess.""
Because the SAT penalizes wrong answers, you should skip over questions you aren't sure about and return to them at the end of the section, after you've answered all the other questions. If you can eliminate answers and make it a ""50/50"" guess, go ahead and answer. If not, leave it blank and move on.
The ACT doesn't penalize wrong answers, so you should never leave any question blank. Follow the same process as the SAT, but leave yourself enough time to at least fill in your ""best guess"" (or just a random guess) for every question. You're bound to get at least a few of them right and improve your score.

, Exams like the SAT and ACT are stressful in part because so much feels out of your control. Should I study this, or that? Will it ask these questions, or those ones? This relates to what some experts call the N.U.T.S. model of stress — which stands for Novelty, Unpredictability, Threat to self or ego, and Sense of control that is lacking. The more of these conditions that are present, the more stress you are likely to feel.You can’t control what topics will be covered or which specific questions will be asked on the exam. You can, however, exert full control over your preparation, giving you a sense of agency and confidence that can reduce your stress. Make a plan. Create a schedule. Stick to it. Remove as much of the “N.U.T.S.” as you can.

, No matter how well you prepare beforehand, you’re going to wake up the morning of the test feeling nervous and anxious. Don’t add unnecessary stress about choosing what to wear or finding your identification or calculator to the mix. Avoid whatever stress you can so you can focus on managing the stress you can’t avoid.Lay out your clothes, making comfort your priority. Pack your bag, making sure you have everything on your checklist (confirm what you need for test day on the official SAT or ACT website(s)). Know exactly how you’re going to get to exactly where you need to be at exactly the right time to take the test.

, Studying instead of sleeping the night before the test will do more harm than good. Adequate sleep reduces stress levels and will increase energy and focus for test day. Prepare your body to function at peak capacity instead of trying to squeeze in one more practice exam or review session.Try to eat a hearty, healthy breakfast that will give you steady energy through the testing period. If you are too nervous to eat much, try to have several smaller (healthy) snacks. Drink lots of water as well, so that you remain hydrated.

, It is very important that you fully comprehend the specific instructions for each section of either the SAT or ACT exam. However, every moment you spend on test day carefully reading over instructions could be used for answering questions during what is in both cases a strictly timed test. Thankfully, while you can’t find the specific questions beforehand, you can find and thoroughly read over the section instructions before you walk into the testing center.Go to the official SAT and/or ACT websites to access the instructions ahead of time.
This is another way to decrease uncertainty and increase your sense of control over the test, which will help to alleviate some of your stress.

, These tests take several hours, and every minute counts. There are multiple scheduled breaks between sections, so be ready to maximize your use of these windows to rest and recharge. Also have a plan ready for when you need a mini “brain break” (for just a few seconds) while taking the test.


For instance, practice a quick breathing exercise you can use anytime on exam day. Close your eyes, inhale slowly and deeply, hold for a beat, then release slowly and fully. Repeat three times, and see how much more relaxed and focused you feel.You will probably need a few little “eye breaks” from time to time while staring intently at your exam. Look away for a second, stare off into space (but not in the direction of someone else’s exam!), and take one or two deep breaths. Then refocus your eyes and mind on the exam., No matter how well you prepare, you will feel some stress during the exam. Some of it is unavoidable, but much of it can be avoided if you keep things in the proper perspective.


For example, you may feel as though you are competing against the other people taking the exam, and worry if they seem to be finishing faster than you. Remember that their scores have absolutely no bearing upon yours. Imagine that each person in the room is taking a completely different test if that helps. Focus only on yourself and your exam.Don't rush through the questions, unless the section period is about to end and you have blank questions remaining (especially with the ACT, which doesn't penalize wrong answers). Train yourself to keep a quick but steady pace. Use your training and especially your practice exams to establish this pace.Keep reminding yourself that the test is important, but it's not ""life or death."" SAT or ACT scores are not the ""be all, end all"" when it comes to college choices and your life going forward. They are but one facet of the portfolio you are building., During exam preparation or another stressful scenario, you can ensnare yourself in a vicious cycle. Stress makes it harder for you to sleep and less interested in eating healthy meals, which in turn makes your body more susceptible to stress, which in turn further impairs your sleeping and eating patterns, and so on. A healthy body can manage stress much more effectively, so you must prioritize eating right, sleeping enough, and exercising often.As a teen, set aside 8-10 hours for sleep each night. Adequate sleep gives you energy, focus, and a positive outlook, while inadequate sleep increases your stress hormone levels.
Get 30-60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each day. Schedule small exercise breaks into your study sessions. Regular exercise improves your mood and reduces stress levels.
Eat healthy, balanced meals, with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. This will provide steady energy and focus. Resist the temptation for supposed “comfort foods” like sugary drinks or fatty fast food. These will provide only a temporary boost, followed by a crash.
See this wikiHow article for more on making healthy choices and other ways to reduce stress as a teen.

, When you’re stressed out about a big event like an SAT or ACT exam, you may feel like any waking moment not directed toward preparation is wasted time. You have to remember, however, that you’re not a machine. For your emotional, mental, and physical health, you have to set aside time each day for relaxing, enjoyable, stress-relieving activities.Listen to music. Read a book. Take a walk. Talk to a friend. Bake cookies. Find time for a favorite hobby, or try out a new one. Find what makes you calm, relaxed, and happy, and make some time for it.

, Some people get the greatest stress reduction impact out of activities specifically intended to have a calming effect. It can be as simple as deep breathing exercises, or as complex as advanced yoga poses. Even breaks of 5-10 minutes, or perhaps a half-hour, can have a significant stress reduction effect.



How to Relieve Stress provides a nice introductory discussion of calming techniques like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, mindfulness, spirituality, and others.

Keeping a journal is also an easy and effective way to deal with stress. The simple act of writing down how you feel and what you are thinking can help you better manage a stressful situation such as SAT or ACT preparation.

, You have to take the SAT or ACT tests alone, but you don’t have to prepare for them — or deal with the stress they cause — on your own. Seek out good listeners and people you can trust, and talk about your you general test anxieties, the specific areas of the test in which you feel less confident, and so on. Like writing, talking about your stress can help you to better recognize and manage the situation.Don’t be afraid to seek out the help of a trusted teacher, a guidance counselor, or a professional therapist if you are feeling overwhelmed by your stress. Seek out people with experience dealing with your type of situation, so that they can provide you with specific advice regarding how to manage SAT / ACT stress.

Increased fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
Trouble sleeping.
Upset stomach.
Anxiety or irritability.
Lack of motivation.;
, Identifying the root of your stress is crucial for understanding if you're suffering from secondhand stress. The next time you feel stress symptoms coming on, recognize them. Then you can analyze the situation and figure out what caused the feelings.


Excuse yourself from the situation you were in. To analyze what happened, it would be helpful to be in a quiet place where no one will bother you. Especially if someone talking to you is causing the stress, you should remove yourself so you can think.
Think about what you were doing when you started to feel stressed. Ask yourself specifically when you started feeling stressed. You might find that hearing your friend or coworker complain about something was your trigger. Or seeing your boss have an outburst after hearing bad news could have also set you off. If this is the case, you've identified that someone else is the root of your stress.

, When you're feeling stressed and having difficulty locking down a source for it, keeping a journal can help you focus your thoughts and narrow down what's troubling you. Commit to writing every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.Your journal can take on any structure or format you want, but in this case you may want to tailor your writings towards what's bothering you.
Some initial questions to guide your writing might be: what am I feeling now? At what time recently did I feel stressed? What was I doing? How did I respond?
Even after you figure out the cause of your stress, you don't have to quit writing. Keeping a journal is a great way to get out your feelings and keep your overall mental health in good shape.

, Absorbing someone else's stress may not be the only reason you're feeling stressed. In fact, dealing with a stressed person can exacerbate the stress you're already feeling. Go through different aspects of your life and see if anything else is wrong. That way, you can not only remedy your problems with another individual, but also work to reduce your overall stress level by identifying other triggers in your life.Think about work. Have you been dissatisfied with your performance or your position?
Think about your family. Is anyone sick or having problems? Are you having trouble paying your bills?
If you're in school, are you feeling stressed from your workload?

, The obvious cure for secondhand stress is to avoid that particular person. This isn't always easy, because a close friend or family member could be causing this stress. However, if the cause of your stress is only a casual acquaintance or coworker, you can limit your exposure to them without worrying about any personal repercussions., Some evidence indicates that heavy usage of social media can increase stress levels. Social networking encourages users to compare themselves to others, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. It also makes bullying very easy. If you find yourself targeted on social media or keep comparing yourself to others, it would probably be best to cut down on your usage.You could block or unfollow the particular people who are causing trouble for you.
You need to maintain a level of detachment from social media. Realize that people often try to make their lives more interesting than they really are, so comparing yourself to this ideal is unrealistic.

, Avoiding the cause of your stress isn't always possible, especially if that person is a family member or a coworker you interact with regularly. The person who is causing your secondhand stress may be going through a tough time themselves.Sometimes, people just need someone to talk to. Next time the person lashes out or exhibits signs of stress, ask if he or she wants to take a walk. Then, in a more informal setting, you can ask if everything is okay and if you can help at all.
Do be careful not to take on more responsibilities than you can handle if this person asks you for help. Remember, you still have to take care of your own health.

, Treating other people's problems as your own is a main cause of secondhand stress. To avoid stress, you have to disconnect from other people's problems and avoid acting like they're your own.Of course this doesn't mean you shouldn't be sympathetic or sensitive to people's problems. You can still let them talk to you and offer advice. But don't let yourself get more involved than that, or you risk adopting other people's problems and stressing yourself.

, If the person stressing you is a family member or close friend, you probably don't want to cut him or her out of your life. You still need breaks to keep yourself fresh, however. If this person is relying on you for help, then you need to be in a good mental state to help. By taking breaks and taking care of yourself, you can recharge your resolve and be a better help when you come back.Plan out some alone time where you can relax and unwind. Do whatever activity you enjoy and distracts you from stress.

, In some cases, like with a sick family member, you can't just avoid the person causing your stress. The stress in these situations can be constant. If you're having trouble coping, try talking to a counselor or other mental health professional. He or she can teach you techniques to control your stress and give you an outlet to express your feelings and frustrations.

, In addition to the steps designed specifically to treat secondhand stress, you can learn some techniques to reduce your overall stress level. If you're unable to avoid the source of your stress, then these management techniques will be especially helpful., A common and powerful tool for reducing stress is deep breathing. By using the right techniques, you can effectively lower your stress level and come back to the problem relaxed and ready to work out a solution.Take breaths from your abdomen, not your chest. This will pull more oxygen into your body and help you relax. When breathing, place your hand on your stomach to make sure your abdomen rises and falls when you breathe. If it doesn't, you aren't breathing deeply enough.
Sit up with your back straight. Alternatively, you could lie on the floor too.
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Take in as much air as you can, and then exhale until your lungs are completely empty.

, Physical activity helps de-stress the body by distracting your brain and releasing endorphins. Include more physical activity in your life if you've been feeling stressed. Even a few minutes of exercise has been shown to have a positive affect on stress levels.Aerobic activities like running or biking tend to be better for stress reduction, though all activity is good.
If you don't enjoy working out, there are plenty of other physical activities you can do. Try going for a walk, swimming, working outside, or any other activities you enjoy that get you moving.

, You might be making your stress worse without even realizing it. A number of foods and drinks can exacerbate stress. By cutting out certain things and including others, you can benefit your stress level and overall health.Caffeine causes your heart rate to go up, which makes stress worse. If you drink several caffeinated beverages daily, try to cut down on your intake to lower your stress levels.
Sugary foods have a similar effect on your health and stress levels because they raise your heart rate.
Alcohol also makes stress worse. If you drink regularly, you should cut back to benefit your overall health.
Foods that have a beneficial effect on stress are whole grains, almonds, pure dark chocolate (the every dark kind, without much added sugar), and berries.

, Lack of sleep makes stress much worse. Without adequate sleep, the body doesn't properly rest and repair itself. Commit to getting a full 8 hours of sleep every night. Not only will your stress levels go down, but your overall health will benefit., Often when people feel stressed, they start talking to themselves negatively. This makes their moods even worse. Avoid this trap by practicing positive self-talk.When you're feeling stressed out, use phrases like ""I can make it through this,"" and ""These feelings will pass.""
Work to eliminate negative thinking. When these kinds of thoughts enter your mind, stop and isolate them. Then replace them with a positive spin. For example, if you're stressed with school and you tell yourself, ""I'll never finish all this work,"" replace that thought with ""I have a lot of work, but I'm capable of finishing it by tomorrow.""

Choose a martial art that suits your needs.,
Several types of Traditional Martial Arts


Soft Style:

Aikido (Japanese) - This art was described by its founder (Morihei Ueshiba) as ""A method for transforming conflict into harmony"".,
Learn to recognize the stress response.,
Understand how martial arts can reduce your stress and lessen your vulnerability to stress.,
Be prepared to expose yourself to fear stimuli.,
Slow down.,
Learn Zen.",How to Reduce Stress With Martial Arts," There are many kinds of martial arts, so spend some time reading about the different kinds and their underlying philosophies. What is important though is to focus on traditional martial arts, as the studies show benefits in terms of well-being and reduced hostility result from participating in the traditional forms only.If you have the chance, do trial lessons in several different types of martial arts to get a feel for the one that you enjoy doing the most. Keep your focus on the martial arts likely to bring you the most stress relief; some are not as likely to do this as others but again, it depends on you. Some of the martial arts in particular to check out include:


Choose between Hard Style and Soft Style: Hard Style arts teach striking and blocking in various combination. Some focus on speed and precision, others on power and toughness. Hard Style training involves a lot of time training with an inanimate, padded, target. Soft Style arts teach grappling and throwing. Some focus on receiving attacks, others are more similar to wrestling. Soft Style training involves lots of time spent with a partner.
Choose a culture: Traditional Martial arts are traditional because they are passed down through some culture. Japanese martial arts have become popular with our culture because of their presence in many movies and television shows, but they are not exclusive. The Chinese have several distinctive and interesting styles, as do the Philippines, Korea, and there are also some schools of traditional European Martial Arts. Different cultures place emphasis on different aspects of training, and also advance different visions of what it means to be a good person.
Choose a specific group: Each training group interprets the tradition which they come from differently. Some groups are very competitive, constantly comparing the students and forcing improvement through tension. Others are supportive and have great compassion for mistakes. There will also be differences between the interpretation of the actual techniques. Because no one can teach every aspect equally, some things will be taught more, and others less.
Visit a class: You can't know if a training group is right until you experience the class in action. Some groups make visitors watch, others invite you to join them right from the start. Even if invited to join, you can decline and watch from the sidelines anyway. Remember when visiting a group to be respectful. If sitting and watching, the goal is for the students not to know that you are there. Don't be secretive, just be unobtrusive. If you are training as a guest, be humble. You have no rank and therefore everyone is your senior. Always assume that they are right when they explain how to do a technique. If you think that they are so seriously wrong that you will injure yourself or another student by complying, plead ignorance or weakness, and don't do that technique. Do not correct them. You may, however, ask a student of senior rank for clarification. Once again, claim that you do not understand, not that you think that they are wrong.;
, The training focuses on receiving attacks from a partner, and redirecting their energy into either a throw or a drop. Joint locks are used. Main School Aikido is not intended as combat training. Instead, each technique is a philosophical metaphor for a way of life. Several of the first students founded their own schools which do teach Aikido as combat training. Chief among those is the Yoshinkai school, which the Tokyo municipal police, the Japanese National Police and the Japanese Military police train in.
Judo (Japanese) - This is more of a sport than an art. It is derived from Jujitsu, which is combat orientated. This art teaches the throwing and pinning of a partner after making contact, usually in the form of a ""clinch"". Training is done with partners, usually in the form of drills. Joint locks and also chokes are used at higher levels, but are omitted for the first several ranks of training.
Tai Chi (Chinese) - This is actually a mixed art, with both Hard and Soft elements, but is primarily recognized for its Soft elements. Basic Tai Chi is actually something called internalized training, which is merely an exercise for fully power training. Many people enjoy the internalized training so much that they never move on. Full power Tai Chi is combat training, but its internalized form is not.
Jujitsu (Brazilian) - While this art is originally Japanese, the Brazilians have made it their own by producing many masters of great skill, as well as by slightly modifying the style. This was mostly possible because Judo replaced Jujitsu in Japan. Training is similar to Judo, but the culture of the art is slightly more aggressive, and students learn joint locks and chokes sooner in their training.
Wrestling (Greek) - This sport is familiar to high school athletics in most European and European descended countries.


Hard Style:

Boxing - This sport is definitely not combat training, because of all of the restrictions on what techniques participants can use. However, there is no better way of building up your endurance and toughness. Knowing confidently that few things can injure you is great for your peace of mind.
Karate (Okinawan) - While Okinawa has been annexed by Japan for a long time, they do have a distinct culture, and Karate comes from their attempts to repel the Japanese occupation force. This originated as the primary combat method of secret revolutionaries. It focuses on unarmed combat or on combat with commonly available tools like farming equipment. Traditional Karate contains both Hard and Soft elements, but many dojos minimize or omit the soft style training. Karate has a heavy focus on Kata (memorized forms).
Kung Fu (Chinese) - This is a combat form originated by Buddhist monks. It assumes a very great time available to dedicate to training. Because of this the techniques can be quite difficult to learn. However, these techniques are very powerful once acquired. Because of its origin in the Buddhist quest for enlightenment, there is a heavy focus on improving all aspects of the student's life, not just their fighting ability.
Taekwondo (Korean) - This Hard Style is the national sport of South Korea, and has over the past several decades become divided between those who practice it as an art or a sport and those who practice it as combat training. Many Martial Artists consider Taekwondo masters to be the most knowledgeable about kicks of any martial art.



, In order to assess the difference that martial arts training will be making to your stress levels, you'll need to know what your stress response typically consists of. Some or many of the following responses are fairly commonplace in a highly stressed person, while the following step will clarify how martial arts will make a positive difference in reducing these types of stress response:


Your heart rate and blood pressure increase, with more blood going to the muscles (hence tension)
Your oxygen levels change, with less oxygen going to your conscious brain and more going to your reactive brain, leaving you open to mental blanking, memory failure, loss of logic, increase in emotions, narrow your attention and cause you to be edgy
Your blood clots faster and blood sugar levels increase, resulting in jelly legs, sugar cravings and sometimes heartburn
You may feel paralyzed, your stomach knotted, and your voice may change or be constricted
Your breathing can become more rapid, your sensitivity heighten, and your body temperature increase, potentially causing dizziness, fainting, increased hearing and seeing ability, sweating and hot flushes
Other noticeable or long-term changes that can damage health.

, The purpose of traditional martial arts is to train a warrior spirit or mind.A warrior spirit can only fully form by developing the certain characteristics, all of which are highly helpful to building your coping mechanisms against stress, such as improving your decision-making, calming your fears, and projecting confidence. As the list in the step prior to this one shows, each of these elements is often absent in a highly stressed person, as hyper-sensitivity to other people's verbal and bodily cues and a high state of alertness for danger brought on by real or perceived dangers in the workplace, on the street, in social settings, etc. take over. And when anger or fear dominate, the thinking processes tend to shut down, and a constant state of being like this leaves you stressed. Learning the way of the warrior spirit may help you to contain your stress responses and teach you how to establish real focus and self-management. The following elements are usual parts of what you'll learn in your martial arts training:You will be responding to situations that involve fear.
You will be learning how to develop non-verbal behaviors that manage to communicate confidence to others.
You will be learning how to remain calm under pressure.
You will be learning how to make rapid decisions under stressful situations.

, In martial arts, given that you are going to be facing an opponent, you will be confronted by fear-evoking situations (including the fear of being physically hurt).This exposure is a good thing because over time, the practice of dealing with it regularly can alleviate your internalized fear and help to desensitize you to things that provoke your fear, such as feeling you're not safe, not confident enough, or that you're unable to defend yourself. From a stress point of view, this is exposure coupled with learning how to respond effectively will begin to reduce your anxiety levels as well as training you in how to respond logically and calmly.


Stress can be produced when you are afraid of something bad happening to you, even where the harm is imagined, mostly because you don't feel able to defend yourself. Training in a martial art can give you the confidence to start believing that even if something bad does happen, you have the wherewithal to respond and defend yourself, not just physically but also retaining your mental clarity.
If you're withdrawn and not particularly assertive, your desire to avoid conflict can increase your stress symptoms because your anxiety levels can leave you feeling unable to cope with the stressors around you. If you live a life feeling that you're not safe, a martial art can help to restore a sense of reassurance and will allow you to deal much better with conflict in general.
Fights almost never go to plan. Martial arts will teach you to intuitively rely on a series of fallback positions to keep changing the perspective and outcomes. This is precisely what you should do in the rest of your life as well, as life rarely goes according to plan either, and the person most able to bend with the changes and spring back up again is the person less likely to break under the pressure of stress.

, When people first begin a martial art, there is a tendency to try to learn fast, to catch up with others, and to perform well from the beginning.What often happens as a result is that the beginner's movements are too fast and ineffectual, the posture is poor, and motor control is difficult. With practice, patience, and time however, you will find that your movements become more confident and slower, and your posture improves, with greater motor control and mental mastery also following. Each of these outcomes will aid in reducing your stress levels, as you master your body's responses and strengthen your breathing and reaction responses.


As you increase through the different levels of your martial arts training (usually denoted by different colors of belts), you will start to wield more and more mastery over your body's reactions and over your fear reactions. The resulting confidence and decreased fearfulness will give you greater positive thinking power that can help you learn to cope with and lessen the impact of stressors in your life.
Martial arts will give you the internal discipline to react to a world that doesn't slow down or stand still for anyone; how you react to external stimuli makes all the difference between staying stressed or coping and staying resilient.

, Zen Buddhism a belief system that is often coupled with martial arts training. It is a mindset that is greatly beneficial to maintain. Almost eliminating stress, Zen teaches you to focus on the moment and to go with the flow.


Daily meditation will also help you to relax.
Martial arts and Zen teach you to forget the needs of the self and act accordingly. When you have fully grasped the inner discipline and the outer respect for others without fearing them, you will discover that craving objects or other desires lessens and that doing what is needed to be done can be achieved in a peaceful manner that does not disturb your mental and bodily processes, without reducing you to a constant state of stress. Through martial arts, you will become more confident in everything you do and less worried about the ""what if"", focusing only on the now.

Take it slowly but surely.",How to Leave the Past Behind," Unresolved past experiences can sometimes produce lasting psychological and physiological effects. In such cases, it’s important to come to terms with how your past is affecting your current outlook or habits.


An important first step is to stop trying to pretend you aren't affected by past events. You can't get over the past until you accept it. If something happens that reminds you of a traumatic event or triggers a strong emotional reaction, try to calmly acknowledge to yourself that this is the case. Let yourself feel what you feel about the past. Later steps in this article provide some specific strategies to help with this.
For example, if you find yourself in a social situation that triggers powerful emotions about the past, don't try to push them away. Instead, excuse yourself for a moment and step away from the group. Then, take a moment to reflect on the past and how it is affecting you before rejoining the group.
The impact of past traumas can be especially strong if you are without a strong social support network.Sometimes, the trauma resulting from past experiences can be so intense that it affects the people you care about.Unresolved past experience can prevent you from building strong relationships with your loved ones. They can also keep you preoccupied with dreams that never came to fruition. This, in turn, can affect your current outlook and habits in ways that make it hard to cope with obstacles in your life.;
, Traumatic or particularly intense experiences can affect our neurochemistry. At times, this can even impact the structure of our brains.


If you find yourself feeling like you should just ""get over it,"" remind yourself that reality is more complicated than that. Traumatic events can actually change the way your brain works. This can take a long time to overcome, so cut yourself some slack and try to be patient.
Emerging research in neuroscience  suggests that brains have a certain “plasticity.” Our genetic predispositions can be manipulated and expressed in unpredictable ways after powerful experiences.In other words, your brain can change. It is a product of both your genes and your experiences.
The physiological and psychological effects of past experiences can seem difficult to overcome and incorporate into your life. But, it’s important to keep in mind your body and brain are constantly reorganizing themselves based on new experiences.Your brain and body have changed before, and will change again. You can make that change a positive thing.

, You can't revisit the past, but you can change the way you perceive it and handle it from now on. If you don't, your hurt self will carry over this emotional pain into other new experiences and relationships.


Your efforts here should be directed toward accepting the past and forgiving those who may have wronged you. Allow yourself to feel whatever emotions you have about your past. Then, try to let those feelings go.When you experience anger or sorrow about the past, try to remind yourself that hanging on to these negative emotions only harms you in the end. No amount of anger will undo what happened. Acknowledge your feelings. Then, look within for the compassion to forgive those who harmed you and the strength to let go.This process will take time and will be different for each person. Other steps in this article are designed to help with the process.
Dwelling on the past can cause problems without any conscious desire on your behalf.

, There are several activities called embodied physical practices that can help you make peace with the past. Meditation and yoga, for example, can help you develop personal coping techniques. These activities help you become more sensitive to the ways your emotions affect different parts of your body.Yoga is best learned with the guidance of a professional instructor. If you've never tried it before check online to see if there are free or low-cost introductory classes offered in your community. Many places have affordable options you can use to try yoga and see if it's right for you.
Meditation is something you can easily do alone in your home. Find a comfortable place to sit with your legs crossed and your hands in your lap. Close your eyes and take slow deep breaths. If your mind wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing. Try a CD or a downloaded MP3 to help guide you through meditation.These practices give you the psychological time and space to identify particular emotions related to past experiences. In doing so, they can allow you to notice and work through the effects they’ve had on your behavior and thought processes., Write about the events in your day-to-day life, or about the past. These are great ways to work through difficult emotions.Start off one night by simply listing the events you experienced throughout the day. You don't even need to force them into any sort of narrative. Try not to think too hard about it; keep your mind open and just write down whatever feels natural. This will get you comfortable with the process of journaling.
This should become easier with each day as it develops into a habit. At this point you can start writing about past experiences that come to mind during your writing sessions.
Focus on your thoughts and feelings. The important thing is to express yourself, not to tell a beautiful story.Journaling about the upsetting events of your past can help you come to terms with them and make them less intrusive in your day-to-day life. Expressive writing has both mental and physical health benefits. It can help you process your emotions and can also help restore disturbed sleep patterns.This kind of emotional work can take some time and introspection but it can be very productive if you let the process unfold on its own.

, Unresolved past experiences can sometimes make it feel impossible to trust new people in your life. This can make it hard to build healthy relationships. However, strong social support systems can be the most important factor in healing the effects of damaging experiences.It’s important to feel supported around other people as opposed to frightened so take it slow at first; maybe just meet a new person for coffee.
Volunteering can also be a great way for you to become more comfortable with interacting with other people again. This can even help you become more comfortable with your vulnerabilities as you see others bear their own.

, If you ever feel overwhelmed, or utterly helpless, consider getting support from a professional. If what you’re dealing with just won't go away or isn’t improved with the steps above speak to a counselor or therapist.There are times when past experiences can be so debilitating that it’s necessary to get help from someone who has helped people through such issues before. This is what counselors and therapists are for.
If you don’t know how to find one you could speak to your primary care doctor who will likely be able to refer you.
Your insurance policy may cover a certain number of visits to a mental health professional. Check your policy details to find out.

, Consider leaving behind friends who keep you focused on the past. The social environment we live is an essential part of what defines both who we are.It also affects how we incorporate unresolved past experiences into our lives.


Spend some time thinking (or maybe writing in your journal) about the people you spend time with and how they make you feel. If there are people in your life who make you feel bad or reinforce negative habits, consider spending less time with them.
For example, people who constantly put you down may not be good to have in your life. Friends who make it difficult for you to do what you need to do to incorporate difficult past experiences can also be a problem. Consider making new friends, or at least initiating a change of scenery.
This of isn’t always easy, but can be a great way to force you out of your comfort zone and grow as a person.
It's a good idea to try new hobbies with your new companions. When you're ready, start to push the boundaries of your comfort zone by joining a local sports team or art class. New directions for your life will gradually emerge that might not have otherwise seemed possible.

, Don't upset yourself by thinking about people who did not respect and appreciate you. Instead, concentrate on those who stick by your side. Let them know you appreciate their help.It can be hard not to dwell on negativity. But, your supportive friends are the ones who deserve your attention.
Keep good friends close by during this time. Having a supportive community of people around you will help you stay strong. It will allow you to feel confident enough to engage with unresolved past experiences or difficult emotions without feeling alone.
When you feel like you're slipping, try spending some time around someone you trust who can help keep you on the right track.If you feel that you are going to fall back into a bad habit, or or are on the verge of despair, call a trusted friend and ask if he or she can meet you for coffee or swing by your house. Having someone around can help you feel supported. This can help you make through tough times.

, Systematic desensitization is the process of gradually easing people into potentially distressing situations while using relaxation techniques.The goal is over time to feel more comfortable experimenting with these situations on your own.This is an approach you can use to start getting comfortable with situations that are causing you a great deal of anxiety.
Start by learning basic relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Then, expose yourself to situations that remind you of those that make you feel uncomfortable. Use the relaxation techniques you've learned to stay calm.
Start with short exposures to stressful situations. The key here is to move at your own pace, guarding against pushing yourself too far. Eventually, you should be able to engage comfortably in situations that currently cause you distress.
For example, imagine you were attacked and badly hurt by a vicious dog. You might start avoiding all dogs. To move beyond this, you could try visiting a trusted friend who has a dog you know to be friendly. Use relaxation techniques before and during a short visit to your friend's home. Try to visit often, staying a little longer each time. This might be difficult at first, but spending a little time with a non-threatening dog could help you overcome your feelings about the attack.

, Sometimes we develop habits that keep us from confronting and moving beyond unresolved experiences. They can keep us from incorporating their effects into our decisions in the present.Part of incorporating these effects is breaking these habits to confront your feelings.


Let's stick with the example of a fear of dogs. If you were attacked by a dog, you might develop a habit of crossing the street when you see someone walking a dog. You might get to the point where you do this without even thinking about it. In the short run, this might reduce your anxiety. But in the long run, it might be preventing you from getting over your fear. If nothing else, its an inconvenience. In this situation, you could make an effort to break this habit. You don't need to seek out dogs, but try to stop crossing the street when you see one coming. After getting comfortable with that, you might even ask that stranger if you could pet their dog. Gradually, this will help you let go of the traumatic event.
Systematic desensitization can he helpful in trying to change counterproductive habits.
Sometimes we don't notice how unresolved experiences have changed us. Our attempts to avoid them become embedded in our day-to-day habits. One way to become more aware of changes in behavior is to ask someone you trust if they notice anything odd in the way you’ve been acting. Other people often are able to pick up on things we aren’t able to notice in ourselves.For example, after a breakup you could ask your best friend: “have I been acting weird in any way since me and my girlfriend broke up?”

, Sit down make a list of all the times you avoided doing something because you were afraid or didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. You don’t even have to know why you were afraid at the time. Sometimes just writing about your feelings about past experiences can be a great way to allow them to flow more openly.


This can be especially valuable if you don't have a good friend around to ask about your behavior.
As the ideas start to flow, think about new ways you can approach these situations in the future.
For example, imagine your list makes it clear that you’re hesitant to go out with your friends. Start by inviting them over to your house so you have a little bit more control over the situation. Maybe invite those you are closest to over at first, and then after a few visits, ask them to bring over some people you don’t know very well.
Take it slow and don’t be afraid to ask for help from people you trust. A gradual progression can help you incorporate the effects of most negative past experiences that you haven’t been able to resolve.
By slowly pushing yourself in ways that might have made you uncomfortable before, dysfunctional habits will begin to fade away. Then you can start working towards building new, more functional habits in your day-to-day life.

, For a time, it can be helpful to put the things that remind you of the unresolved past experience in a box. Get a large box and throw into it anything that reminds you of a past failed relationship, a job that left you feeling sore. Anything physical that reminds you of troubling experiences should go in the box.


After some time has passed, decide whether this box should be tossed or stored. Either way, you are coming to a conclusion about its contents that they can no longer influence you.

, Putting words and names to emotions and unresolved experiences can make them more tangible. This can help you better manage your feelings.


You could, for instance, write a letter to a person or people in the past who hurt you or experienced a difficult event with you. Being able to engage with such people from your past can be quite helpful, even if they are not actually present for you to converse with.You could write or speak poetry or prose. Anything that allows you to let out the feelings you are holding on to from the past is fine. No matter how horrid the words are that come to mind, let them out.

, While you're going through the healing process, try to be aware of the triggers that can send you back to past habits. This can include experiences like coming in contact a person who hurt you. Sometimes even watching a movie that reminds you of an unresolved experience can be a trigger.


When you are exposed to such a situation, use the techniques described above. Actively aim to put a hold on habitual reactions and challenge yourself to do things differently.
This also means avoiding making decisions in haste that you may regret later. For example, think carefully before cutting off ties with somebody in your family or sending someone notes filled with anger. Before quitting something you have been doing for a long time, such as a job, give this careful consideration. Some of these choices might end up being the path you take after thinking it through. Initially though, this exercise is about strengthening yourself to make calm and enlightened decisions.
It can be especially helpful to check in with a therapist or mental health counselor. He or she will often have suggestions to help you cope with experiences that trigger negative feelings.
Remember in difficult times that you do care about tomorrow. Your goal is to build a responsible, thoughtful, and clear future that is free of the control of past habits.

, Don't expect an overnight transformation. You will only achieve the best results by allowing yourself time and space to incorporate the effects of the past into your life.


Each person recovers a different pace. If you start to think: ""I should be over this by now,"" try to replace that thought with: ""I have made progress and will continue to do so.""

Here are some great ways to exercise:


Take up running. Running releases endorphins and can make you feel great after you do it. Try setting a goal for yourself, like running a 5k or 10k race. This will keep you motivated and make you feel more capable of meeting and tackling challenges.
Join a pool and swim a mile every other day. Immersing yourself in water will make you feel stronger and will wash away any of your stressful thoughts. This is also a good activity if you have any joint or muscle pain.
Take a yoga class. Yoga is not only great for you physically, but it will help you learn to regulate your breath and your mind's wanderings.
Join a team sport, like bowling, volleyball, or softball. You'll be able to make new friends and workout at the same time. In other words, you get the benefits of socialization AND exercising in one go.
Take up hiking. You'll feel less stressed if you spend more time in nature and exposed to fresh air.;
, Massage therapy can help reduce stress.A massage is a great way to relax and to minimize the physical and emotional tension you are experiencing. You can give yourself a massage by massaging your neck, forearms, and palms, ask a friend to give you a massage, or even go to a professional masseuse.


A professional massage can be pricey, but well worth it. A masseuse will literally be able to knead some of the stress out of your body. Check to see if massage therapy is covered by your insurance plan.
Massaging is also great foreplay. If you have a willing significant other, ask him to massage your feet or back, and see where it takes you.

, Maintaining the right diet is the key to reducing stress. Well-nourished bodies are better able to cope with the physical and emotional side effects of stress.Moreover, stress has been correlated with overeating; people tend to seek high-calorie, high-fat foods when they feel stressed.If you want to reduce the stress in your life, then you should pay particular attention to your diet. Here's how to do it:


Eat a healthy breakfast.Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, so take the time to eat healthy carbs like oatmeal, proteins like lean turkey or ham, and a healthy portion of fruits and vegetables.Eat three balanced meals a day. Not skipping meals no matter how busy or stressed you are will help stabilize your routine and give you more energy.Make time for healthy snacks that will keep your energy high throughout the day. Carry an apple, banana, or bag of almonds. Avoid snacks that will make you feel unhealthy and lethargic, like a sugary snack or a soda.
Minimize your caffeine and sugar intake. Caffeine and sugar may give you a temporary boost but often result in energy and mood crashes later on. Cutting back on these things may also help you sleep more soundly., A number of herbs and teas can have a calming effect and reduce stress-induced insomnia, anxiety or anger. Always make sure to consult your physician or other health practitioner before using any new herbs or supplements. The most common herbs and teas used for stress relief include:Chamomile - The chamomile plant has been popular because of its wide range of healing properties and its easy availability. Perhaps most commonly ingested as a tea, chamomile is often used to relieve stress-induced symptoms, such as insomnia and upset stomachs.Passionflower - Passionflower plants have been used to treat sleep disorders, anxiety, and gastrointestinal problems. Recent research has suggested that passionflower can be as effective as prescriptive chemical drugs in treating anxiety. Passionflower is usually ingested as a tea.Lavender - Research has shown that lavender can produce calming, soothing, and sedative effects when its scent is inhaled. For this reason, lavender is often used in aromatherapy oils, teas, soaps, bath gels and lotions, among many other commercial products.Valerian root - Valerian root can be used to treat anxiety and insomnia, although it should not be used for longer than one month., Sleep is simply too important to shortchange and sacrifice.Improving your sleep schedule will go a long way in helping you reduce stress, since sleep affects your memory, judgment, and mood.Research has shown that most Americans would be happier, healthier, and safer if they slept an extra 60-90 minutes each night.Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep a day to get a healthy night's sleep. Sleeping too much or not enough can make you feel groggy and unable to deal with your responsibilities.
Try to get the same amount of sleep every night. Don't sleep five hours a day during the week and then sleep ten hours a day on weekends, or you will feel even more unbalanced and tired.
Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day. This will make your routine even more regular, and it will become easier for you to go to bed and wake up.
Spend an hour decompressing in bed before you actually go to sleep. Read or listen to calming music, or write in your journal. Don't watch TV or look at your phone, as it can be harder to wind down and get your mind and body into sleep mode.

, Most people separate their physical selves from their mental selves. However, it can be useful to take a moment and check in with and mentally scan your body to understand how stress is affecting it.Lie on your back or sit with your feet on the floor. Start at your toes and work your way up to your scalp, noticing how your body feels and where there is any tension. Don't work to change anything or loosen up those tense areas, just be aware of them.For a couple of minutes, lie resting and breathing into all areas of your body, from top to bottom. Imagining the breath flowing into each body part as you come to it., Place a warm heat wrap or cloth around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes as you shut your eyes. Try to relax your face, neck and shoulders.You can also use a tennis ball or Acuball to then massage those head, neck, and shoulder muscles where many of us hold our tension. Place the ball between your back and the wall or the floor, depending on what is easiest and most comfortable for you. Lean against the ball and apply gentle pressure to your back for up to 30 seconds. Then, move the ball to another area to decompress that particular spot., Reading is a great way to calm your mind and to gain knowledge. It's also a wonderful way to wake up your mind in the morning and to help yourself fall asleep at night. Whether you're reading historical fiction or a steamy romance, being absorbed in another world will help you relax your mind. Even just six minutes of reading can help reduce your stress level by two-thirds.If it helps, you can read with calming classical music in the background before you go to bed.
Keep a good light source nearby to protect your eyes, but dim the lights around you as you read to make yourself more calm and ease yourself into relaxation and rest.
If you love reading and want to make it more social, join a book club. This is a great way to encourage yourself to read and make friends in the process. Again, you can hit two birds with one stone here to reduce your stress level: do something you love and have meaningful interactions with others.

, Become a positive thinker and to take more pleasure in your everyday interactions. Psychologists have shown that optimists and pessimists often face the same setbacks and challenges but the optimist copes with these in a better manner.Think everyday about 3 small things that you are grateful for; this will help remind you of all of the positive elements of your life even when you're feeling stressed. Positive thinking can help you keep a little perspective., Laughing has been proven to reduce stress. Many physicians, like Patch Adams, believe that humor can positively impact recovery from illnesses and surgeries.Studies have even shown that the very act of smiling can improve your mood and make you feel happier.Laughing releases endorphins, brain chemicals that enhance your mood.Using humor allows you to take back your power. Humor allows us to look at things in a different light. It may turn whatever is stressing you out on its head. It often pokes fun of authority. It may give you a novel way of seeing what is bothering you. Laughter and humor is a deep and powerful tool to see life differently.

, Focusing on deepening your breath is one way to invoke the relaxation response to stress. Deep breathing is also known as diaphragmatic breathing, abdominal breathing, belly breathing, and paced respiration. Deep breathing encourages full oxygen exchange, meaning the trade of incoming fresh oxygen for outgoing carbon dioxide.This helps to slow the heartbeat and stabilize or even lower blood pressure.Begin by finding a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Take a normal breath or two to settle yourself. Then try a deep breath: breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your chest and lower belly to expand as you fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Don't hold it back, as many of us tend to do. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth (or your nose, if that feels more natural). Once you feel comfortable doing this after a few practice rounds, move on to the regular form of breath focus. As you sit with your eyes closed, complement your deep breathing with helpful imagery and perhaps a focus word or phrase that helps you relax.Why doesn't shallow breathing have the same effect? Shallow breathing in fact does the opposite by limiting the motion of the diaphragm. When we breath shallowly, the lower lungs don't get a full share of oxygenated air, which can cause you to feel short of breath and anxious.

, Mindfulness exercises are ways of paying attention to the present moment in order to help people adjust how they think and feel about their experiences.Mindfulness helps people manage and reduce stress and often uses techniques like meditation, breathing and yoga..Try meditating if you can't make it to a course on mindfulness or a yoga class. You can meditate anywhere and for as long as you like. Meditating for just 20 minutes a day can reduce your stress greatly. All you have to do is find a comfortable seat in a quiet place, put your hands in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Focus on being present and relaxed in your body, and notice every breath and small ache you feel. Work on clearing your mind of any negative or stressful thoughts; this can be the hardest part. And, most importantly: breathe. If you find your mind wandering, focus on counting your inhales and exhales. Try meditating right after you wake up or to wind down before bed., Recognize that you can't control everything. There will always be stressful elements in your life, but you can minimize the stress in your life by eliminating what you can and learning to cope with the rest.It can be helpful to consult your journal and review all of the things you are stressing over but can't control, including traffic, who your boss and coworkers are, economic ups and downs, etc.
It's not easy to realize that you can't control anything but you may find it empowering in the end. For example, in this process you will realize that the only thoughts and behaviors you can control are your own. You can't control what your boss thinks about you or what your in-laws say; instead, what you CAN control are your responses and reactions to them. You will thus gain a new appreciation for who you are and what you're capable of.

, Instead of avoiding or putting off dealing with your stressors, why not face them directly? Though you may not be able to single-handedly eliminate all of the things that are stressing you out, you may be able to alleviate them to some degree and, most importantly, prevent them from worsening and having increasingly adverse effects on your mental and physical well-being.


Address any stressful situations in the workplace. If you feel overworked or undervalued, talk to your boss in a calm and reasonable manner. If you feel that you're over-committed at work, find a way to do half an hour less work a day, perhaps by cutting out distractions or unnecessary breaks in your work flow. Look for solutions that will help you reduce that particular stressor without adding any additional stress. Learn how to be assertive to communicate your needs so that they are taken seriously.Address any relationships that are causing you stress. If you're stressed out about the state of your relationship with a partner, family member or friend, it's best to start a conversation than to wait around to see what happens. The sooner you open up about the stress the relationship is causing you, the sooner you can begin to resolve it.
Address the ""little things"" that need doing. Sometimes it can be the smallest things that add to our daily stress as they build up and remain undone. If you're feeling like you're starting to ""sweat the small stuff"", deal with these things directly. Make a to-do list of the little things (such as needing to change your oil to making a dentist appointment) that are nagging you and see how many you can get done in a month. Creating a checklist can be very motivating; you'll get to see the list get shorter as you check items off.

, Getting organized, planning ahead and being prepared can reduce stress levels.One of the first key steps is to keep a day planner that lists all of your appointments, meetings, and anything else you have scheduled, such as a yoga class or class trip. This will help you know what your days look like each week and month. In so doing, you'll have a better sense of what you need to do and how to plan for these things.


Organize your short-term plans. If you're stressed at the thought of an upcoming trip, try to hammer out the details as early as you can so there are no x-factors. Knowing what's ahead will give you a sense of control and help you better manage any unforeseen circumstances.
Organize your space. If you declutter your space, then your life will feel more organized and manageable. This may take some effort, but the benefits will outweigh the time you spend on getting everything right. Get rid of things you no longer use or need (such as old clothes, electronics or small appliances) and rearrange your space to make it as functional as possible. Try to maintain an organized and clean living space. Spend 10-15 minutes each night throwing out anything you don't need, cleaning, and putting everything back in its place. A clean and clear space can help make a clear mind.

, While there are a lot of commitments you cannot control, there are a lot that you can. All too often, people say ""yes"" to things that do not bring pleasure, or cause undue anxiety, or take away from more important commitments. One reason that many people feel stressed out is because they feel over-committed and like they don't have enough time to pursue their interests or spend time with their loved ones.


Make appointments for yourself. This is something parents especially need to do--put aside time for one's self rather than children, community, church group, or whatever. Whether that is to go on a hike, take a hot bubble bath, or meet up with a friend--this is important time to put aside.
Distinguish between ""shoulds"" and ""musts"". You must file your taxes on time, for instance. But feeling you should make homemade treats for your child's pre-school class may make you feel guilty when you simply do not have the time to make Pintrest-worthy food--if the children are perfectly happy with carrot sticks and ranch dip, why not opt for something simpler?Think about what you absolutely have to do and prioritize that over things that you ""should"" or would do in an ideal situation.
Learn how to say ""no."" If your friend is always throwing parties that are crowded and cause you anxiety, skip the next one. It's okay - and sometimes necessary - to say ""no"" sometimes. Know your limits and stick to them. Taking on more than you can handle is one definite way to increase your stress.Make a ""To-Don't List"". Sometimes there is so much focus on tasks, it makes the day a never-ending hum of activity. Try making a list of what to remove from your schedule. For instance:

If you have to work late on Thursday, if you can avoid making dinner that night, do so.
You have to help your parents clean out the garage this weekend. You will end up tired and sweaty, so going skateboarding with your friends will likely be out. Maybe you can go next week.
You have a big test coming up. That may mean you have to go to the gym for a half hour, not for two hours.



, Make time to relax for at least an hour each day, especially in the morning and in the evening before bed. Write it into your planner so that you don't end up skipping out on it. Everyone needs time to recharge their batteries.Do something you enjoy every day, whether it be a short play of the piano, stargazing, or doing a puzzle. Such activities will remind you of some of the things you like about your life., Instead of thinking ""X, Y, and Z are really stressing me out,"" shift your focus to what you can do to alleviate these problems. Shifting your perspective from the problem itself to what you are going to do about it can help you reassert control over your life.For example, if you know that traffic stresses you out because it is boring and wastes your time, ask yourself what you can do to change your experience of being in traffic. Come up with a range of solutions (such as listening to music or books on tape or getting a co-worker to carpool with you) and try them out. Assess methodically which is working best for you. Framing stressors as problems implies that they are things that can be solved, like a puzzle or math question., Research has shown that people who experience major life stresses, such as the loss of a partner or job, come out the other side of the ordeal more easily if they have a network of friends and family on whom they can draw and rely.Spend your time with people who are positive forces in your life, who make you feel appreciated, valued, and confident and encourage you to be your best possible self.


Minimize your interactions with people who stress you out. If someone in your life is stressing you out all the time, then you're probably better off without that person. Of course, you may not be able to cut off a stress-inducing coworker, but you can certainly try to minimize your interactions with people who stress you out on a daily basis.Avoid individuals who are negative and who make you feel inadequate. Negativity breeds stress. Try minimize your contact with all of the negative people in your life. Someone who is not supportive of you may in fact cause you greater stress than if you were simply alone., Before you can move forward, you need to be able to identify the causes of your stress. Take some time to be alone and get out a notepad or journal. List everything that may be contributing to your feelings of stress. Once you have a better sense of what is causing your stress, you can make changes that will help you cope with it.Consult a stress inventory. A stress inventory can help you assess your stress. The Holmes-Rahe Life Stress Inventory is widely used in the psychology and psychiatric fields. This list contains 43 stressful life events that can impact your mental and physical well-being from severely stressful events, such as the loss of a spouse or a divorce to less stressful events, like vacations and minor violations of the law (e.g., jaywalking or parking tickets). It is important to note, however, that all individuals feel stress in different ways and deal with life events differently. While a stress inventory may be useful in helping you identify some causes of stress, it may not list everything you're experiencing or may assign values that don't jive with your own experience.
Journaling - even for just 20 minutes a day - has been proven to help people in many areas of their lives. Journaling has been correlated with reduced stress and an improved immune system. Further, writing helps you keep track of your personal behavior and emotional patterns. It can also help you resolve conflict and know yourself better.Begin by considering the root causes of your stress.You may think you're stressed because of your low salary, but the real root cause may be that you're generally dissatisfied at your job and are uncertain about what career path to pursue. Or what if you get stressed when your husband buys a new gadget? Are you mad specifically about the gadget or is your stress coming from bigger concerns about your family's growing debt?
Evaluate your personal relationships. Are the relationships in your life helping you be a better person and cope effectively with stressors? Or are these relationships instead causing added stress?

, Are you stressed because of a specific situation or are you in a permanent state of stress? Stress because a coworker failed to get his project done for a meeting, for example, is different than if you are feeling stressed from the moment you wake up to when you go to bed. If you are in a constant state of stress, there may be a more serious underlying condition to your stress. In this case, you should consult a mental health professional for guidance and advice. You can also start learning how to deal with anxiety by reading up on the different coping strategies that are out there.

, This will help you determine what is stressing you out the most. Ranking your stressors will also determine where you should focus your energies in order to proactively reduce your stress. For instance, traffic might be at number 10, whereas financial concerns are at the top of the list.

, To reduce stress, you have to be methodical and thoughtful. If you're really determined to reduce or even eliminate the stress in your life, then you have to take directed and specific actions to alleviate certain stressors.


Start with the little things on the bottom of the ranked list you created and see if you can address them one by one. For example, you could make traffic time less stressful by leaving earlier, bringing along your favorite music or getting books on tape to listen to in the car. You could also consider alternative transport options, like a carpool or public transit.
Work your way up the list to find ways to address all of the different aspects of your life that stress you out. Some may be easier to cope with than others. For example, it might not be so simple to remove the stress of money as to make your commute more enjoyable. However, you can still plan to take proactive measures wherever possible, such as consulting with a financial advisor. Even the act of reflecting on your stress can be empowering and stress-relieving.Consider making a Stress Management Worksheet for each of your stressors. This will help you understand each stressor individually and how it impacts your life. It can also help you think of and commit to a few ways to addressing that stressor. For example, you can write down how you plan to cope with a specific stressor from a more positive perspective. The worksheet also helps you focus on your more general experiences of stress as well and asks you to commit to listing a few key ways in which to plan to treat your self better and engage in some self-care.

, You don't have to deal with your stress alone. You'll feel much better if you open up to a friend, family member, or even a professional.If you share your feelings, chances are that you'll be able to get some helpful feedback and a fresh perspective on your problems. In addition, the very act of talking about your stress - saying the words out loud - might help you clarify what exactly it is that you are struggling with.Talk to a close friend or family member about your stress and stress management techniques. It's likely that people around you have had to cope with stress at some point in their lives, so you'll not only be able to open up, but you'll gain some insight as well.
Know when to get help. If you constantly feel overwhelmed by every aspect of your life, you may benefit from seeing a mental health professional. If you're so stressed that you can barely sleep, eat, or think straight, then it's time to seek help.

Distract yourself for a while.,
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Talk to friends or family.,
Write down your feelings.,
Think positively.",How to Calm Down After a Stressful Experience1," When you experience a stressful situation, you may want to keep thinking about it over and over afterwards. You may dissect the situation and think about what you did wrong or right. If it was traumatic, you may keep just reliving it and thinking about it. Try to avoid this kind of thinking and find something enjoyable to distract yourself for a while.For example, you could watch a movie, play a video game, read a book, listen to a podcast, or talk to a friend about something unrelated to what happened.
Continuously thinking about the stressful experience can keep your nervous system on alert and feed your stress.
Keep in mind that it is normal to want to replay the situation over and think about it, but doing this can make it harder to calm down. You will be able to calm down faster if you wait to process what happened.;
, Don’t try to ignore how you are feeling. Acknowledge that you are stressed, upset, overwhelmed, or scared. That is okay. Trying to ignore the feelings may cause them to simmer, keeping you stressed. Instead, acknowledge them so you can move on from them.Acknowledging the feelings isn’t the same as dwelling or obsessing. Once you acknowledge them, try to let them go.

, After you experience a stressful situation, you may want to talk to someone you trust. Reach out to a family member or friend and tell them about what happened to you. Sometimes just getting the stress off your chest and sharing it with someone is enough to help you calm down.If you don’t feel comfortable talking to the person about what happened, then a friendly conversation may help, too. Spending time with someone you enjoy being around can help you feel better.
You may want to connect physically with another person. Ask for a hug, to hold hands, or a comforting arm around you. Sometimes, just a smile and laughing with another person can calm you.

, Another way to calm yourself is to write down what you’re feeling. You may find writing down your experience, your emotions, and your fears therapeutic. Putting the feelings on paper can help you take control of your thoughts and start to calm as you get them out.You can write in a journal, type it on the computer, or scribble down thoughts on a scratch pad.

, One way you may be able to calm down after a stressful experience is to change the way you think about the experience. You may be stressing because you are feeling negative or pessimistic. You may feel overwhelmed because the situation is out of your control. Try to reframe how you think about the experience by changing your thoughts to positive ones.You may tell yourself that you are fine now and got through the experience. You are strong and survived.
You can remind yourself that you did all that was possible, and that is important.
Tell yourself that things may not be as bad as you think because you are thinking through stress and anxiety. Try to take a step back from the situation and look at it in a neutral, calmer way.
Try to reframe criticism or what you might perceive as a personal attack as feedback or learning opportunities. For example, if your boss criticizes your work performance, then try to focus on how you might use the feedback to improve your work performance.

Choose a location for the funeral.,
Prepare a grave.,
Ask all the mourners to arrive in their black clothes so the ceremony can begin promptly.,
Have everyone sit somewhere peaceful or somber so they can reflect on all the burdens in their lives.,
When everyone has written their burdens, take them to the burial ground in a solemn procession and circle the grave (if you made one).,
Light the candle.,
Begin with one of your burdens first, since you are the Mistress/Master of Ceremonies.,
Cover the grave and give each mourner a note card that has the following inscription: ""Goodbye burdens, I don't need you anymore, I am complete as I am.,
Lead your procession away from the grave and change from your mourning clothes to your happier attire.

,
You can now have a small party or celebration to invite new, happy memories and expectations into your life.,
Go on in life without these burdens and be happy.",How to Bury Your Burdens," Although this is not a serious step, it is recommended you know where to go so that you can tell the other mourners. The location can be as simple as your backyard or as showy as a chapel or real graveyard. Make sure there will be no trouble with your digging a hole; you don't want to get yourself arrested1;
, You can simply mark a section of dirt or make a styrofoam gravestone and dig a hole. This is a required step in the process; if you don't have a place to bury your burdens, where will you put them? The whole point of the ceremony is to leave them behind, after all. The hole doesn't have to be very deep; you'll only need to dig down a foot or so. Make it wide enough to receive and hold all the burdens you'll be throwing into it.

, Suggest they bring a change of clothing so they can leave in less mournful attire. You can ask friends, family, and neighbors to attend the funeral.

, After a few minutes of quiet contemplation, give each person a pen and a set of note cards. There should only be one burden per note card, and you should only use one side of the notecard for your burden.

, Explain the reason for which you are here. For example, you might say, ""We are here today to bury our burdens and the things that drag us down.""

, Explain that it symbolizes faith, trust, surrender, and hope. (This can apply in either a religious or more general sense.) Explain the ceremony.

, Read it out loud to the group, light the edge of the paper with the candle, and let the ashes fall into the grave. When burning, say, ""Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. I relinquish my burden because I must."" (Have all the mourners repeat the phrase together after each burden is read.) Then either pass the candle to the next mourner or hold the candle throughout the ceremony and instruct the next person to read theirs. Keep going around until all the burdens are gone.

, The longer I hold on to you, the harder it is to stand. I don't need a crutch, I can walk on my own. I don't need burdens in my life, so just leave me alone."" Join hands with one another. ""So, hand in hand we walk away and turn our backs to your grave. We're free from all our burdens now; we are not your slaves. No more burden, anxiety, or guilt. Finally we are free. There's nothing weighing me down now. I'm happy just being me!""

,, Ask for happiness, prosperity, and fortune to light your way. Laugh and have fun with your fellow mourners.

, Although it may be necessary to repeat the ceremony as time goes on and new burdens appear, don't forget to let go of worries and burdens whenever it becomes necessary, ceremony or not. Enjoy living free.

,How to Deal With Stress1,
"
Focus on your breath.,
Meditate.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Do body scan meditation.,
Try visualization.",How to Calm Down After a Stressful Experience2," Focusing your mind on your breathing and controlling your breath can help you calm down. Deep breathing helps you get more oxygen to your body, which helps reduce the stress response. Take a moment to breathe after a stressful event.You should breathe from your belly instead of chest. Place your hand on your belly. Inhale. Your abdomen should be expanding instead of your chest rising. When you exhale, your belly will flatten as it deflates.
Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Breathe slowly in a controlled manner.
You may want to try counting as you breathe. As you inhale, count to five, then as you exhale, count to five.

, Meditation is a common way to calm down and relieve stress. Meditation is the relaxation technique of easing your mind and body by focusing your thoughts. You can meditate anywhere and it doesn’t take a lot of time.One way to meditate is to get comfortable, steady your breathing, and focus on the present. Pay attention to the way your body feels and the thoughts in your head. Don’t judge anything you observe in your body and mind. Be neutral as you acknowledge the feelings. Be present in the moment and accept this is where you are right now.
You can repeat a word or phrase over and over to yourself.
Choose an object to be the focus of your attention. As you breathe deeply and focus on the present, you think about the object. What is the object, where did it come from, what does it mean? Appreciate the object for what it is.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a relaxation technique where you tense and relax muscles in your body. This helps you release tension in your body, focus your mind, and ultimately calm down.Get into a relaxed position. This works really well while lying down and wearing loose clothing. Start by taking a few slow breaths to center yourself.
Start with your right foot. Slowly and deliberately, tense the muscles in your foot and hold as you count to 10. Then relax your foot and feel the tension leaving your body as those muscles relax and loosen. Take a few breaths.
Now, do the same thing with your left foot. Continue doing the same thing as you travel up your body. Go from right calf to left calf, then right thigh and left thigh, the hips and glutes, abdomen, chest, back, right arm, left arm, right hand, left hand, neck, shoulders, and face.

, Body scan meditation is a technique where you focus your attention to each part of your body. You don’t do anything, like relaxing and tension in progressive muscle relaxation. You just bring awareness to your body and how you feel.Lie down in a comfortable position and focus on your breathing. Just breathe for about two minutes.
Focus on each part of your body separately, starting with your right foot. Notice any feelings in your body as you breathe deeply and evenly. Do this with each side and each separate body part, spending a few minutes really focusing on that body part.
When you have scanned your entire body, spend a few minutes focusing on how your body feels and breathing before opening up your eyes.

, Visualization, also called guided imagery, is a meditative technique where you imagine yourself in a calmer, happier place. You should use all five senses when visualizing. Guided imagery helps you focus your mind, find peace, and let go of stress. This can help you calm down if you have experienced a stressful situation.Choose an image or place that makes you happy. It could be a beach, a forest trail, or your favorite spot as a child.
Use as many senses as you can. Imagine in detail what the scene looks like. If you are imagining a beach, think about the sound of the waves rolling in, the smell of the salt on the air, the feel of the sun and breeze on your skin.
You should do this in a quiet place if possible.

Exercise.,
Do a relaxing activity.,
Use your senses.,
Try yoga.,
Put electronic devices away.",How to Calm Down After a Stressful Experience3," Exercise can help you calm down after a stressful experience. Exercise helps reduce adrenaline while releasing endorphins that can make you feel better. Exercise may also be able to help your nervous system move from the stressed out state into a more calm one. Try exercise that works your whole body.Walking, running, swimming, team sports, or dancing are good choices. You may want to try activities where you have to focus your mind on the activity, like boxing, weight training, or rock climbing.
Try to focus all of your mental energy on your body and the activity. This can help your body let go of tension and stress. Think about your feet touching the ground, your breathing, and the sun on your body.

, Sometimes, all you need to calm down is a bit of relaxing down time. After a stressful experience, you may want to take some time for yourself. Play some soothing music, watch a favorite television program, or read a book. Put on comfortable clothes and curl up with your favorite blanket.Light some candles and take a bubble bath.
Play with your pets, cook, drink a cup of tea, or even clean. Do whatever will calm your mind and body.

, To relieve stress and calm down quickly, you should try using your senses. Engage your sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, or movement. Look or smell something soothing. Taste something that you like, or touch something comforting. Doing this can ground you and help calm your mind and body.For example, look at a photo or picture that makes you happy. Sniff your favorite scent. Listen to a soothing sound like rain falling or waves crashing. Have a piece of your favorite candy, hug your favorite stuffed animal, or put on your favorite comfortably sweater.

, Yoga is a common practice to calm the body and mind. It can help you relax and center your body. Yoga focuses on deep breathing, mind focus, and body poses. After a stressful experience, you can take some time to go through some poses to help calm down.You can take yoga classes at a gym or a yoga studio.
There are many yoga videos available to buy and for free online. You can search specifically for yoga to calm down or relax.
If you’ve never done yoga before, you may want to try beginners yoga or watch some videos on the fundamentals that teach you how to do the poses.
If you feel any discomfort, stop or modify the pose.

, Being connected to social media can increase stress levels and keep you from being able to calm down. If you have had a stressful experience, don’t go straight to Facebook or Twitter. Instead, put your phone, tablet, or laptop aside and focus on where you are.Constantly seeing news coverage of stress-causing events or reading negative posts from others can cause you to feel more stressed and interfere with your efforts to calm down.

Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat properly.,
Learn to relax.,
Practice yoga and meditation.,
Do things you love.",How to Deal With Stress2," Targeted exercise goes a long way toward freeing your body of stress hormones and increasing your endorphin levels - responsible for feelings of happiness. Carve out time during your busy day to exercise to both keep your body healthy and as a natural outlet for your stress. You should notice the difference.Try to raise your heartbeat to 120-180 beats per minute for about 30 minutes per day. If you don't have time to do all thirty minutes in one sitting, don't worry; you can break up the exercise time however you need to fit your schedule.
Walking for even 20-30 minutes each day is sufficient if that's all that you can afford. Walking isn't just good for stress-reduction: Adults over 40 who walked briskly for at least 150 minutes a week saw their life expectancy increase by 3.4 – 4.5 years.Swimming, hiking, and biking have been shown to reduce stress as well. A benefit of swimming and biking is that, opposed to jogging, they create far less joint strain, which makes them perfect for people with joint problems or those wanting to prevent them., Give your body the sleep it wants, and your stress levels will take a nosedive. Sleep is a mechanism by which your body recuperates and restores its energy reserves. If you're not getting enough sleep, your body will use stress to keep you active and alert in the absence of stored energy.


Most adults need at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.Young children and older adults need more, about 9-10 hours of sleep per night.
Get into regular sleeping habits. If you can, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each night and morning. Routinizing your sleep cycle will teach your body when it's supposed to go to be tired, aiding in better sleep and less sleep deprivation.
49% of Americans who don’t get enough sleep blame stress as the culprit.If you believe that you're stuck in a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation/stress creation, see your doctor for more targeted advice.

, Your body needs to be healthy, strong, happy and properly fueled to help you tackle stress. Like it or not, stress is a bodily reaction to anything that disturbs its natural state, meaning that your body can have a profound effect on producing and relieving stress.



Water has been shown to relieve stress.That's because a dehydrated body creates cortisol, a stress hormone. An under-hydrated body creates stress to motivate the owner of the body to properly care for him/herself.

Start decreasing caffeine and alcohol intake. In some cases, alcohol intake increases stress response in humans while being linked to substance dependency, a stressful condition itself.Caffeine is also responsible for raising stress levels, especially at work, so try to stick to water as a general rule.
Eat a healthy breakfast and healthy snacks during the day. It is better to eat several smaller meals throughout the day than to consume three large meals.For a healthy stress-free diet, consume more complex carbohydrates such as whole-grain breads and pasta, foods high in vitamin A such as oranges, foods high in magnesium like spinach, soybeans or salmon, and black and green tea, which contain antioxidants.

, Relaxing your body, by whatever natural means, is a great way to reduce stress. Don't expect your stress to immediately dissipate; it can take time. In most cases, try not to fixate on the stress itself while you're relaxing. Think of something placid and tranquil, or think of nothing in particular. Let your body tell your mind that everything is okay.


Listen to calm and soft music. Music really gets you relaxed and happy. Try listening to music with no vocals and pick music with instruments like the flute, piano, or violin. Classical, jazz, or folk tunes generally work well, but if that's not your cup of tea, choose music that puts you in a good place.







Take a bath. Add Epsom salts or other fragrant bath salts for a luxurious touch. Indulge in your private time and relax the body.






Get a massage. Either having a professional massage or con a loved one into giving you a stress-relieving massage. Use lotions or oils and dim ambient light for the most relaxing atmosphere.






Start a diary or journal. You don't have to write in it every day. Writing down what's bothering you, what you've been busy with, and how you feel may help you to expel your negative emotions.







, Although you could technically consider yoga your daily exercise, practicing the deep stretches and slow body movements will help you to clear your mind. Meditating - clearing your mind - while practicing gentle yoga will give double the relaxation effect to ease your stress.


Use guided imagery to imagine a place that makes you feel at peace. Imagine somewhere that you feel happy; focus on the details to fully remove your mind from the present.
Do yoga alone or in a group setting to help you learn new poses. As you advance in your yoga, you will be able to form complex stretches that force you to focus and take your mind off your stress.

Practice deep relaxation by doing progressive muscle relaxation. This is when you work through your body by tensing your muscles, holding the tension for ten seconds, and then releasing it. This will soften and relieve all the muscles in your body.

, Often when you're stressed, you can look at your schedule and see that you are lacking time for doing your favorite activities. Whether that be drawing, writing, reading, playing sports, or cooking, set aside time on a daily basis to do those things you enjoy.


Try picking up a new hobby to help you relieve your stress. If you've always wanted to learn how to ride horses or build model airplanes, then do it! Learning something new will take your mind off of whatever is bothering you, and give you a new hobby to enjoy.
If you have a very busy schedule, set aside at least just ten minutes per day to do what you enjoy. Although ideally you should spend thirty minutes to an hour, allowing just a small break from your hectic schedule will be enough to lower your stress levels."

Avoid negative thinking.,

Take responsibility for making your life what you want it to be.,

Learn to lean on friends and loved ones.,
Have more positive self talk.",How to Deal With Stress3," Acknowledge the positive in your life and begin to re-establish some balance in your emotional register. Avoid focusing on only the bad things that happened during your day, but consider the good as well.


Stop and count your blessings. Write down even the simplest things that you have and enjoy: a roof over your head, a bed to sleep on, quality food, warmth, security, good health, friends or family. Acknowledge that not everyone has these things.
Say something positive to yourself as soon as you wake up every morning. This will keep your energy and mind focused on positive thinking. Be thankful for each day that you have; you never know which one could be your last!
Use positive self-talk. Reinforce your resolve through positive statements such as, ""I can handle this, one step at a time,"" or ""Since I've been successful with this before, there's no reason why I can't do it again.""
Visualize positive things; this does not take long but can help you regain focus. Think about success, read about successful people. Don't admit defeat before you've been defeated. You don't deserve to beat yourself down so that you can punish yourself.

, Set goals for what you need to achieve during the day, then write a ""to do list"". Add some breathing room in the middle of the day that will give you time to recharge. Taking control of your time and priorities will significantly decrease the amount of stress you feel.


Know your limits. Be realistic about what you can and can't accomplish in a day. It's not helpful if you bite off more than you can chew and then castigate yourself for not getting it done.

Prioritize your tasks. Work on finishing the highest priority (most urgent/important) items first. Put low priority items on the bottom of your list.
Do your most unpleasant or most difficult task at the beginning of the day when you are fresh, thereby avoiding the stress of last minute preparation. Procrastination feeds stress!
Emphasize quality in your work, rather than sheer quantity. Take pride in having done something well as opposed to having done a lot of something.

Schedule your day, if possible, so that stressful scenarios don't overlap, reducing the number of stressors you must juggle at any one time. Stagger deadlines for large projects.
Review your goals at the end of the day and think about everything you have achieved. This is cathartic and will help you sleep better. Check off the things that you accomplished on the to do list.

, Make sure you understand why you become stressed so that you can try to avoid these circumstances. Knowledge is powerful, and self-knowledge is especially powerful.


If you notice, for example, that you regularly get stressed at a certain time with a certain person, go out of your way to prepare your brain for the upcoming stress. If the person is someone you love and trust, tell them how they make you feel in a non-threatening way. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your misgivings, remind yourself that the occasion is momentary, the feeling will pass, and you'll be in complete control soon.
Rehearse. When you know that you are going to face a stressful situation, rehearse how you are going to handle it. Picture yourself overcoming it successfully. Create a mental videotape that you can play over and over in your mind.

, This especially comes with things such as politics, and often applies to other individuals. Learning to accept things as they are is an important coping mechanism, but not as easy as it sounds.


Is the problem a real problem you’re currently facing, rather than an imaginary what-if? If the problem is an imaginary what-if, how likely is it to happen? Is your concern realistic? Can you do something about the problem or prepare for it, or is it out of your controlAdmitting to yourself that there's nothing you can do about a particular issue will go a long way in helping you adjust. Acknowledge that maybe you feed off of stress, like an adrenaline junkie feeds off adrenaline, but that in your case, it's becoming unmanageable.

, It is less stressful to make decisions and take action than to feel powerless and react to others' decisions. Decide what you want and go for it!



Learn to say no on occasion. You cannot do everything you are asked, and even if you could, you probably wouldn't want to.
Resist the urge to be perfect at all times. Perfectionism can cause huge amounts of stress if you hold yourself to unattainable standards. Be realistic about what you can and can't do. Don't set yourself up for failure just because you want to stroke your ego.
Don't get down on yourself for failing if you tried your hardest. You gave it your all, and nobody would ask you for more. Hold yourself accountable, but don't make being accountable impossible.
Be one of your own best friends. It may sound cheesy, like something out of a Leave it to Beaver commercial, but it's true: Love yourself, depend (mostly) on yourself, and celebrate the things you do well. Loving yourself will ease the anxious question ""Am I good enough?"" and replace it with ""I know I'm good enough.""

, One of the barriers to stress reduction is the temptation to take things too seriously. It's okay to back off from your intensity and see the humour in life's situations. Laugh a little or better yet, laugh a lot! See the humour in stress.


Learn to laugh at yourself. Don't put yourself down, or lash your self-esteem, but try to be playfully deprecating about yourself from time to time. How are you expected to laugh at other things if you can't even laugh at yourself?

, This is one of the most important things, as keeping things bottled up can only cause more stress. Your friends, if they are true friends, will try to understand what you're going through, and will accompany that empathy with a sincere desire to help out if at all possible.


Ask your friends for help. If you want something done but can't find the strength or the time to do it, it's okay to ask your friends or loved ones for help. Express your gratitude and extend the offer of help as a kind of reciprocity.
Look for people's respect, not approval — your friends included. Your friends will respect you because they love you, even if they don't always agree with you. Your enemies (if you have any) will respect you because your motivations come from a sincere, heartfelt place. Resist the urge to be loved and accepted by everyone; it's literally a Herculean task. You'll find yourself a lot less stressed and a lot more satisfied if you do.
Seek out positive people rather than negative ones. It sounds like a truism because it is: Surrounding yourself with people who are fun-loving, excited, and kind will help you avoid the stress you'd be feeling with pessimistic, cynical, mean people.

, Nothing else helps intensify stress more than negative thoughts. When you start to having the feeling of defeat is the perfect time for a little reminder.


You know yourself better than anyone else, and you are the perfect person to give you the reminder that it will get better.
Remind yourself of all of the things you have accomplished in the past. All of those small accomplishments add up to very big ones over time.
Change the words you use. Instead of saying, ""I can't do this,"" say something like, ""I've been able to get through this before, and I will get through it this time too.""

Heed these signs so that you can take actions to rejuvenate your body and enjoy the holiday season. Some of the physical signs to watch for include:


Tight muscles. Stress hormones can cause your muscles to contract for extended periods of time.
Shallow breathing. When your body is in fight-or-flight mode, your breathing quickens and you become more alert.
Headaches. Not all headaches are caused by stress, but if they consistently surface in difficult moments, they may be stress headaches.
Lack of energy. If your body is maintaining its stress response over a period of time, you will suffer from a lack of energy to put toward other activities, such as spending quality time with family and friends.;
, Get a good number of restful hours per night, or the sleeplessness will become a vicious cycle: the less you sleep, the more you need; the more you need, the less time you have to prepare for and appreciate the holiday season, and the more taxed you will feel.


Ensure that you have 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night. Leave last minute tasks for tomorrow. Avoid getting bogged down in holiday planning and responsibilities.
Set aside an hour or two of ""winding down"" time before you drift off. This will help your body prepare to enter the sleep state. Avoid electronics and noisy environments right before bed. Enjoy the crackle of the fireplace instead!

, Nutritious eating is a powerful measure to ensure your body's ability to handle stress. Stay away from sugar, fat, and caffeine. Instead, opt for foods with high fiber content and carbohydrates, such as baked sweet potatoes. Fruits and vegetables are also a good choice.


Avoid eating as a stress management tactic. This can lead to guilt and health problems associated with overeating. With all the great food circulating around during the holiday season, this is an especially important caution to take.

, Many people love to appreciate the holidays with a glass of eggnog. Moderate amounts of alcohol may temporarily relieve stress and increase enjoyment, but research shows that alcohol can also prolong stress-related tension. Consuming a reasonable amount (1-2 drinks) is usually safe and may even confer certain health benefits, but be careful and consult your doctor if you have concerns.

, Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins: the chemicals in the body that promote good feelings. Choose an activity you like and are likely to stick with; almost any form of exercise will do the job. If the gym is closed for the holidays, try running outside!


If you have health concerns or haven't exercised in a while, consult your doctor first.
Finding a workout buddy will increase the enjoyment factor.

, In the middle of everything, remember to breathe. Allow your body a moment of relaxation; let your body do what it naturally does. Practice deep breathing techniques to keep your calm amidst the holiday chaos.


Take a deep breath, allowing the air to fill both your belly and your chest. Count to three, and then exhale. Repeat this a few times until you feel your body begin to unwind.
Breathe normally, while counting your breaths. You can use ""one"" for inhales and ""two"" for exhales, or you can go all the way to ten. This focusing technique will drown out stressful outside influences.

, A stressed mind can really dampen holiday cheer. Stress affects people's minds differently, but take note of these common symptoms and find out if you should make intervening efforts to relieve yourself from stress's draining emotional and cognitive effects.


Irritability: you find yourself becoming irritated by relatively insignificant annoyances and inconveniences.
Altered sense of humor: things you would normally find funny fail to make you laugh.
Forgetfulness/poor memory: your mind is distracted to such an extent that you make careless mistakes and forget details.
Racing mind: your thoughts are speeding by and you're unable to slow down and appreciate what's going on around you.

, The commotion of the holiday seasoning can be too much for some people. If you are under a lot of pressure, take a step back and remove the stressors from your immediate environment. Some of the things you might benefit from include:


Leave the stressful environment behind and find something that makes you laugh. You aren't obligated to spend every minute of the holiday season with family. Watch your favorite comedy or talk to a funny friend.
Meditate. Meditation has been shown to reduce anxiety and tension, as well as promote new perspectives on life and increase self-awareness.
Write your feelings down. Research shows that keeping a journal is cathartic and people who regularly record their thoughts visit doctors less often. Journal about your holiday experience so far and what you want to happen in the immediate future.
Try progressive muscle relaxation techniques. These are great techniques for helping your body and mind to let go of negativity. Find some time to try them out between gift shopping and preparing the holiday meals.

, Sometimes you may need a little help getting into the holiday mood and appreciating the season on a deeper, more meaningful level. Try these activities to help you enter into the holiday head-space:


Bake cookies. It may seem trivial, but baking is a creative process for many people that produces something tangibly delicious and also allows us an expressive outlet.
Focus on family and friends. Gifts can be an enervating part of the holiday season, but try focusing less on the material aspects and more on meaning: community, discovering your true desires, and more.
Make your gift-giving meaningful. Instead of buying prepackaged, generic gifts, try crafting or creating your own. Specialize the gift to the person, make it personal.

, Some perfectionism is healthy if it means being goal-oriented and striving toward things that are meaningful to you. However, there is also ""neurotic perfectionism,"" where people sabotage themselves from experiencing joy and other positive emotions. The media may construct an image of the holidays as a conflict and stress-free wonderland, but real life is more nuanced:


Pursue realistic goals. There's nothing wrong with the desire to achieve certain goals, but be sure to analyze your expectations. It's okay to make mistakes now and then. If you're involved in planning holiday events, allow yourself some slack to make errors and have things not come out totally flawless.
Celebrate success. Recognize your achievements rather than glossing over them. Write about them in your journal! Use the holiday downtime to reflect on what you've achieved over the course of the year.
Practice feeling gratitude. Gratitude is something that can be cultivated by focusing on what you have to be thankful for. Again, writing entries in your journal is a good idea. Spending time with family and friends during the holiday season is a great time to be aware in this sense.

, Not everyone enjoys the holiday season, and that's okay. If you are feeling overwhelmed or sad, own it. You're under no obligation to act differently than you feel. Research suggests that avoiding our emotions is actually the source of many psychological difficulties. Avoid making things worse; accept how you feel.


Tell yourself that the emotion isn't bad. It's where you are, it's what you're feeling in this moment. Even if it hurts, it won't last forever. Think of it as an interesting experience, approach it with curiosity and openness.

, Some level of disagreement and friction is normal. Avoid stressing over the small stuff:


Pick your battles. Avoid arguing over things like who sits where at the dinner table.
See the bigger picture. Adjust your perspective. Your sibling may be irritable for reasons other than you, so avoid taking it personally.

, Family conflict is a universally common occurrence. There are several reasons why family social structures create the conditions for a variety of minor, and not so minor, forms of hostility. Learn these reasons to better understand your place in the structure and give in less to predictable, repeating patterns of interaction:


People notice and remember small differences in personality more than they do similarities. These small, recollected differences can create tension when you've lived with the person for many years.
Cumulative annoyances are the basis for a lot of interpersonal conflict. Small grievances can explode into full-blown hostility over years of close proximity. Family systems are the perfect environment for these ""social allergens"" to grow.
Siblings and parents/children are both prone to the same kind of conflict over things like competition for limited resources and personal eccentricities.

, Forgiveness is a powerful activity, contributing positively to overall happiness, health (including stress), and the harmony of relationships. Use these steps to forgive and let go of old conflict patterns:


See the positives. Has arguing with your sibling made you a more assertive person? It may seem counterintuitive, but seeing the good in the bad helps you move toward forgiveness.
Generate empathy. Try to imagine what would cause the person to behave rudely to you. Maybe they feel jealousy about a perceived instance of favoritism by other family members. Understand that people lash out for a reason.
Think of forgiveness as self-care. As mentioned, forgiveness grants a lot of positive benefits to the forgiver, emotionally and in terms of overall health. Forgive is positive for everyone involved.

, Develop a toolbox of skills and attitudes for coping, when conflicts do arise. These steps can form the foundation:


Listen to what they have to say. Practice effective listening. For instance, summarize the points they have presented, and then go beyond that by asking clarifying questions.
Collaborate. Adopt an attitude of compromise that's equally respectful of your needs and the needs of the other person. Search for the ""win/win"" option. Incorporate both of your insights into problem-solving endeavors.
Attack the problem, not the person. Keep it as impersonal as possible. Avoid dragging personal insecurities into it, so that people don't feel a need to defend themselves.

, If you aren't feeling a particular planned activity, give yourself a pass. Conserve your time and energy for the most important events. Over-planning and creating a hectic schedule can muddy your holiday season. This way you can avoid regret and keep yourself on track for doing what you actually want to do.

Give the other person a chance to talk about his/her emotions.,
Use body language to express sympathy.,
Listen first, offer comments later.,
Use appropriate physical contact.,
Offer to help out with everyday work.,
Refer to a shared religion.",How to Be Sympathetic1," Offer to listen to him/her talk about how s/he's feeling, or how s/he's trying to cope with his/her problems. You don't need to have solutions at hand. Sometimes a sympathetic ear can be a great help on its own.;
, Even while listening, you can show that you are paying attention and sympathizing with your body language. Make eye contact, and nod in understanding occasionally. Keep your body turned toward the person instead of to one side.Don't try to multitask, and avoid distractions during the conversation. Turn off your phone if you can, to avoid interruption.Keep your body open by leaving your arms and legs uncrossed. If your hands are visible, keep them relaxed and facing slightly sideways.This will help communicate that you are engaged in listening to the other person.
Lean toward the person. Leaning in toward the other person may make him or her feel more comfortable talking to you.
Nod as the person is talking. Nodding and other encouraging gestures help people feel more comfortable talking.
Mirror the other person's body language. This isn't to say that you have to directly copy everything s/he does, but keeping your body in a similar posture to his or hers (for example, facing him/her if s/he is facing you, keeping your legs pointed in the same direction as his/hers) will help create a supportive atmosphere with your body language.

, In many cases, the other person needs you to listen as s/he explores his/her feelings and thoughts. This is being supportive, even if it does not feel particularly active or helping to you.Often, if you offer advice before it is asked, you risk making the other person think you are making his/her experience about you.""No-solution listening,"" according to author Michael Rooni, allows you to provide other people with a safe space to vent and work through their feelings. They do not feel pressure to take your advice, nor feel like you are ""taking over"" their problem or situation.
If in doubt, ask: ""I want to support you however you need me to. Do you want me to help you problem-solve, or do you just need a space to vent? Either way, I'm here for you.""If you went through similar experiences, you may be able to help with practical advice or methods of coping. Frame your advice as your personal experience, not a command. For example: ""I'm so sorry you broke your leg. I remember how much it sucked when I broke my ankle a few years ago. Would it be helpful if I shared what I did to cope?""
Make sure not to come across as dictating a certain course of action. If you do have advice and the person is interested in hearing it, phrase it as a probing question, such as ""Have you considered ___?"" or ""Do you think it would help if you _____?"" These types of questions acknowledge the other person's agency in making his or her own decisions and sound less bossy than ""If I were you, I'd do ______."", Physical contact can be comforting, but only if it is appropriate in the context of your relationship. If you are used to hugging the person who needs sympathy, do so. If either of you are not comfortable with that, briefly touch his/her arm or shoulder instead.Be aware that some people may feel too emotionally vulnerable or raw to enjoy a hug at that moment, even if hugging is commonly part of your interactions. Take note of the other person's body language and judge whether s/he seems open. You can also ask, ""Would a hug make you feel better?""

, Someone going through a hard time in her life will likely appreciate some assistance in day-to-day tasks. Even if s/he seems to be handling these tasks well, the gesture demonstrates that you are there to help. Offer to drop off a home-cooked or restaurant take-out meal. Ask if you can help by picking the kids up from school, watering his/her garden, or assisting him/her in some other way.Mention a specific date and time in your offer, rather than asking someone when s/he's available. This gives him/her one less thing to decide or think about during a stressful time.
Ask before offering food. Particularly in certain cultures or after funerals, the person may be overwhelmed with pies and casseroles. Something else could be more helpful.

, If you both belong to the same religion or share similar spiritual views, use that to bond with the person. Offer to pray for him/her or attend a religious ceremony with him/her.


Do not reference your religious views when expressing sympathy to someone who does not share them.

Understand what causes homesickness.,
Recognize homesickness symptoms.,
Homesickness is common for young people.,
Keep familiar things around.,
Do some things you loved to do at home.,
Talk about your feelings with someone.,
Keep a journal.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Talk with friends and family back home.,
Avoid obsessing over your old home.",How to Deal With Homesickness1," Homesickness comes from the human need for connection, love, and security. Despite its name, your feelings of “homesickness” might not have anything to do with your actual home. Anything that is familiar, stable, comfortable, and positive can be a source of homesickness when you’re away from it.Research has even shown that homesickness is a kind of grief for a loss similar to mourning a breakup or death.You may even have pre-emptive homesickness, where you develop feelings of anxiety, loss, or obsession about home before you leave because you are anticipating the separation.Children and pre-teens typically feel homesickness more than older adults, although people of any age can experience this.;
, Homesickness is much more than just missing “home.” It can cause a variety of feelings and side-effects that can impact your daily functioning. Learning to recognize these symptoms can help you figure out why you’re feeling the way you are and take action to help.Nostalgia. Nostalgia is when you frequently think about your home or familiar things and people, usually through an idealized lens. You might feel preoccupied by thoughts about home, or find yourself constantly comparing your new situation unfavorably to your old one.Depression. People who suffer from homesickness often experience depression because they lack the social supports they had at home. You might also feel like you have less control over your life, which can worsen depression. Common signs of homesickness-caused depression include feelings of sadness, feeling disoriented or like you “don’t belong,” withdrawing from social activities, academic or work difficulties, feeling helpless or abandoned, experiencing low self-esteem, and changes in your sleeping patterns. Not wanting to do or not enjoying things you used to do is often a sign of depression.Anxiety. Anxiety is also a hallmark of homesickness. Anxiety due to homesickness may cause obsessive thoughts, especially about the home or people you miss. You might also have difficulty concentrating or feel extremely stressed without being able to pinpoint a cause. You might get easily irritated or “snap” at people in your new situation. In extreme cases, anxiety can trigger other responses, such as agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) or claustrophobia (fear of confined spaces).Abnormal behaviors. Feeling homesick can throw you off your normal routines and change the way you respond to things. For example, if you’re not usually an angry person but you find yourself getting upset or yelling more than you used to, this could be a sign that you’re feeling homesick. You might also eat significantly more or less than you usually do. Other symptoms include frequent headaches or experiencing more pain or illness than usual., While a person can get homesick at any age, younger people more typically encounter this. There are a couple of reasons:

Children and teens typically are not as emotionally independent. A seven year old is generally not nearly as ready to venture from home as a seventeen year old.
Young people usually have not had as much experience with new situations. If you have never moved before, or been away at camp before, or been on your own before, it is more difficult than the second or third time. When you are young, it is more likely to be a new experience than an older adult.

, Having familiar things from “home” can help ease your feelings of homesickness by giving you an “anchor.” Things with high sentimental or cultural value, such as photos of family or an item tied to your cultural identity, can help you feel connected to home even when you are away.Balance old with new. In order to adjust to your new situation it’s important to embrace the changes that you’re experiencing. Certainly have some comforting items from home, but realize you cannot and should not be surrounded by old, familiar things. Remember that not everything has to be a physical object. In the age of the Internet, you may be able to stream your local radio station, for instance.

, Research shows that doing things you feel nostalgic about can help you feel better.Tradition and rituals can help foster a sense of connectedness to your home even when you’re far away.


Eat your favorite foods from home. There’s a reason we have the term “comfort food.” Eating familiar foods from your childhood or culture can make you feel happier and more secure in your new environment.Try introducing your favorite foods to new friends to strengthen the connection between familiar sources of comfort and new sources of emotional support.
Participate in your religious traditions, if you have them. Research has shown that people who have religious or faith traditions feel less homesick when they participate in those traditions in a new place. Finding a place of worship or meditation in your new place, or even finding a group of friends with similar traditions, can help you adjust.Find some similar activities to do. If you were in a bowling league or book club at home, don't be shy. Do your research and see if you can find something similar in your new environment. You'll be able to do the things you love and meet some new people in the process.

, It’s a common myth that talking about feeling homesick can cause or worsen symptoms of homesickness. Research has shown that this isn’t true.In fact, talking about what you’re feeling and experiencing can help you deal with your homesickness. Not acknowledging your feelings can make them worse.


Find a trusted person to talk with. A college RA, a guidance counselor, a parent or close friend, or mental health professional can give you a sympathetic ear and, often, advice about how to cope with your feelings.
Remember that seeking help from someone else doesn’t make you “weak” or “crazy.” Having the strength to admit you need help is a sign of courage and good self-care, not something to be embarrassed about.

, Keeping a journal will help you get in touch with your thoughts and process everything that is happening in your new environment. Whether you're studying abroad, in college, at summer camp, or just moved to a new city, you will likely be experiencing many new and unfamiliar sensations, and keeping a journal can help you keep track of your thoughts. Research has shown that keeping a journal where you reflect on your experiences and how they made you feel can help relieve feelings of homesickness.Try to keep your focus positive. While it’s normal to feel lonely and homesick, it’s important to look at the good side of your new experiences. Think about the fun things you’re doing, or think about how something new reminds you of something wonderful from home. If you only journal about how miserable you’re feeling, you may make your homesickness worse.
Make sure your journal is more than a list of negative feelings and events. When you do list a negative experience, take some time to think and write about why it made you feel that way. This is called ""narrative reflection,"" and it serves a therapeutic purpose., Research has shown that exercise releases endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals. Endorphins can help fight anxiety and depression, which are both common side-effects of homesickness.If you can, exercise with others. This will give you the chance to socialize and meet new people.


Exercise can also boost your immune system. Homesickness may manifest as increased feelings of sickness (e.g., frequent headaches or colds).

, Talking with your loved ones back home can help you feel supported and connected, which is important for adjusting to a new place. You need to develop a sense of self-confidence and self-reliance to combat homesickness effectively. Don’t let yourself focus so much on your loved ones in another place that you don’t learn how to manage on your own.
Talking to friends and family can make homesickness worse for very young children or for people who are away from home for a very short time.You can also spend a bit of time on social networking sites to connect with friends and see what they’re up to. It may help to not feel they are impossibly far way. However, do not focus so much on your old friends that you don’t have time to make new ones, though.

, While connecting to people back home can be a great coping strategy, it can also become a crutch. Don’t let your attempts to remind yourself of home take over your life. If you find yourself staying in to talk to your mom for the third time that day rather than grab a coffee with a new friend, consider adjusting the amount of time you spend on connecting with new people. There is a fine line between keeping in contact with people from your hometown, and not moving on to where you are now. Schedule your phone calls home. Set limits for how often and for how long you’ll talk to friends and family back home. You could even try writing old-fashioned “snail mail” letters. These are great ways to stay connected to people back home without letting your nostalgia for the past keep you from experiencing the present.

Learn about the causes of anxiety.,
Learn about different types of anxiety.,
Remember what anxiety feels like.,
Listen carefully.,
Practice empathy.,
Observe the anxious individual.,
Keep costs and benefits in mind.,
Positively reinforce healthy behaviors.,
Avoid criticizing unhealthy, anxiety-driven behaviors.,

Prepare for panic attacks.,
Relax.",How to Help People With Anxiety," Read up on the causes of anxiety.This will help you understand the other person's perspective and give you some sense of when to offer help. You might ask about a difficult past, a medical condition, or just if there's anything to talk about.


Although the exact cause of anxiety disorders isn't fully understood, certain factors such as painful or traumatic life experiences and certain genetic traits increase the likelihood of having anxiety.Other times, anxious individuals have an underlying medical condition such as irritable bowel syndrome, heart disease, asthma, premenstrual syndrome, or thyroid problems.;
, There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders that have different underlying triggers. Try to get a sense of what kind of anxiety your contact might be suffering from so you can form a more specific response:Agoraphobia: anxiety about being in places where you could become trapped or lose control.Anxiety caused by an underlying medical condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome, heart disease, or thyroid problems. You might be able to reduce the anxiety if you can help with treatment for the underlying medical condition (for example, by reminding them to take medication).
Generalized anxiety disorder. This type of anxiety describes individuals who are excessively anxious about the day-to-day events in life.
Anxiety related to substance abuse or withdrawal. Suggest a visit to a medical professional to help get clean or manage withdrawal symptoms.
Panic disorder: very intense feelings of anxiety and/or fear, lasting up to several minutes. These can involve difficulty breathing, heart fluttering (palpitations), and a sense of danger or incoming doom.Social anxiety disorder: an excessive fear of social interactions. The anxious person may be excessively self-conscious, become embarrassed very easily, or fear screwing up in social situations., Anxiety is not a fun experience. One way to help is by understanding what the anxious person is going through so you can provide comfort in specific ways related to the individual's symptoms. Anxiety symptoms include:Feeling nervous.
Feeling powerless.
Feeling a sense of incoming danger.
Feeling weak.
Feeling tired.
Difficulty concentrating.

, Different people may require different kinds of aid. Perhaps the best way to find out how you can help is to ask. There are a number of things you can do to be a good listener:Keep your expressions neutral. For example, say things like ""I see"", or ""uh huh"".
Match your expressions with the emotional tone of the conversation. For example, if your friend is very upset, try to make your ""I see"" sound empathic or reassuring rather than either emotionally cold sounding or excited (both of these contrast with the other person's mood).
Ask a lot of open-ended questions. If you want to find out more about how you can help, rather than asking ""are you anxious?"" use an open-ended question such as ""what kinds of things or situations generally make you anxious?""
Pay close attention by doing your best to clear your mind of your own worries and keep track only of the other person's thoughts and feelings.

, Empathy refers to the ability to sense others' emotions and imagine what they might be thinking or feeling.There are some ways to be empathetic towards those with anxiety:Focus your attention on the anxious person.
Keep in mind shared human values and the shared human experience. Remember that we all have a lot of the same pains, fears, and worries; this can make it easier to understand another perspective.
Temporarily suspend your own judgments.
Share relatable experiences but do so sparingly so as not to take over the conversation. The key is to demonstrate that you can relate to the anxious person's experiences.

, Learn to look for outward signs of anxiety, so you can get a sense of when they are anxious. This lets you provide help or comfort in times of distress. Signs of anxiety include:Nervousness.
Rapid breathing.
Sweating.
Trembling.

, Try to remember that if you don't get much benefit out of an activity but it causes your friend or partner significant anxiety; it may be best to stop.


That said, avoid over-accommodating the anxious person's anxiety, as it provides little incentive to change., For example, compliment your socially anxious partner if they attend a party and get on well with people. Let them know they were the life of the party and give a few specific compliments.This may help your partner realize that engaging with others socially isn't so bad and that it is possible to thrive in social interactions.

, If you rebuke someone for anxiety-related behaviors, this might just cause more anxiety. This is the opposite of what you want to do.If you are frustrated and tempted to criticize, try leaving the room and entering again once you have calmed down.
Instead of focusing on the current, negative behavior, focus on the potential positives that could result if the behavior changed. For example, instead of getting upset at a friend for avoiding social situations, say something like ""imagine all the networking opportunities there will be at that party tonight. In the past, I've made a few great friends from these sorts of events.""

, You can help someone with anxiety by encouraging them to seek treatment.Let them know that psychotherapy, medication, or some combination of both often succeed in treating anxiety.Keep in mind that the kind of treatment you suggest may depend on the type of anxiety or its underlying cause. For example, rehab is useful for anxiety caused by drug abuse. Social anxiety is typically treated by a mental health professional.

, Some kinds of anxiety result in panic attacks. Panic attacks may result in difficulty breathing or heart palpitations, and the anxious individual may think they are having a heart attack or losing control. Panic attacks can be very scary for the anxious individual, and for you if you aren't prepared.During a panic attack, the sufferer likely won't have the energy to physically move, respond, or have normal thoughts. Rather than getting upset or worried yourself, provide reassurance and tell them that it will soon pass.
If you have any suspicions that the symptoms are not the result of a panic attack, take the necessary medical precautions, such as calling emergency services.

, Spend a nice, quiet, relaxing evening with just the two of you. Spend it at home if public spaces increase anxiety.Make it clear that you don't mind spending time, in a way that makes the other person feel comfortable and at ease. Perhaps the biggest way to help an anxious individual is to be understanding and flexible.

Focus on yourself.,
Change your thinking.,
Focus on the person’s good qualities.,
Give up control.,
Avoid trying to be a hero.,
Practice acceptance.,
Be assertive.,
Re-frame negativity.,
Create boundaries.,
Be nurturing.,
Know the signs of pessimism.,
Understand possible underlying issues.,
Continue to educate yourself about pessimism.",How to Avoid Letting Pessimistic People Get You Down," Sometimes we can spend so much time worrying about others and how they are feeling that we lose sight of ourselves. Take responsibility for your own feelings and reactions towards pessimism.By focusing on your own happiness and less on others, you take the power away from negativity.


Remind yourself that you are in control. You are in control of how much you let another person’s feelings and thoughts affect you.For example, even though pessimism is hard to listen to, understand that the other person’s pessimism is a reflection of themselves and you can only control your own feelings. You have the power to dictate what affects how you are feeling.;
, Using logic as a coping resource is associated with higher mental toughness. Stay positive. Research suggests that optimism may increase mental toughness.This means that your own optimistic outlook can help you combat pessimism and the spill-over from negativity.


Look for some good in everything and remind yourself that anyone can find flaws in anything when looked at closely enough; what's a lot harder is coming up with solutions and positive actions. Instead of seeking to persuade the pessimist verbally with upbeat commentary, simply get on with your positive life and let your behavior and actions do all the talking.
If you find yourself feeling down around the pessimist, make a mental list (or even write it down if you wish) of five good things in your life. Think of the items on this list in your head as a sort of ""shield"" against negativity if you find yourself reacting to it.
Actively cultivate positive friendships with other optimistic people. Spending more time around optimists will help raise your mood and reassure you that your state of mind is the right one for you.

, The individual’s outlook on things isn't her only feature - there are many more complex qualities within a person, so rather than fixating on the negatives, look for the good things. Is she intelligent? Supportive of you? Is she unique enough not to care what anyone else thinks about her? Is she good to work with? Focus on the positive aspects of a person and seek to balance out the negatives.Just as you might make a list of the five positive things in your life, try to make a list of at least three positive things about your pessimist and run these through your mind when dealing with this person gets tough. You can also draw on this list to remind the pessimist of what she is good at, in case it seems she has forgotten.
Find compassion for the pessimist in your life by remembering that her pessimism might be rooted in unhappiness or low-self esteem. When you hear negativity, remind yourself that she may be going through something very difficult that is contributing to her pessimism.

, Understand that you do not have control over other people’s thoughts or behaviors. Expect the pessimist to have responsibility for her pessimism. She may see the negatives, therefore let her own her interpretation of events and life in general. Accept that this person has a choice to think the way she does.Tell the pessimist to make the choice that she feels most comfortable with. Avoid giving advice or pushing the person to see or do things your way.

, Resist the innate desire to attempt to cheer the pessimist up. What you want to avoid is positively reinforcing her negative thoughts by providing a reward for pessimistic thinking (attention, positivity, etc).Don't seek to persuade the pessimist that everything will work out fine. Remember that you cannot control how she will interpret the situation.

, Don't be too quick to dismiss people due to their pessimism. Learning to get along with people who are not like us is an important part of self-development and socialization.Being pessimistic isn't always bad. Some philosophers and researchers have argued it may actually make people happier and closer to reality because they will be more prepared and less disappointed if they consider that the worst outcome might occur.Thus, when bad things do happen, they may be better at dealing with them.

, Give feedback and help your pessimistic friend understand her effect on others. Be mature in your interactions with her.Be respectfully honest. If the pessimistic person is bothering you in some way or affecting you negatively, let her know. Say you're sorry that she sees things that way but you see things differently.
Use “I statements.” I feel ____ when you ______. Focus on your own feelings rather than on the other person’s actions.
Avoid labeling. Telling a person who has pessimistic thinking that she is a pessimist will most likely be unhelpful and could lead to conflict.

, One thing you can do is attempt to offer alternative ways of looking at the problem.Remember though, you are not trying to save her from pessimism or cheer her up. You are simply expressing your opinion and disagreeing with her view of the situation.

, You may need to spend time apart from this person or distance yourself.Setting boundaries on what you discuss with the person and how long you bathe in her influence can be useful ways of overcoming your dislike of being in her presence.Do not just ignore her; that would be considered passive-aggressive communication.
Limit your interactions if necessary. However, if she is your friend, coworker or family member you may not be able, nor wish, to avoid her. In this case, minimizing the amount of time spent around her can be beneficial to your own sense of well-being.

, Exercise compassion when dealing with others who think differently from you.If the pessimist doesn't want to do something that you do, be empathetic about her worries or plight. This is a kind, yet subtle, way to highlight the thing she is being negative about - by focusing on it directly and expressing sympathy for her worry, and pain.
Be understanding and supportive without validating the negativity.For example, tell a pessimist who is disinclined join you in an activity that she can go home/not come, while you go ahead and do it anyway. Say something like, ""I'm sorry this is hard on you. Go ahead and do whatever it is you need to feel better (go home/not come/stay here/do the easier task, etc.).""

, Initially, because of your own sunny attitude, you might not be alert to the pessimistic bent of another person. It is helpful to understand these patterns in order to be able to detect them in yourself. Signs of negative thinking include:


Thinking that things aren't going to work out well.This is also known as catastrophizing, or thinking the worst will happen.
Believing that the negative outcomes are permanent and inescapable.May blame self or others for things not turning out well., A possible reason for the existence of pessimistic thinking is depression.If this is the case, the pessimist may need psychological or medical treatment.


See How to cope with depression for an explanation of the symptoms.
If you are concerned that your friend or family member has a mental health issue you can express your worry to her and offer treatment as an option. Simply say, ""I noticed you seem sad (or angry, or negative) lately, have you ever considered talking to a professional about it? I think this might help."" Be careful not to be pushy or you may scare her off.

, The more you know, the less personal it might feel when pessimistic thinking is around you. With education comes understanding and an increased ability to cope.


One option is to read the book, Learned Optimism, by Martin Seligman. Dr. Seligman is a psychologist and expert in the field of positive psychology.He offers ways to identify if you are more optimistic or pessimistic, as well as ways to cope. This can be a useful resource both for the pessimist and optimist, and teaches tools to learn how to be more optimistic.

If someone is threatening you and you have stress and anxiety, stand up to them and tell them how you feel.

,
Tell someone you trust about your stress and tell them everything that is bothering you.,
Get something like a stress relief ball or if you having a punching bag, go there everyday and yell at it or punch it.",How to Deal With Stress4,", Revealing yourself is a good way to express how you are feeling and how to deal with it.

, That can help you express your stress and then relax your body. Holding in emotions is not good for your body.

Avoid claiming to know or understand what someone is going through.,
Avoid minimizing or invalidating the other person's feelings.,
Avoid expressing personal beliefs that the other person does not share.,
Stay away from pressuring someone to use your solution.,
Remain calm and kind.,
Don't act hard or uncaring.,
Don't insult the person.",How to Be Sympathetic2," Even if you went through a similar experience, realize that everyone copes in different ways. You may describe how you felt during that experience or suggest ideas that might help, but understand that the other person may be going through a different struggle.Instead, try saying something like, ""I can only imagine how hard this must be for you. I know how sad I was when my own dog died.""
Most importantly, never claim that your own problems are more serious (even if you feel that way). You are here to support the other person.

, Acknowledge that the other person's problems are real. Focus on listening to his/her problems and supporting him/her as s/he deals with them, not telling him/her that they're not worth the attention.Try not to accidentally minimize or invalidate your friend's experience. For example, if you try to comfort a friend who has lost her pet by saying, ""I'm sorry you lost your dog. At least it could be worse - you could have lost a member of your family,"" you're actually invalidating her grief for her pet, even if you don't mean it that way. This could make her feel reluctant to share her feelings with you, or even feel ashamed of them herself.Another example of invalidation is the well-meaning, ""Don't feel that way."" For example, if your friend is struggling with body image issues after an illness and tells you that he feels unattractive, it would be unhelpful to reply: ""Don't think like that! You're still attractive."" This tells your friend that he is ""wrong"" or ""bad"" for having his feelings. You can validate the feelings without agreeing with the idea behind them. For example: ""I hear you saying that you're feeling unattractive, and I'm so sorry that hurts you. That must really suck. If it helps, I think you're still very attractive.""Similarly, don't say ""at least it's not as bad as it could be.""This can be interpreted both as a dismissal of the person's problems, and as a reminder of additional problems in the person's life.

, S/he may not be comforted by such statements, or s/he may even be offended by such statements. They can often feel impersonal or prepackaged. It is usually best to keep your focus on the person you are interacting with and what you can do for him/her.For example, you may be a deeply religious person who believes in an afterlife, but the other person does not. It may feel natural to you to say something like, ""At least your loved one is in a better place now,"" but the other person may not get comfort from that.

, It's reasonable to suggest a course of action that you think might help someone, but don't stress the person out by bringing it up repeatedly. You might see it as an obvious, easy solution, but recognize that the other person might not agree.


Once you have said your piece, let it go. You may be able to bring up the point again if new information comes up. For example, ""I know you don't want to take pain medication, but I heard about a safer drug that might have fewer risks. Are you interested in the name so you can research it yourself?"" If the person declines, drop it.

, You may think the other person's problems are petty, or less serious than your own. You may even be jealous of someone whose problems seem so minor. This is not the correct time to bring this up, and you may never have a good opportunity to do so. It's better to politely say goodbye and leave the room, rather than express your irritation.

, Some people think that ""tough love"" is an effective therapy technique, but this is the opposite of acting sympathetic. If someone is grieving or sad for a long period of time, s/he may be depressed. In this case, s/he should talk to a doctor or therapist; trying to get him/her to ""toughen up"" or ""move on"" is not helpful., This may seem obvious, but during stressful times, it can be easy to lose control of your emotions. If you find yourself arguing with the person, insulting him/her, or criticizing his/her behavior, leave the room and apologize once you've calmed down.


Do not even jokingly insult someone who needs sympathy. S/he may be feeling vulnerable and easily hurt.

"
"
Acknowledge the event or problem.,
Ask the person how they're coping.,
Express support.,
Let the person know that emotions are appropriate.",How to Be Sympathetic3," Use these phrases to explain why you're approaching the person in need of sympathy, if you heard about the problem from someone else. If s/he started the conversation, respond by acknowledging the other person's feelings.


""I'm sorry to hear that.""
""I heard you were going through tough times.""
""That sounds painful.""

, Some people respond to stress or grief by becoming busier. They may not take the time off to think about their emotional state. Make eye contact and use a phrase that makes it clear you're asking about his/her feelings, not day-to-day life:


""How are you feeling?""
""How are you coping with everything?""

, Make it clear that you are on his/her side. Mention friends and family that may also be able to support him/her, reminding him/her that s/he has other people to turn to:


""You are in my thoughts.""
""I am here when you need me.""
""I'll be in touch later this week about helping out with _____.""
Avoid the very common ""Let me know if there's anything I can do."" This actually makes the person have to think of something for you, which they may not feel capable of doing at this time.

, Some people have trouble expressing emotions, or feel that they are experiencing the ""wrong"" emotions. Use these phrases to let them know it's okay:


""It's okay to cry if you need to.""
""I accept whatever you need to do right now.""
""It's normal to feel guilty."" (or anger, or whichever emotion the other person just expressed)

Make a list of what you miss about home.,
Get involved.,
Share what you love about home with others.,
Be brave.,
Get out of your comfort zone.",How to Deal With Homesickness2," It’s very common to miss your loved ones when you’re away from them. Make a list of the people you miss and what they brought to your life. What memories do you cherish? What things did you do together? What aspects of their personalities did you love? Finding new friends who are similar to those you left behind can help you feel emotionally supported. It can also help you adjust to a new place or situation.


Look for ways in which your new environment is like what you miss. Research on homesickness has showed that when you can find aspects of the familiar in your new situation, you are less likely to stay homesick because you are focused on something positive., It’s easy to say that you need to make new friends, but actually doing that can be hard in a new place. The best way to develop a strong social support network is to put yourself into situations where you’ll meet new people, especially if you have similar interests.Getting involved with new activities can also help distract you from your feelings of homesickness.


For example, if you’re away at school or college, there are a variety of clubs, sports, activities, and student government bodies you could join. These can help you connect with other people, many of whom are probably experiencing homesickness too!
If you’re at a new job or in a new city, it can be hard to make new friends. Research has shown that you may find it harder to make friends after you leave college.Consistency is key: joining a group that meets frequently, such as a book club or workshop, is likely to help you make friends because you’ll see the same people on a regular basis., One of the most important things you can do to fight homesickness is to make new friends. Having a strong support network makes you less likely to have problems coping with homesickness, even if you feel it.Sharing your positive memories about home will help lift your spirits and make you feel more comfortable talking about home.Have a party where you share your cuisine and customs with new friends or acquaintances. Whether you're studying abroad or just going to college a few hours away, sharing your favorite foods from home with others can make you feel better. You can have a party where you teach a few friends to make the foods you love most from home, or just invite some people over to enjoy your favorite local snacks.
Share your favorite music with others. If you're from a place that loves country music, have a small get-together where people play board games, get to know each other, and listen to your favorite tunes. If you loved listening to jazz at home, play some jazz. The music doesn't have to directly relate to your home as long as it reminds you of being home.
Tell funny stories about being at home. Though you may be feeling too mopey to laugh, try sharing some funny anecdotes about what you loved most about being at home. Talking about fond memories can strengthen your connection to home and to new friends.
If you're living in a place with a different native language from yours, try teaching some people a few key phrases in your language. This will be fun, distracting, and educational for your friends.

, Feeling shy, awkward, or vulnerable is a common side-effect of homesickness. If you don’t take any risks, you will miss out on experiences that could help you adjust to your new situation.Try accepting invitations, even if you won’t know many people at whatever you’ll be doing. You don't need to be the life of the party! Just being present and listening to others is a good step.


If you’re shy, give yourself a manageable goal: meet and talk to just one new person. You’ll probably become more comfortable socializing as time goes on.Focus on listening to the other person, which is the easiest way to make a connection.
Even if you end up not making friends at that particular party or event, you will have proved to yourself that you can handle doing new, unfamiliar things, and that can boost your self-confidence.

, Doing the same familiar things may feel comfortable, but it’s important to push yourself out of your comfort zone to grow and change. Research has shown that a moderate level of anxiety, such as that experienced when you’re learning a new skill, can improve your performance in intellectual and interpersonal tasks.Feeling too comfortable can keep you from adjusting to your new environment.Start with small steps. Trying to face your biggest fear all at once could be counter-productive. Trying to throw yourself into something completely foreign could leave you feeling overwhelmed. Give yourself small, manageable goals that challenge you a little bit at a time.Try a new restaurant in your new town. Offer to sit with a stranger at the cafeteria. Ask someone in your class to start a study group with you. Invite a co-worker to get drinks after work.

Enjoy the unique aspects of your new environment.,
Learn the language.,
Get out of the house.,
Pick up a new interest.,
Give it time.",How to Deal With Homesickness3," Finding ways to meet your needs in a new environment can be challenging, but it’s also helpful in fighting homesickness.Connecting with what is new and exciting about your new situation may help you feel more attached to it.


For example, if you're studying or living abroad, check out all of the museums, palaces, local restaurants, and cultural traditions that make the country unique. Get out your tour book and make a goal of doing something cultural at least once a week.
Immerse yourself in the culture. Even if you’ve just moved to a different place in your home country, you might find that the local culture is quite different from what you’re used to. Learn the local expressions, try out new cuisine, and check out local bars and pubs. Take a cooking class that focuses on local ingredients. Join a local dance club. Increasing your intercultural communication skills can help you feel more at home in a new place.Ask the locals about their favorite things to do. You may get an excellent recommendation for finding the best burrito of your life, or you could get directions to a gorgeous off-the-radar lake.

, If you’ve moved to a new country, not being able to speak the language can be a huge barrier to feeling like you belong. Learn the language as quickly as you can; take classes, chat with locals, and practice your new skills. You’ll feel more confident and in control once you’re able to communicate with the people in your new environment., Getting out of the house is half the battle to beating homesickness. Of course you'll be homesick if you spend eight hours in a day watching reruns of The Office in the near-dark. Instead, make a goal of spending a lot of your time out of the house, whether it's just to read the same book you were going to read at home in a sunny park, or to take a long walk with a good friend instead of doing sit-ups in your room.


Work or study out of the house. Go to a coffee shop or park and do the same work you were going to do at home. Just being around people may help you feel less alone.

, Finding something new to do on your own can help you find your passion. It can give you a positive, productive activity to focus your energy on and can distract you from feeling sad or lonely. Learning a new skill can also help you break out of your comfort zone.


Try finding a hobby that’s related to your new environment. See whether there are any biking or hiking clubs in your area. Join a local art class. Find a writers’ workshop. If you can socialize while developing a new skill, that will help you feel more connected to your new place.

, Don't be disappointed in yourself if you're not in love with your new environment right away. Many people around you may have embraced their new surroundings more quickly, but that doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you; in fact, many people who may look like they're having a great time may in fact be feeling incredibly homesick. Have patience and know that with a bit of perseverance, you'll be able to make it work."

Take a nap.",How to Hold Back Tears1," Use a small amount of physical pain to distract from emotional pain can help prevent tears. Pinch yourself in a sensitive area, like the bridge of your nose, the flesh between your fingers, or the inside of your upper arm. This is very effective for many people when it comes to preventing crying., Pay attention to the natural breathing patterns of your body can also serve to prevent tears. Focus on how your breaths are coming and going. You can also practice deep breathing by breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth, channeling air into your abdomen. This can be soothing and calm you down, making you feel better about the upsetting situation., Changing sensations can also help you avoid tears. Place a cold water bottle or ice cube on your wrist. Sprinkle some icy water on your face. Anything you can discreetly do to create a physical sensation can provide a solid distraction from crying., For some people, looking upward can help prevent crying. This will prevent the tears from escaping. However, the major downside is that this can prove distracting and does not have as high of a success rate as other options. The tears will usually fall once you put your head back in a regular position., Walk into another room or go outside. “The Doorway Effect” describes the situation in which forgetting is linked to walking through a doorway, This is because entering a new environment helps you to construct a new situation, erasing the old situation. This can reduce your anxiety and help distract you, though you won’t completely forget about the problem., Sleeping regenerates and heals the brain. It allows you to access the vast amount of information and knowledge in your brain that doesn’t immediately come to mind when you are awake. This is known as “spreading activation,” which allows your brain to seek out associations which might help to solve the problem."

Release stress productively.",How to Be Calm in a Stressful Situation," One of the best ways to calm down if you’re already feeling stressed is to stop interacting with the stressor, if possible. Sometimes, even taking a few seconds before you head back into the situation can be enough to help you cool down.Try counting to ten, or taking 3-5 deep breaths, before you reply in a heated conversation or situation.
Take a break. For example, if an argument with your spouse is getting heated, stop and excuse yourself for a moment by saying something like, “I’m feeling a little overwhelmed right now. I need to take a 15-minute break before we continue discussing this.” Go to a different place, focus on breathing deeply, and recite a calming mantra, such as “I can handle this calmly. I can do this.”

, When we’re stressed, sometimes our bodies interpret the stress as an attack and kick us into “fight or flight mode.” This stimulates the release of hormones like adrenaline, which constrict your blood vessels, make your breathing rapid and shallow, and boost your heart rate.Over time, this panic response can become a habit for your brain in what’s known as “automatic reactivity.”Slowing down and focusing on the individual physical responses you’re experiencing can help you learn to identify what it feels like when you’re stressed to the max. Studies also show that this conscious process of noticing what’s going on in your body can help retrain your brain’s automatic habits.Notice each thing that is going on in your body, but try to avoid judging it. For example, if you’re worried about doing well on a final exam that’s in just a few minutes, you might notice to yourself, “My face feels hot and flushed. My heart is beating very fast. My palms feel sweaty. I feel nauseated.” Try to keep your noticing these things as neutral as possible.

, When your body enters “fight or flight mode,” your sympathetic nervous system can seriously mess with your breathing. You may find it difficult to breathe when you’re stressed, but it’s important to focus on taking some long, even breaths. This will restore oxygen to your body and decrease lactate in your bloodstream, making you feel more calm and relaxed.You’ll probably notice that when you’re stressed or upset, your breathing seems to come from the very top of your chest, even your throat. Aim to breathe from your diaphragm instead. Place one hand on your lower abdomen just below your ribs and one on your chest.Inhale slowly through your nose. Aim to breathe in for a 4-count if you can. You should feel your belly expand along with your chest as you inhale: this is diaphragmatic breathing.
Hold the breath for 1-2 seconds. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Aim to exhale for a 4-count if you can. Repeat this process 6-10 times per minute for a few minutes.
You may also find it helpful to recite a mantra while you breathe, or count your breaths to keep yourself from getting distracted.A mantra may be a syllable, such as ""ohm,"" or it may be a phrase, such as ""breathing into my body , breathing out release ."", When you’re stressed, you may unconsciously tighten and tense your muscles, which can make you feel even more stressed and “wound up.” Using progressive muscle relaxation, or PMR, can help release that tension and get you feeling more calm and relaxed. PMR focuses on consciously tensing and then releasing muscles by groups.There are several free guided PMR routines online. Berkeley has a script you can follow along with.MIT has a free 11-minute audio guide to doing PMR.Find a quiet, comfortable place if you can. If this is not possible, you can still do some PMR techniques.
Loosen tight clothing if possible. Sit comfortably or lie down (although lying down may relax you so much you fall asleep!). Breathe evenly as you do your PMR groups.
Begin with the muscles in your face, as many people carry stress in their face, neck, and shoulder area. Start by opening your eyes as wide as they will go for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Give yourself 10 seconds to notice how these areas feel.
Move to the next group. Purse your lips tightly for 5 seconds, then release. Smile as wide as you can for 5 seconds, then release. Again, let yourself enjoy the sensation of relaxation for 10 seconds before moving on.
Continue to tense muscle groups for 5 seconds and then release the tension. Give yourself a 10-second relaxation break between groups.
Progress through the rest of your muscle groups (if time allows): neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes.
If you don't have time for a full PMR release, try to do it with just your facial muscles. You can also try a quick hand massage, since we often carry a lot of tension in our hands.

, Exercise is a natural mood-booster because it releases endorphins, natural chemicals that make you feel calm and happy.Several studies have demonstrated that exercising regularly can make you feel calmer and happier overall.Whether you go for a run, do calisthenics, do yoga, or lift weights, 30 minutes of physical exercise every day can help you relax.


Exercise may also have a preventive effect. Studies have shown that getting some aerobic exercise before an experience that may be stressful can actually help you keep calm during that experience.Try exercises such as yoga and tai chi. Their focus on deep breathing, meditation, and gentle physical movement can really help soothe you., You may exhibit a variety of signs when you’re feeling stressed or anxious. Knowing what to look for will help keep stress from sneaking up on you unawares. Everyone experiences and responds to stress differently, but there are some common symptoms you can look for:Psychological signs can include: trouble concentrating, difficulty with your memory, being distracted easily, feeling less creative or decisive, worrying, or frequent negative thinking.
Emotional signs can include: teariness, irritability, mood swings, unusual feelings for you, defensiveness, feeling a lack of motivation or the desire to procrastinate, low confidence or low self-esteem, frustration, feeling nervous or jittery, uncharacteristic aggression or anger.
Physical signs can include: aches and pains, a lowered immune system, weight or sleep changes, panic attacks, exhaustion or fatigue, and change of sex drive.
Behavioral signs can include: forgetfulness, self-neglect, social withdrawal, trouble sleeping, relationship trouble, impaired time-management and self-motivation, and using substances such as alcohol, nicotine, or drugs to help cope.

, Is your heart pounding because that person just cut you off on the freeway, or is it because of that presentation you have to give to your boss this afternoon? Think for a moment and try to figure out what’s really bothering you. If it helps, you can write various things down on a piece of paper and then rank them. Common sources of stress include:


Family. Conflicts with parents, loved ones, or your romantic partner can really stress you out.
School or work. You may feel pressure to perform, meet deadlines, or achieve certain tasks. You may also feel stressed about balancing work and your personal life, or about making major decisions.
Personal. These sources can be intense. You may worry about feeling “good enough.” You may be stressed over your relationships, or you may have problems with your health or finances that stress you out. You may also be bored or lonely, or have limited relaxation and self-care time.

, It may be that stress has become so integral to how you envision yourself that you don’t even recognize how tied up you have become. Take a step back and consider how you think about stress.


Do you frequently feel stressed out even if the stress always seems temporary? For example, you might say something like “It’s just really crazy at work this week” to explain your stress. However, if you are often feeling this stress, this suggests it is more than a temporary “bump” that’s causing it.
Do you feel like stress is part of your identity, or a “normal” part of your life? For example, perhaps you think, “My family are all worriers. That’s just how we are” or “I just live a stressful life, that’s all.” This type of thinking can make it seem like there’s nothing you can do to manage your stress.
Do you feel like your stress is others’ fault or responsibility? For example, you might blame the stress about a college essay on the teacher’s strict standards, rather than your procrastination. This can keep you from taking action to reduce your stress by changing your own behavior.

, Sometimes, we can get caught up in obsessing over the past to the point that it stresses us out in the present. You can’t change the past, but you can respond to the present and prepare for the future.


Constantly rehashing something that happened in the past can be a sign of rumination, an unhealthy thinking habit where you repeat a “broken record loop” of negative ideas. This can cause anxiety and depression.It is also unproductive, because ruminating doesn’t teach you anything about the past experience or help you problem-solve for the future.Instead, if you catch yourself stressing about something that has already happened, take a moment to remind yourself that you cannot change the past. However, you can learn and grow from it, and you can use its lessons to do better in the future. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “Why do my partners always break up with me? I’m just a loser,” this is unhelpful and it could definitely cause you stress.
Try thinking about your past in a more productive way. For example, you could examine your past relationships for trends, such as the type of person you generally date, your communication styles, or events that surrounded each breakup. You may find patterns that help you understand what’s going on and make new plans for future relationships. You also avoid essentializing about yourself, which will help you feel motivated to make any changes you need.

, We all worry about our futures at some point. However, we can get so wrapped up in anticipating the future that we stress out and forget to live in the present. This type of thinking isn’t helpful, but you can learn to change it. Remember: the future isn’t set.A common type of worry about the future is “catastrophizing,” where you predict the worst possible scenario for any event, even minor ones.For example, if you’re feeling stressed about an upcoming exam, catastrophizing could look like this: “If I don’t make a good grade on that test, I’m going to fail the course. I could even fail the semester. If I fail the semester I will lose my scholarship and I won’t be able to go to college any more. I’ll end up with no money and no job and I’ll have to live under a bridge in a box.” Obviously, this is an extreme example, but it illustrates the kind of thinking that can happen.
One way to challenge this is to imagine the absolute worst thing that could actually happen.For example, in the above scenario, the worst thing might be that you do indeed fail out of that college and have to move back in with mom and dad. Then, consider whether you could handle it. Chances are almost always yes. Finally, consider the real likelihood that this will occur. In this case, it’s pretty slim: a failed test does not equal failing a class, which does not equal failing out of college, etc.
You can also challenge catastrophizing by stopping yourself at each “conclusion” and finding logical evidence and counterpoints for it. For example, if you fail the exam, you might fail the course -- or you might be able to retake the exam, or bring up your grade for extra credit.

, You should always try to make plans and decisions when you’re calm and relaxed. If you’re feeling stressed or angry, that could impair your judgment and lead you to make rash or unhelpful decisions.Inhale deeply through your nose. In your mind, count to five seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, for another five seconds. Repeat this breathing pattern until you feel comfortable with it.
Think about something else. Get your mind off the stress by thinking about something that makes you happy, such as your kids or spouse (provided they’re not the cause of the current stress), or by concentrating on the things you have planned for the day.
Visualize relaxing things, such as a deserted island or a country road. Close your eyes and try to picture even minor details about the imaginary place, and you can put yourself in that situation instead of the one you’re in.
Get away from the cause of the stress. If you can physically escape the stress trigger, do so. Leave the room or pull off the road for a moment to put things in perspective.
Acknowledge that anxiety is not always bad. Sometimes, anxiety or stress can be a clue that you’re considering a significant or even unhelpful decision.For example, you might feel stressed about selling all of your belongings, buying a school bus , and living a nomadic life in the desert. This is obviously a big decision, and whether or not it’s a good fit for you is something you need to consider seriously. Anxiety is your warning sign here to slow down and think carefully.

, In general, you have two responses when you face stress: you can choose to change either the situation or your response to it.Even if you’re powerless to change the source of your stress, you have the power to choose how you’ll respond to it. You can choose to learn new techniques to respond in the moment. You can choose to refocus your thinking. Consider some questions when deciding your approach.


Can you avoid it? You can sometimes avoid stressors, thereby changing the situation. For example, if you frequently find yourself stressed by your busy schedule, you can examine your agenda for things you could drop. You could also learn to say “no” to requests more frequently, or ask for help.
Can you alter it? Some stressors can’t be avoided, but you can alter your approach to them and thus change the situation. For example, you and your romantic partner will have disagreements at some point; this is natural for all relationships, even if you’re the most loving couple in the world. However, these don’t have to be stressful if you alter your approach, such as seeking compromise or expressing your feelings directly instead of using passive-aggression.
Can you adapt to it? Sometimes you can change your approach or behaviors to reduce stress, even if you can’t change the situation. For example, if you frequently find yourself stressed by rush-hour traffic, you can’t change that: you have to get to work, and rush-hour traffic is a worldwide problem. However, you could alter your approach to this stressor by taking public transit to work, finding a different route home, or leaving a little earlier or later in the day.
Can you accept it? Some things you simply cannot change. You cannot change or control others’ feelings, actions, or reactions. You can’t change the fact that it rained on your wedding day, or that your boss is a selfish jerk no matter how hard you try to be a good communicator. However, you can accept these as things beyond your control and let go of your need to control them. You can also view them as learning experiences from which you can grow.

, Sometimes you can resolve a stressful situation right away with one action, but often you’ll need several steps, perhaps over a long period. Write out a plan with attainable goals and a timeline for reaching those goals.


Additionally, many stressful situations are avoidable. If you prepare ahead of time for important events and make contingency plans, you may not have to cope with as much stress later. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

, If you continue to experience stress because no matter how hard you try you can’t take the steps quickly enough, you probably haven’t set realistic goals. In a culture that values a can-do attitude, it can be hard to accept that sometimes you can’t do something, at least not within a given period of time. If that’s the case, revise your timeline or lower your expectations. If you can’t do that, the situation qualifies as one which you can’t control. Learn from your experience, but let it go.


If you find yourself constantly failing to meet someone else's unrealistic standards, read How to Stop Being a People Pleaser and How to Overcome Martyr Syndrome.

, A complex problem can be overwhelming, even when you’ve got your plan mapped out, but remember: the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Just focus on one small goal at a time.


Show yourself patience and kindness as you enact your plans. Remember that personal growth is hard work that does not come quickly. If you encounter setbacks or challenges (and most likely, you will at some point), view them as roadblocks from which you can learn new ways of approaching the situation, rather than “failures.”

, Procrastination often results from fear and anxiety, which can stop us dead in our tracks. Often, perfectionism is a culprit. You may get so wrapped up in needing to be “perfect” (which is both highly subjective and always unattainable) that you find yourself unable to actually do what you need to do because you’re worried it won’t turn out as you hope. Fortunately, you can learn some techniques to help you overcome procrastination and the stress it can cause.Remind yourself that you cannot control outcomes, only actions. You might be so stressed about what your professor will think about your essay that you can’t face writing it. Remember that you can control what you do: you can do your best and write your best essay. The rest of it is out of your hands.
Acknowledge that “perfection” is an unrealistic standard. No human can attain perfection, and our ideas of what “perfect” means are highly variable anyway. Instead, aim for your personal best and avoid making assumptions about yourself based on outcomes. For example, a perfectionist might see a B+ on an essay as a “failure” because it is not a perfect grade. However, someone who is aiming for her personal best could reframe this: she knows she did the best she could and she can be proud of that effort, regardless of what the grade on the essay says.
Watch out for “should” statements. These insidious thoughts can encourage you to beat yourself up over things that are out of your control. For example, you might have the thought, “A good student should never make mistakes.” However, that is an unrealistic standard that no one can meet. Instead, try a “can” statement: “I can perform to my best ability and honor my effort, even when I make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes in life.”

, You can’t eliminate all stress from your life, and in fact, you wouldn’t want to. Stress can be a great motivator. It can even be a sign that you’re deeply invested in what you’re doing or about to do. Mindfulness techniques can help you notice when you experience stressful sensations and acknowledge those feelings without judging them. This will help you avoid focusing too much on the stress.Here are a couple of exercises to try:


Try the raisin meditation. It may sound a little silly, but this exercise can help you learn to slow down and focus on the present moment. As you interact with your handful of raisins, you will pay careful attention to each element of your experience, acknowledging it to yourself. Try it for 5 minutes a day.Begin with a handful of raisins. Take one between your fingers and hold it. Turn it around, notice its texture, its ridges and valleys. Make a mental note of what the raisin feels like.
Examine the raisin visually. Take time to really see the raisin, as though you were an explorer from another world whose first contact with Earth is this remarkable wrinkled thing. Notice its colors, its shape, its textures.
Smell the raisin. Hold the raisin to your nose and take a few deep breaths. Enjoy any aroma that you smell. Try to describe it to yourself. You may even find that certain raisins smell different than others!
Place the raisin on your tongue. Notice how it feels there. Can you feel the weight? Can you move it around your mouth, exploring how it feels in different places?
Taste the raisin by taking a small bite. Notice now how you move your mouth as you chew it. Try to discern what muscles you’re using to chew. Notice how the texture and taste of the raisin respond to your chewing.
Swallow the raisin. Try to see if you can follow the raisin as you swallow. What muscles are you using? What does it feel like?


Try a self-compassion break. We can get so wrapped up in the daily stresses of our lives that we become accustomed to judging ourselves for them. A quick self-compassion break for just 5 minutes can help you become more mindful of when you are being harsh with yourself.Think of the stressful situation. Notice any sensations of stress in your body, or any emotions you are feeling.Repeat to yourself, “This is a moment of suffering” or “This is stress.” Acknowledging that this is what is happening without judging it will help you become more mindful of your experience.
Now repeat, “Stress is a natural part of life” or “Everyone has negative experiences sometimes.” This will help you recognize your common humanity with others. You are not deficient or “bad” for experiencing these things.
Place your hands over your heart or wrap your arms around yourself to give yourself a hug. Repeat to yourself, “May I be kind to myself” or “May I be patient.” You can say whatever seems most relevant for your situation, but keep it phrased positively.


The Greater Good in Action center at Berkeley has a bunch of other evidence-based exercises that you can practice at their website., RAIN is a helpful acronym invented by psychologist Michele McDonald to help you practice a mindfulness approach. It stands for:Recognize what is going on. Consciously notice and recognize whatever is going on right now, in this moment. This means acknowledging feelings or thoughts that seem negative as well as those that seem positive. For example, “I am feeling very angry and stressed right now.”

Allow the experience to be there as it is. This means that you acknowledge whatever is going on in your mind and heart without judgment. It’s tempting to judge yourself for seemingly “negative” feelings or reactions, or to try and avoid or repress those things. Instead, notice them and acknowledge even the unpleasant thoughts and feelings as valid parts of your experience. For example, “I feel so angry with my partner, but also ashamed that I snapped at her.”

Investigate with kindness. This crucial part involves showing yourself and others compassion as you investigate your present moment. Ask yourself what your thoughts and feelings reflect about your beliefs and needs right now. For example, if you are feeling angry with your partner and ashamed that you snapped at her, you might direct harsh judgment toward the both of you: “I’m a bad person for yelling at her. She makes me so mad.” Instead, try to approach both people with kindness: “I yelled at her, and I’m feeling ashamed by that because I love her. I made a mistake that I can acknowledge. My partner said things that made me angry, but I know she also loves me. We can work together to solve this issue.”

Natural awareness arises from not over-personalizing the experience. This means extricating yourself from that tendency to generalize about yourself based on one experience, such as “I’m a bad person” or “I’m a loser.” Your feelings are part of your experience, but they are not you. Allow yourself to acknowledge that you may have negative experiences or feelings without them defining who you are.

, Meditation is all about being quiet and accepting in the present moment.Meditation can help you feel calm and relaxed even through your day-to-day stresses. In fact, meditation can over time even rewire how your brain responds to stressors!Mindfulness meditation in particular has recently received a lot of scientific support for its benefits.You can do some meditation on your own, take a class, or use an audio guide.


Begin by finding a quiet place without distractions or interruptions. Avoid having your TV, computer, or cellphone on. If you can, take at least 15 minutes to meditate (although 30 is even better).Close your eyes and breathe evenly and deeply. Begin by focusing just on your breath. You can gradually expand your focus to include your other sensory experiences.
Notice your sensations without judgment. Acknowledge the thoughts you experience as thoughts, even if the thoughts seem negative to you: “I am having the thought right now that this is corny.” Accept the thought as it is, without trying to change or reject it.
If you find yourself getting distracted, bring your thoughts back to noticing your breathing.
You can also find free audio meditations online. MITand the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Centerboth have online MP3 meditations. You can also find mobile apps such as Calm that can help guide you.

, Challenge negative thoughts when they show up by repeating positive affirmations to yourself. You can train your brain to look for the best in you, not the worst, which can help reduce stress levels. Here are some examples:“I can do this.”
“I can do my best. That is all I can do. That is enough.”
“I am bigger than my problems.”
“My mistakes do not define me.”
“I am human. We all make errors.”
“This is temporary and will pass.”
“I can ask for help when I need it.”

, It can be tempting to handle stress in unproductive ways, such as turning to alcohol or other substances, or taking it out on another person, pet, or inanimate object. Avoid these tendencies and focus on productive ways to express your stress instead.


Resist the temptation to blow up or lash out when you’re stressed, especially if you’re angry. Expressing your anger through shouting, physical violence, or even breaking or punching things can actually make your anger and stress worse.Try something less harmful, like squeezing a stress ball or doodling.
On the other hand, swearing may actually help you feel better in a stressful or painful situation.Just be mindful of where you do it: obviously, dropping the f-bomb in front of your boss or cussing out your child could hurt not only you but others.
Cry if you want to. Sometimes, you just need to cry. Doing so productively can actually help you feel better. Make sure to repeat calming, kind statements to yourself as you cry, and allow yourself to feel your feelings.Listen to some soothing music. The British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the world’s “most relaxing” music. Listening to some calm, soothing music when you’re stressed can provoke a physiological relaxation response.Take a hot shower or bath. Physical warmth has been shown to have a relaxing effect on many people."

, A quick wipe-up can at least prevent you from crying even more about spoiled makeup or having a snotty nose.

, Most useful is a low-brow hat that can be tilted over the eye area. But you could try a scarf, sunglasses or a veil as well.


If you're lacking clothing to help, shield your eye area with a magazine, book or clutch bag until the crying is over.

, If you rub them too hard, they will most likely turn red, and puffy, and that does not look attractive. Instead, just let the tears flow down your cheeks. If you're crying because of a smaller reason(not a funeral or something where you'll cry a lot, but rather getting frustrated about something you know you'll get over quickly with only a few tears), then don't hold it in. If you do, then your eyes can become red, and eventually you'll have to let the tears out anyway, so your efforts will be wasted. If you don't try to hold it back at all(which can be very hard sometimes), then the tears will come out without any redness, or lasting effects. Then, gently wipe the tears away once they have fallen down your cheek.


Use a tissue to gently dab away the wetness, if you need. When you wipe your tears, gently swipe them off your face. Or else your face will feel sticky and shiny, and yes, it makes your skin look worse. So, gently swipe the tears off, then smile!

, This is a common thing that lots of people, especially children, tend to do automatically. Screwing or scrunching up your face mars its natural attractiveness, so avoid this as much as possible.


Don't purposely make an ugly face, although some people do it by instinct. Think positive thoughts, not negative. Smile and be happy.

, This can help you to relax and calm the belly sobs welling up. Breathe in, and out, in and out. Focus on trying to relax.


Purse your lips together to contain yourself better.

, Try your best not to make any heavy, loud breathing sounds, (although it is hard to control for some people). Instead, take slow and steady breaths and just sob or sniffle every once in a while.

, If you act all serious and dark, you won't look cute. Although giggling does induce a few more tears, it makes you look prettier and happier, so giggle!

, If you are an ugly crier and you can't help but make an ugly face and sob really loudly, which is not uncommon, once you start crying, bury your face in your hands. Once you have slowed down your crying and you're just sobbing and sniffling, put your head back up and continue on.

It is better to let yourself cry than force yourself to stop. Pent up emotions are being expressed when you cry which allows the body to release tension and recover.


If you are in a time crunch and you need to stop crying, tell yourself, “You need to stop crying and find the calm inside you.” Repeat this until you stop.
You can also purposely startle yourself. This will create a quick shift in your emotions and will help you stop. Simply saying, “Oh!” might do the trick.
Redirect your emotions with a pinch to your arm. This can cause enough of a distraction to switch off your crying response.
Once you have stopped crying, distract your thoughts away from the reason for crying. If you just received news that someone passed away, focus on what you need to do that day.
Crying is related to many positive events as well as sad or maddening events. Allow yourself to cry until you stop.;
, When you cry, facial nerves are stimulated, which causes the skin to increase in temperature. Cool water splashed on your face will lessen the heat. Let the water run over your hands and wrists and splash your face a few times. Use a towel or whatever is available to pat your face dry.

, You want to clear you nose of mucus, but blowing it excessively will increase the redness of your nose. Once you've blown your nose, look in a mirror to make sure your nose is clean.

, Take a few cleansing breaths to release the residual emotions and fill your lungs. Crying can constrict your breathing, and slow breathing can restore normal function. Your body will benefit from the additional oxygen.


Avoid rapid breathing that can turn into hyperventilating, which can trigger a panic attack., When a person cries, blood rushes to the face, eyes and nose areas. Once you stop crying, the skin will eventually return to your normal color.


Use a cold compress and place it over your eyes, nose and face. This will speed up the calming process.
If you are at work or elsewhere and a cold compress is not available, wet paper towels and spin them in the air to cool them. This will do the trick.
Fan you face using a piece of paper or whatever you can find to allow air to rush over your face. This will cool your face, which will reduce the redness.

, If you don’t have any eye drops, you will simply need to wait until your eyes clear or put your sunglasses on to hide your eyes.

, If you want to make sure you are presentable, the mirror will tell you. If your hair looks good, your face looks good, and your clothes are situated like you want, then you are ready.

, You might need to give yourself a little boost to rise to the occasion of facing the crowd. Try some positive self-talk and say, “Okay, you’ve got this. You are going to hold it together. We are moving on.” , The feelings of whatever it was that made you cry might return to upset you again. If you start to feel emotional, stop yourself and substitute a positive thought.Pick a subject matter that is not closely related to the reason you are crying. The goal is to refocus your attention away from issue at hand.


Tell yourself, “You are going to think about something positive like how much you love going to the beach. Yes, that is what you are focusing on now.”
Think about a project you are working on. Make a mental list of the steps you need to take and when you will get them accomplished. Imagine how happy you will be when it is complete. This will carry you out of the emotional darkness you might be feeling.

, You may not be an actor, but your body doesn’t know that. The power of suggestion can be very effective.As you enter the crowd, perk up, smile and tell yourself, “You are feeling good and you are happy.” Send yourself on your way filled with positive thoughts.

, You were crying for some reason. If you have gone through a difficult time, you need to allow yourself to feel the emotions that made you cry. You also need to determine if the frequency and duration of your crying is excessive.


Was this an isolated incident or something that is happening often?
If you find yourself crying uncontrollably for an extended period of time, you need to talk to someone about getting help.

Try blinking, or not blinking at all.,
Pinch your nose.,
Smile.,
Cool off.,
Have some tea.,
Laugh.,
Try progressive relaxation.,
Take control.,
Use pain as a distraction.,
Take a step back.",How to Stop Crying1," For some people, blinking quickly and repeatedly can spread tears out and help them reabsorb into the tear duct, preventing initial tears from pooling. Conversely, for some people, not blinking and opening the eyes as wide as is comfortable actually discourages tears from forming by tensing the muscles in and around the eye area. Only practice will tell you which group you fall into., Because your tear ducts stem from the side of your nose to an opening in the eyelid, pinching the bridge of your nose and the sides while clamping your eyes closed can block the tear ducts. (This works best if used before tears begin to flow.), Studies have shown that smiling has a positive impact on emotional health. It also positively impact the way others view you. What's more, the act of smiling counteracts the symptoms of crying, making it easier for you to prevent tears., One way to dial back intense, unpleasant emotions is to take a moment to splash cold water on your face. Not only does it relax you, but it can boost your energy and make you more attentive.. You can also drip cold water on your wrists and dab it behind you ears. Major arteries run through these areas just below the skin surface and cooling them can have a calming effect on the whole body., Research has shown that green tea contains L-Theanine, which can promote relaxation and decrease tension while also increasing awareness and focus. So the next time you find yourself overwhelmed, with tears welling up, treat yourself to a cup of green tea., Laughter is an easy, inexpensive form of therapy that can improve your overall health and decrease feelings that lead to crying or depression. Find something that makes you laugh and give yourself some much needed relief. , Crying occurs often as a product of prolonged tension.This process allows your body to relax tense muscles and calm your thinking. It is also a cognitive activity because it teaches you to recognize how your body feels when you are upset and tense versus when you are relaxed and calm. Starting at your toes, begin tensing the muscle groups of your body one at a time for 30 second intervals, working your way slowly upward to the head. This activity also has the added benefit of relieving insomnia and restless sleep., Research suggests that feelings of helplessness and passivity are often at the root of episodes of crying. To prevent crying, shift your body from passive to active. This can be something as simple as getting up and walking around the room, or opening and closing your hands with a slight squeeze to engage your muscles and remind your body that your actions are voluntary and you are in control..

, Physical pain distracts your senses from the root of your emotional pain, making you less likely to cry. You can pinch yourself (such as between your thumb and pointer finger, or on the back of your upper arm), bite your tongue, or pull your leg hairs from inside your pants pocket.If you find yourself causing bruising or other physical harm, it is recommended that you discontinue this method and attempt to use one or more of the other tactics.

, Remove yourself from the situation, physically. If you are having an argument that is causing you to cry, politely excuse yourself for a few moments. This is not running away from your problem; removing yourself allows you to refocus your emotions and removes the imminent threat of conflict. During this time, practice some of the other techniques to help ensure you do not cry upon re-entering the room and continuing the discussion. The goal here is to bring yourself back to a place of being in control of your emotions."

Learn about the benefits of crying on occasion.,
Seek behavioral modification therapy.,
Be upfront about your emotional needs.",How to Hold Back Tears2," It's okay and healthy to cry. You should not always hold your tears back. If possible, give yourself a chance to cry once a week. Watch a sad movie or TV show in the privacy of your own home. Allow yourself to experience feelings of sadness.


Tears provide a powerful and necessary emotional release. They also remove certain toxins from the body, which can help bolster the immune system. Allowing yourself to occasionally cry can be good for your physical and emotional well-being.Crying on occasion can actually make you stronger. It boosts feelings of resiliency and strengthens the capacity for empathy. This is possibly due to the fact that crying is a form of stress management. People usually feel better after a good, cathartic cry., Behavior modification therapy is a form of therapy where you recognize negative behavioral patterns and work on consciously changing your behavior. If you cry frequently, behavior modification therapy can help you find better ways to cope with emotional distress. Some people cry when they are angry, not only when they are sad.You can ask your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist who practices behavioral modification.
If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your college or university.

, Oftentimes, frequent crying is due to an inability to express emotional needs to those around you. Talk to your loved ones about when and why you need emotional support. Do not be ashamed to ask someone to take time to listen to you vent, hold your hand, and provide emotional comfort.

"
Take a step back from the situation.,
Seek distractions.,
Practice self-talk.,
Allow yourself to experience anger.",How to Hold Back Tears3," If you feel tears coming on due to emotional stress, sometimes stepping back from the situation can help. Putting some distance between yourself and a stressor can help you hold back tears.


If you are crying because of an argument then you need to show the person involved that you are upset about it. Tell them if you need to cool down. Say something like, ""I need a minute"" and leave the room. Go for a walk. Read a book. Do anything you can to distract yourself from growing emotional.If you're at work or school, leave a meeting or class to run to the bathroom. Take a quick five minute break if possible. Return to your office or cubicle and simply breathe for a few moments., You cannot always simply leave when you feel tears coming on. If you can't duck out from a meeting or a classroom, try to distract yourself from the emotional distress.


Take notes. They do not have to be relevant to what's happening. You can write song lyrics, poetry, simply doodle, anything to get your mind out of the present moment.Use your phone. If you're in a situation where it's appropriate, try using your phone as a way to get your mind off the situation. Go to a funny webpage. Check your Facebook profile. Send a text to a friend., If you learn to use self-talk to ground yourself emotionally, you can avoid crying when upsetting situations arise. You can think of a positive quote or applicable song lyrics to calm yourself down.

For example, you might think of a phrase your grandmother often used to say, such as “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”

, Oftentimes, people use crying as a means to convey frustration and distress. This is not necessarily a conscious decision. The chemicals released in tears often quell aggression, so crying is sometimes an evolutionary means of defense. However, sometimes it’s more effective to express anger when being disrespected.For example, say you arrive for a doctor's appointment to find your doctor is not in. You have a very busy schedule and today is the only day you have time for your annual physical. When you arrive, the doctor is not in and the receptionist unapologetically tells you he forgot to cancel the appointment. In such a situation, you may feel tempted to cry in frustration. However, instead express that you are angry.Express anger in a firm but non-aggressive manner. Do not curse out the receptionist or start yelling and making a scene in the office. Instead, say something like, ""That's incredibly rude and I really don't appreciate it. I need you to make me another appointment."" You've expressed that you are displeased with the situation in an upfront manner rather than attempting to diffuse the situation with tears."
"
Postpone crying.,
Meditate.,
Find positive distractions.,
Listen to music.,
Be aware.,
Be grateful.",How to Stop Crying2," As part of taking control of your emotional responses, when you feel you are about to cry, tell yourself that you can't cry now, but you will allow yourself to cry later. Take a deep breath and focus on de-escalating the emotions that are causing you to tear up. While this may be difficult at first, cognitively recognizing your emotions and conditioning your body to respond in appropriate ways at appropriate times is a long-term solution to crying at inconvenient times.


Note that it is never a good idea to put off crying all together, as suppression can create lasting emotional damage and exacerbate the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Always remember to create opportunities to express your emotions., Meditation is an ages old way to reduce stress, combat depression, and relieve anxiety. It doesn't take finding a yogi to benefit from meditation, either. Simply find a quiet spot, close your eyes and focus on your breathing, taking long, deep breaths and exhaling in a slow, measured fashion. You'll notice your negative feelings melting away almost immediately., Find something other than negative emotions to focus on. Think about something that makes you happy or makes you laugh. Watch funny animal videos on the internet. You can also try to focus on something you are looking forward to. If you are a problem-solver, work math equations or take on a small project. If these don't seem to work, mentally imagine a calming, restful place. Let your mind focus on the details of that place that bring you happiness. This will coerce your brain to feel an emotion other than sadness, anger, or fear.

, Music has varied benefits when it comes to managing stress. Soothing music can calm us down, while listening to music with empathetic lyrics can empower and reassure us. Choose what is right for you and banish tears with a well-crafted playlist., Focus on your present self, the way food tastes, how the breeze feels on your skin, the way the fabric of your clothing feels when you move. When you focus on the present and really pay attention to your senses, it can relieve mental stress and help you see that the problem you are facing isn't quite so imposing., We often cry because we feel overwhelmed by what we see as wrong with our life or because of problems that we face. Take a deep breath and consider that the problem you are facing is less severe, relative to other problems you could be facing or have faced in the past. Remind yourself of the good things you have to be thankful for. Keep a journal to remind yourself of your blessings and to help you through particularly trying times."
"
Identify the source.,
Acknowledge emotions as they occur.,
Take stock of the good things.,
Journal to understand the source of your tears.,
Get help.,
Know when you're grieving.",How to Stop Crying3," Does the urge to cry accompany certain emotions, events, individuals, or types of stress? Is the source something that you can minimize contact or interaction with?


If the answer is ""yes,"" develop ways of avoiding or restricting contact with the source. This could be as simple of avoiding lengthy conversation with a coworker who hurts your feelings or avoiding sad or violent films.
If the answer is no, consider reaching out to a therapist for coping strategies. This is particularly appropriate for when conflict with close family or loved ones is identified as the source of negative emotions that lead to crying.

, Although distractions are useful when crying occurs at inopportune times, take the time when you are in a safe, private place to experience your emotions authentically. Be introspective, analyzing your feelings, the sources, and possible resolutions. Ignoring your emotions or trying to repress them constantly is counterproductive to healing and improvement. In fact, ongoing problems can linger in your subconscious and actually increase episodes of crying., Develop the habit of self-policing your negative thoughts and remind yourself of good things about yourself. Try to maintain a 1:1 ratio of positive to negative thoughts whenever possible. This will not only make you happier in general, it will help prevent unpredictable emotions by training your brain to know that, in spite of problems, you are a worthwhile individual.

, If you are having difficulty controlling your tears or you're not even sure why you're crying, journaling can help you get to the root. Journaling can have a positive impact on your health, can help you see the positive benefits of a stressful event, and help clarify your thoughts and feelings.Writing about anger or sadness can decrease the intensity of these emotions, which may help curb your crying. You will also get to know yourself better, becoming more confident and aware of situations or people that are toxic and should be removed from your life.Try journaling for 20 minutes a day every day. Practice ""free writing,"" in which you don't worry about spelling, punctuation, or any other ""shoulds."" Write quickly so you can't censor yourself.You'll be surprised by what you learn and how much better you will feel.
Journaling allows you to freely express your emotions without judgement or inhibitions.If you have experienced a traumatic event, journaling can help you process your emotions and can actually make you feel more in control. Write about the facts of the event and the emotions you experienced to get the most out of your journaling., If nothing seems to help curb episodes of crying and negative emotion and it's having an impact or your relationships or employment, take the first step toward a solution by contacting a licensed therapist. Often the problem can be solved with behavioral therapies; however, if there is an medical reason for these problems, a therapist can ensure you receive proper medication.


If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, seek help from a counselor or mental health professional. Symptoms of depression include: persistent sad or ""empty"" feeling; feelings of hopelessness, guilt, and/or worthlessness; thoughts of suicide; decreased energy; difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much and appetite and/or weight changes.If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts, get help immediately. Try calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 (800) 273-8255, or visit IASP to find a helpline in your country. Or call someone you trust to talk about how you are feeling.

, Grief is a natural response to loss; it could be the death of a beloved family member, the loss of a relationship, losing a job, loss of health, or any other loss.Grieving in personal – there is no ""right"" way to grieve, nor is there a prescribed time table for grieving. It may take weeks or years, and there will be many highs and lows.Seek support from friends and family. Sharing your loss is one of the most important factors in healing from loss. A support group or grief counselor may also be helpful.Eventually the emotions connected to grieving should become less intense. If you experience no improvement or your symptoms only seem to get worse over time, your grief may have developed into major depression or complicated grief. Contact a therapist or grief counselor to help you move toward acceptance."

Know why infants cry.,
Ask the child questions.,
Notice if the child is injured.,
Offer distractions.,
Reassure the child.,
Time out.",How to Stop Crying4," Remember that crying is one of the only forms of communication that an infant can access, and it is a consistent indicator of need. Put yourself int he mindset of the child and consider what could be causing discomfort. Some common reasons that babies cry are:


Hunger: Most newborns require feeding every two to three hours around the clock.
The need to suckle: Infants have a natural instinct to latch and suckle as this is how they derive nourishment.
Loneliness. Babies require social interaction to develop into happy, healthy children and will often cry when they want affection.
Tiredness. Newborn infants need frequent naps, sometimes sleeping as much as 16 hours of the day.
Discomfort: Think about the context of the crying episode and what your child's experience may be in order to anticipate normal needs and desires.
Over-stimulation: Too much noise, movement or visual stimulation can overwhelm infants, causing them to cry.
Illness. Often the first sign of illness, allergy, or injury is that the infant cries and does not respond to soothing., Unlike the guessing game we play with infants, children have access to more sophisticated forms of communication and we can ask, ""What is wrong?"" This doesn't necessarily mean that they are capable of communicating like adults, though, so it's important to ask simple questions and read between the lines when a child seems unable to describe a problem in detail.

, Younger children can have difficulty answering questions when upset, so it is important for parents and caregivers to pay attention to the context and physical condition of the child when he is crying.

, If the child is hurt or unhappy, it can help to distract her from the pain until it subsides. Try to refocus her attention on something she likes. Determine if and where injury may have occurred, but ask about every part of her body except for where she is actually hurt. This requires her to think about those body parts rather than the one which hurts, creating a distraction.

, Children often cry in response to discipline or after negative interactions with an adult or a peer. When this occurs, determine whether action is warranted to mediate the situation (e.g. put fighting children in time-out) but always remind the child he is safe and loved, in spite of conflict.

, All children will behave badly from time to time. However, if the child uses crying, anger, or shouting in an attempt to receive what she wants, it is important to prevent the association between bad behavior and satisfaction.


If your toddler or child is throwing a tantrum, remove the child to a quiet room and let her remain there until the tantrum passes, returning her to a social environment when the anger has passed.
If the upset child is old enough to walk and follow commands, ask the child to go to her room, reminding her that she is allowed to return, tell you what she wants, and why she is upset once she calms down. This also teaches the child productive coping strategies for anger and disappointment while still ensuring the child feels loved and respected.

Ask if assistance is needed.,
Identify the cause of pain.,
Give appropriate physical contact.,
Focus on the positive.,
Let them cry.",How to Stop Crying5," Unlike infants and children, adults are capable of making independent assessments of their condition and whether assistance is needed. Before stepping in and attempting to help, always ask if you can offer assistance. If the person is in emotional pain, he may need space and time to process emotions before including another person in the coping process. Sometimes, just the offer of assistance is enough to help a person cope with distress.


If the situation is not serious and the person welcomes a distraction, tell a joke or funny story. Comment on something funny/strange that you read online. If the person is a stranger or distant acquaintance, ask him non-intrusive questions about his likes and preferences.

, Is the pain physical? Emotional? Has the person had a shock or been victimized in some way? Ask questions but also be observant of the situation and surroundings for clues.


If the person is crying and appears to have been injured or in need of medical assistance, call 911 immediately. Remain close by until help arrives. If the location is unsafe, move the person to a safer location nearby if possible.

, In the case of a friend or loved one, it may be helpful to offer a hug or hold hands. Even an arm around the shoulders can be a source of support and comfort. Different situations permit different degrees of physical contact, however; if you are unsure whether the person will take comfort from this kind of assistance, always ask.

, Without necessarily changing the subject, attempt to focus on positive aspects of what is causing emotional distress. In the case of the loss of a loved one, for example, mention good times that were shared with the person and things about her that were loved. If possible, reminisce over funny memories that may elicit a smile or possible laugh. Being able to laugh can exponentially reduce the urge to cry and improves overall mood.

, Crying is a natural response to intense emotional distress and, while there are occasions where it is in opportune or inappropriate, provided no one else is being hurt, letting someone cry could ultimately be safest, most supportive option.

Many people who were raised to hold it all inside have a lot of trouble expressing emotions as adults. But crying is a necessary part of life that actually fosters good mental health. Crying can be an expression of sadness, pain, fear, joy, or just pure emotion, and it's a natural, healthy way to let those emotions run through our bodies.


Men tend to have more trouble letting it all out than women do, primarily because men are taught to keep their emotions to themselves. But crying is just as natural for men as it is for women, even if they do it less often. Girls and boys cry the about the same amount until they reach age 12.When they become adults, men cry 7 times a year on average, while women cry 47 times a year.Crying is in no way a sign of weakness. It's an expression of emotion that has nothing to do with decision making. You can still take brave actions, even if you cry in anticipation. In fact, crying could help you process the emotions you're feeling and think more clearly about what's ahead.
Crying is not for babies, contrary to what you might have heard. Children are more likely to cry because they have not yet internalized the idea that there's something wrong with it. But the need to cry does not go away when you grow up.;
, Crying is a way that humans release emotional tension. It's a natural bodily function that happens as a result of emotions building up and needing to be let out.Interestingly, humans are the only mammals that produce tears as a way to express emotion. Crying is a survival mechanism that helps us in the following ways:


It relieves stress and lowers blood pressure. Over time intense stress and high blood pressure can lead to severe medical problems, and crying helps to mitigate these issues.It's a way to remove toxins that build up when you're upset. Certain chemicals build up in your system when you're stressed, and crying helps to expel them through tears - especially emotional tears, as opposed to tears formed as a result of irritation.It boosts your mood immediately afterward. This isn't just in people's heads - it's a scientific fact. When you cry, your level of manganese gets lower. The buildup of manganese leads to stress and anxiety, so crying is nature's way of easing emotional pain., Now that you know all the good things that come about when you cry, think about what might be stopping your own tears from flowing. If it has been a long time since you've been able to cry, you may need to make a conscious effort to get to the point where you can release your emotions through tears.


Do you harbor negative thoughts about crying? If so, try to change your views and see that there's nothing wrong with crying - it's good for you.
Do you have trouble expressing feelings in general? Allowing yourself to cry will be a good start for you. Being able to process emotions in this way will help you be more emotional in general.
When you push your feelings down and keep yourself from crying, those feelings don't go away. You may feel either angry or numb.

, Letting yourself cry is a way to take better care of yourself. It's a way to honor your feelings instead of denying them and pushing them down. When you cry, you're allowing yourself to be you. Giving yourself this emotional freedom will have a positive effect on your mental health.If you're struggling to allow yourself to express emotion, imagine yourself as a child. Think about how you were free to be yourself then, crying when you felt sad that a fun day had to end, or when you fell off your bike and scraped your knees. The events that make you cry as an adult will be different from those that made you burst into tears as a child, but you can still try to recapture that sense of emotional freedom.
It might also help to think about how you treat others when they cry. Do you tell them to stop, to hold it in? When your best friend feels overcome and starts crying, you probably give them a hug and encourage them to let it all out. Treating yourself with the same kindness, rather than self-censuring, could help you feel comfortable enough to cry.

, Most people who have trouble letting themselves cry prefer to experience their emotions alone, away from others. It can be easier to let yourself truly experience your feelings when you aren't worried about what someone else is thinking. There's certainly nothing wrong with crying in front of others, but you might find it more relaxing to be by yourself at first.


Your bedroom might be a good choice if it's a private, quiet place.
If your house has a lot of other people in it, try driving somewhere private so you can cry in the car. But make sure you feel well enough while driving there and back; crying while driving can be dangerous.
You can also cry in the shower - no one will hear you there.
Being outside might help you free up your mind to process emotions. Look for a private spot in the park or on the beach.

, Many people push their feelings aside and bury themselves in distractions to keep from crying. This technique is so effective that it can result in going months or years without crying. At the first sign of sadness, do you tend to turn on the TV and spend the evening laughing at your favorite show? Next time you start feeling down, resist that impulse and allow yourself to feel the emotion. It's the first step to having a good, hard cry.


There are many other types of distractions. You might stay late at work every night, spend all your time going out instead of being alone, or read articles online until you fall asleep. Think about what you tend to do when you're not in the mood to feel emotional, and make the decision to stop and focus on your emotions.

, Instead of letting your thoughts skip away to something less important, focus your mind on the emotions swirling around in your head. Just let yourself think through them instead of trying to push them away.


If you're sad, think hard about the event that brought about these feelings. Think about how much you wish it hadn't happened, what your life was like before, and what your life will be like from now on. Let yourself understand and feel the loss of what might have been.
No matter what strong emotion is causing you to want to cry, think it through and allow it to take a prominent spot in your brain. Observe how much it's stressing you out, and what a relief it would be if the problem would just go away.

, Are you starting to feel your throat tighten a little? Don't swallow and force yourself to stop thinking about what's making you sad. Instead, let your emotions overcome you. Keep thinking about what you wish hadn't happened. When the tears start to flow, don't resist them.


Once you really start crying, it'll probably be hard to stop. Keep crying until you've ""let it all out"" - you'll know when you're done.
The average length of a bout of crying is six minutes., When you're finished crying, think about how you feel. If you're like most people, you'll find that your brain feels a bit freer of the emotion that was bogging you down. You might not feel joyful right away, but you probably feel calmer, less anxious, and ready to take on your problems. Hold onto that feeling, and get into the habit of crying when you need to. It'll get easier with practice.


According to one study, 85% of women report feeling better after crying, while 73% of men do.If you don't feel good after crying, consider why. It can be hard to shake off years of being told that crying is weak, and so on. If you're embarrassed that you cried, try to remember that it's completely natural and healthy.

, This is a surefire way to get the tears flowing if you're sad about a particular person, your family, or how much life has changed. Go through an old photo album or pull up pictures online and allow yourself to gaze at each one for as long as you want. Remember the good times you had with the people in the pictures, or how much you loved a particular place.

, It can be very cathartic to watch a movie with a plot so sad it makes you cry. Even if the actors are in a situation completely different from yours, watching them go through sad times and cry themselves might help turn on your tears. When you do start crying during a movie, let your thoughts turn to your situation, so you can process your feelings about your own life. If you need suggestions for a sad movie to watch, try these:


Steel Magnolias
Stella Dallas
Breaking the Waves
Blue Valentine
Rudy
The Green Mile
Schindler's List
Inside Out
Titanic
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas
My Girl
Marley And Me
The Book Thief
Room
Romeo + Juliet
The Notebook
The Fault in Our Stars
The Giver
Up
Old Yeller
Where the Red Fern Grows

, The right music can be the perfect way to help your emotions loom larger in your brain. One of the best ways to use music to help you cry is to pick an album or song you listened to at a different time in your life, or one that reminds you strongly of someone who is gone. If there's no particular song or artist who fits the bill, try one of these extremely sad songs:

, Put a pen to paper and try to capture the essence of your feelings. You can start by writing down a description of the source of your emotions. Describe the ins and outs of your breakup, discuss the last few months of your father's illness, write about how you lost your job at the start of the recession. Then go deeper and write about how that event has changed your life, and what you're feeling as a result. Writing down memories is also a good way to bring yourself to the point of tears., It can really help to talk to someone else about what made you sad, angry, or overwhelmed. Discuss your feelings until you have nothing left to talk about or cry about.

Let yourself cry when the time is right.",How to Not Cry," You may feel the urge to cry in specific situations, like when confronting authority.Though that urge might feel like it is beyond your control, there is usually an identifiable cause. You may feel a range of emotions, such as:


SadnessFear
Anxiety
Joy
Frustration
Grief;
, Shedding tears will be related to the emotions you are feeling and the thoughts you are having at the time, even when they don’t seem immediately related. Consider the kinds of thoughts you are having when you feel like crying, and seek to find the connection.


For instance, if you feel the urge to cry in a happy situation, consider whether you think the situation is “too good to be true,” or is fleeting.If you feel the urge to cry when you are being evaluated (such as during a review at work), determine if your thoughts are causing you to feel judged harshly, singled out personally, inadequate, etc.

, Even in tense situations, you have some control over your thoughts and feelings. When you are communicating with someone and feel the urge to cry, consider what you are telling yourself as you listen to this person.For instance, if you are being evaluated at work and your manager suggests there are areas you could improve upon, are you telling yourself this means “I am terrible at my job,” or are you concentrating on forming a specific plan of action to move forward?
Similarly, if a friend is upset with you and you feel the urge to cry, ask yourself if you are telling yourself “My friend hates me,” or simply that “I have done something specific to hurt my friend, and I should not do this again.”

, By observing your internal feedback, you can determine if you are being self-critical; this is a common reason for feeling the urge to cry. Consider your thoughts and feelings when you are communicating with others (or thinking to yourself). Identify and stop self-criticism.Common forms of self-criticism include statements like “I’m too emotional,” “Men shouldn’t cry,” and “I’m a failure.”
Replace these criticisms with thoughts that are more self-compassionate, like “I worked really hard on that project, and I’m proud even if it didn’t quite succeed,” or “I really care about this issue, and I know my feelings are invested in it.”

, Some people do not know how to react when someone cries in front of them. However, you should be able to expect that someone understands that there is a reason when you cry, and that it doesn’t necessarily mean that you are being weak, inappropriate, unprofessional, etc.


When you cry and others seem unprepared or surprised, you should nevertheless expect them to show empathy by saying something like “I can see this is something really important to you,” or “I know you are upset.” If you cry in front of someone who doesn’t seem to know how to react, you don’t have to ignore it. You can try saying something like “You see, this is really important to me,” or “I’m upset because ….” This will help the person understand what is going on.

, Some people find that they can stop themselves from crying by pinching or poking their nose, arm, cheek, palm, etc.It is possible that the sensation of pain temporarily distracts you from the emotions or thoughts that are causing the urge to cry.

, Like pinching yourself, you can create a temporary distraction or sensation of slight pain by pushing your tongue against the roof of your mouth when you feel the urge to cry.

, Getting plenty of oxygen can boost your mood and increase your alertness. In addition, having a moment to pause can help your thoughts catch up to your feelings, and dispel the urge to cry.

, For instance, say you need to go to the restroom or get some air. A short break to take a walk or assess your feelings can buy you some time and stop the urge to cry.

, Sometimes, having something else to focus on can distract you from the urge to cry.For instance, if you have a stressful meeting with your boss and are afraid you might cry, take a notepad or other object with you. Focusing on this during the meeting can prevent tears.

, If you often feel like crying in certain situations, try imagining them in your head and playing out alternative situations.Repeatedly visualizing better outcomes in imaginary scenarios, in which you don’t cry, can help you handle an actual situation.


For instance, if you have a tendency to cry during family conflicts, imagine a situation in which you talk to your family while remaining composed and confident. If you can imagine how you will appear when you don’t cry, you’ll have a plan.
If you are trying to avoid crying when defending yourself, imagine situations in which you speak up. For instance, imagine meeting with your boss for an evaluation and saying “I appreciate your feedback on X issue. I’d like to offer my perspective on the same.”
If you are trying to avoid crying when speaking in public, imagine yourself on a stage confidently delivering your speech, presentation, etc. Then, when you actually have to speak in public, you will already have rehearsed a good outcome.

, If you feel like you have a serious problem controlling your emotions, don’t be afraid to seek help. Counselors are trained to help you understand your emotions and to develop techniques for understanding and controlling your feelings., Some medical conditions, like pseudobulbar affect and certain forms of depression, can cause outbursts of uncontrollable crying, or increase your likelihood of crying.If you often have the urge to cry, or can’t seem to stop when you do, you may want to see your doctor to determine if there is an underlying cause that needs to be treated.

, While scientists still don’t fully understand why humans cry, its clear that there is a relationship between crying and the expression of emotion.Crying can actually make the crier feel better, and cause others to feel sympathy and empathy, thereby forging connections between people.Remember that everyone has good reasons now and then to cry, and so you may not always need or want to stop.

, Having a good cry is an important way to release emotions, but if you do it a work or school, you may not end up feeling better afterward. Crying around colleagues or fellow students may attract attention that you don't want. While most people are understanding when you need to cry, some aren't, and you may not want to share such an intimate side of yourself with them. In addition, crying at work could be seen as unprofessional, especially if it happens during a meeting or another high-pressure moment.

, Crying can be a normal reaction to hurt feelings. While there's nothing wrong with crying in response to hurt or anger, it can signal to the other person that you aren't fully in control of your emotions. If you don't want to give them the satisfaction, try techniques to keep yourself from crying over things like a bad work review or a rude comment.

, Crying from fear is also normal, but there are times when you might not want to express yourself that way. For example, maybe you have a presentation to give, and your stage fright is so extreme that you fear you'll cry in front of the class. It's worth practicing distraction methods and other ways to keep yourself from crying until you're out of the spotlight.

, Crying is a valid way to release all sorts of emotions. Some situations may not be right for crying, but others absolutely are. Let yourself cry when you're with people who know you and support you. Let yourself cry at memorials, funerals, and other spaces where expressing emotions is encouraged. And of course, let yourself cry when you're alone. Sometimes the best time to cry is when you don't have to worry about how your tears will affect other people, and you can just focus on yourself.

Settle down.,
Wash your face.,
Drink some water.,
Treat redness.,
Treat swelling.,
Use eyewear.,
Let makeup help.,
Meet the world.",How to Disguise a Crying Jag Face," None of the rest of this is going to do you any good if you can't get hold of yourself now. At this point the slightest case of misty eyes will keep that swelling going. Take deep breaths and make yourself concentrate on something else. You can fall apart again when you're alone.;
, First thing you should do is wash your face with very cold water. Keep your eyes open while you splash. (If you have contact lenses, you should take them out for at least a few minutes.) This is calming, too, if you're having problems with step 1. Pat your face dry.

, It's healthy for you. It'll help get rid of your headache and replace the fluid you lost from all those tears.

, Visine (or any other eye drops that treat red eyes) is a must. Use a drop on your nose and lips, too, since it'll constrict the blood vessels.

, If you're really puffy, take ibuprofen (Advil) right away. It'll reduce the swelling and help the headache you probably have. Then make a cold compress--a frozen gel pack wrapped in a damp washcloth is ideal--and apply it to your eyes, nose, and lips. Keep it shifting; if you leave it too long in one place you'll only make it redder.

, If you wear contacts, now is the time to clean them and put them back in if you want to. If you have glasses as an alternative, however, opt for those. Thick-framed glasses especially distract from anything that's abnormal behind them. If you're a guy, this is your stop--go forth and be your stoic self. If you're a girl, move on to step 7.

, It's best not to go through your entire makeup routine. You're not going to a party (at least, you shouldn't -- you're in no shape for that). You're facing other human beings only briefly and out of necessity. The idea is to look like you weren't expecting to see anyone, and you have nothing to hide or worry about. You're perfectly fine!


Concealer: With the lightest shade you have, put a dot just below your lower lash line (i.e., the part that's probably plum purple). Blend it horizontally where you'd put eyeliner. If the rest of your under-eye region is discolored, touch that up with a slightly darker shade of concealer if you have it. Put a dab on the tip of your nose and on each side of the base, too.
Lashes: Put a light coat of mascara on your lower lashes. Curl your upper lashes firmly, but don't apply mascara there. This will keep your eyes looking natural and un-made-up, but will cause your eyes to look more open.
Lips: If your lips are still punched-in-the-mouth puffy and red, put a dab of nude lipstick on, or spread on a tiny dot of concealer and then apply lip balm.

, Put on a brave smile and eyeglasses if you have them. If your ex's friends spot you on the street, they'll carry back the message that you look to be doing fine without him!

, When you feel yourself getting worked up, take a few long, slow breaths. This forces your body to calm down and distracts you a little from whoever is yelling at you, which might be enough to avert a crying session., Look at something other than the person who’s yelling at you. Focus on your desk, your hands, or some other object in front of you. Breaking eye contact with the angry person will help you regain your composure., Get some distance from the person who’s yelling at you by taking a step backwards or scooting back in your chair. Taking control of your physical space can make you feel less helpless and cut back on your urge to cry., If you’re not going to be able to stop yourself from crying, step away from the situation. Make an excuse if you can, such as not feeling well. You can also just tell the person you’re getting too upset to keep talking to them. Go somewhere private to calm down.Say something like, “I’m getting too worked up to have a productive conversation with you. I need to step away for a minute, but we can keep talking later.”
The restroom is usually a safe place to escape to.
Taking a walk to clear your head is also a good option. Getting a little exercise will help you feel more in control of yourself.

, Dab cold water underneath your eyes to cut down on redness and puffiness. You can also use an ice cube wrapped in a napkin.If you’re at home and not in a hurry, wrap a bag of frozen peas in a kitchen towel and put it on your face, or rest cold green tea bags on your eyes.

, Use eye drops like Visine to get rid of any lingering eye redness. Put one or two drops in each eye.

Let people know you cry easily.,
Talk to the person who yelled at you.,
Think about why conflict makes you cry.,
Come up with some alternate strategies.,
Find healthy ways to cope with stress.,
Talk to a counselor.",How to Stop Crying when Someone Yells at You3," If you’re prone to tearing up all the time, do some preemptive damage control by telling your boss, coworkers, and friends. Emphasize that it’s not a big deal, and tell them about the best way to react if it happens.For example, you could say, “I tend to cry easily, so don’t worry if I get upset – that’s normal for me. I try to keep it under control, but if it happens, I just need a few minutes to calm down.”

, After you’ve calmed down, ask the person who yelled at you if they can talk to you privately. Address the problem and apologize if you did something wrong. Then tell them how their yelling made you feel, and politely ask them to talk to you more calmly in the future.Say something like, “I get pretty flustered when people shout at me, so it was hard for me to come up with a good solution to our problem earlier. Next time we run into an issue like this, can we talk about it when we’re both calm?”

, Ask yourself what you feel when someone yells at you. If you can identify where your tears are coming from, you might be able to figure out some alternate coping strategies.For instance, if you get overwhelmed by sheer adrenaline, you could squeeze a stress ball to release tension instead.
If being yelled at makes you feel small and inferior, you could try remembering that the other person is a human who makes mistakes too, and they might not even be in the right for yelling at you.

, Think about what you can do or say next time someone gets angry at you. Visualize yourself staying calm and collected as you use your new strategies.For example, if your boss tends to yell a lot, imagine saying something like, “I’m sorry you’re not happy with this, and I’ll work on finding a solution. In the meantime, though, I find it hard to focus on what you’re saying when you yell. Can we discuss this more calmly later?”

, If you are faced with chronic stress, you may be more likely to cry in tense situations. Getting your stress under control could stop this from happening as much. Think about some relaxing activities you can do on most days to keep stress at bay.For example, some healthy ways to deal with stress may include doing yoga, meditating, calling a friend, going for a walk outdoors, or listening to soothing music. Try these activities when you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

, If your crying is affecting your relationships or getting in the way of your work or school performance, it’s worth seeing a mental health professional to find out what’s going on. A counselor or therapist can help you discover why you cry so much and find ways to stop."

Be a good listener.,
Don't minimize her pain or tell her not to cry.,
Affirm her sadness.,
Use nonverbal comforting techniques.,
Assess whether physical contact is appropriate.,
Ask her what you can do to help.,

Take care of yourself.",How to Comfort a Crying Woman1," There can be an infinite number of reasons why a woman might be crying. Perhaps she is grieving, stressed out, ill, or overwhelmed by joy. Before proceeding further, try to get a handle on what the situation might be and whether it is appropriate for you to try to comfort her. Some reasons why you might not be the right person to comfort her would be:


If you are affected by the same situation that is upsetting her. If you are shaken up, disturbed, or hurt by the situation that made her cry, you might not be in a good position to help her. If this is the case, you might want to seek out a support network who can help both you and her cope with whatever is going on. If she is crying from joy. Scientists aren't exactly sure why, but someone who is overcome with happiness might cry uncontrollably, just like someone who is scared or sad. In cases like these, congratulating your friend or lover might be more appropriate than trying to comfort her!
If she is crying because you two had a fight. Before stepping in to comfort her, you might want to calm down by yourselves for a while to make that the argument doesn't start back up again.;
, Unless there is a very good reason for you not to comfort her, you should make an effort to help the crying woman. Ignoring someone who is crying can be quite harmful to her emotional well-being. And choosing to comfort someone will allow her to recover more quickly from her tears and will also make your relationship stronger. , This cannot be stressed enough. Tears are an important form of communication, and you should pay attention to what she is trying to say. Use active listening techniques, such as verbally affirming what the crying person is saying and avoiding interrupting them.


Be especially careful not to turn the conversation back to yourself: this is about her. Don’t make it about you. Even if she’s not behaving in the way you would, that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t deserve comfort, or that she deserves to be sad. Avoid phrases such as, ""If I were in your shoes,"" ""Have you tried . . .,"" or ""When that happened to me, I didn't make such a big deal out of it.""

, Tears can often be a good or positive action, even if they were caused by something painful. Crying can bring physical as well as emotional relief to someone who is sad or stressed. Bottling up emotions can prevent the healing from taking place. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, let her cry as much as she needs to. She will likely feel better for doing so.


In general, avoid any commands, negative language, or imperatives. Stay away from phrases such as, ""Don't cry,"" ""You shouldn't be sad,"" or ""That doesn't sound too bad.""
People who are crying because of a mental illness such as severe anxiety or depression might actually feel worse, not better, after crying.If you think she might be crying because of a mental illness, you should still offer comfort and support, but you should also suggest that she see a doctor so that she can get the necessary treatment. , Show her that you understand her pain by acknowledging that her pain is legitimate and that you sympathize with her pain. Use phrases like:


""That sucks... I'm really sorry that happened!""
""I understand that this must be very painful.""
""That sounds very frustrating. I'm sorry.""
""No wonder you are upset. This sounds like a very difficult situation.""
""I'm so sorry that happened to you.""

, A crying person might recognize comfort more readily from nonverbal comforting cues than from verbal communication. Nodding, using appropriate facial expressions, making eye contact, and leaning forward can help her know that you are concerned and that you care. While offering a tissue can sometimes be interpreted as a caring gesture, it might also send the signal that you want the crying to stop. Only provide a tissue if the crying person asks for one or seems to be looking around for one.

, Some people are comforted by touch, and others are made more anxious by it. You can offer a hug if you know that she responds well to hugging. Hugs can even help relieve stress over time. Other kinds of appropriate touch might be holding her hand, touching her shoulder, stroking her hair, or kissing her forehead. Use your best judgment based on what you know about her preferences and the boundaries of your relationship, and always follow her lead. Be sure to back off if she asks you to.


You can also observe her body language to determine whether she might be open to comforting touch. Defensive body language such as clenched fists, crossed arms and legs, or avoiding eye contact might mean that she would rather you backed off a little bit. , Let her be the one to guide you in this. It’s easy to get caught up in trying to fix things the way that you think is best. However, she may not want help or may need something other than what you think she needs. The last thing you want to do is to make a situation worse. Resist the urge to problem-solve something when what you should be doing is helping her process her pain and grief. Let her know that you’re here to help her, but don’t force it. Her idea of help may be simply having someone to talk to. Often listening is the best way to help comfort someone. Ask open-ended questions about whether you can help her out. For example, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" or ""I'd really like to help--can you think of anything that might make your situation better?"" might be good ways to start a conversation about how you can lend a hand.
Sometimes someone who is upset is too overwhelmed to suggest ways for you to help her. If this is the case, try providing a list of a few specific things you might be able to do to comfort her. For example, you might ask if she might like to go out for ice cream, or if she would like for you to stop by later with a movie you could watch together. See if she responds positively to any of those comforting suggestions. , While trying to problem-solve shouldn't be your first instinct, it is possible that there are some tangible, specific things you can do to help relieve her pain. If it is possible for you to remove her troubles--and if she seems to want you to--then you can offer to step in in some way.


For example, if she is crying because she is stressed out from work, you might offer to do some extra chores around the house to give her more time to focus on her job. If she is crying because she had a fight with a friend, you might discuss ways for her to repair that relationship.

, In the next few days or weeks after the crying incident, check in occasionally on her to make sure she’s still doing okay. Don’t be too invasive about it, but asking her out for coffee, asking her how she’s doing, or calling a bit more often could be very helpful. It is possible that she will recover quickly, but she might also need some extra time to get over her sadness. Showing your support over that time will help a lot.

, Empathy is important, but it might also cause you to be upset or depressed. Remember to take care of yourself too, and reach out to others if you need help!.

Sit down by yourself and think over what's been going on in your life.,
Pick a time/place where you feel comfortable crying.,
Make sure you are alone.,
Turn down the lights, close the blinds, cover yourself with a blanket, or put a pillow (gently) over your face.,
Don't think degrading or rude thoughts about yourself.,
Give yourself time to clean up.,
Allow yourself as much time as you need, so plan ahead.",How to Allow Yourself Time to Cry," Making sure you come to terms with what is upsetting you can help you center in why you are grieving.;
, Places like your room, the bathroom, or other places that you feel comfortable with can help you unwind and feel less insecure and uncomfortable when you feel like crying.

, Try not to be around others; school would be a place you shouldn't (but can, of course) cry in because you are with your peers, or other people who may take advantage of you in your time of weakness.

, Sometimes people feel more comfortable crying when it is darker and harder for others to intrude on their personal moment. Some people feel better burying themselves in a blanket or sheet so that they feel more isolated.

, It's okay to think about whatever you feel like crying about, but do not think mean thoughts about yourself. Do not think things like ""I'm so worthless"" or ""I'm weak, I can't believe I'm crying"" or ""I deserved to be treated/spoken to that way. It's my fault."" Hurting yourself with such things will only make you feel worse; remember, you're crying to release bad emotions, not create new ones!

, Chances are, you don't want others knowing that you were crying, so give yourself time to wipe your tears away and catch your breath. When you feel ready to leave your ""place of sanctuary"" walk and talk as you normally would; if you don't want other to know you've been crying, try to keep your behavior as normal as possible.


Putting a cold water bottle under your eyes can help if you're feeling pain or the area is slightly swollen. Also, do not rub your eyes with your hand; wipe them gently with a soft fabric, to make sure there is no extra redness (and you don't want to irritate or scratch your eyes.)

, This may sound strange to you, but making sure you have enough time to cry and clean up will minimize complications (your siblings walking in, or your parents calling you to do something, to name a couple.) If you need an hour or just five minutes, make sure nothing will get in the way of your grieving.

, When you are having a conversation with someone and you feel tears coming on, look away for a minute. Find a spot on the wall to focus on, or look at your hands intently. Remove yourself from the situation momentarily (just one minute will do) to give yourself space to gather your thoughts., Put some literal distance between you and the situation or person making you cry. Taking a step backward can give you a bit of personal space in which to gather your thoughts (and tears)., Remove yourself physically from the situation that’s making you cry and take a walk. Focus on moving your arms and legs, and try to regularize your breathing.If you want to stop crying, don’t retreat to the bathroom. You might cry more there.

, Grab a magazine or watch a funny video. Pull yourself away from the immediate feelings that are making tears well up. Deliberately focus on the concrete details of what you’re reading or watching, and comment on details to yourself, such as, “That is a gorgeous dress,” or “I can’t believe that cat jumped so high.”"

In many cases, the important part is just being there. Your physical presence and time is often most appreciated in difficult times.Stay with the person and let them know you’re there for them and supporting them.;
, If the person starts crying in public, offer to go somewhere more private. This can help with any embarrassment they feel. Go to a bathroom, car, or empty room. Being somewhere private can help them feel safe and able to work through whatever emotions they feel.


If they seem uncomfortable, ask, “Would you like to go somewhere more private?”

, If you have a tissue or know where to get one, offer to grab one for them. Crying leads to wet faces and wet noses, and offering a tissue is a sign that you want to help. If there are no tissues nearby, offer to get one for them.


You can say, “Would you like me to get you a tissue?”

, It’s never helpful to tell someone to stop crying or that whatever they are crying about isn’t worth their tears. If someone is crying, let them cry. They are sharing a vulnerable moment with you, so allow them to express what needs to be expressed without telling them how to feel.


You might feel awkward or uncomfortable around someone who’s crying. Remember that your role is to offer support in a way that’s helpful to them, and the focus is ultimately not on you.

, They might want you to stay and listen or they may want some space and alone time. Don’t assume you know what they want because you don’t. Asking what they want and need puts the other person in control and gives you the opportunity to listen and respond. Whatever they ask for or need, respect what they say.Ask, “What can I do to help?” or “How can I support you?”

, You shouldn’t feel like you’re in a rush or need to go do something. Part of being supportive is being there and giving your time for the person. If you’re there to comfort them, give them the time that they need. Your presence alone can be comforting, so sticking around and making sure they are capable of getting on with their day or getting further help can be what they need most.


Don’t stop for a few moments then get on with your day. Stay with them and let them know you will stay if they need you.

, If you know your friend likes hugs, give them a hug. However, if they tend to be more physically reserved, you may wish to pat them on the back or perhaps not touch them at all. If you’re helping a stranger, it’s best to ask if they want physical touch. If you’re in doubt, ask if they’d like a hug or for you to hold them., The person may be in shock or not want to talk. If they don’t seem willing or wanting to open up, don’t force it. If you’re stumbling to come up with something to say, don’t feel like you have to say anything profound. Just being there and saying (or implying), “I’m here to support you” is often enough.


You might comfort someone who never tells you what’s upsetting them. That’s okay.

, Turn up your listening skills and be willing to give your full attention to them. If you ask them what’s wrong and they don’t respond, don’t keep asking. Accept whatever they say and focus on supportively listening.Give them your full attention and pay attention to what they say and how they say it.


Improve your listening by making eye contact and responding nonjudgmentally.

, You might think that saying, “I just went through something like that” will be helpful and foster a connection, but really, it puts the focus on you and not them. Keep the conversation about them. If they’re talking about what’s making them cry, let them talk and don’t interrupt them.You might really want to relate to them or talk about something in your life, but resist the urge to do so unless they ask. Your role is to help and comfort them.

, If the person is crying and upset about a situation, don’t try to immediately solve the problem for them. It’s more important for you to do less talking and more listening. The person may not even mention what’s wrong, and that’s okay. It’s not your role to solve their problems.Their crying is not a way to solve their problem, it’s a way to express their emotions. Let them do so without interfering.

, If this person is having problems coping with their emotions and their tears, it may be time to see a therapist. Their problems may overwhelm you or you might think that what they’re going through might be best handled by a therapist. Be gentle in your recommendation, but let them know it might be a good idea.For example, try saying, “It sounds like what you’re going through is really difficult. Have you thought about talking to a therapist?”

Focus on your breathing.,
Move your eyes to control your tears.,
Distract yourself with a physical movement.,
Relax your facial expression.,
Remove the lump in your throat.",How to Stop Yourself from Crying1," Crying is a reaction caused by a heightened state of emotions and the relaxing effects of breathing can help you to stop yourself from crying.Perhaps you’ve just thought of a sad memory, you’ve been broken up with, or something tragic has happened in your life. Calming yourself is a big part of stopping yourself from crying. Focusing on breathing, as in meditation, can help you to control the emotions you are feeling and help you to restore a sense of inner peace.When you feel the tears coming, breathing in slowly and deeply through your nose, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Doing this will both relax the lump that forms in your throat when you are on the verge of tears, and will stabilize your thoughts and emotions.
Try counting to 10. Breathe in through your nose when you count a number. Exhale through your mouth when you are between numbers. Counting helps you to focus solely on your breath and not whatever is making you want to cry.
Even taking just one deep breath can steady you when you are faced with something that makes you want to cry. Draw one deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then let it back out. In that moment, focus only on the air going in and out of your lungs. Taking this deep breath will also give you a moment to pause before you have to deal with the cause of your sadness.;
, If you are in a situation that is making you want to cry, but you don’t want to show your emotions to others, moving your eyes can help you to control those tears. Some research has actually shown that blinking may help stop the flow of tears.Blink a few times to clear your eyes of any tears.


Cross your eyes or roll them several times. Of course, you may only want to do this when you know that no one is looking at you. Aside from mentally distracting yourself (you have to focus to cross your eyes) it will also physically keep the tears from forming.
Close your eyes. Closing your eyes gives you a moment to process what is happening. Closing your eyes paired with taking several deep breaths will help you to calm down and focus on not crying.

, When you are on the verge of tears, it is important to get your mind onto other things. Physically distracting yourself is one way to keep yourself from crying.Squeeze your upper thighs or squeeze your hands together. The pressure should be enough to distract you from the reason why you feel like crying.
Find something else to squeeze, whether it is a stress toy, a pillow, a part of your shirt, or a loved one’s hand.
Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth or up against your teeth.

, Furrowing your brow and frowning may make it more likely that you will start crying because our facial expressions can affect our emotions. To help stop yourself from crying, try to adopt a neutral facial expression in any situation where you feel like you are going to cry. Relax your brow and the muscles around your mouth so that you are not wearing a look of concern or distress.


If it is appropriate or you can get away for a few minutes, try smiling to stop yourself from crying. Some studies have shown that smiling can alter your mood in a positive way even if you don’t feel like smiling., One of the hardest parts of trying to hold in your tears is getting rid of the lump in your throat that forms when something makes you want to cry. When your body registers that you are under stress, one of the ways the autonomic nervous system reacts is to open up the glottis, which is the muscle control the opening from the back of the throat to the voice box. When the glottis is opened, it makes it feel like there is a lump in your throat when you try to swallow.Take a sip of water to release the tension caused by the glottis being opened up. Sipping water will relax your throat muscles (and calm your nerves.)
If you don’t have water on hand, breath steadily and swallow slowly several times. Breathing will help you relax, and swallowing slowly will help tell your body that it doesn’t need to keep the glottis open.
Yawn. Yawning helps to relax your throat muscles, which means that it helps ease the tightness you feel in your throat when you glottis is opened.

Show empathy.,
Allow her to cry.,
Demonstrate that you are available to talk to.,
Listen to her actively.,
Be empathetic, but professional.,
Offer assistance with work-related matters.",How to Comfort a Crying Woman2," In general, people prefer to cry in front of people they're close to--not in front of strangers, coworkers, or acquaintances. If you're not close to her but she is still crying in front of you, she is probably quite distressed indeed and in need of some sympathy. It is especially important for you to react with empathy and not with annoyance, panic, or fear. , If she does in fact want you around, let her cry. Don’t try to force her to stop crying or suggest that she ""buck up."" Crying is natural and healthy, and can help relieve stress and pain. Remember that there is nothing unprofessional about tears at work. Most people cry sometimes, so crying at work is bound to happen at one time or another. Tell her reassuring things if she seems embarrassed, such as ""It is okay to cry,"" or ""There's nothing embarrassing about crying--we're all human!""

, Because she doesn't know you well, she might not want to go into too much detail with you. But perhaps you could be a helpful listening ear. Ask questions and use open body language to show that you are willing to listen if she likes. For example, you could say:


""I know I'm your colleague, but I'm also happy to be your friend if you need someone to talk to. Do you want to talk?""
""My door is always open if you need to talk about something difficult.""
""Is there something I can help you with? Even if it's not about work, I am happy to listen.""

, If she decides to talk to you about her troubles, use active listening techniques to show that you are paying attention. These include: not interrupting or providing suggestions, asking questions only to affirm that you understand what she is saying, making eye contact, and avoiding distractions. , You should act like a human being and show that you care but you also don't want to overstep any boundaries with a coworker. After all, your work relationship will have to continue even after this incident.


For example, you might not want to offer a hug unless she asks for one. If you want to call her outside of work to check up on her, you should ask whether she would be comfortable with that.

, Perhaps your coworker is crying because of work stress, or perhaps there is a personal matter that is affecting her ability to focus on work. In either case, if you are in a position to help her professionally, you might help her find solutions.For example, she might need to take some time off, or you might help her make a plan to get through a difficult professional task.
Only take action if she wants your action, however. It’s easy to get caught up in trying to fix things the way that you think is best. However, she may not want help or may need something other than what you think she needs. The last thing you want to do is to make a situation worse.
Don't try to step in about personal matters too much. Don’t feel like you need to solve personal problems of a co-worker. Also, if you don’t know her very well, do not presume that you know how to solve her problems. Be there to comfort her and listen, and focus on workplace issues.
If you see no way that you are able to help her fix the problem, then apologize and tell her that you cannot help her fix the problem. If you know anyone whom you think can help her fix the problem, recommend that she talk to them and enlist their help.

Give a smile.,
Keep a neutral expression on your face.,
Shift your emotion to anger.,
Be prepared with something to say.",How to Control Crying2," Forcing yourself to smile when you feel the opposite will help you overcome negative feelings.Your mood will lift and stress will be reduced even if you fake a smile,as your body tricks your mind into thinking you are happy.

, Relax your crumpled up forehead and tensed mouth and cheeks. By installing a neutral expression on your face, you are forcing your body out of the immediate crying mode., Many times, you might start crying because you are trying to hold in your true emotions. It’s often not considered appropriate to get angry during a conflict, and crying can come because adrenaline is flowing and you’ve stuffed down your anger. Allow yourself to identify angry feelings and announce them.Often, women don’t feel like they are allowed to get angry at the risk of being labeled a *****. Skip this feeling and give yourself permission to get angry.You don’t have to be aggressively angry to show that you’re angry. Even saying something like, “I’m angry that I haven’t had a chance to participate fully,” can help you name your feelings and keep from crying.

, Have a response in mind for certain types of situations. If you seem to cry easily when you receive criticism from your boss, for example, think about ways to respond verbally to this feedback. Being prepared with something to say, even with a canned response, can help steer you away from crying."

Pinch yourself.,
Alternately, try biting the inside of your cheek.,
Pinch the bridge of your nose.,
Widen your eyes and look up.,
Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth.,
Try swallowing.",How to Control Crying3," Distract yourself away from your oncoming tears by causing a very small amount of physical discomfort to your body. Pinch your arm to redirect your mind from your tears., Try to be gentle so that you don’t draw blood. You can also press your fingernails into the palm of your hand.

, Squeeze your thumb and forefinger on the bridge of your nose, right near your eyes. This will slow down your tear ducts from producing tears., Open up your eyes really wide, which can help dry them out. Looking up while you do this will help any forming tears sink back away from the rims of your eyes.

, Tightening your mouth muscles and focusing on pressing your tongue upwards can help stop you from tearing up.

, Swallowing will help constrict the muscles in your throat. Crying helps open the muscles, so if you can do the opposite, you may be able to restrict the crying response., Taking a drink of water can also achieve the same effect.

Get some exercise.,
Eat nutrient-rich foods.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Control Crying4," Try going for a jog or a bike ride to pull yourself out of the situation that’s making you cry. Exercising will increase oxygen flow to the brain and will release endorphins that will calm you down.

, Feed your body with good foods in order to give yourself energy and strength to fight off negative feelings. Eat proteins and cut down on refined sugars and refined carbohydrates.Eat a good breakfast every morning. This will help stabilize your blood sugar and your mood.
Increase your intake of folic acid, which can be found in leafy green vegetables.

, If you are tired, you are often not able to handle strong feelings as well. Being short on sleep will make it more difficult to hold back the tears. Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep in order to smooth out your nerves.

Talk with a counselor.,
Talk with a trusted friend or family member.,
Keep a journal.,
Try acupressure.",How to Control Crying5," Seeking professional help can give you an important outlet for understanding why you’re crying in certain situations. A counselor might be able to help you figure out how to communicate more effectively so that you don’t end up crying so often. This person might also help you get to the root of why you feel like crying., Confide in someone you trust by talking about some of the issues that cause you to cry. Whether it’s work conflict or a relationship problem, it can help to talk through the problem so that you gain some perspective.

, Writing down your thoughts in a journal can be therapeutic and can allow you to announce and explore feelings that you’re experiencing. This is a good way to work through stressors in your life and to strategize ways to control unwanted crying., Acupressure is a traditional Chinese healing method that involves pressing on different parts of your body to achieve relief and healing of certain health symptoms. Try some of the acupressure techniques associated with relieving anxiety, which is often the source of unwanted crying.


Press the spot right in between your eyebrows. Apply pressure to this spot for 1-3 minutes.Press on your inner wrist. Lay three fingers on your wrist, with your ring finger on the crease of your wrist. Feel for the space between the two tendons on your wrist just underneath your index finger. Apply pressure here to feel relief from anxiety and crying.
Pinch the webbing in between your thumb and index finger."

Let yourself cry.,
Examine why you want to cry or are crying.,
Write in a journal or diary.,
Talk to someone.,
Distract yourself with things you love.",How to Stop Yourself from Crying2," Sometimes you just have to let it out and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Crying is a completely natural thing that everyone--really everyone--does. Even if you keep yourself from crying in the moment, you will need to let yourself feel sad at some point. Find a quiet place where you can be alone and let yourself have a good, long cry.


Allowing yourself to cry may even benefit your mental and physical health. Crying can help your body to release toxins. After a good cry you may also find that you feel happier and less stressed., Taking time to think about what is making you cry or feel like crying is important. Once you find the reason behind your tears, you will be able to analyze it more fully and come up with a solution or a way to make yourself feel better. Think about what is happening that is making you feel like crying. Is there a specific person or situation that is making you feel this way? Has something recently happened that is making you feel sad? Or is there another reason that you keep finding yourself fighting off tears?If you cannot determine the cause of your tears on your own, consider speaking with a therapist for help. If you cry a lot or often feel like crying, you may be depressed and need to be treated for depression., Writing your thoughts down will help you to sort them out and feel better. Journaling can also help you to deal with stress, anxiety, and depression. For best results, set aside a few minutes every day to write about your thoughts and feelings. You can structure your journal any way that you like and write about whatever you want.If a specific person has made you want to cry, try writing them a letter. Writing down what you feel can often be easier than saying your thoughts out loud. Even if you don’t give the person the letter, you will feel better after having expressed what you have been feeling and thinking.

, After you have let yourself cry, you should talk to someone about what you are experiencing. Talk to a close friend, family member, or therapist about whatever is making you want to cry. As the saying goes, two heads are better than one, and the person you talk to will help you resolve the challenges you are facing.


Talking to someone will also allow you to feel like you are not alone in the situation. If you feel like you are carrying around the weight of the world, talk to someone and let them help you sort out what you are thinking and feeling.
Talking therapy is very beneficial for people who are dealing with depression, anxiety, loss, health problems, relationship problems, and more. Consider speaking to a therapist if you continue to have trouble with crying or if you have problems that you want to discuss with someone in a safe, confidential environment., Taking time to enjoy your hobbies can help you to gain a new perspective during a difficult time.Set aside time every week to enjoy one of your hobbies. Even if you feel like you will never be able to fully engage in the world around you because you are so sad, you will soon find that you are actually having fun and laughing.


Surround yourself with people that make you happy. Do fun things that you like to do like going hiking, painting, etc. Go to a party and meet new people, or dress up with your friends and throw your own party. Immerse yourself in activities--filling up your time is a great way to distract yourself from feeling sad.

"
"
Think of something else that you can focus on.,
Think of something funny.,
Remind yourself that you are a strong individual.,
Distract yourself by engaging in something else.",How to Stop Yourself from Crying3," Sometimes you can stop the flow of tears by redirecting your attention onto something else. For example, you could change your focus by doing some simple math problems in your head. Add up small numbers or go over the times table in your head will distract your from what is making you feel upset and help you calm down.Alternatively, you could try to think of the lyrics to your favorite song. Remembering the words and singing the song in your head will take your mind off whatever is bothering you. Try to imagine the words to a happy song so you give yourself a mental pick-me-up.

, While it may seem hard to do in the face of whatever is making you want to cry, thinking of something funny can really help you overcome your tears. Think of something that has made you laugh really hard in the past--a funny memory, a scene from a movie, or a joke you heard once.Try to smile when thinking of this funny thing.

, Giving yourself a mental pep-talk when you feel like you are on the verge of tears can help you overcome your desire to cry. Tell yourself that it is okay to feel sad, but that you cannot feel sad right now. Remind yourself of the reasons you cannot cry at that moment--you don’t want to cry in front of people you don’t know, or you want to be strong for someone else, etc. Tell yourself that you will let yourself feel sad, but that you need to hold it together for that moment.


Remember that you are a great person, who has friends and family who love you. Think of what you have achieved in your life, as well as what you hope to achieve in the future. But if you do that it will make you cry more!!
Research has shown that using positive self-talk has many health benefits beyond easing distress. It can also expand your life, enhance your immunity to the common cold, reduce your chances of developing depression, improve your ability to deal with difficult situations, and reduce your chances of dying from a heart attack., The worst thing you could do would be to dwell upon whatever is making you want to cry, especially when you want to keep yourself from crying. Distracting yourself is a temporary way to keep yourself from crying--but know that at some point you will have to face whatever is bothering you.


Put on a movie that you have been wanting to watch (or an old classic that you really love.) If movies aren’t your thing, grab your favorite book or put on an episode of your favorite TV show.
Go for a walk to clear your head. Often, being in nature is a great way to distract yourself--invest yourself fully in appreciating the beauty around you and try to avoid thinking of whatever is making you sad.
Exercise. Exercising releases endorphins and will make you feel better when you are feeling sad. Exercising also makes you focus on what you are doing, rather than how you are feeling."
"
Blame your tears on something else.,
Dry your tears discreetly.,
Remove yourself from the situation.",How to Stop Yourself from Crying4," While people around you may see through your white lie, telling it may still help to calm you down.


Say you have been having really bad allergies. This is a classic excuse for having tears in your eyes--allergies make your eyes watery and red.
Yawn and then say something like, “yawning always makes my eyes water.”
Say you think you are getting sick. Often, when people get sick their eyes become glassy. Saying you feel sick also gives you a good excuse to leave the setting you are in.

, If you can’t help but shed a few tears, wiping them away discreetly is the next best thing to keeping yourself from crying.


Pretend that you're trying to get something out of the corner of your eye, then wipe along the bottom and wipe the tears off the edge. Pressing your index finger lightly into the inside corner of your eye will also help to dab away the tears.
Pretend you’re sneezing and put your face into the inside of your elbow (so that you can wipe your tears on your arm). If you can’t fake sneeze, just say ""false alarm.""

, If you are caught up in a negative situation that is making you want to cry, get out of it. This does not necessarily mean storming out of the room. If something is upsetting you, make an excuse to leave the room for a few moments. Taking a step back from whatever is causing you to want to cry will help you to feel better and control your tears.By taking a step back, you are distancing yourself both physically and mentally from the problem.


As you take a step back, breathe in deeply and then exhale just as deeply. You will find that you will feel less inclined to cry.

Spend time with loved ones.",How to Survive Domestic Violence," If you're in danger, get out of the house and get to a safe location. If you're in immediate danger, call the authorities now, or contact a domestic abuse center in your area.To find one locally in the United States, call the Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)


Depending on your physical, mental, or emotional state, you may wish to go to the hospital or a safe house for people who have survived domestic abuse, to assess the situation and plan your next steps. The location of a safe house is kept a secret, and they may be able to send a car to pick you up if you can't make it there yourself. They provide food, donated clothing, shelter, a bed to sleep in, and services to help you get reestablished, such as obtaining welfare and setting up housing, and have counseling services available.
You might also elect to go immediately to the local police station, the home of a trusted friend or relative, or to any open, safe, public place like as a shopping mall, big box store, or restaurant. Be sure not to tell your abuser where you are going or they may follow you.If you have no transportation, find somewhere safe to hide in the neighborhood. Go to a neighbor's house, climb a tree, hide behind the garbage cans, hunker down in a ditch. Do whatever you need to to protect yourself the best you can.;
, Although it is a myth that victims are the ones provoking domestic violence in the first place, if your abuser is being confrontational, try to avoid fighting back.Use your best judgment here, but it may be best to give in temporarily to avoid a more serious violent counterattack. Try to stay under the radar until you can make a plan to leave for good.


For example, if your abuser hit you and said that you didn't do the laundry correctly, just try your best to do what either he or she wants, rather than try to take a stand on this particular issue. Instead, focus your energy on staying safe and setting a plan in motion to get out for good.

, Hide this in a bag or purse and know where it is in the house at all times. If things get out of hand, spray and run for safety. Don't look back or second-guess your decision. Remind yourself that protecting yourself and your children (if applicable) is the number one priority.Practice how to use the pepper spray so you know what to do right away if you ever need it for real.

, It is often difficult to leave an abusive relationship. The situation may be complicated by custody of children, finances, religion, family, and other cultural considerations. But the first thing to do is plot your escape and cover your tracks, then worry about these complications later.The one caveat though is to always be sure to ensure the safety of your children before escaping from the relationship.
Don't let your partner know that you're planning on leaving and don't wait for the worst to happen before you leave. Any legal issues arising from your departure may be settled after you have sought help from Domestic Violence networks and the police.
Leaving your partner doesn't necessarily mean that you don't love them, or that you've given up on someone who may need help with substance abuse issues, a personality disorder, or other mental health issues. But again, your physical safety is your priority. You can always settle complicated matters afterward.

, If you have kids, be sure to have a safety plan in place for them. This includes several important steps that can help to keep your kids safe in a domestic abuse situation :


Teach your kids how to dial the emergency number and explain to them when they should do so (i.e., when they feel threatened or when you are being attacked by your abuser).
Make arrangements with a neighbor who is home a lot for your kids to leave and stay with your neighbor if the situation escalates.
Make sure whoever your children stay with in emergency situations knows that under no circumstances is this person to hand your children over to your abuser.In the event that your children can't escape (e.g., if your abusive partner is blocking the door to outside), have a place they know about where they can hide until things settle down. This might be under a bed or in a closet, anywhere that they are out of sight and farthest from any potential weapons that might be lying about (e.g., don't make the spot somewhere in the kitchen where there are knives).

, Try to secure a PO Box and a safe deposit box, in which you can stash money away from the home, not in an account with your name on it where your abuser might be able to access it. Don't tell anyone about your plan to leave in advance unless they are a domestic violence counselor, a therapist, or a long time friend who has no ties to your abuser and is aware not to reveal any information about you to them.

, To help prosecute and end your abuser's ability to harm, it's important to take the steps necessary to secure a conviction. Make certain you have a small tape recorder with you at all times. Buy it from a ""surveillance"" shop and learn how to use it from the sales staff. Turn it on whenever you have a gut feeling of mood swing from the person. Keep batteries fresh. Be sure also to take photos of your injuries and of objects broken during violent outbursts.Place copies of legal/financial documents in your safe deposit box. Do the same for any evidence you have of abuse: photos, diary, letters of apology from your abuser.

, Find a small bag you can pack with everything you'll need for a few nights, just the essentials, and keep it in an easy-to-access place, so that you'll be able to grab it and leave at a moment's notice. It shouldn't look like a suitcase to your abuser: an inexpensive small bag will do. Pack several days of clothing, medications, enough money to cover the cost of a motel for a few nights, a cell phone, and important phone numbers and addresses.If you have children, or a pet, it's essential that you pack for them as well. Keep all packed belongings as portable and light as possible. Again, if you haven't taken the time to do this, don't wait and waste valuable time. Leave immediately and worry about the details later. Head to a domestic abuse shelter near you and they can help you sort getting your belongings once you are safe.
If you have children, it might be better, depending on your specific situation, to put them in a secure situation before leaving. Consider leaving them with friends or relatives if you have that option and if your abuser won't check there.

, Know exactly what ways you can leave from your house. Can you fit through the bathroom window? How many seconds does it take you to unlock the front door? Make sure you are prepared to leave quickly in situations where there is an immediate threat of violence.Be sure to practice these leaving strategies when your abuser is not around.

, Choose an opportune moment to leave and then leave. Don't decide to have a big confrontation and risk more abuse. If you can, leave quietly and write a note to your abuser letting them know that you have left for good. Make sure you have all your needed belongings such as your social security number, needed medications, birth certificates of all family members, school and vaccination records for your children, your house and car keys and lease or rental agreement, your passport or work or study permit if in a foreign country, and anything else you think of that you deem a necessity. If you are feeling guilty about leaving in the night, remember that your abuser is causing you significant amounts of physical and emotional pain and there is absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.

, As soon as you secure your physical security and the security of your children (if applicable), it's important that you speak with the authorities and move forward with ensuring that your abuse will end.Consider finding an attorney you trust to tell your story to and get legal advice on how to move forward with pressing charges.


Make contact and meet with domestic violence counselors, making certain they keep your record of consulting them in their files. Ask for a copy to place with your other documents. Domestic violence specialists may be able to help secure you new lodging, even if you've got a spotty rent history or employment record.

, Once you break free, don't go back, attempt to contact, or reconcile with your partner. Let your abuser get the message with the restraining order paperwork. Don't try to reason with your abuser as it very likely will not work.Although the details will vary by country and county, in general, to file a restraining order, you should go to a family courthouse and request the necessary paperwork.To find a courthouse you can visit, see: www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/Court_Addresses/

Decide whether your case requires urgent attention or not. If you are in serious threat of physical danger, or otherwise deem that you need a restraining order right away, you can apply for a motion, which essentially means the courts may issue you a restraining order right away (as opposed to the normal process of a few weeks).If you can, get the help of a lawyer as you navigate this process. Your lawyer can send someone to serve the documents to your abuser. Serving the documents is required; in other words, the courts must be sure that abuser was given notification about the restraining order. If you cannot obtain a lawyer, the courts may be able to provide a member of staff who can serve the documents for you.You will then need to file for proof that the documents have been served.
Go to court whenever you are required; you may be asked to go to court more than once, just follow the instructions provided by the courthouse and be sure not to miss your appointment(s)!, Abusers are physically and emotionally manipulative, and getting out effectively means that you have to cut all ties and start ignoring your abuser at once. Don't entertain apologies, promises, or ultimatums to change.


Your abuser may threaten you and attempt to have you return to the home. Cut all communication and make sure that they don't know where you are. Your physical safety is your only priority. If your abuser makes threats over text or email, be sure to save this as evidence in case you need it for legal reasons. If your abuser is holding your child or financial resources so you can't leave, you can always settle custody or joint banking accounts during legal proceedings. Do not get intimidated by your abuser.

, Talk to a licensed mental health professional. Domestic violence is not a simple life challenge to live through. Often, there are many reasons why people find themselves in domestic violence situations, many of them stemming from childhood. The way to arrest the cycle of abuse is to get professional help right away. Seek out or ask your therapist to help you find a local domestic violence support group and attend as soon as possible to begin the process of healing.To find a psychologist in your area, visit: http://locator.apa.org/

Finding support can help you heal emotionally and plan ahead for your future. Both of these are very important for building up your happiness and self-worth.Surround yourself with positive influences, making new supportive friends, and spending time building yourself back up in the company of people who have your best interests at heart.

, Tell yourself, even if you do not believe it at the moment, that you are important. Stop believing what your abuser has been telling you about yourself. You are worthy, you do have rights, and your happiness is important. If you have trouble believing this, make a list of your strengths as evidence of your value. Ask your loved ones or therapist to contribute to this list.


One way to build your self-worth is by taking up a new hobby that allows you to express yourself while gaining mastery at something new.Try something new like a dance class, art class, poetry, drawing, or photography.
You can even do simpler things to boost your self-esteem such as wearing clothes that make you feel good about yourself, caring for your personal hygiene, or making a list of your strengths and most worthy achievements.If you feel like your self esteem is getting lower and not higher, remember that it may be a long and rocky process to improve your self-worth. After all, you have been put down for a long time and it can take a while for your inner self to feel worthy and back in control.
Just make sure you do become a member of a group and continue to get support from other domestic violence survivors. It is important that you are involved with survivors who will support you.

, While you might not have been able to feel it before, underneath your survival fear there may be a deep well of anger. To promote your recovery into a better life, it is important that this anger is processed and managed effectively.Try to channel your anger into productive energy, not self-destructive or risky behavior.


Anger often promotes the urge to retaliate, and although it might feel good in the short term, do your best to avoid retaliation as it will only make your problems worse in the long run. Instead, if you feel yourself building with rage, channel that anger into productivity or at least less destructive ways of letting it out. You could, for example, write down what you are upset about in a journal or a poem to process your feelings. You might also or instead go for a hard work out; you may choose to go to the gym and hit a punching bag, or go for a long run. Studies show, in fact, that exercise helps to reduce anger., Your friends and your extended family are there to support you and can provide a security blanket to protect you from the influence of your abuser. Spending time with those you are close to can help to reduce stress and aid in the healing process.Be with people you can trust and let the healing begin.

Figure out what you want and pursue it.,
Invest in your health.",How to Stop Expecting the Worst," Are you incredibly fearful when there are upcoming social engagements? Do you feel hopeless when you consider your job prospects? When you read the paper, do you feel like your species is doomed? Write a list of these topics, and resolve to focus positive attention on each one in turn.Your fears and worries can be projections about possible problems in the future, obsessions over things that already happened and can't be changed, or preoccupations with things that could be insignificant but end up getting magnified through worry.;
, You may feel like expecting the worst or being pessimistic is your ""default"" mode, and you are not even aware that you are thinking negatively. But these thought patterns are harmful — they tear you down, are unproductive, and make you feel worse.Start becoming aware of these patterns by writing down your pessimistic thoughts — carry a small notebook or use your smartphone.


Examples might be, ""I'm going to fail this test,"" ""He's going to reject me,"" ""I've been using the bathroom a lot — I probably have diabetes,"" etc.
Be as specific as possible when you write down these thoughts., Instead of treating your negative thoughts as inevitable and true (like believing your friend is mad at you and will probably end the friendship), start to test and challenge these thoughts.Take a piece of paper and write your negative thought at the top. Then start asking yourself these questions and writing out the answers:What evidence is there that this is true? What evidence is there against it? (i.e. ""We've had fights before and we always work it out. Even when we had a big blow-up last year, we talked it through and we have a strong friendship."")
Is there a different way you could look at the issue? Can you imagine a more positive outcome?
What are the chances that this worst-case scenario will actually come true? What are other possible, more likely outcomes?
Is this thought helping me or hurting me?
What would I say to a friend who was thinking this way?

, Sometimes people view expecting the worst as a way to prepare themselves or protect themselves from something bad happening. Their negative thoughts are a form of hyper-protection: if the person constantly anticipates the worst and thinks the worst of everything, he will never be surprised or disappointed. If this sounds like something you do, remind yourself that this kind of protective overdrive is hurting you, wasting your time with worry.Expecting the worst won't stop those things from happening — it doesn't truly ""prepare"" you for a bad outcome.Think about why you predict that things will not turn out well. Is it because they are uncertain? What is the chance that there could also be a positive or neutral outcome?, You may feel as though you have no control over your life — that you can work hard, do everything right, and it won't make any difference in the outcome. Or, you may think that you can somehow eliminate uncertainty and keep yourself safe from harm by anticipating a negative outcome in life. Remind yourself that you don't have complete control in your life — you can't control other people, the weather, etc. — but that you also aren't just along for the ride. You can control how you react and respond to things. You can control whether or not you take a chance, whether or not you get back up and try again when something goes wrong, whether you'll let a rejection from your crush spoil your year or if you'll let yourself feel disappointed and then work on moving forward.


Ask yourself — does expecting the worse somehow give you control over other people? The weather? Does it change the outcome at all, or just make you feel low?
If you always expect the worst in regards to your health, do what you can to improve your health. You can't control your genetics or some environmental factors, but you can eat healthy and get exercise, see the doctor if you think something is wrong.
If you expect the worst of other people, consider losing your expectations entirely, or dropping people who can't meet your needs. If your friends always let you down, ask yourself if what you are expecting from them is reasonable. Are you expecting them to be perfect? Or are you asking them to be supportive and they always tear you down? You can't control whether or not someone will do what you ask, but you can control how you respond. Try asking for what you need and letting go of the outcome by focusing on solving problems. If your needs are continually not met, then you may need to distance yourself from those people and find some more supportive friends.

, Studies have shown that it is possible to retrain yourself to have a more positive outlook.You'll have to consciously make an effort to stop when you find yourself expecting the worst and imagine a better, positive outcome. It you're walking into a job interview and saying to yourself, ""There's no way I'm going to get this position,"" stop right there. Force yourself to think about the positive outcome you really want — ""I'm going to nail this interview and do really well."" This might seem strange or unfamiliar at first, but this is because you are learning a new skill. Stick with it.


If you think ""I'm too keyed up to fall asleep and I probably won't get any sleep tonight again and I'll be wreck tomorrow,"" stop yourself and put it positively. ""I want to fall asleep now, so I'm going to focus on relaxing.""
You can subtly ""rewrite"" your ordinary thoughts to be a little more positive. If you think ""I don't know how to do that!"" change it to, ""I'm going to learn how to do that.""
When a positive thought comes to you, repeat it. Positive thoughts help you build resilience and create an upward spiral of emotional wellbeing., If you are a chronic worrier, and you find that negative thoughts are ruining your pleasure and your focus, make a regular date with yourself to worry for a while. This could be daily, day-and-nightly, or weekly, depending on what works for you. Write the dates down, set a scheduled amount of time (maybe half an hour), and stick to it: really do sit down and worry at that time.During your worry time, you can write about the things that you are worried about, or you can just sit and think through each of them.
Do some problem solving if you want, or just worry.

, Keep a diary. Carry it with you. When you are full of gloom or fretfulness, put it on paper. Use your diary to get the anxiety out, but also use it to get back into the present moment. When you write, be very honest about how you feel and what you are thinking. Get all the details down.Remember that the diary is for you and your thoughts, so don't worry about spelling, grammar, or sounding silly or strange. This is your place to express anything that's on your mind, no matter how small or large.
You may want to write in your diary every night before bed, to get your worries out.

, You may be in the habit of leaping from a possibility to its worst possible outcome. Instead of defying this habit, slow it down. Go step by step: what's the worst thing that could happen in each situation? If this happened, then what would happen? Start to turn it around into an exercise of problem solving. This can keep you from ruminating and help you start to feel empowered, reminding yourself that you have agency in your own life.


Go through this until you can't go any further.
Ask yourself what you need to approach the situation right now, then go about getting that thing.For example, if you are constantly worried about losing your job, ask yourself: ""Okay, say the worst has happened and I lost my job... What then?"" You can search online and read the help wanted section every week; you can learn how to apply for unemployment; you can work your contacts to see if anyone has a lead on a job. This is very different different than just thinking: ""Why bother doing a good job? I'm just going to lose it anyway.""

, When put your fears and despairs in positive terms, you are employing the same skills you use when you make a joke or laugh at yourself: the ability to step outside of your emotion and see it from another angle. Humor is an excellent coping mechanism, and it really does make your thinking more flexible.When you feel despair, you don't have to laugh it off, but you can ironize the drama of it all. If you feel lonely or abandoned while your partner is traveling, think ""Oh poor me, I love someone and he's having fun and therefore I must suffer.""
Look for the silly upsides of your situation: ""Well, I haven't had a serious relationship in two years, but on the plus side nobody's ""borrowed"" one of my sweaters permanently in that long either…""
Talking with a good friend or family member who knows your patterns can help you learn this habit—gentle teasing can help you get out of a negative train of thought.

, When you find yourself in the grips of a bad feeling, work to return to the present. Worry is a projection into an uninhabitable future: use somatic exercises to increase your mindfulness of the present.Check in with your five senses: ask yourself what you are seeing, what you feel, what you smell, taste, and hear.
Pay attention to your breath. If you are breathing quickly, try to breathe slowly and deeply.Try tensing and relaxing each muscle in turn, slowly. Focus only on how your muscles feel.
If you are deep in a panic, try wiggling your toes. This can wake you up into your body., Invest in your social life. Spend time with loved ones. Share your anxieties: part of not suppressing your feelings is sharing them with others. When a loved one is not able to hear you out, consider writing them a letter, or asking if there's another time you can talk.Spend time just having fun as well. Socializing may bring up certain anxieties in you, but it is ultimately healthier than isolation.
Surround yourself with positive people. If you know people who have an upbeat outlook, who encourage you, and who make you feel good, spend more time with them.

, Anxiety and depression are serious medical conditions. If you experience a sense of approaching danger or doom, you may have anxiety. If you cannot control your worries and put them aside, and if worry is interfering with your focus, this can also be anxiety. Following every possibility through to its worst possible result is a symptom of anxiety.Anxiety can come with or without symptoms of depression.
Any fear that interferes with your quality of life is likely a symptom of anxiety.
See your doctor, or make an appointment with a psychiatrist, if you feel you might have anxiety or depression.
If you experience suicidal thoughts, see your doctor immediately or call the United States National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1 (800) 273-8255.

, The sooner you get help for anxiety, the easier it will be to manage it. Once you have a treatment plan in place, follow it and keep track of your progress. Your doctor may suggest talk therapy, and you may also be prescribed anti-anxiety medication. Once you have started either of these treatments, stay on them.If you are not interested in medication, just let your doctor or therapist know. You have options.
Ask about cognitive-behavioral therapy, which focuses on helping you identify and alter thought patterns.
You may also join an anxiety management group.
Consider living well part of your anxiety management plan: plenty of rest, exercise, good food, and mindful meditation.

, If you tend to expect the worst, you probably set a lot of barriers for yourself. Get in the habit of deconstructing these when you notice them. For instance, if you want to call a new friend to make a date, you might think ""Oh she's probably busy, why would she want to be my friend, she's too afraid to tell me she doesn't want to be friends, if I pester her she'll never talk to me again."" Instead, say ""There's nothing wrong with asking someone to hang out. If she doesn't want to, I trust that she will tell me so or make a simple excuse.""


Try to do one little thing you're afraid to do every day.

, Identify the things you most want, and start planning how to make them happen. If you suffer a failure, don't give up. Look past what you think may be expected of you — making lots of money, buying a house, having kids, etc. — and try to determine what it is that makes you happy. Once you have an idea of what you want, you can research what it will take to get it and start setting goals. If you need extra support for this, such as therapy or a life coach, don't hesitate to reach out.If you're not sure what you want, try making a list of what is most important to you. It may be something abstract, like love, or something concrete, like money. Once you've done this, look over your list and try to see if there are any themes or beliefs that emerge.Maybe you notice a lot of the things that are important to you have to do with providing care and being around animals, but little to do with money or status. Maybe pursuing a life on an animal sanctuary would be a fulfilling path for you.

, Being anxious or pessimistic can take a toll on your health, but your physical health can also affect your mood. Prioritize keeping your body in good shape, and your outlook will improve.



Sleep enough. Adults need seven to nine hours a night, while children and teenagers need nine to 11 hours of sleep. Get into a regular sleep pattern where you go to bed and wake up at about the same time daily.Eat your three meals a day, with healthy snacks in between. Don't obsess over food, however: not everything needs to be healthy. Eat when you are hungry, and be mindful of portions. Be sure to eat a variety of foods, as this will get you the nutrients you need.Exercise. Aim for about 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week.Exercise on a regular schedule, but notice when you need a little extra movement. When you are feeling really down, that might be your cue to get up and do something active, like a short walk or even a household chore.
Avoid abusing substances. Alcohol and drugs can aggravate anxiety.

Identify the type of shopper you are.,
Know if you shop when stressed.,
Recognize the link between shopping and self-esteem issues.",How to Stop Using Shopping to Fill a Void1," You can overcome compulsive shopping by recognizing what motivates you to act and working to stop the problem at its root. The most common type of shoppers are:


Compulsive shopaholics shop to assuage emotional problems.
Trophy shopaholics look for top items to add to their collections.
Some shopaholics seek the flashy appearance of material affluence through new things.
Bargain seekers are those who justify purchases based on sales and good deals.
Bulimic shoppers are those who get caught in a guilt cycle of buying and returning.
Collectors who feel they need every item in a particular set to complete a collection.;
, People tend to shop to relieve stress. You can help get to the root of issues by observing your stress level when you choose to shop. It can also help deconstruct that shopping does little to actually relief stress. After all, how stress-reducing is it to worry about whether or not your credit card will be refused, and how much it is mounting up? If you shop when you are stressed, you are more likely to make impulse decisions to stop the feeling.


Take notice of your triggers and emotions. Shopaholics tend to shop in response to certain emotional states, such as negative emotions, boredom, for a thrill, or to fill a void. Triggers, when recognized, can help stop destructive behaviors before they start.

, Shopaholics often use purchases to deal with self-esteem issues. These purchases can be clothing that makes you look better, or new things for the sake of keeping up on appearances. Write down how you feel after making a new purchase. Observe if you feel more confident, or other emotions that address self-esteem issues.


Materialism and competition in a consumer based society can exasperate these issues. Shopping is seen as a more acceptable behavior than other addictions like drugs or alcohol. Avoid using your possessions as a measure of success or to compare to others. "

Wear non-insulting clothing.,
Be physically fit.,
Be confident and look like you are.,
Tell a bullying adult to stop.,
Get out if things get out of hand.",How to Avoid Being Bullied by Adults," This is very important. They need to know what's going on, and they may be able to put a stop to it.;
, Some adults see teenagers as menaces, or as those punks who don't really care about anything but making adults go crazy. If you're acting like what they think you are, you're just giving them an excuse to bully you. This will also let them take you more seriously. Be sensible and polite, and try to think ahead.

, Whenever you see someone going around acting as if they think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread, don't you just want to go down and take him down a notch? Adults have this feeling too. So be humble. Don't brag, don't boast, and don't walk around like you're better than everyone else.

, The old saying ""strength in numbers"" is true; very few people will even try to bully you when they're outnumbered.

, Wearing clothes with obscenities or insulting phrases has the potential to provoke others.

, If someone is just in a bad mood and looking for someone to be a jerk to, they want to pick someone that isn't going to offer a hard time. Looking stronger will deter someone from you; no one wants to bully someone that looks like they could punch a hole through their face! You don't have to be buff; you just have to look like you could put up a decent fight if it was truly necessary.

, Hold your head up high whenever you go places, don't slouch, etc. A bullying adult wants to have an easy target, and looking insecure will just attract them to you. However, there is a fine line between being confident and cocky; make sure not to cross it.

, Tell them loudly and firmly to stop. If there are people nearby, say it loudly enough so that they can hear and possibly intervene. They may not realize that they're bullying, or just be in a bad mood; either way, they need to know that what they're doing.


, When things start to escalate into either yelling or violence, usually you will be at a disadvantage because you're younger. Leave the scene, and if the bully continues to actively pursue you, Call the Emergency Services and tell them that an adult is bullying you.

You can also try using sweat shields under your clothing to prevent sweat stains.;
, There are lots of different deodorants on the market, so try a few different brands to see if one works better for you. If regular deodorant is not strong enough for you, you may need to ask your doctor about a prescription strength option. There are also several over-the-counter options that bill themselves as ""prescription strength"" or ""clinical strength.""

If possible, seek out air conditioned areas or bring a fan with you.For example, if you're going on a first date and you're worried about sweating, scope out restaurants ahead of time and choose one that has strong air conditioning.

, Many people unwittingly assume postures that increase their body heat when they begin to feel nervous. If you have a problem with anxiety sweating, you should pay careful attention to your hands and your face when you feel anxious, making sure that you are giving your skin as much room to breathe as possible to avoid creating more heat.Common reactions to anxiety that can create more body heat include making a tight fist, putting your hands in your pockets, and covering your face with your hands.

Avoid making shopping a social activity.,
Stop viewing shopping as a hobby.,
Change your environment.,

If you have some extra money to celebrate, put the money away and rejoice in the good feeling when all that savings adds up.

It is also harder to match that feeling each time, so you feel compelled to buy more. What sort of hobby leaves you feeling so compelled and tied up?

It can help to wait until the rush of the impulse wears off and you can really think about whether you need the item. If you see something you want, give it until the next day then reassess whether you still want it.
Leave your wallet at home. Take only your driver's license or public transportation pass and the exact amount of cash, no more.

You might notice beautiful wildflowers all around you, smell the scent of the grass and flowers, hear the sound of a gentle breeze blowing, and feel the warmth of the sun on your skin.

, A quick distraction can help you to feel less anxious as well. Try to force yourself to do something that will hold your attention when you are feeling anxious.

Rule out other medical causes.,
Ask your doctor about medications.,
Get Botox.,
Have iontophoresis.,
Consider surgery.",How to Stop Anxiety Sweating2," While anxiety does often cause sweating, there may be other medical causes as well. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about your excessive sweating to find out if there may be other underlying causes.Medical conditions that may increase sweating include thyroid disorders and low blood sugar.
Certain medications, including morphine, fever-reducing medications, and thyroid medications, may also increase the body's sweat production.

, There are a variety of medications that can help reduce excessive sweating, but this is not right for everyone. All of these medications may cause unwanted side effects, so it is important to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Medication options include:Beta blockers
Amitriptyline
Anticholinergic drugs

, While Botox injections are traditionally used for wrinkles, they can also be extremely helpful for people who sweat a lot. The injections work by blocking nerves that cause sweating.Botox is temporary, so you will need to get injections every few months.
Some people do not see results after their first Botox treatment, so you may need multiple treatments to reduce your sweating.

, Iontophoresis is a procedure that uses an electrical current to stun the sweat glands and reduce sweating. It is highly effective, although multiple treatments are required.Although this procedure is not invasive, it can be very painful.

, If nothing else works to reduce your sweating, you may want to talk to your doctor about the possibility of a surgical procedure called thoracic sympathectomy, which reduces sweating by removing cells that are responsible for creating sweat in specific areas of the body.

This procedure is minimally invasive, but does require general anesthesia.
Surgery comes with serious risks, including injury to the blood vessels, blood clots, and nerve damage. Some people also begin sweating more in other areas of the body after surgery.

Avoid worrying about sweating.,
Exercise regularly.,
Try relaxation techniques.,

Get out of bed.,
Try a quick distraction.,
Identify your anxieties.,
Write your anxieties in a journal.,
Play calming sounds in the background.",How to Stop Anxiety at Night1," If you wake up because anxiety or panic, or you feel anxiety at night, don’t stay in bed. Your bed should be a comfortable, calming place where you sleep. If you lie in bed, tossing and turning with anxiety, your bed may begin to be a place that causes you even more anxiety.When you can’t sleep, go sit or lay in a different place in your home. Sit in a chair, lay on your couch, or stretch out on the floor.
If you lie there for 20 to 30 minutes, get up and go somewhere else. You can return to bed after you calm again.;
, Sometimes, distraction can work help with night time anxiety. Sometimes, distractions cause more anxiety because you consciously are thinking about making yourself get over your anxiety. You can try to distract yourself at first. Put on the television, read, or do something else to distract yourself.However, if you aren’t distracted within five to 10 minutes, stop trying to distract yourself. Instead, find another way to deal with your anxiety.

, One thing that might help you stop being anxious at night is figuring out what is causing you anxiety. This helps you deal with it before you try to go to sleep, or be able to put it out of your head until the morning. When you identify your anxieties, you can decide if it’s something you can deal with tonight or if it is out of your control until the morning.For example, you may feel anxiety about going to sleep because you suffer from insomnia.
You may also just suffer from general anxiety, so your brain is a violent whirl of emotions and thoughts.

, Facing your anxieties and putting them down on paper can help you work through them. Writing them down can help you take control over them by pulling them from your head onto the sheet of paper. After writing in the journal, you can try to look at them and tell yourself how the anxieties are irrational.

List any triggers that may have caused the anxiety.
Write down thoughts you had before you started feeling anxious. What are you thinking now while you are anxious?
Write down what you are trying to do to calm yourself.
Explore why the anxieties aren’t realistic or rational. Even if you don’t believe it at the moment, just write how you are thinking unrealistic, negative thoughts.

Ask yourself questions to challenge your anxious feelings.,
Schedule a time for your anxiety.,
Write about how you feel.,
Remind yourself that the way you feel is only temporary.,
Redirect your thoughts to the present.",How to Stop Anxiety2," Make a list of objective questions you can ask yourself to challenge your reasons behind your anxiety. By taking some time to rationalize your anxiety, you may feel like it has less power over you. Some questions you might ask yourself include:What evidence is there to support that something is really wrong?
What evidence is there to support that the situation is actually not as bad as it appears?
What are the odds that the worst case scenario can actually happen?
What are some of the more likely outcomes?
How would I advise a friend who had this worry or one similar to it?

, Since you are bound to feel anxious sometimes, you might find it helpful to schedule in some daily worry time. This will help you to put limits on your anxiety, rather than allowing yourself to feel anxious all day.


Schedule a span of 15 to 30 minutes each day to worry and feel anxious. Ideally, it should be the same time each day and your worrying should be done in the same place.
If anxieties come up outside of your worry period, jot those anxieties down on a list. Remind yourself that you will have time to worry about it later.
Reflect on your anxieties during your worry period. You may even find that some of your anxieties have disappeared by the time you are ready to worry about them.

, Identifying your feelings and putting them on paper may also help you to feel better. When you are feeling anxious, sit down and just write about how you feel. You may even want to start a thoughts journal to keep track of all of your anxious thoughts. One way to organize your entries in a thoughts journal is to divide what you write into three columns.The first column can be something like: What is going on? Or, what is the situation? In this column, you can describe where you are, what you are doing, who you are with, etc.
The second column can be something like: What am I thinking? In this section, you can write about the anxious thoughts that you are having.
The third column can be something like: How anxious am I? For this column, you can just write a number from 1 (not anxious at all) to 10 (extremely anxious) to represent how anxious you feel.

, Sometimes when you feel anxious, you might feel like it is permanent and worry that you will never feel good again. This can be quite frightening, so you may need to remind yourself that your feelings are only temporary.Try saying something like: “This is only a small moment in time.” Or, “These feelings will not last.”

, Dwelling on the past or future can provoke anxiety, so training yourself to focus on the present can also be a good way to reduce anxiety. Focusing on the present can also make it easier for you to deal with the issues or tasks that are facing you right now.To make yourself more aware of the present moment, pay attention to what is happening around you. Who is there? What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel?
You may want to practice meditation to become more focused on the present. Meditation is also a great way to reduce anxiety."

Seek help from a therapist.,
Try cognitive therapy.,
Consider exposure therapy.,
Ask about medications.",How to Stop Anxiety3," If your anxiety is interfering with your daily life, then it might be a good idea to seek the help of a mental health professional, such as a counselor or therapist.Talk therapy is an effective way to reduce anxiety and to learn effective tools for handling anxiety-provoking situations.


For example, you may want to seek therapy if you have been withdrawing from your friends and family, avoiding certain places out of fear, or having a hard time focusing on work or school because of your anxiety.

, Cognitive therapy focuses on changing your thoughts and behaviors in order to reduce your anxiety. By going through cognitive therapy with a licensed mental health professional, you identify, challenge, and replace the negative thoughts that cause you to feel anxiety.For example, you might find that you often think to yourself, “I am going to fail,” and this thought may cause you to feel anxious. With cognitive behavioral therapy, you will learn to identify this thought as it occurs and challenge the thought or change it into something positive, such as “I am going to do my best.”
Cognitive therapy is something that you should only undergo with a licensed therapist. Ask your therapist about using cognitive therapy as part of your treatment plan.

, Exposure therapy helps you to face the fears that cause you to feel anxious. Over time, you may increase the intensity of your exposure or face your fears for longer periods of time. As a result, your fears and anxiety levels should improve.For example, if you are afraid of flying, then you might begin by imagining that you are in an airplane. Over time, you might work up to visiting the airport, taking a short flight, and then, as a final goal, taking a cross-country or overseas flight.You should only undergo exposure therapy with the guidance of a licensed therapist. If your fears cause you to feel anxiety, then talk to your therapist about incorporating some exposure therapy into your treatment program.

, There are several different types of medication available for anxiety, which you may want to consider if you have trouble controlling your anxiety by other means. Keep in mind that you will have to see a psychiatrist (a medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry) to obtain medication for anxiety. Some medications you may consider include:Benzodiazepines. These are the most common anti-anxiety medications. They work fast to reduce anxiety, but they can be habit forming. It is best to use these medications for severe anxiety only. Some benzodiazepines include Xanax (alprazolam), Valium (diazepam), Klonopin (clonazepam), and Ativan (lorazepam).

Antidepressants. Some antidepressants can help to reduce anxiety, but these take about four to six weeks to start working. Some common antidepressants that can help with anxiety include Zoloft (sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Celexa (citalopram).

Buspirone. This drug is a mild tranquilizer that takes about two weeks to begin working. It is similar to benzodiazepines, but it is much milder and has fewer side effects. Buspirone is also less likely to be addictive.

Beta blockers. Some high blood pressure medications known as beta blockers can also help with the physical symptoms of anxiety. These are considered off-label prescription drugs because beta blockers are mainly prescribed for heart problems and high blood pressure. Some beta blockers include Tenormin (atenolol) and Inderal (propranolol).

Develop your support group.,
Eliminate stimulants.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Follow a balanced diet.,
Sleep more.",How to Stop Anxiety4," You may often turn to family and friends when you are feeling anxious. However, you may find it helpful to identify specific people who you feel the most comfortable talking to and confiding in.Learn how the people in your life affect you. Some people may make your anxiety worse because they are anxious themselves. For example, if you have a friend who worries as much as you do, then she may not be the best person to call when you feel anxious.

, Stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine can make anxiety worse. If you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages, then try to reduce your caffeine intake. If you smoke or use other tobacco products, then do everything you can to quit smoking.If you are a smoker, quit smoking as soon as possible. In addition to increasing anxiety, smoking can cause serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, cancer, and emphysema. Ask your doctor about smoking cessation programs in your area.
Try not to exceed more than 200 mg of caffeine per day. This is about the same as two eight ounce cups of coffee.

, Alcohol may make you feel better for a little while, but it can make your anxiety worse later on. Limit your alcohol intake and do not use alcohol to deal with anxious feelings.If you tend to binge drink or to drink in excess in response to your anxiety, then you may need to seek help to stop drinking. Talk to your doctor about treatment options.

, Some studies have shown a link between eating habits and anxiety levels.Therefore, cutting out unhealthy, processed foods and opting for more healthy whole foods may affect your anxiety levels in a positive way. Strive for balanced, healthy meals that include fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and complex carbohydrates.


Include some fish in your diet, such as salmon, which include omega-3s. Consuming foods that contain omega-3s on a regular basis may help with anxiety.
Try to reduce your intake of candy, sugary cereals, baked goods, and other high-sugar foods. Instead, opt for a piece of fruit when you want something sweet.
Include complex carbohydrates in your diet, such as oatmeal, quinoa, and whole wheat bread. These sources of carbohydrates may increase the level of serotonin in your brain and calm you down as a result., Not getting enough sleep can make you feel more anxious, so it is important to get about eight hours of sleep every night.Try to go to bed at the same time every night and do things to prepare yourself for sleep. These might include:


dimming the lights
taking a warm bath
listening to some white noise or soothing music
reading a book

Start small.,
Make a plan.,
Soothe yourself when anxiety strikes.,
Perform reality testing on your thoughts.,
Get assistance from a professional.",How to Stop Avoidance Coping1," If you learn to tolerate uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, then you won’t require avoidance coping. Exposure therapy often helps lessen anxiety surrounding certain situations. However, you don’t want to push yourself too quickly into an anxiety-provoking situation.

Practice exposure by gradually building your tolerance. You can do this by starting with an activity or event that causes the least amount of anxiety. Once you have mastered it, you can gradually move to one that causes more, and more.Make sure that you give yourself a realistic timeframe to accomplish this goal. Keep in mind that it will not happen overnight and you will likely be a work in progress for a while and that is okay.
You can do this more effectively by making a list. Rank those situations that provoke anxiety for you. For example, you might list, ""speaking in front of an audience,"" ""asking someone out on a date,"" or ""going to a restaurant alone."" Start with the least anxiety-provoking situation and work your way up.
Whenever you accomplish a goal, find a way to celebrate or commemorate each step among the way. This can even be something small such as, writing it in your journal and congratulating yourself out loud.;
, Plan to expose yourself to situations you typically avoid. Prepare yourself for the experience of anxiety by choosing one thought, feeling, activity, or situation that typically causes anxiety.For instance, if you want to practice going to a restaurant by yourself, you might first start with getting take out on your own a few times. Then, you might ask to be seated.
Another way to devise your plan might be in levels of exposure. For instance, you might be okay getting breakfast alone, but dinner makes you anxious. You'll want to gradually build up to eating supper in a restaurant alone.
To increase the chances that you will stick with your plan, you may also want to have an accountability buddy. This could be a mental health professional, a friend, or family member. Make sure that they are familiar with the steps you have chosen to follow and that they will help to hold you accountable.

, When you expose yourself to the anxiety-provoking situation, employ your self-soothing techniques. In addition to deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, you might listen to calming music or state phrases of affirmation, such as “I can do this” or “I am brave.”Another helpful phrase to repeat to yourself is, “No anxiety can last forever.” This will help you to remember that what you are feeling is temporary.

, Once you start to get used to the sensations of anxiety, you will need to focus on the thoughts surrounding these situations. Reality testing allows you to assess a situation from an objective point of view to reduce the anxiety it causes.For example, you might think, “I can’t ask Mr. Thomas to explain the assignment after class. Last time he yelled at me.” Try to see this situation from different angles. Are there other ways of viewing it?
The reality is that just because Mr. Thomas yelled last time doesn’t mean he will this time. Also, he may have yelled for reasons separate from your question. Maybe he had a bad day and was tired. Perhaps this time, he is in a better mood.
If you are unable to adjust your thoughts on your own, then you can also try contacting an objective person to help bring you back to reality. Tell them what is going on and what you are feeling anxious about.

, The process of learning to tolerate anxiety-provoking situations can be challenging. You can seek out help from a professional to assist you in stopping your avoidance coping behaviors. One form of therapy, known as exposure therapy, has been shown to be effective at helping reduce anxiety and the events that provoke it.Keep in mind that there are lots of different types and levels of exposure therapy. For example, your therapist may decide to either use a graded approach to expose you to things that cause you a mild amount of anxiety first, or they may use a flooding approach and expose you to the thing or things that cause you the most anxiety first. Depending on what causes you anxiety, they may use in vivo exposure therapy, which actually exposes you to the things you fear, or imaginal exposure therapy where you imagine the exposure happening."

Use mindfulness.,
Perform breathing exercises.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Go through guided meditation.",How to Stop Anxiety at Night2," A lot of anxiety comes from dwelling on the future or the past. Mindfulness keeps you focused on the present. This technique helps you relax by helping you let go of your worries. During mindfulness, you don’t ignore or try to push away your anxieties. Instead, you identify them so you can be released from them.Get into a comfortable position in a quiet room. Close your eyes. Start by identifying your anxieties. Don’t try to judge them, fight them, or even react to them. Instead, just think about them. Pretend you an outsider just looking at your anxieties.
Let the thoughts pass in and out of your head. Often, when you don’t try to fight the thoughts, control them, or actively ignore them, they start to get stuck in your mind. By just looking at them and not engaging with them, you can just let them float out of your head.
Focus on your body in this moment. Think about how your breath feels going in and out of your nose and mouth. Focus on your five senses. What do you feel, smell, or hear?
Mindfulness takes practice. Don’t be discouraged if your mind is all over the place the first few times you try it.

, Deep breathing is a great technique that helps you relax, reduce stress, and lessen anxiety. When you feel anxious at night, you can try performing breathing exercises to calm your mind and your body.Lie on your back in a comfortable position. Place your hands right below your rib cage. Take a long, slow deep breath through your nose by expanding your belly. Your fingers should separate as your breath, and your hands should lift as your belly expands. Exhale through your mouth. Repeat five to 10 times. You can do it longer if you need.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is another relaxation technique you can use at night to help you overcome anxiety. In progressive muscle relaxation, you work on relaxing your whole body, and therefore your mind. You can do this in bed if you wish.Start by tightening your toes. Curl them under your feet and hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax.
Next, tighten all the muscles in the feet. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Slowly relax.
Continue tightening muscles as you move up the body. Do your legs, thighs, abdomen, arms, neck, and face. Tighten and relax the muscles in each area. Make sure to relax slowly.

, Meditation is a great stress and anxiety relieving technique. Through meditation, you can release your anxiety and get to a state of relaxation. You can even perform guided meditations that help prepare your mind and body for sleep. Guided meditations vary in length, from five minutes to over an hour, where someone walks you through the meditation process so you can achieve a deep state of relaxation.You can find multiple guided meditations online. There are audio files through meditation institutes and sites. You can also find guided meditations on YouTube.

Stay busy in the evening.,
Exercise after work.,
Limit your alcohol and caffeine.,
Prepare for bed an hour before you want to fall asleep.,
Choose a consistent bedtime.",How to Stop Anxiety at Night3," Often, the reason why people don’t feel anxiety during the day is because they are busy. Work helps keep you distracted from your thoughts and anxieties during the day. At night, you may slow down and do nothing, which can cause you to start thinking about your anxiety. Instead, give yourself projects or tasks in the evening to keep your mind occupied.These tasks don’t have to be stressful or strenuous. Read a book, wash the dishes, do a load of laundry, crochet, or put together a puzzle. Anything that helps keep your mind focused on something other than your anxiety.
Having nothing to do in the evening can lead to you getting lost in your head. This leads to increased anxiety.

, Working out after you get off work can help reduce your anxiety at night. Exercise is a natural mood booster and proven method to help reduce anxiety. Aerobic exercise is a quick cure for anxiety. You can try to combat night anxiety by exercising every evening.If you get anxious at night, you can go for a quick walk, do some yoga, or do a short HIIT cardio routine in your living room. This can help manage the anxiety you feel at the moment.

, Alcohol and caffeine can negatively affect your anxiety. They can keep your riled up, causing your to feel jittery. They may also cause you to feel more panicked. In the evenings, limit or completely eliminate your alcohol and caffeine intake.Alcohol can also trigger negative feelings or feelings of depression. It can change your state of mind, which may be more vulnerable at night.

, Sometimes, it may take awhile for your body and mind to catch on that you want to sleep. Things like televisions, computer screens, and cell phones can keep the mind alert, while the light interferes with melatonin production. Start moving towards bedtime an hour before you want to sleep.Turn off all electronics and lower the lights. This helps your body and mind start to calm. Your body will also start producing melatonin, which promotes sleep.
Do something that engages your mind to help distract you from the anxiety of sleeping. This does not include the computer or television. Instead, read, draw, write in a journal, or even play a game. These things are full body and mind activities that can fully distract you and help relax you as you prepare for bed.

, Routines can help reduce your anxiety. There is comfort in doing the same thing. Routines present you with familiar actions and experiences, which do not cause further anxiety. Your bedtime should be a routine time. Instead of going to sleep whenever you feel like it, choose a convenient bedtime that you can meet every night.By using the same bedtime every night, your brain and body will start being trained to know when it is time to go to sleep.

Practice deep breathing.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation.,
Gain an observer's perspective on anxious thoughts.,
Try mindfulness.",How to Stop Avoidance Coping2," Stress and anxiety result in labored breathing. You can effectively control anxiety and activate the body’s natural relaxation response with deep breathing, which will counter your brain’s sense that you are in danger. These exercises help you realize that you are safe—your heart rate slows, your blood pressure falls, and your muscles start to relax.Begin a deep breathing practice that you can use in the place of avoidance coping.
Try breathing in slowly with your nose to a count of five. Hold the breath briefly. Then, exhale through your mouth to a count of five. Repeat this several times until you start to feel more relaxed., Often, when you face anxiety, you tense up various muscle groups. Learning to soften and relax these muscles can help you lessen the anxiety you feel.To practice progressive muscle relaxation, find a quiet, comfortable place to sit or lie down. Start either at the top of your head or the bottom of your feet. Working your way up, tense each muscle group. Hold the tension for a moment, and then release it. Notice how the relaxed state feels. Continue over your entire body.

, Stepping back and viewing your thoughts from a different lens may help you to notice that they don’t have to have power over you. This also helps you gain objectivity for when you want to start challenging anxious thoughts.When an anxious thought arises, vocalize it. You might say, “I am having the thought that I want to skip the social event. I don’t want people looking at me.”

, Mindfulness can be used throughout everyday life to help you regulate your attention. It helps when anxious thoughts are overtaking your brain to slow down and focus on the present moment. The goal is to focus entirely on the activity at hand without giving any attention to competing thoughts.You can do mindfulness when you are eating by only focusing on the sensations of the food, chewing, and swallowing. You can also take a mindful shower, dress mindfully, or drive with mindfulness.
To make this a habit, include mindfulness exercises as a regular part of your schedule. This will help to increase your awareness of your body, breath, and mind all of the time.

Dedicate some time to observing and logging avoidance coping.,
Write down the situations that you tend to avoid.,
Note the thoughts and feelings you have when avoiding.,
See the impact avoidance has on your health and well-being.",How to Stop Avoidance Coping3," To stop avoidance coping, you need to know that you’re doing it. Spend some time acting as an observer to your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.Ask people who ae close to you to let you know when you appear to be avoiding the things that cause you anxiety.

, Keep a notebook with you so you can jot down any interesting information you learn through your observations. Notice which situations prompt you to avoid and what you do to avoid them.For example, you might avoid going into a certain building at your school because it reminds you of an embarrassing incident that happened there.
You may be surprised by the lengths you will go to avoid things that make you feel anxious. For example, you might pretend to be ill or lie about having a previous engagement.

, While you may engage in avoidance coping to prevent anxiety, you may find that it has the opposite effect. Avoiding limits you from being able to grow and learn from what you fear. And, it ends up adding to your stress and anxiety.Write down your thoughts and feelings when you avoid. For example, you might avoid the building, but still feel anxious. Or, you find yourself thinking, ""I'm such a freak.""

, In order to fully take action against your avoidance coping, you need to recognize that avoidance doesn’t help. Think back on some situations or events you have avoided and the outcomes.Have there been negative consequences associated with avoidance coping? Maybe you lost a friend, missed out on a big job opportunity, or see yourself as weak because of it.
Also, be sure to ask your spouse, family, and close friends, “Does my anxiety affect your life in any way?”

Don't participate in cyber bullying behavior.,
Parental control software can help protect you.",How to Stop Cyber Bullying," Cyber bullying often takes the form of one person harassing another through emails, instant messages, text messages or other modes of electronic communication. Harassment is taking place if the bully is directly contacting someone with one or more of the following types of messaging:


Hateful or threatening verbal messages. This includes name-calling, attempts to control someone's behavior by threatening to expose embarrassing information and/or threats of violence.
Embarrassing or threatening images or videos.
An unending barrage of emails, instant messages or texts, whether or not they are threatening in nature.
Lies about the person to make them look bad.;
, Another common form of cyber bullying happens when the bully harasses a target by way of public embarrassment, rather than directly contacting him or her. Cyber bullies may use these public tactics:


Posting humiliating messages on a social media site, a blog, or another public space.
Spreading rumors and gossip using social media, text messages and other tools.
Sharing pictures or videos that are embarrassing or explicit in nature, or are altered with the intent to humiliate, on social media websites and through text messaging.
Creating a website filled with defamatory images, insults, and rumors about the target.

, A less obvious, but equally harmful form of cyberbullying takes place when the bully attacks someone by impersonating him or her as a way to bring about humiliation or punishment. In this case it is more difficult to identify the perpetrator.


In some cases the bully may create a screen name nearly identical to the screen name used by someone else, then use that name to create embarrassing or threatening situations for him or her.The bully may steal the target's password, hack his or her accounts, and send embarrassing messages to others or make expensive purchases.

, Some bullies start out as a friend, an ex, or someone else you know well. If it seems possible to have a reasonable discussion with the person, consider asking him or her to stop. Have the conversation in person, not through email or text.


Keep in mind there may not always be a reason for cyber bullying, or one that is straightforward. Sometimes people lash out on others because of their own insecurities. In any case, it is not your fault.
If you don't know who the bully is, or if you're being bullied by a group of people, attempting to talk it out probably won't work. You may need to take a stronger action.

, If talking it out won't work, don't directly respond to the text messages, instant messages, emails or other communications you may have received from the bully. Bullies want to elicit a reaction from their targets, so firing back a text will only make things worse.


Don't threaten the bully to get back at him or her. Sending a threatening message out of exasperation will only provoke the bully to keep up the bad behavior, and it may get you in trouble, too.

, File away every email, text, instant message, web address, and other evidence you collect from the bully. Record the time and date that each message was sent. Having as much information as possible about the bully's behavior will help you determine how to stop his or her behavior., Immediately put an end to the bully's most invasive threats by blocking that person from direct communication with you. Once you've made sure all prior messages have been saved, take the following steps to protect yourself:


Delete the person from your email contacts and block instant messaging communication.
Delete the person from your social networks and prevent them from getting in contact with you again.
Block the person from your phone.

, Prevent the person from finding a new way to contact you by limiting the amount of personal information you make available online. Take the following measures to protect yourself:


Don't reveal your address, phone number and whereabouts online. Social media sites make it easy for people to contact you in a lot of different ways, but they all have privacy settings you can employ to keep certain people from bothering you. Change your settings so that only close friends are able to contact you.
Consider changing your screen name and other online identification. If you've been using the same screen name for years, the bully may be able to find a way to continue harassing you by posing as someone else. Eliminate the possibility by changing your screen name, as well as your profile picture and other information that makes you easy to find online.
Create new accounts. If you fear someone else is impersonating you, it might be necessary to create new accounts so that that person is no longer able to pretend to be you. Notify your friends and family that you have a new email address, social media page, and so on.

, You might be tempted to let the bullying run its course instead of bringing attention to the problem, but if you do that the bully will get the message that there's no penalty for putting someone else in danger. Don't assume the problem will go away on its own; speak up immediately to put a stop to it.


If you're a child or teenager, ask an adult for help. Your parents, teachers, principal and school counselor are all in a position to put a stop to the situation before it goes any further.
If you're a parent, take the situation seriously and address it immediately. Cyber bullying has often had tragic consequences.

, Every school has a policy for dealing with bullying, and more and more schools have a specific plan for putting a stop to cyber bullying. Some states require this by law. No matter what your school's individual policy might be, it's the administrators' job to resolve the situation.


If you're a child or teenager, know that taking this issue to the school is the right thing to do. Other kids at the school may be experiencing cyber bullying, too; the school needs to be made aware of the problem to take steps to end it.
If you're a parent, set up a meeting with the school principal or dean to address the problem head-on.

, Cyber bullying usually violates the terms of service laid out by social media sites, cell phone providers, and other service providers. Read up on your providers' policies and take steps to report threatening behavior.


You may have to send your records of the cyber bully's messages to the provider as proof you are being bullied.
The provider may decide to penalize the person as a result of your report.

, In some cases cyber bullying may be classified as a crime, which places it beyond the jurisdiction of schools and service providers. If the cyber bullying involves one of the following elements, call your local police department:


Stalking and use of intimidation.
Threats of violence or death.Sexually explicit photos or descriptions of a minor, which is considered child pornography.Secretly-recorded photos or videos that were taken without the subject's knowledge.
Hate-related communications or actions., Cyber bullies often use pictures, status updates, and personal information they find online to harass their targets. It's fine to share a little information about yourself online, but never reveal something you don't want the whole world to know.


Don't take an explicit photo of yourself to send to someone else, and never let someone else take an explicit photo of you. You may be in love with your significant other now, but if you break up, you won't have control over what happens to those pictures. Many cases of cyber bullying involve former significant others trying to get revenge on their exes by distributing explicit pictures.
Personal information sent through private emails, texts and instant messages could land in the hands of a cyber bully. Try not to discuss embarrassing or deeply personal information online. Even if you're only telling a friend, you never know how the information might get out. It's best to discuss serious matters in person.

, Sometimes online communications can be misread by the recipient, leading to a conflict that can escalate into a bullying situation. Be respectful to people with whom you communicate online to avoid making enemies. If a conflict develops, try to resolve it in person.A good rule of thumb is to be as polite to someone online as you would be in person.
Don't send messages when you're feeling angry or emotional. They are more likely to be taken the wrong way by the recipient.

, Even if all of your friends are doing it, cyber bullying is still wrong. People choosing to go along with the crowd in cases of cyber bullying is what makes these types of attacks so effective and damaging. Your behavior can influence other people's actions; make it clear that you don't stand for cyber bullying by setting a good example for others.


If your friends start teasing someone online or via text, don't participate. Ask them to stop, and let them know that cyber bullying has the same dangerous consequences as in-person bullying does.
Don't take photos or videos of someone else without their knowledge and permission. It's against the law to secretly record someone else's behavior when they believe no one is watching.
Even if you take photos or video of someone with their permission, don't distribute them unless the person agrees to it. Never distribute photos or videos that could be considered explicit, humiliating or could somehow be used against the person.

, This should be installed on your PC and smartphone and it will block many attempts at bullying and can be especially configured to help you. If you don't already have this, then ask your parents about installing it. If you're a parent then go ahead and install it as a protective measure."

Listen to what the insulter says with a pleasant look on your face.,
Walk away.,
Smile at your attacker.,
Think a positive thought instead.",How to Avoid Being Affected by Insulting Commentary1," However, be aware that smiling or laughing could be seen as a psychological sign of defense in these circumstances. Sometimes just letting the person get out their words shuts them up.


This idea ties into the ""fake it until you make it"" technique of dealing with life's problems. You can pretend the mean words don't bother you.
Sometimes acting like nothing is wrong can make the other person feel non-effective in their nasty words.
With this method, the attacker will never know if they hurt you.;
, Do not show anger or fear of any kind, which will only give your insulter satisfaction. Silence can actually make the person shut down and help you prevent mental drain. If the comment is on social media, you can just delete the comment.
This is the easiest way to avoid the situation.

, Ignore what the person said. This will make your attacker feel like their comment did not affect you. Avoidance can work in this circumstance.For example, if someone calls you dumb and you just brush it off without saying anything, they won't feel like they got to you.
Just smile and pretend you are ok. Sometimes a smile is enough to change your mood. They say it can even bring about positive emotions., When you brew on bad thoughts, it makes it worse. That's why it's a smart idea to tell yourself a compliment. Think of the things you are good at.


For example, if someone tells you you're fat, think about the great job you did at work the other day, instead.

Make your Facebook account as bully-proof as possible.,
Spot bullying tactics.,
Look for a pattern.,
Tell the bully to stop.,
Talk to your trusted friends about what is happening.,
Don't stoop to play their game.,
Report them.,
Close your Facebook account.,
Don't participate in Facebook bullying yourself.,
Be prepared to wait for Facebook to erase the bullying groups/pages.",How to Stop Bullying on Facebook," Be sure to make your settings safe by only letting your known friends see your account and interact with you. If something happens in real life that you think could spill over onto Facebook, consider taking pre-emptive action to remove the problem person before they can try anything. For example, if someone you know from school or work who bullies you there asks you to be their friend, deny the friend request. If they ask you about it in real life, be polite and say that you don't have the time for more than 20 friends and family members and that all the spaces are already filled.


Set up a limited profile so that you can control how much people other than your accepted friends can see when they find your Facebook page. Go to the ""My Privacy"" page and click on ""Limited Profile Settings"". Be very cautious about which settings you allow to be viewable by just anybody; keep most things to confirmed friends only – list their names in the limited profiles box. If you're a parent, help your teen to work out the appropriate profile level.
Learn how to block friends who don't behave like friends. Read How to block people on Facebook and How to block someone in Facebook chat for details.;
, Bullying can come across in different ways to different people and online it is not always easy to detect a person's real meaning and sometimes you'll need to assess whether or not you're reading too much into something. But some things that might denote bullying on Facebook include:


Wall posts that say intimidating, mean-spirited, or outright nasty things about you, your friends, and the things you care about. For example: ""Marcia, May and me all hate you. You've got really bad breath. Don't bother coming to school tomorrow.""
Consistent abuse about the things you've posted. For example: ""Why do you post such STUPID things???? You're a waste of space!!!!""
Use of lots of punctuation, such as WTF?!!! on a consistent basis, intended to ram home a message without any subtlety.
Use of ALL CAPITALS can denote a menacing attitude. Online etiquette views most usage of ALL CAPITALS as the equivalent of shouting and if the message is accompanied by negative words or implications, it might be an attempt to bully you.
Posting photos or videos of you online that are unflattering, that show bullying of you that's happened in real life (for example, phone shots of people roughing you up), or tagging you in photos that suggest negative things.
They use threatening, harassing, or nasty language in Facebook chat.
They start a Facebook group based on you, such as something like ""10 Reasons to Hate Hermione B"" This is probably one of the worst-bullies uniting against you.

, Be sure that the bullying commentary is not just a one-off stupid, petty or insulting comment that was added thoughtlessly. If there is a pattern of leaving nasty messages on your wall, it's obvious that the person doesn't intend to stop. Also consider how this person behaves toward you in real life if you know them in your daily life. Is this something they're carrying over from their everyday behavior?


Be aware that it's possible for one thing to be enough to establish harassing behavior, such as threatening you, or adding compromising photos of you with suggestive comments, etc.

, Initially, it might be enough to ask the person to stop bothering you. Message them quietly at first. If they keep it up, leave a public request; knowing that your other friends can read it might shame them into ceasing.


If the bully is someone known to you in a professional capacity, remind them of their need to remain professional in the online sphere. You might do well to remind them that your wall is read by many people too and that other people's perception of them is likely to change if they read anymore of the harassing comments.

, They may be able to leave messages asking the bully to stop as well, and to make it obvious in public that the bully's behavior is unwanted and not tolerated.


If you're a teen, talk to your parents. Your parents can contact the relevant parents or school and discuss what is happening. They can also consider legal action if the bullying does not cease.

, You might feel safer responding in kind from the relative ""safety"" of your computer, but this will only increase the problem, and could result in flame wars and real life confrontation. Ignore their attempts to lure you into responding and block them from being your Facebook friend. Ignoring is usually the best means for deflating a bully's satisfaction.

, There's no need to pussyfoot around if you've been nice and things didn't stop. Report the bullying behavior, activities, and the bully to Facebook administrators. Outline the facts and the impact that the bullying is having on you and request that action be taken, including removal of any bullying posts, groups, or other public elements. Parents can report on behalf of teens; for more information, see Facebook's own instructions at https://www.facebook.com/help/?safety=parents.


If you have a guidance counselor at school, college, or your workplace, you might consider going to them for help. Ask them for the school, institution, or company policy on bullying and harassment to see whether Facebook is covered. Even if it's not, the substance of the bullying itself should be the subject of an anti-bullying or anti-harassment policy. Find out what you can do to get help and support, and to get the bullying to stop.
If you're unhappy with the response of a counselor or other person, or of Facebook, consider talking to someone in your local police station for further advice. They may be able to help you directly, or to send you to someone else who can help.
The police should be involved if you have received physical threats, racial taunts, or if photos or videos of you being mistreated, demeaned, or showing nudity are involved.

, If you're really unhappy using the Facebook account and things feel out of control, or you feel over-exposed, consider deleting your Facebook account. You can always open a new account when you're feeling stronger or when you're older.


Another way to cope may be to open a new Facebook account using a different name, such as your first and middle name. You may need to talk to Facebook administrators about opening an account with a ""non-real"" name but if bullying is the issue, then you have good grounds for being exempted from the usual name policy.

, Put a stop to cyber-bullying via Facebook by pointing out when it's wrong and reminding those who participate in it how it harms others, including to the point where some teenagers have killed themselves as a result of bullying in the online environment.

, You will be probably be waiting a LONG time. It is unfortunate that Facebook does not take their own abuse policy seriously.

Control your thoughts and self-talk.,
Share your confidence (even if it's not there yet).,
Remember your attacker is intellectually inferior to you because they had to resort to rude insults.",How to Avoid Being Affected by Insulting Commentary2," You are the keeper of your own mind. Don't let one person's opinion get you down. It's just one person saying something silly! Say to yourself: ""I'm confident.""


It's hard work, but changing the voices in your head is a big step in feeling good. Think about what you think. Try to purposefully change the train of thought so you don't validate the attacker's ideas. Practice reciting positive statements like ""I am successful"" or ""I am happy.""
Tell yourself you are ok how you are!

, Tell the attacker he or she is being rude. Sometimes keeping it straight is the best approach. Some people make comments without realizing how inappropriate hey are. An objective comment on the person's hurtful words might even open the other person's eyes. You will feel like the better person when you stand up for yourself.


For example, you may want to say ""That wasn't a very nice thing to say.""

, It doesn't take a lot to come up with nasty words. Just remember you are being the mature person. Stand tall.


Adults shouldn't be making insults to their friends, family or co-workers.

"
"
Ask more questions.,
Remember criticism is different than feedback.,
Ask yourself what you learned from the interaction.",How to Avoid Being Affected by Insulting Commentary3," Maybe the critique has a worthy point you can learn from.If the critique is straightforward, maybe it's something that can help you grow. For example, maybe a person who is called smelly can learn to wear deodorant before exercising.

, Look who is doing the insulting and what their motive is. Are they just giving a silly opinion? Or is the person a loving relative who just wants to help? Think about what the person is saying. Your mom probably wants what's best for you. If she hurts you, tell her, but know she is trying to help.

, Even if things don't end well, when you get home, think about what you got out of the encounter. Perhaps the person taught you how not to behave or you'll learn something about a particular person's personality.


In the future consider whether or not you want to hang out with someone who hurt you. Perhaps you learned that this is not the sort of person you would like to be around.

If you want to prevent bullies from thinking that you're an easy target, then you can work on not only developing an inner confidence, but also on projecting confidence. Stand tall, make eye contact with people, look happy to be where you are, and avoid hunching over or looking at the ground. Look engaged and happy when you talk to other people, and walk to class with a purpose, not like you're dragging your feet. Though developing true confidence can take a long time, making the effort can put you on the path to being less likely to be bullied.Look at yourself in the mirror. Check out your body language and make sure that it's open and positive.
While dressing to the nines may not help you feel confident, taking time with your appearance and showing that you care about how you look will make bullies less likely to bother you. Maintaining good hygiene will make you feel better about yourself, which will in turn raise your confidence.;
, If you have a group of friends or even just a friend or two, this is the time to get their support. You can tell them about what's happening and make sure to stick by them in any threatening situations. If you know when the bully is most likely to approach you, whether it's in the halls or on your walk home, then make sure you're not alone, but walking with at least one friend, so the bully is less likely to approach you. And if you have an older friend, or even an older sibling you can walk with, that will also scare the bully off.


Unfortunately, bullies love to prey on people who don't have many friends. If this is you, then know that you're not alone, and try to work on developing friendships with people, or at least getting to know a few acquaintances. Just having someone to sit with in the cafeteria or to walk with in the halls will make you less likely to get picked on.

, If a bully comes up to you and says hurtful things, then your best bet is to exude confidence, stand tall, and to look that person firmly in the eye and say, ""Stop!"" or, ""Leave me alone."" Just saying something simple and then moving on can show that you're not letting the bully get you down and that you're willing to stick up for yourself. This may make the bully think that you're not a good target because you're too strong.


Of course, you have to get a good read on the situation. If you feel like you're in a dangerous or threatening situation, then your best bet may really be to back off and get away from the bully as quickly as possible.
If the bully keeps annoying you, and saying ""Stop!"" and standing proud isn't working out, you can try to outright ignore the bully. If you just walk by like you don't see him or her, acting like his or her words are having no effect on you, then the bully will be likely to get bored or to disengage pretty quickly. He or she won't see the point in bullying you if it's not getting a reaction out of you.

, If you go about your day, thinking about all of the ways that you can be bullied, from being tripped in the cafeteria to being laughed at in class, then you are going to spending your waking life being afraid of everything that can happen. Of course, it's best to be on your guard and to be prepared for anything when you're being bothered by a bully, but you should try visualizing a positive outcome when you think about any of the negative situations that can arise in a bully's presence.


If you visualize positive results after confrontations with bullies, then you are more likely to achieve what you want.

, While you shouldn't start fighting a bully who comes up to you, and only resort to violence if you have no other option, taking a few self-defense classes, such as karate, can help you not only learn to defend yourself, but to gain the confidence you'll need to stand up to bullies. Just knowing that you could fight back when a bully is approaching you will make you much more confident when you face the bully, and you'll also have more confidence in your own strength.


If self-defense classes aren't up your alley, you can also consider signing up for an after-school sport. Any sport can help you get into shape, and you may even make a few friends along the way.

, If you know who you are and have faith in yourself, then you will be less likely to be approached by a bully. You don't have to think you're the greatest person in the world, but always putting yourself first and knowing that your goals and needs are important can go a long way in helping you avoid bullies. If you think you are an interesting, thoughtful, and worthy person, then a bully will be much less likely to bring you down.


Bullies don't like a challenge; they prey on the weak. If they see you and think, ""Hey, there's a guy who is pretty happy with himself,"" then they won't want to make the effort to try to make you feel bad. But if they think, ""There's a guy who is already miserable in his own body,"" then they'll be more likely to make a move.

, This may sound like an obvious point, but one of the ways you can prevent being bullied is to simply avoid places where the bully is likely to be. Sit in a new spot of the cafeteria. Take a new path to class or a new path home. Do what you can to be away from that person as much as possible. Though you shouldn't change your whole life and schedule just to avoid this person, avoiding the bully will make him or her get bored and to stop making the effort to bother you.


This is a good short-term strategy, though in the long run, you'll have to take stronger measures to prevent the bullying.

, If the bully is mean to you, calls you names, or tries to humiliate you in public, of course it will be tempting to be mean to that person back, but if you really want to stop the bullying, then you can't stoop down to the bully's level. If you call him or her names back, try to fight unprovoked, or just engage in general meanness, then you'll be escalating the situation and making it worse for yourself.There's nothing more frustrating for a bully than a person who doesn't respond, call him names, or show that he cares at all. If you add fuel to the fire, then you're just giving the bully exactly what he wants.

, A bully's goal is to make you cry and to feel worthless. Sure, the things he says may be hurtful and may fill you with self-doubt, but you must never, ever let the bully see that anything he says has an effect on you. If he says something mean and you look visibly upset, then he'll only be encouraged to dole out more of the same. But if he calls you names and you shrug and act like you couldn't care less, then he will be much less likely to keep pestering you.Of course, it can be hard to keep your emotions bottled up inside, especially if the bully is really hurting you. Just try to stay calm, breathe, count to ten, or do whatever you can to not let the words hurt you. If you need to cry, try to do it in privacy, and to at least maintain your cool while you're in the bully's presence.
Though it may sound hard, try not to let the bully's words get to you or make you think there's something wrong with you. Remember that the bully is a mean person who takes pleasure out of hurting people -- why would you think that anything he/she said was true?

, Many people are afraid to tell adults, teachers, or other authority figures about bullying because they think it makes them look like a wimp and that it can make the bully more angry. If you really want to prevent bullying, though, then you can't be afraid to take these more drastic measures when they are necessary. If the bullying has gotten out of control, or even if you've had just one really horrible experience with a bully, it's never too soon to tell your parents, your teachers, or someone else at your school or in your community.


The adult will have an idea of how to handle the situation. If the bullying is really out of hand, then you may even have to contact local law authorities, and the adult can be a big help in navigating the situation.

, Don't ever think that it's your fault that you're being bullied because there's something wrong with you. Bullies are often cruel and irrational people who have low self-esteem and who try to make themselves feel better by belittling other people. They don't act rationally, and it's never your fault if a bully starts bothering you. Don't be hard on yourself and think that the situation could have been avoided if you looked or dressed differently. If you're being bullied, then it's important to be calm, to think positively, and to avoid blaming yourself if you want to get out of the situation as soon as possible.If you're down on yourself about being bullied, then this will make the bully even more likely to target you. Instead, you should think and act like you don't deserve to be treated this way.

, If a cyberbully is approaching you and saying mean or nasty comments, going around impersonating you, or just generally trying to upset you online, it can be easy to want to fight back and to tell that person to go away and to start calling that person a few names yourself. But the truth of the matter is, the more you engage with the bully, the more he will think that he's getting to you, and the more likely he'll be to keep bothering you.You can say something like ""Please leave me alone,"" but other than that, don't talk to the person.
You can tell the person, ""I'm saving evidence of this conversation"" to encourage the person to stop bothering you. Beyond this, though, it's best to avoid talking to the bully at all.
Just as in real life, if the bully sees that he or she has the power to make you upset, he or she will be more likely to continue bothering you.

, Whether you're on Facebook chat, g-chat, or another form of instant messaging, just make it so that the person is blocked from your account, so you cannot receive any messages from that person. You may also appear invisible to that person, depending on which programs you are using. Once you block the bully from talking to you, he or she is likely to give up on trying to reach out to you.


Blocking sends a louder message than engaging with the bully. The bully will see that you're serious about wanting to be left alone.

, If the bully sends you hurtful chats, posts, or emails, don't delete the evidence. Save it in case you decide to contact your service provider or to talk to an adult or an administrator of your school. Having a written record of the bully's behavior will give you the proof you need to get the bully in trouble. Save it somewhere, print it out, and make sure the evidence is on hand when you need it. If you don't save any evidence, then it'll be your word against the bully's, and the bully is likely to deny having any online contact with you.


Even the act of saving and storing the evidence of the bullying will be empowering for you, even if you decide not to use it.

, If you want to make it less likely that you'll be bullied in the first place, you can also create higher privacy settings, whether you're using your Facebook, Twitter, or another online account. Limiting the access that people have to your photos and the things you post can help you avoid people who are just trolling your profile in order to find something to laugh or be mean about.


That said, you should also be careful about whom you accept as a friend on online networks. If you accept absolutely everyone who wants to be your Facebook friend without knowing very much about that person, then it's more likely that this person will end up making some unpleasant remarks.

, Of course, it is never your fault if you are being bullied or cyberbullied. Still, you can think about which comments you post, and who is able to view them. If you post something very controversial or likely to offend a lot of people, then you may be opening yourself up to having people bully you about what you're saying. Though most bullying does not happen because of posted comments, if you want to be more safe than sorry, then you should avoid posting anything that is likely to anger a lot of people., If a person is being offensive, vulgar, or just plain annoying to you online, then you can contact the service providers to get that person banned from the service. If you contact Facebook and report bullying, then the person will face the embarrassment of being booted from his or her Facebook account and will have to explain why. Reporting the person can show that you mean business and is likely to make him or her back off.

, If the cyberbullying is getting out of hand and the person is regularly bothering you with hurtful, mean, spiteful, and angry comments, then you can't keep ignoring it. If you feel like you've tried everything or that you can't face this alone, then it's time to talk to an adult or an authority figure at your school about the incident to stop the situation from happening.It's never too early to report bullying to adults, and you should never think that you're being cowardly for stepping forward. In fact, it takes real courage to stand up for yourself and to say something to prevent a situation from happening.

“I’m not really in the mood to hang out today.”
“Thanks for the invitation, but I’m not feeling very well today.”


Also, quit confiding in them. Continuing the intimacy of friendship will only make it harder to end the relationship in the long run.;
, Start coming up with reasons that you can't see them. This will help if they are bad company and you want to gradually stop hanging out with them. Eventually they should start to notice and leave you alone.Some good examples of excuses could be that you have to babysit, that your parents are monitoring you, or you could even sign up for school activities and say they are taking up too much of your time.
Try one of these examples:

“I appreciate the offer, but I have a lot of homework tonight.”
“I can’t hang out today because my parents are making me do my chores at home.”



, Talk to them about their behavior and tell them why their actions bother you. Give them advice about how to change if they are willing to hear it.Some ways you could help them are by telling them honestly how their behavior makes you feel, talking to a counselor or their parents with them, offering to help them with something stressful in their life that might be causing them to act out (like homework, trouble at home, etc.), or helping them find positive outlets in their life (like sports, church, and other hobbies or school activities).
Try one of these examples:

“It bothers me when you make me feel like I’m not a good friend.”
“I don’t like feeling pressured to do things I don’t want to do. I wish you wouldn’t do that.”
“I’ll be happy to help you figure out a way to deal with that situation.”



, If they persist with their bad behavior and won't leave you alone, continue to resist them. But if they still continue to follow you, tell them you don't want to hang out with them anymore.


Try one of these examples:

“I don’t think being friends with you is good for me right now. I think I need to take a break.”
“I feel like I need to focus on other things right now. I can’t hang out with you anymore.”



, What qualities are you looking for in a friend? Determining these things ahead of time will help you know what to look for when you are making new friends. Search out people who have these positive qualities you want in your life.


Some qualities you might consider are kindness, honesty, loyalty, intelligence, or creativity.
Think of ways to tell if people possess these qualities. For example, someone who makes good grades in school is probably intelligent. Someone who volunteers at a nursing home is probably kind. Someone who is very active in art class is probably creative.

, Try to become friends with people who have good morals. A good place to meet people like this is at your church youth group or in an activity group organized through your school. People who get involved in activities and in the community are less likely to cause problems.

, Do this before you start hanging out with someone new. If they mouth off in school, get into fights, or bully others, don't get too close to them.

, Hanging out with likeminded people is important. The saying “you are what you eat” can be applied to the friends you choose as well. If you hang out with motivated, driven people that will begin to rub off on you as well.If you spend time with people who don’t care about school or who are not nice to others, those behaviors could eventually rub off on you., There are probably a lot of people in your life (parents, teachers, counselors) who have more life experience than you and would love to advise you on how to find and keep good friends. Take advantage of their advice by talking to them and asking their opinion. It might help!

, If you want to attract the kind of people who will be good company, you need to be a nice person who is enjoyable to be around. Be kind to others, help those around you, and make goals for your life.Be grateful for what you have in life and what others do for you. Everyone likes feeling appreciated. Tell others that you are thankful for them., People don’t want to spend time with others who will get them in trouble or influence them negatively. Make decisions in your own life that will positively impact your own life and those around you.


Before making a decision, think about your choices, possible outcomes for each, consider the pros and cons, and enlist the advice of people you trust., When you are a teenager, an easy way for others to make judgments about what kind of person you are stem from observing how focused you are in school. If you make an effort and try to be successful in your classes, this will reflect well on what kind of person you are and it will attract other people who will be good company for you.


Also, this will be a good marker for the parents of your prospective friends. Sometimes parents can be suspicious of new friends. But if you are successful in school, most parents will have more confidence in you from the beginning., Sometimes we attract the wrong kind of people because we are not emotionally capable of being a good friend at the moment. There are plenty of ways to get the help you need – like through counseling/therapy, by taking care of your body through diet and regular exercise, or simply by talking through your problems with someone you trust.Some examples of things that you might need to get help for before you can attract the right kind of friends is drug or alcohol addiction, various psychological problems (like depression), or anger management issues. These are aspects of your own life that you will need to work toward fixing in order to attract the kinds of friends you want.
If you are feeling severely depressed or suicidal, reach out for help immediately. Talk to your doctor or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255)."

Recognise what a Chav actually is.,
Avoid ""Chavvy"" areas.,
Avoid Chavs at School.,
Avoid Chavs - close range Sometimes it is impossible to avoid Chavs, they may be family members, friends of friends etc.","How to Avoid ""Chavs""","


Surprisingly, a ""Chav"" is somebody who - wears Burberry, polo shirts with upturned collars, tracksuits, ""bling"" and listens to hip hop, Rock 'n' B, Drum 'n' Bass etc.
A ""Chav"" is actually an alien from another world who does all of these things but also displays an even worse set of characteristics such as: being rude to everyone (including, if not especially their best friends); having extremely bad manners and a terrible command over the English language.
The almost total inability to talk properly is the staple of Chavs. A Chav can also be identified as someone who tries to act like they are black, or possibly Jamaican, but ironically sometimes secretly(or not so secretly) harbours racist views.
They have also proved time and time again to be bullies.
Avoiding someone simply because they look like a Chav, or enjoy ""Chavvy"" things is no better than being a Chav, who often hate or at least look down on those who display different characteristics to their own.
Someone who dresses like a Chav, but is a nice person, is better being described as ""Chavvy"" than an actual Chav.
By instantly judging anyone that looks like they may be a Chav, you are in fact no better yourself.;
, It is well known that Chavs are usually found in large groups, gangs, and even ""posies"".


It is also well known that these can be found in poor urban areas. It is often a fair judgment to say that any poor urban or suburban areas contain large amounts of Chavs. Avoid such places, or spend as little time there as possible.
Chavs are infamous dwellers of council houses, and these too are likely to have at least one Chav in every one of them.
City centers are often favourite haunts for Chavs, who will gather their in large groups, admittedly this is rarely to do anything productive.
If you stay away from these areas you may not need to deal with Chavs too often.

, Almost all schools have a massive population of Chavs.


They usually dominate the school, are the most popular kids, the ""toughest"" kids and the most common.
This can be a problem if you wish to avoid them. Do not panic, this can be easily achieved. Think to yourself, where would a Chav choose to hang out at school? Where would a Chav rarely go?
It is likely that there are quiet corners of the school that can act as a sort of refuge or safe haven for you and your friends. If you are an accomplished and hardworking student, you will likely be in higher classes, or groups, where few Chavs are admitted. This is not the case with all schools though.
The key is to remember that groups of Chavs will likely cause trouble and try to cause you some sort of grief.
They can be very childish, throwing things around the class, insulting the teacher, seeking attention and even blatantly bullying a member of the class.
However, one Chav is much less of a threat, only the most tragically disturbed Chavs continues their anti social behaviour when they are left alone.
A Chav in a classroom of normal children usually goes into a state of quietness until they are reunited with their Chav friends.
It is even possible that sometimes a Chav, if not with other Chavs might occasionally do something that might possibly be considered as a friendly gesture.
Sometimes, such interaction with a ""lone Chav"" may gain you some sort of respect and safety from the group as a whole, and you may be described as ""safe""; but talking to a lone Chav should not be seen as a guarantee of some sort of protection against the rest. It is likely you will become another victim as soon as a Chav is surrounded once more by their ""crew"".
Join an anti-Chav student alliance at your school. This will a group of good, respectful students, who work against chavs using more powerful tactics than just pure violence and unintelligible language. Such organisations will provide support to the vulnerable, and if you want to make a difference, you can help. Ask senior students in your school about this.

,


If a Chav is already trying to trouble you then there are a few things you can do.
Try to look confident - Do not look scared, as Chavs can sense this. Almost like dogs.
Be nice- Smile and try to be upbeat, do not speak unless spoken to, but try not to appear miserable, you will be even more of a target for bullying.
Avoid eye contact - never stare at a Chav. This is especially important if you see Chavs in the street. Chavs are actually extremely insecure, which is why they attempt at displaying such a mean, ""bad boy"" attitude; and staring at them almost always provokes hostility.
Try to act invisible, but do not ignore a Chav if they Try to communicate will you, this may infuriate them. Instead Try to keep a low profile and do nothing that may make you a threat or a victim.

Don't react.,
Ask this person why he or she is attacking you alone.,
Accept responsibility for your actions.,
Be aware that anger, hurt and insecurity are the root of most insults.,
Respond with humor.,
Walk away (and stay away).,
Let the bully end up looking bad for the insult.",How to Ignore Insults," Act as if you never heard the insult in the first place. If the bully continuously provokes you saying things like ""Hey can't you hear me?"", just shake your head and keep walking. Without a reaction, they may not see a reason to continue insulting you.;
, Wait for a time when none of their friends are around and ask them why they are being rude. If you ask while their friends are around, they may feel like they need to defend their honor, if you get them one on one, they might be more likely to share the truth.

, If this person does manage to answer, and has valid reasons to be upset, address the problem right away. While this may be a little difficult, you have to be really honest with yourself. You will gain respect for your directness. For example:


You: ""What did I do to deserve that?""
Him/her: ""You snubbed me yesterday, walking by all high and mighty with your friends, pretending like I wasn't there.""
You: ""I did that?"" (Look surprised). ""Dude, I don't remember it. Are you sure I saw you?""
Him/her: ""You looked right at me, jerk.""
You: ""Really? You know what, we were talking about (insert subject here) and I was really focused on that. I don't even think I realized you were there. Listen, I'm so sorry for that, I didn't mean to snub you. Let me go get those guys/girls, I know they're going to feel bad, too."" Bring your friends over, explain how your actions hurt this person, and apologize. Try to get all of them to apologize too, if you can.

, If you hurt someone, even unintentionally, they may respond with angry insults, especially if they are not very good at communicating their real wants and needs. Moreover, insecure people like to call attention to the shortcomings of others (even if untrue) in order to cover up for their own perceived inadequacies (it's just easier that way). Don't retaliate––by not taking it personally, you can just let it all slide off like water from the duck's back.

, If you aren't at fault, and it's a random insult attack, responding with humor can sometimes disarm the insulter. For example, if someone calls you a porker or something like that, you might say, ""Really? I like to think of myself as a sublimely well-proportioned fatso."" Or, ""Why thank you, I love pigs!"" cheerfully. That will often get the person insulting you to stop, out of sheer surprise at your audacity.

, If you've tried to figure out why this person is targeting you, and can find no reason, and you've tried to joke with him or her to no avail, and he or she is still bent on humiliating and insulting you, just leave. And until he or she picks a new target (and this will happen), avoid the person.


Dignified ways to walk away include saying nothing or saying something like ""Hey, deal breaker! (Smile) I've got to be off now!""; ""Okay, my line in the sand has been crossed. See you later.""; or simply, ""You'll have to excuse me.""







, Many times, you really don't have to do much to make this happen. Just taking the insult, smiling and shrugging, or responding very mildly can do the trick, and it can turn the tide of public opinion in your favor. For example:


Bully: ""Hey loser! Where did you get those clothes? The Wannabee shop?""
You: (In a quiet, humble voice) ""Actually, I got these from my big sister/brother. Since my dad lost his job, our family hasn't had much money for clothes, so we have to make do with what we can get. I know they're sort of the height of fashion from several years ago, aren't they? Not really very hip. But whatever. We can't afford anything else.""
Bully: (Sneering.) ""Aw. Poor waddle baby can't get any better clothes. Wah. You're breaking my heart. Not.""
You: (Staying humble.) ""I wasn't looking for sympathy. You asked a question and I answered."" (Hopefully others are overhearing this.)
Bully: ""If I were you, I'd tell my folks to either get me some decent clothes or send me to another school.""
You: (Sigh) ""I really feel bad for my dad and don't want to make him feel worse. So I'm not going to ask for anything for myself right now. In fact, I'm looking for a job right now, to try to help with expenses for my family.""
Others: ""Yeah. Leave him/her alone, man. they're not doing anything to you.""
Bully: ""Oh, fine. You can all have a little pity party with that poor crybaby. I'm out of here. Later losers!""

And that will probably end that round of insulting, at least in that way. When others join in and defend you, the bully will seek an easier target, one where he feels more sure of finding allies. Bullies don't generally like to stand on their own two feet––they like feeling like a lot of people are behind them. They bully people because when others chime in, it makes them feel better about themselves somehow. When others don't want to join them, they back off, even if it means losing face.
Bullies are often insecure people and if they are tormenting you, do not respond with humor near his or her friends instead of retaliating with an insult.

Don't instigate.,
Don't back out.,
Instill respect in your enemies.,
Understand that in battle, there are no rules, and there is no such thing as fairness.,
Do not make it a show.,
Afterwards, stay cool.,
Lastly, don't fight all of the time.",How to Defend Yourself in a Fight at School," Although everyone longs to be a tough guy that can crack skulls and take names, that doesn't always work in reality. No one wins when you and your enemy end up looking like punks.;
, This goes against any form of self-defense, but in this situation, backing out will give you a cowardly appearance - even if the other kid probably doesn't want to fight any more than you do. In the worse case, this will lead up to more confrontations.

, This may sound impossible, but threatening that you'll make them eat through a straw for the next year will make most bullies back off, yet will turn you into a bully.

, There are, however, limits you should never exceed except in a life or death situation. Never hit the head or throat or nose. Certain hits to these places can and will cause death. Use non-dangerous pressure points and hits to the shins and shoulders. A kick to the shins is enough to make almost anyone back off without long-term injury.

, The goal of school fights is to send a message. That bully just wants to look strong in front of everyone, so prove him wrong.


If you are getting attacked from the back to the head, grab their arm with your neck and shoulder. Then - with all your force - use both your hands to give them a Chinese burn.

If they continue to hit you, dodge it, and keep giving them a Chinese burn.


Refrain from getting carried away. Hurt him enough to send a warning, and if he takes the warning, let him go. Inflicting serious or fatal injuries upon the bully may get you in trouble.
Don't forget that the bully has his own mind as well. Dodge his blows, and calculate his weaknesses. Try to figure out the bully's strategy, and use it against him.
Let the bully make the first move. If you punch him first, you'll most likely be blamed.

, Screaming ""are you not entertained?!"" or something similar will make you look like a psychopath. The officer at your school would like it more if you made it as obvious as possible that you were merely defending yourself. Go with everything that the school staff and/or police say: you're the good guy.

, 'He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster.' Also, don't brag a lot, as you're just asking for it. Make it seem like no big deal, and wait patiently until the whole thing blows off.

Don’t release your strong emotions on the person because aggression can make the bullying worse or escalate the situation.Try to control your emotions before responding. If you notice yourself getting angry or upset, take some deep breaths. Slowly lengthen each breath so that you’re breathing longer and fuller breaths.

Take your breaths from your belly, not your chest.
Try counting each breath. For example, inhale for four seconds, then exhale for four seconds.;
, Not letting someone’s words affect you shows your power over a situation. When someone’s words affect you and hurt you, that person has power over you. Don’t give the person this power. Ignore their comments and don’t emotionally react.Ignoring these comments is easier said than done and it might take some practice.
Repeat to yourself, “This person’s words and opinions don’t have to change how I feel about myself.”

, Stand up for yourself and don’t back down. If you decide to speak out, talk confidently.Speak up for yourself by saying that the comments are mean and don’t reflect who you are.

For example, say, “I don't know why you would call me ugly. Your opinion of how I look doesn’t change who I am.”

, Maybe someone called you ugly for having a big nose, curly hair, or big feet. These features don’t carry negativity in themselves. Maybe you do have these features and some people don’t find them attractive. That’s okay. Remind yourself that this person is judging you and you don’t have to take it negatively.


For example, say, “Yes, I do have a big nose. How astute of you to notice.”

, Humor can undermine the harsh words and diffuse any tension of the situation. However, don’t use humor to fire an insult back. Humor is a great way to respond make a statement that their words won’t hurt you.Exaggerate the comment by adding to it. For example, say, “I guess I am pretty ugly. I’ll probably have a swan-like transformation any day now!”

, Ultimately, the way you feel about yourself is more important than the way other people perceive you. Lots of people have lots of opinions, but the ones that matter most are the ones you have of yourself. Learn to prioritize the way you see yourself above the way others see you.If someone calls you ugly, remind yourself that your opinion matters more than theirs, and they cannot make you feel ugly.

, Many people see themselves with a critical eye. If you find it easy to list off the things that are “wrong” about you or that you do not like, try building a list of the things you do like about yourself. Take a look in the mirror and instead of focusing on what you don’t like, find what you enjoy about your body. Maybe you like your eye color, skin tone, lips, hands, or anything!


Make a list of the things that you enjoy about your body and remind yourself of these things when you feel low.

, Nobody can define what pretty, normal, or beautiful are on the whole. As the saying goes, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and this applies to attraction as well. If you feel low about your looks or what people have said to you or about, start building your own self-acceptance. Have compassion on yourself. See yourself as an imperfect person and have compassion for those imperfections in yourself.For example, say to yourself, “I am not perfect in who I am or what I look like. I can accept myself despite these imperfections.”
If one person finds you unattractive, so what? That doesn’t mean everybody sees you that way. Accept yourself as you are and remember that you can't please everybody.

, If being called ugly has seared into your self-image and into your thoughts, it’s time to get it out. Focus on saying something to yourself that builds yourself up and puts positive thoughts into your mind. Think of affirmations that are in the present tense and try to say them every day. You might not believe the words at first, but keep with it and see how you feel.For example, say (or write down), “I am beautiful” or, “My worth is more than skin deep.”

, Start to raise your self-confidence. If you don’t know how to feel confident or don’t feel you can be confident, act like you have confidence. For example, ask yourself, “What would someone who is confident do now? How would they respond?” Start to see yourself as confident, even if you don’t believe you are. When people see you as a confident person, they may be less likely to make fun of you or insult you.As some people say, “Fake it ‘til you make it.” Soon enough, you’ll find that feeling confident gets easier and easier.

, If you feel bad about yourself after someone calls you ugly, try doing something that makes you feel good about yourself. While you can’t instantly change the way you look, you can put your attention toward doing things that make you feel happy, calm, relaxed, or at ease. This can help you deal with the stress and feel better overall.For example, go for a walk, take a bath, write in a journal, or listen to music.

, Put some effort into taking care of yourself. For example, practice good hygiene such as changing your clothes (including underpants and socks), showering regularly, brushing your teeth, and wearing deodorant. Practice taking care of yourself to feel more confident, such as taking time in the morning to make your hair look nice, dressing in clean clothes that reflect your style, and creating a look you like.Being called ""ugly"" is different from being called ""not well taken care of"". Take responsibility for your image and for things that you can change.

, Whether you need support or someone to confide in, talking to an adult can help. This might be a teacher, parent, coach, or spiritual leader. They might lend a listening ear or give you some advice in how to handle situations when people try to hurt you. They might even help you intervene or confront the person who called you ugly.Adults remember being younger and may be able to give advice based on their own experiences.

, If your ‘friends’ are teasing you or calling you ugly, take a second look at who you consider a friend. A true friend will support you and care about you, not tear you down or make fun of you. Choose to be around the friends who make you feel good. After all, winning over ‘cool’ friends who are mean to you will still leave you feeling bad.Even if you spend time with less ‘cool’ people, be with the people who treat you well, respect you, and don’t make you feel bad about yourself.

, If you’re struggling with bullying, self-image, or self-esteem issues, a therapist can help you.Learn ways to cope with your feelings and build your self-esteem. If you struggle with anxiety or depression as a result of bullying or insults, your therapist can help you find ways to feel better about yourself.

Find a therapist by calling (or having your parents call) a local mental health clinic or your insurance provider. You can also get a recommendation from your physician or a friend.

Take a cyber-break.,
Keep the comments in perspective.,
Remove the comments.,
Talk to the sender in private.,
Talk to an adult you trust.,
Don’t feed trolls.",How to Deal With Mean Comments on the Internet1," Sometimes taking a break from being online is the best way to deal with mean comments on the internet.Staying online makes it more likely that you will look at the comment repeatedly and get more upset. It also makes it more likely that you will respond to the comment, which isn’t a good idea.


Close the app or walk away from your device so that you can think about how you want to deal with it and so that you can calm down.
Do something else like taking a walk or reading a book to distract yourself for a little while.;
, You can deal with mean comments by thinking about who is posting the comments and why they might be doing it.Although some people are actually trying to be mean, some comments may be meant to be funny or, perhaps, they are just worded wrong but the intentions aren’t bad.


Look at the sender. The person may not even know you. You’re probably ""friends"" with people on SnapChat and Instagram that you don't ever talk to in real life and may not have even met.
Could it be interpreted differently? For example, a comment from your best friend about a picture you posted that says ‘you look awful lol’ could just be his way of teasing you.
If it’s a comment on social media, think about whether it’s possible the sender didn’t mean to make the comment public.
For example, did your friend that is new to Snapchat post a Snap publicly that they meant to send as a private message?

, If you are sure this a one-time or random event, then deal with the mean comment by deleting it or removing It from your page. Once it’s gone, you don’t have to see it anymore or risk anyone else seeing it and making a bigger deal out of it.


Most sites and apps make it easy to remove a comment that has been posted. Usually you can click ‘help’ and find instructions for removing a comment.
If it's a Facebook comment, click the ‘X’ in the top right corner of the post and press ""Remove Post"".
SnapChat posts are automatically deleted after 24 hours.
You can delete an Instagram comment by tapping it and then holding it. A ‘trash’ icon will appear in the top right corner that you can click to delete the comment.

, If the comment is from someone you know, you can deal with it by telling the person how you feel. The sender may not realize that their comment was mean or that it hurt your feelings. Talking to them in private may convince them to stop.Tell them the comment bothered you. Try saying, “The message you sent me really hurt my feelings. I know you may not have meant for it to. But, please don’t send me anything like that again.”
Explain that the comments could lead to false rumors being spread or unneeded drama between friends. For example, you might say, “What you posted could be misinterpreted in a bad way.”
If the comments are on social media and they are about something you would rather not discuss on the internet, then explain that to the person.
You could say, “I really don’t want everyone to know about that. Next time, please just call me or send me a private message.”

, If you are a child, pre-teen, or teenager and the mean comment is from an adult, you should tell another adult. You should also talk to an adult if the comment bothers you so bad that you can’t sleep, or your eating habits change, or you feel bad about yourself for a while.


Immediately tell an adult like your parent, teacher, coach, or religious leader if another adult posts something mean, untrue, or scary about you or to you.
For example, you could tell your coach, “Coach, a grown-up posted a comment about me on Facebook that really hurt my feelings and made me feel bad about myself.”
You could talk to your dad by saying, “A while ago someone posted a comment about me that was mean. I tried to ignore it, but it still really bothers me.”
Adults can help you with things like figuring out who the person is (if you don’t know), how to make sure they don’t do it again, and how to help you with how you feel about it.

, Posting negative comments, or trolling, is a way for some people to gain recognition and sometimes it is just something they do to entertain themselves. If you are dealing with someone who often posts negative comments online for you or other people, then this person might be an internet troll. Internet trolls can be anonymous posters, or even people who are part of your social network.The best thing to do if you are dealing with a troll is to avoid giving that person the attention they are seeking.


Don’t respond to the person in any way, whether you are going to say something positive, negative, or neutral. Responding (or feeding) the troll will only cause that person to feel noticed and want to continue the abusive commenting.Ignore the comment and move on with your day.
Try taking a few deep breaths to calm down and then distract yourself with something pleasant, such as a video, an interesting article, or something offline, such as the view outside of your window.

Try to understand why some people ""backstab"" or double-cross.,
Look after yourself first.,
Make a decision to confront the backstabber.,
Prepare your approach.,
Ask to speak with the backstabber.,
Avoid being rude or aggressive.,
Listen to their response.,
Tell them how you feel about your future relations.,
Seek to understand what motivated them and do this with a view to forgiving them.",How to Confront a Backstabber," A backstabber is someone who pretends to be your friend, or to be on your side, and then turns around and does or says things that lead to you being harmed, exposed, or treated badly as a result of things they suggest or reveal. Backstabbing is a form of manipulation and reveals a person who is disloyal, insecure, and very unsure of their own place. Understanding the motivations behind backstabbing can help you to find ways to deal with it, as well as showing you that the backstabber is very often a person with poor emotional resources and is probably a very unhappy individual. While that doesn't excuse their behavior, it can reassure you that the backstabber is probably like this with many people and needs to be treated objectively as someone to be careful of. Reasons why people resort to backstabbing include:


Inability to make close friendships or keep friendships, and perhaps a fear of getting too close to other people in case they're hurt. Gossiping in a mean-spirited way can cause them feel they're more attractive to people they'd like to have friendships with.
Inability to get where they want to in life because they're not talented, dislike hard work, cannot figure things out, or they're afraid of doing the innovative things themselves. Their greed for promotions, profit, or bettering their position can cause them to see backstabbing as an easy path through.
Seeking to impress someone else. This can be the case where the person doesn't feel they're getting enough attention or respect from someone in authority or someone they wish they could spend more time with. It can be made worse where you're spending time with the person the backstabber would like to befriend.

Jealousy. An insecure person who also harbors jealous thoughts about someone else can easily resort to backstabbing as a way of feeling superior over the subject of their desire and can even view this as a sort of ""revenge"", as a way of taking down someone's strengths, to make themselves appear and feel stronger.






Stupidity. Some people just don't understand the limits of dropping other people in a mess. It might amuse them, or it might be because they don't really understand the extent of the ramifications involved in undermining another person, but they just don't think about what they're doing and the harm they're causing.

Revenge. Perhaps you did something (knowingly or unwittingly) that they don't feel that they can forgive you for, and this is their sneaky method of getting back at you. In this case, look at what you might have done in relation to this person. Try to see whether there is something that might have caused them to feel so angry or disoriented that they wanted to hurt you.;
, The fallout from a backstabbing episode can be monumental, depending on what the backstabber has revealed about you, or has said about you. It's important to do what you can to remedy the fallout through talking to the relevant people, and doing anything else that needs to be fixed. Some things that you might need to do include:



Reflecting on the consequences. Before you do anything else, take some time to assess the damage before rushing in to try to patch it up. Perhaps things seem worse than they are because the disloyalty is blurring your perception. Take at least a little time to work through the consequences to decide whether you need to do anything, or whether it's best left to just fizzle out with time. If you do realize that things need to be done to repair the damage, then write out a plan of action to help keep you organized and panic-free.
Asking other people involved if the things said are true. Seeking to expose the layers of lies can be a useful way of finding out how far the backstabber has been weaving a web of deceit. For example, if the backstabber says A doesn't like you and you go and ask A if this is true, A may say the backstabber said the same about you not liking them...

Apologizing to people if anything negative you've said has been revealed. Don't grovel; be truthful, apologetic, and focused on where you're headed next, now that you've learned a big lesson.
Explaining to people why what has happened is out of context, untrue, or convoluted. Don't exaggerate or make up stories; just be clear on the real facts and highlight how the backstabber might have got things twisted in the retelling.
Letting people know that you're going to the source of the rumors or tattling and sorting things out before they get worse. This will show people that you mean business about fixing what the backstabber has done or said, and that you're not afraid of facing the person directly.

, You might prefer to change the word ""confront"" to ""meet with"", ""discuss things with"", or ""talk things through with"" the backstabber if ""confront"" is too bold and aggressive a word for you. Whatever you call it, making the decision to call the backstabber on his or her behavior is a bold step and one that you'll need to approach with courage and fortitude. Make sure you've got your facts straight, and that you feel strong and calm enough to talk to the backstabber without lapsing into emotional overdrive; remember that a backstabber is a manipulative personality and will try to turn your emotions back on you to make it seem as if they are not in the wrong or that you have misunderstood things.

, If you already know what you want to say, then go ahead. However, for many people, the thought of confronting someone openly about something rude or nasty that the other person has done, can be confronting in itself. The answer to nerves is to pre-script your approach so that you know what you want to say, even if you don't remember the exact words on the occasion. The types of things you might like to pre-script include informing the backstabber that you'd like to talk to them, putting together the facts of what has happened and how you've been impacted by the backstabbing, finding more constructive words than ""backstabbing"" to explain what has happened (so that you can remove the emotional anger), and crafting what kind of solution you'd like to see come out of this talk. For example, you might write down something like the following:""I have something I'd like to talk to you about. I'd like you to hear me out about it before you give your response. I need your help in clarifying why you've chosen to say/do X, Y, Z, which has resulted in X, Y, Z. I don't know why you felt you needed to do this, and it has been hard for me to . And while I don't know what motivated you to , I do know that I won't accept this happening anymore. I've spoken to J, L, and K and explained my side of things. They seem to understand much better now what has happened. Then either: or Follow with: I believe that when people do things that are not kind or caring toward another person, that this is based on their own fear, unhappiness, or hurt. If that's the case for you, I'm willing to talk about it with you if you want and I will support you. But I will not tolerate being taken advantage of or having you believe that it is OK to undermine me in front of my colleagues/friends/family, etc. If you're willing to talk about this now in an open and friendly way, that'd be great. If you need more time to think over what I've said, then we can get together and talk this through a bit later. If you don't want to talk about it at all though, please understand that I will not stand around waiting for you to do this to me again and I will take action to protect my reputation including . If that is the case, I'm sorry but I cannot allow this to happen again.""


Role play this discussion before seeking to have it. This will give you the opportunity to remember the major points and will give you a sense of reassurance that you've already trialed the discussion.

, Try to arrange it so that it's at a time and place where you will feel comfortable. Perhaps over a cup of coffee or milkshake, perhaps in a quiet room at work or school, or perhaps in the local park. Make sure that it's somewhere that you also feel safe, especially if you suspect that this person might be a bit unstable or react badly.


If the backstabber isn't so keen to speak with you, or you suspect that they'll refuse to talk with you, try the tactic of simply baling them up somewhere and starting to talk to them when they can't get away easily. This might be at the end of lunch or a meeting, for example. Realize that doing this will make them uncomfortable though, and that they may be much more likely to respond to you negatively than if you give them the space to be more honest and less defensive.

, Take an assertive approach to talking with them and one which shows that you're more interested in understanding than in retaliating or telling them off. While being at the receiving end of backstabbing isn't good, and the repercussions may be damaging to you, you can usually mend the damage over time but harboring internal anger will damage you far more than the external consequences of backstabbing. If you approach the discussion with both an assertive and compassionate frame of mind, you're more likely to get somewhere than if you're hot-headed and righteous. The following things are important when talking with someone who has hurt you:


Stick with ""I"" statements, to express how you're impacted, how you're feeling about what has happened.
Remove judgmental statements that include ""you are... "". This will only cause the other person to feel threatened and defensive and they'll respond by fighting back and being spiteful instead of talking openly.
Maintain eye contact, keep your posture relaxed but straight (preferably standing with one foot slightly in front) and don't blink or look away a lot. Project confidence to make it harder for the backstabber to avoid taking you seriously.

, It is important to remain open-minded and to be prepared to understand what motivated the other person. You might discover that it is something that you did or said that motivated them, and that you might actually need to apologize and repair some bridges too. Even where you've done nothing to provoke their backstabbing behavior, be prepared to listen to their story. There can be a multitude of reasons and maybe they need someone to talk to, someone to confide in and in some peculiar way, you might just be the person who opens that door for them. Realize that if they feel OK about backstabbing you, they may have done it many times before and you might just be the first person who has been prepared to listen to them and not just ignore them or retaliate.

, After you've heard them out and responded to anything that you feel you need to explain, or accepted your share of the problem if necessary, then make it clear how you feel about where the two of you are headed in future situations. In the pre-script above, it was suggested that you make it clear to the backstabber that things change or you will take action to make sure that this person cannot harm you again. Let them know that you'd like to remain their friend/coworker/supporter but that this can only occur if they stop undermining you. It may be evident to you by this stage that you don't want any further interactions with them; if this is the case, be clear about it and let them know that your relations will remain civil and professional but nothing more.


Whatever you decide about staying in touch with them, at least let them know that you won't be saying anything negative about them, ever. That will likely be a shock to their system since they're so used to being negative about other people, that being made aware that someone else won't do this can be very eye-opening.
If the backstabber is someone in a position of authority, such as your boss, try to get a written record of the ""clarification procedures"" for fixing the situation that you've reached during your discussion.This way, you can refer to the written record if things aren't improving or you get into deeper problems later on.

, Bear in mind that forgiving a person doesn't mean you agree with them, or want to spend time with them; it's about enabling you to let go of what has happened to get on with your life, otherwise even if you banish them physically, you can end up carrying them in your head space.


Don't excuse their motivations, just be conscious of what causes people to behave the way they do. In turn, use this as a lesson for future encounters with this person and with people who have similar tendencies. Forewarned means that you'll be less vulnerable to such situations and more likely to take precautionary action that heads backstabbing behavior off before it occurs.

Whine a little.,
Take time (off).,
Get a stable income.,
Finish school.,
Quit the nasty habits.,
Start thinking proactively.,
Determine exactly who you want to be.",How to Start a New Life when You're at Rock Bottom1," That's right. That's the first step to starting over. You gotta feel what you're feeling. Clamming everything up will just make you explode later. And what's more: admitting this is how it is could fuel you to do something about it. Acknowledging your situation and not liking it is the only way you can do something about it. So go ahead. Whine. You're unsatisfied. That's how living works.


Talk about it. You know how dieters are supposed to have a diet buddy, or at least let the world know what they're going through? That's for support and accountability. It's the same principle here. Even if you just find one person, you'll have a friend to lean on and someone that can keep you on track when you slip. We all need that support.;
, The fact of the matter is that right now you need a break. Sometimes, life just needs to stop. In as much as you can actually do this, grab that Kit Kat and take a short hiatus. Start replenishing your energy bar for the massive endeavor you're about to rock, showing life who's boss.


If you have a job, you may need to take time off work. Not a long time -- nothing to get you fired. Just a day or two to assess and concentrate. Right now is all about you.

, There's a definite hierarchy of needs that all humans have. For most of us, it involves having money at our disposal. In order to have food on the table, you gotta have money in your pocket. You don't need a lot, but in order to move up the hierarchy (and to start thinking about climbing up), you need a stable income.


So to put it succinctly, if you're unemployed, start looking for work. Looking for work should take you 40 hours a week. In today's economy, it may not come easily, but it'll come. Keep your nose to the grindstone and leave no stone unturned, nor opportunity turned down.

, If you haven't finished high school, this is doubly important. In order to get a job, you'll need a GED. All it takes is pulling up a Google search and making a phone call to a local adult education center. Most places can help you work out a payment plan and want to see you on the right track. What's more, where's the harm in just asking?


If you have some college, but haven't graduated, consider going back. Not only will you up your employment options, but you'll feel good about yourself. You'll feel accomplished. After all, rock bottom is just a state of mind. There are plenty of people who others might consider to be on rock bottom that feel on top of the world. Finishing college could change your mindset entirely.

, If you're smoking, drinking, or partaking in other addictive behaviors on a constant basis, it needs to stop now. There is no personal advancement if it does not. In order to see progress, you cannot keep your old tricks. The buck stops here.


Imagine the person you want to be. Does that person have a dependency on anyone or anything else? When it comes to this self project, why settle for anything less than that ideal image? You owe it to you to be the best you can be. If you can't kick this habit, none of the new, better habits will fall into place.

, When you need to change everything about your situation and to completely start over in life you need to make some major adjustments between your ears. You need to think like a new person, act like a new person, dress like a new person, and surround yourself with new people, yes. However, to do this, you need to start thinking positively and with conviction. Put away the ""I can't,"" ""what if?"", and ""maybes."" There's no room for those here. This starting over? You're going to do it.


It's highly possible that training your brain to think differently could alleviate this situation entirely. What are you but your thoughts, anyway? While it's impossible to instruct someone on how to specifically do this, know that the rest of this page will make that process a lot easier. Thinking positively and with confidence will make all these steps doable.

, What will you look like. What will you dress like? What will your relationship look like? Where will you live? What car will you be driving? Take a good 15 minutes, close your eyes and really imagine the life you want down to what you feel like in that life. Take a good mental snapshot of your perfect life. You need to believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that this person you envisioned will be you.


You need an end point in order to know just how and where to start your journey. Where do you want to end up? What goals would you like to reach? Write it down. Everybody needs something to work to because none of us is perfect. Now's your chance to pick yours. This is what you'll be aiming for.

Drown out the sound.,
Move to another room.,
Plug your ears.,
Calm your mind with meditation.,
Distract yourself.",How to Sleep when Your Parents Are Arguing1," While you can probably sleep through low levels of sound, loud sounds like yelling can keep you awake. The best way to minimize the impact of loud sounds on your sleep is to drown out the sound. Ideally you’d use a sound machine, such as the kind that plays white noise or ocean waves. If you don’t have a sound machine, though, play soothing music at a low volume, which should help you sleep.Whatever noise you use to drown out the sound of your parents arguing, make sure that the volume isn’t too loud.
Classical music at a low volume is excellent to play when you’re trying to sleep.
If you have to use it, a television can help drown out noise. Bear in mind that a television may actually keep you awake, though.
As a last resort, if you choose to cover your ears with a pillow, make sure that you don’t obstruct your airway at all.;
, If your parents are arguing close to your room, go sleep in another room that’s further away from them. Moving to another room that’s further away should make it more difficult to hear them and easier for you to fall asleep. Make sure that you take your pillow and a blanket with you so that you’re warm and comfortable in the new room., If your parents fight frequently or if you have difficulty sleeping through noise, you might benefit from a pair of ear plugs. Ear plugs are specially designed to fit safely in your ears while blocking out external sounds. Most earplugs will dull the sounds around you but still allow you to hear sounds right next to you, making them an ideal sleep aid.Earplugs are great to have for other reasons too. Invest in a good pair to take with you when you go to shows, loud parties, will be near construction, or even a sporting event.

, Meditation helps calm your mind, breathing, and pulse, and, fortunately, you don’t have to sit in a full lotus position to reap the benefits. By calming your mind and focusing on clearing your thoughts, you will come to accept the argument as part of the space that you’re in, as opposed to an act that is happening outside your room.Practice these techniques when the house is relatively quiet so that you can get used to doing them.
Close your eyes and calmly breathe, in and out through your nose, focusing on the air moving in and out of your body.
Consider where you are – the room, the bed, the house – and accept every sound, light, and piece of furniture as a part of that space. Your parents arguing are a part of that space.
Accept that the space is as it is and focus on clearing your mind of distracting thoughts while tuning out distracting noise.

, It may be that they are just too loud and that you can’t fall asleep. Consider distracting yourself. Distracting yourself allows you to focus your mental energies on something other than their argument and your sleep efforts. Hopefully the distraction will help you put their argument in the background so that you can eventually fall asleep.What’s in your room that you would enjoy doing or looking at?
Do you have music or books?
Or do you like to draw or color?

Listen to music.",How to Relieve Stress Quickly1," The section of your brain that processes scent is close to the area that controls your emotions. As a result, happy smells can quickly and easily influence your mood.Rub a few drops of essential oils onto your wrists. Lavender is calming, while lemon and orange scents are great for a quick energy boost.
You can also use an essential oil diffuser in your home or office.;
, Black tea has been shown to reduce cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and promote feeling of relaxation. Even the ritual of preparing a cup of tea can be soothing. Furthermore, tea helps to keep you hydrated, which is great for both body and mind., One study shows that chewing gum can reduce anxiety and improve alertness.This method could not be simpler! Keep some gum in your bag or your desk at work. When you find yourself feeling stressed, bust out some gum and chew until you feel a lift in your mood.


Select a gum that is low in sugar, as this will be better for your teeth.

, Nature sounds (such as a babbling brook, a crackling fire, or bugs and birds chirping in the woods) can almost instantly reduce your stress level.Look for a cd, app, or podcast that has nature sounds you enjoy. Listen to these as stress prevention, or turn them on when you begin to feel overwhelmed.

, Music can help to relieve stress, reduce pain, and enhance your overall quality of life.Try listening to some music when you are feeling stressed to quickly and easily shift your mood.Create a stress-free playlist by selecting upbeat songs that you enjoy.
Anytime you feel stress creeping up, pull up your playlist and hit play.

Get outside groups involved.,
Report it to police.,
Register your school for an anti-bullying program.,
Understand that you’re not alone.,
Know that it’s not your fault.,
Remember there are people in your life who love and care about you.,
Realize that not all authority figures are competent in dealing with bullying.",How to Deal With Bullying when Authority Figures Are Unsupportive," If authority figures aren’t taking your bullying issues seriously, then it’s up to you to understand the rules regarding bullying.


Unfortunately, there are no federal laws, which specifically pertain to bullying.However there are laws and policies regarding bullying at the state level.
Visit http://www.stopbullying.gov/laws/ to learn about your particular state’s laws and/or policies.
The site includes information about how to report incidents of bullying for students and their families, as well as staff. It also outlines how to submit information anonymously.Know that bullying laws exist to protect people based on their race, sex and religion.
One thing to note about bullying laws pertaining to religion is that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 doesn't directly specify religion. However, religious based harassment such as ethnic characteristics, is covered.;
, Thankfully, nearly all states have bullying laws. However, they have been slower to institute policies pertaining to cyberbullying. Unfortunately, cyberbullying is often more traumatic than traditional bullying.Know that you can report instances of cyber bullying, regardless of whether state laws or policies are in place.
It may be civil rather than criminal, but individuals have been prosecuted for cyberbullying, using laws currently in place., Whether it’s in the school mission statement or code of conduct, most schools do have a policy regarding bullying. However, once you enter the workforce, you may not encounter something as clear cut.


If you’re dealing with bullying at school request a copy of the school code of conduct. If a teacher won’t provide you with one, go to the principal of guidance counselor.
At the workplace, ask a human resources representative about the bullying policy. There’s no guarantee they’ll have one, but it is worth inquiring about before moving forward.

, If you haven’t already discussed the issues you’re facing, now is the time to talk with family members.


This is particularly important for younger people, as parents may need to be involved per the school’s policy.
For adults, seeking advice from your spouse is often helpful in knowing what to do next.
Most importantly, you should have an outlet, someone to talk to about how you’re feeling and what you’re experiencing.

, If your immediate authority figure, such as a teacher, isn’t responsive to your issue; find someone who is.


At school that might be a principal or a guidance counselor. In the workplace, if it’s not your boss, it may be a human resources representative or another supervisor.
Ideally you want to find someone in your organization who will support you and help to resolve any bullying issues.

, If you aren’t able to resolve the issue within your organization, it may be time to seek help from local authorities.


Call your local police station ahead of time to find out what information they need.
They can give you a better idea as to what the procedure is and what steps will be taken once a report has been filed.

, This will not only be helpful for work or school officials, but may be required by the police should you choose to report the incident to them.Effective documentation should include assessing the nature and prevalence of bullying at school and tracking suspected and confirmed incidents of bullying.
Try to be as specific as you can when you're addressing the nature of what took place. Record the dates each event took place as well.

, Peer mediation is one common strategy for dealing with issues between students.You may be required to start with peer mediation per your school’s policy.


There are serious disadvantages to peer mediation. Bullying is more than a conflict; it's victimization.During peer mediation the child who is being bullied should understand that the school is doing everything they can to stop it and that no one deserves to be bullied.If you feel intimidated or as if any of the blame is being placed on you during peer mediation, stop the session immediately.

, For more help in getting authorities within your organization to address bullying, try getting an outside group or the media involved.


Contact groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which can offer their help, particularly for discriminatory based bullying.
You may also want to contact your local media outlets. They often have a call for action number or email address, where you can outline the problem you've been facing. It's not a guarantee that they'll feature you on their station, but it's a good avenue to try when no one else will listen.

, If peer mediation has failed or if authorities within your organization aren’t taking your complaint seriously, it’s time to go to the police.


Have your documentation on hand, which outlines the incidents that took place and when they occurred.
Call ahead to see who you should speak with and what day/time they are on-duty.

, For school aged kids who have experienced bullying, help to make sure other kids don’t have to go through the same thing by enrolling your school in an anti-bullying program.


One such program is PACERs, Champion Against Bullying. Ask someone within your organization, be it a principal, teacher or guidance counselor, to sign up.

, Bullying can feel like a lonely experience. However, 25 percent of kids experience bullying, so you're not alone in what you're going through.Sadly, many kids and adults alike have experienced bullying at some point in their life.
There are kids at school and, for adults, others within your workplace, who can relate to what you’re going through. Reach out to them for support!
Organizations such as PACER.org are also dedicated to connecting individuals who have been bullied.
Even if you don’t feel comfortable getting involved in an organization, browse through their online materials. It will hopefully help you to feel more connected to others who have been in a similar situation.

, While it may not always feel like it, realize that you are not to blame for the bullying. The bully may be frustrated or discontented in their own lives and want to make you feel as badly as they do by having control over your feelings.Regardless of who you are, what you believe in or what you’ve done in your life, the person at fault is not you!
Nobody deserves to be bullied - always keep that in mind!

, Whether it’s a friend, a parent or another family member, there are people who care deeply about you. Reach out to those people and let them know what’s going on.


Ask them for their support as you move forward. Having people you trust who can encourage and support you will boost your resilience when being bullied.It’s particularly important, if you don’t have the support of your authority figure, to have the support of others!

, One of the best ways to cut down on bullying is to have a person within the organization who actively reacts and responds to bullying as soon as it happens.Unfortunately, not all authority figures are equipped to deal with bullying. Whether it’s lack of education, ignorance, or downright disbelief that bullying exists; some authority figures are clueless.
There may also be biases involved regarding race, creed and sexual orientation.

Tell yourself that everything is going to be alright.,
Find mental games or psychological tools to cope with your anxiety.,
Take deep breaths.,
Make a list of things that are bothering you.,
Avoid stimulants.,
Try meditation, yoga, or light exercise.,
Identify the source of your anxiety, if you don't know it.,
Try creating a bedtime routine.",How to Sleep With Severe Anxiety1," Often times, our anxiety is caused by a mix of rational and irrational fears that compound upon each other and drive us toward having a panic attack. This, understandably, can undermine our ability to get some sleep. In order to counter this problem, simply tell yourself that everything is going to be alright.Reassure yourself that your anxiety is momentary and will soon pass.
Tell yourself that while your fears are rational, you might be overreacting at the moment.
Repeat “I am okay, I’ll be alright” or something similar to yourself over and over again.
Try saying something like ""I tried to do my very best today. I'm worried, but it's not doing me any good right now to worry. I'll solve more problems tomorrow."";
, Sometimes we’re able to find some games or other intellectual tools that will help put us at ease and forget about our anxieties. These games or other tools are intended to distract you from your problem and to put your mind at ease. Some things you can try include:Repeating a mantra to yourself. This could be anything, from a funny poem or a nonsensical statement to a spiritual or religious statement.
Solving an abstract problem that bothers you on a purely intellectual level. Such a problem could be from the existence of god to whether black holes actually exist. Such problems are trivial to the extent that they won’t impact our daily lives (and panic us more) but are very important on an existential level.
Counting sheep, stars, or dimples in your popcorn ceiling. Such activities will help distract you from the larger problems bothering you and may help put you to sleep.

, Many times when we’re anxious, we’re also breathing rapidly and not taking real deep and consistent breaths. In order to overcome your anxiety, try to breathe deeply and consistently.Take a deep breath.
Count to five and then exhale.
Repeat this exercise. Change your count if it is helpful.

, If you’re anxious about money, obligations, or job related issues, try to make a list about these things. Sometimes, making a mental or written list of your problems will provide a sense of control or order where there was none before.Grab a pen or pencil and jot down what is bothering you.
Make a quick plan about how you are going to resolve your issues.
Tell yourself that you’ve tackled your problems and have created order in your life. Things will be better soon.

, One thing you definitely need to do is avoid any stimulant that might give you excess energy or keep you awake. In fact, stimulants might make your situation worse by deepening your anxiety. Avoid:Caffeine. This includes 5-hour energy, carbonated drinks, chocolate, coffee, and tea.
Cigarettes
Sugary drinks.
Controlled substances such as methamphetamine.

, One way to relax yourself is to try meditation, yoga, or light exercise. These activities can help calm you by putting your mind at ease. In addition, they may help you dispel excess energy.


Meditate. Sit in a quiet environment, breathe deeply, and close your eyes. Focus on your breathing and your still and quiet state. Keep other thoughts out of your mind. Repeat this for as long as you need.
Practice yoga. Yoga, and the stretching exercises associated with it, may help relax your mind and body and help you get to sleep. If you are not familiar with yoga, search for a yoga for beginners website on the internet and try some of the most basic yoga sets.
Do some light exercise. Light exercise, such as pushups, running in place, or jumping jacks, might help you release excess energy and put you in a focused and even relaxed mindset. Don't overdo it though. Just do a little exercise until you feel more relaxed.

, Perhaps identifying the source of your anxiety will help you relax. Spend a little time thinking about why you are so anxious. There is a good chance that your anxiety is caused by something you can't quite identify and is lurking in the back of your mind.Think about things that might be bothering you.
Make a list of things that are stressing you out.
If you can identify the source and importance of anxiety, this may put you at ease and allow you to sleep.

, Following the same routine every night before bed can be a comforting way to soothe yourself at night.Try developing a routine that you can follow every night to help yourself relax and prepare for sleep.


For example, you might start by taking a bubble bath or shower, then brush your teeth and put on pajamas. Next, you might sip a cup of warm herbal tea while listening to some soothing music.

Document the comment.,
Don't post a response.,
Report the comments.,
Change your privacy settings.",How to Deal With Mean Comments on the Internet2," Sometimes comments cross the line between mean and bullying. If the comments get sexually graphic, violent, threatening, humiliating or if the same person (or people) posts lots of mean comments about you, then it is cyberbullying.You should save some form of evidence of it so that you can report it.


If the comment references race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disabilities it can be considered discrimination.People often go back and delete mean comments they post on social media, so document the comment as soon as you see it.
Take a screenshot of the comment. Try to make sure you get the time, date, and sender’s name in the shot.
Keep a journal documenting where the comment was posted, what exactly it said or showed, who sent it, etc.

, Even though you may want to retaliate, stand up for yourself, or defend yourself in a reply post, it’s not a good idea. Responding to a cyberbully might make you feel better for a minute or two, but in the end, it will only make things worse.The person wants a response from you and will probably use anything you post in response as a way to harass you even more.
A response from you could bring extra attention to the situation and upset you even more.
Write what you would post in response to the comment in your journal or in an email to yourself, instead.

, Telling someone of authority like the site administrators or even a teacher is the best way to deal with cyber-bullying.They will be able to help you make the bully stop leaving mean comments (even if the person sends them anonymously).


If you are a child or teen, tell an adult like your parent or teacher about the comments. They can help you handle the situation and report it to the right people.
Make sure you send or show them your documentation of the comment. It will make it easier and quicker to stop the bully.
Some social networking sites have places like Facebook’s ‘Safety Center’ where you can report cyberbullying.
If the comment threatens something physical or sexual you should also report it to the police.

, Consider setting your email, messaging, and social media accounts up so that only people you know (or no one) can leave comments without you reviewing them first. Doing this will make it harder for the cyberbully to contact you and leave mean comments.If possible, block the person that has been cyberbullying you. This may mean deleting them as an online ‘friend’. Check with the site or app for specific directions on doing this.
Send their email messages directly to your ‘spam’ or ‘trash’ folder or use your email provider’s block feature.

Use meditation as a coping technique.,
Try deep-breathing.,
Express how you feel.,
Focus on the positive about yourself.,
Use positive self-talk with yourself.,
Go offline.",How to Deal With Mean Comments on the Internet3," Even if it is just one comment, a mean post on the internet can be stressful and hurt your feelings or make you feel bad about yourself. Using coping techniques like meditation can help you deal with the effects the mean comments are having on you.Sit or lie somewhere comfortable and allow your body to relax as much as possible.
Focus your mind on your breathing or on relaxing your body more. You may want to focus on a phrase or word like “Calm” or “I am relaxed”.
You can use meditation when a mean comment has you extra stressed, as well as practice it regularly to improve your health and well-being overall.

, Controlling and slowing your breathing can help you when you are feeling anxious or upset about a mean comment.Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to feel the breath all the way to your belly.
Hold it for a few seconds, then slowly exhale through your mouth.
Repeat this as many times as you need to. Try to take longer to inhale, hold it for longer, and take longer to exhale with each breathe.

, Mean comments can affect you when you read them, as well as for a while after that. You may feel betrayed, angry, depressed, confused, or sad. Don’t ignore how you are feeling. The best way to deal with the way the comments make you feel is to acknowledge it.


Talk to someone close to you about how the comments make you feel and why they make you feel this way.
”You might say, “Someone left a mean comment on my page and it really made me feel bad. Can I talk to you about it?”
Write about how you feel in your journal. Write down each feeling and why you think the comment made you feel this way. Write about how you can feel better.
Talk to someone like a parent, religious leader, or therapist if the comments are causing you to become depressed, lose sleep or affect your eating habits.

, Don’t let the bully win by beating yourself up or believing the comments.Instead, deal with the mean comments by thinking about all the good things about you and the positive things in your life.


Make a list of all the positive things about you. Include things about your personality, skills and talents you have.
Look over your list frequently, but make a special effort to look over it after you receive a mean comment. This will help you deal with the comment without feeling bad about yourself.
Look at the nice and positive comments that people have sent you on the internet. Add any words they use to your list.

, It can be easy to start believing what the mean comments say and to start using negative self-talk like, “I AM stupid” or “I must be ugly”. Protect your self-esteem and your feelings by using positive self-talk to protect your feelings.Any time you notice that you have thought something negative about yourself, immediately tell yourself the thought wasn’t true and remind yourself how great you are.
For example, you might say to yourself, “These comments aren’t true. I am a good person, people like me, and I like myself.”

, It’ll be much easier to deal with mean comments on the internet if you aren’t always on the online.So, turn your electronic device off and do something that you enjoy or to improve yourself. You’ll handle your feelings about being cyberbullied better if you do.


Spend time with friends and family in-person instead of online. They can help you deal with the mean comments, have fun, and feel better about yourself.
Do something active like going for a bike ride, taking a hike, or doing martial arts. It will give you time away from the internet and support your health.
Take a class or volunteer in your community. You’ll have the chance to meet new positive people as well as improve yourself or your community.

Take a shower.,
Start exercising.,
Concentrate on eating more healthily.,
Make an effort on the outside.",How to Start a New Life when You're at Rock Bottom2," It may sound a little funny, but in order to get your mind clean, you gotta get your body clean. To start fresh, you gotta be fresh. Being dragged down by the dirt of the day will only be a reminder of your present situation.


Like we discussed earlier -- ""rock bottom"" is very much so a mental state and therefore can come and go with ease. Showers (and other seemingly pointless endeavors) then become tricks of the trade in that they can relax you, take away stress, and cue your mind that it's time to start over. You're not just getting clean -- you're getting prepared.

, Seems a little ridiculous, on the outside, huh? What kind of person at rock bottom has the will (or maybe the means) to exercise? But the thing is you can't think of these things in such a linear fashion. In fact, you gotta think backwards. Does the successful person exercise or does the exerciser become successful? Is it the chicken or the egg we should be addressing?


The first thing to go when you're down in the dumps is your body. You lie in bed all day, only greeting the sun to tell it to go away. To make matters worse, it's a vicious cycle that only propagates itself. Your body starts to drag and then your mind goes with it. When you exercise, your mind starts taking cues from your body instead of the other way around. You feel better, you look better, and you are better when you exercise -- enabling you to tackle the other parts of this insane world.

, All of a sudden it becomes hours upon hours of TV dinners, boxed wine, tubs of ice cream, and piles of self-loathing. After the binge, you feel absolutely terrible -- thus forcing the process to repeat. The only thing you can do then is lie on the couch and pray for a release from the impending indigestion. Not very productive, huh?


Food should make you feel energized, not lethargic and full of reproach. After a healthy meal, your body feels better and you feel better. Are you noticing a pattern? Getting out of a rock bottom is about feeling good enough (not being good enough) to do something about it. Eating healthy is part of the mental trickery to get your mind speeding down the track to Awesome Town.

, For the record, this point is not at all endorsing materialism or vanity. That being said, looking good on the outside can make you feel good on the inside. So after you take that shower (post-workout), throw on a nice outfit and go socialize. You've earned it.


Knowing you look good can change your outlook on everything -- and how people treat you too (sad, but true). You'll find an inner source of confidence that can ultimately change your behavior (for the better). The world will probably be a bit kinder to you and in turn it's easier to be kinder to yourself.

Stop the negativity.,
Reestablish old hobbies and find new ones.,
Make an every day to-do list.,
Help others.,
Surround yourself with positive influences.,
Move.",How to Start a New Life when You're at Rock Bottom3," You! Stop it. You know how it works. Instead of thinking thoughts that are helpful and rational you end up thinking things like, ""I'm a complete failure -- I'll never amount to anything regardless of what I do, so why bother trying?"" Here's some news for you: Those thoughts are not facts. They are feelings. And feelings can change.


When you catch yourself thinking something negative, either force yourself to immediately stop it in its tracks or add on something to make it better. ""I'm a complete failure"" turns into, ""I'm a complete failure at this one thing today. Tomorrow is another story."" Take yourself out of the black and white. Nothing is 100%. When they said, ""This too shall pass,"" this is what they were talking about.

, Between naps and box sets of the Golden Girls, it's easy to lose track of who you once were. In order to snap out of the rut, you gotta do things that you may not want to do -- and keeping up your old (pre-rock bottom) life is one of them. If you used to play music, force yourself to play music. If you used to love cooking, cook. It may be the last thing you want to do, but rediscovering what once brought you joy could be just the catalyst for change you need.


In addition to keeping up old habits (the good ones), new ones work just as well! Staying active (both physically and mentally) will force you out of this lackluster, lethargic thought-path you've been squeezed into. Are there any opportunities at your school or workplace? Is a friend trying something out that seems interesting to you? What could be a valuable way to spend your free time? In other words, what could distract you?

, That damn villain called lethargy strikes daily. Morning rolls around and the only reason to get out of bed is to go to the bathroom. This is where the to-do list comes in handy. On it, write all the little things you want to accomplish for the day. It doesn't have to be world-changing, it just has to get you out of bed and being productive.


It all depends on where you are in the process. It could be something like ""send in 5 applications, ""go for a 2 mile (3.2 km) run,"" or ""talk to a new person."" Think of a few things you'd like to see come to life in the near future -- what are small things you could do every day to achieve them?

, Another trick to get out of your world and more wrapped up in the world of others (which can be a much less scary and intimidating place) is to help others. Not only will you make them feel good, but making them feel good will make you feel good. Instant gratification.


Seek out the little opportunities in addition to the bigger ones. Offering to walk an elderly neighbor's dog, helping a pregnant woman with her groceries, help someone in your family -- all these little deeds add up. You'll gain a sense of purpose, possibly make friends, and just make the world better. That's three wins in one.

, It's very possible that the crowd you're around is to blame for this rocky place you're up against. Hate to break it to you, but those around us can be total drains on our potential. Is it possible the relationships you have are making you a little worse for the wear? If the answer is even a maybe, it'll be best for you to put your efforts elsewhere.


Sometimes it's necessary to end toxic friendships. We grow as people and our friends don't meet these new identities we find. It's totally normal. If any of your friends (or significant others) don't fill you with joy, maybe it's time for them to go.

, Obviously this is easier said than done, but if your present circumstances are highly dictated by location (no job opportunities, no friends to speak of), you may want to consider moving -- if it's financially feasible. It doesn't have to be a big move, but a change of scenery could do you some serious good. What better way to rejuvenate you than to rejuvenate all of your senses?


With a move, soon enough you'll forget all about your former life. Who were you once, anyway? If bad memories are associated with where you are currently, give this idea serious thought. Is there anywhere you could go but still maintain your support network? Sit down with yourself and ask if this process (arduous though it may be) would be worthwhile. It's like getting handed a whole new world.

Be patient with yourself.,
Focus during the transitions.,
Cultivate a passion.,
Get into a satisfying routine.",How to Start a New Life when You're at Rock Bottom4," Straight up, starting a new life doesn't happen overnight. It could take years. You'll probably be making such constant small progress that you won't even notice. Imagine losing 1/16th of a pound a day. You're not going to be able to tell for a long time -- but one day your clothes will be far, far too big.


By the time you do notice, you'll probably be so awesome, happy, and content that rock bottom seems like it barely ever existed. Until the moment comes when you wake up and realize, ""Crap. That used to be me, didn't it?"" take your time. It'll come. It always does. It's always darkest before the dawn, remember?

, This is another way of saying, ""Slow down before the speed bumps."" There are going to be times when you're about to lose it -- when you feel on the cusp of falling back to where you used to be, only worse (is there a worse than rock bottom?). It's these times when focusing, staying positive, and realizing this is totally normal are absolutely mandatory.


You're striking a serious balancing act between your old life and your new life right now, and that can get pretty daunting. No one expects you to do it with your hands tied behind your back and one eye closed. In fact, we expect you to lean on us for support. That's what we're here for. Though the transitions will be messy, know that they're only temporary. Focus and you'll get through them.

, You're on the up and up. Fan-fricking-tastic. Now it's time to find something new. Something fulfilling. Something to drive you. Something to keep those demons at bay. What does your mind immediately jump to? Any passion will do as long as you're passionate about it. It'll take up your time, use your creativity, and give you purpose. All wonderful, wonderful things.


Being truly good at something is so rewarding. Being truly good at something you really, really enjoy is even more rewarding. Cultivating a passion, regardless of what it is, can do great things for your sense of self. You'll get so well-established that rock bottom isn't a place on your map anymore. It got erased.

, Now that you have all these new ideas that are fresh and exciting, you've gotta stabilize and make them just part of your everyday world. It might take a few weeks, but balancing work, a social life, your passions, and free time will eventually all fall into place. There's no reason it shouldn't.


The good news here is that the routine will help shape itself. As long as you keep your priorities in line (taking care of your body and your mind, like we covered), it'll fall into place.

Understand that it's not your fault.,
Don’t jump to conclusions.,
Accept that you feel their argument.,
Talk with someone.",How to Sleep when Your Parents Are Arguing2," The first thing to do is remember that even though your parents are arguing, it's not your fault. No matter how much it might seem that way. Blaming yourself for it just won't help anyone. Your parents are the adults and their argument is theirs. It’s not your fault and you should not feel guilty about them arguing.You may have done something wrong that you think started their argument. Accept responsibility and punishment for what you’ve done, and also remember that their argument is separate from your actions.

, You may hear pieces of their argument, or you may hear what you believe is the whole thing. There is certainly more to the story than what you’re overhearing, though. Don’t jump to conclusions – don’t assume that anyone is moving, that anyone did anything wrong, or that your family dynamic is going to change. Let your parents have their argument and focus on getting to sleep.It’s normal to worry when your parents argue, and it’s also difficult not to jump to conclusions. Jut remind yourself that you don’t know the whole story and that worrying won’t do you or them any good.

, You might think that you’re not bothered by their argument and that you’d just like to get some sleep. Science shows that you will react to your parents’ distress, and that’s normal and healthy. Once you recognize that you will react to their distress, you can acknowledge the emotions and hopefully limit their impact on you.The most common reaction is anxiety, whether you realize that you’re feeling it or not.
You will likely have physical reactions too, such as increased heart rate and cortisol spikes, and these can definitely keep you awake.

, If you’re able, talk with someone – your friend, your pet, your sibling, even your stuffy. Who or what you talk to isn’t as important as the act of talking, which allows you to unburden yourself. You can talk about your feelings, your fears, your frustrations, and cry if necessary. You won't be alone. Nobody is going to judge you for talking about your feelings.If you have a phone and permission to be on it, call a friend.
Or, if you have permission to be on the computer, send them a message.
If it’s too late for you to be on any technological devices, talk to a stuffy, your pillow, the cosmos, just talk.

Ask your parents to quiet down.,
Tell them that you need resolution.,
Tell them how you’re feeling.,
Protect yourself.",How to Sleep when Your Parents Are Arguing3," If it’s safe to do so and you feel comfortable doing so, calmly let your parents know that you can hear their argument, that it’s upsetting you, and that it’s preventing you from going to sleep.Be calm and don’t accuse them of anything.
Only ask them to quiet down if you’re comfortable that you will be safe doing so.
“Mom and Dad, I know that you’re unhappy right now and that you’re trying to work that out. But I can hear you arguing and it’s keeping me awake. I really want to go to sleep now and am wondering if you might lower your voices please.”
You can also just say, “Please, stop arguing. You’re really upsetting me and I'm scared""

, Arguments are never pleasant, especially when you only overhear parts of the argument and don’t know the whole story or how everything ended up. Explain to your parents that you respect their space and that their argument is theirs, but that you need to know that they’ve achieved resolution about the issue.They may tell you that they’d prefer not to discuss it, and that’s something you’ll need to prepare for.

, If it’s safe to approach them while your parents are arguing, you might choose to ask if they can talk with you about your feelings. You might, on the other hand, do best to wait until everyone has calmed down and they are likely to be more receptive to what you’re saying. No matter when you decide to have the conversation, letting your parents know how their arguing makes you feel will let them know that they are impacting you, and it might also help you sleep better because you’ll have talked with someone and gotten some resolution.Be calm and don’t accuse them of anything.
Tell them how you feel. “When you argue, I feel scared that one of you is going to leave. It makes me sad even after you’re done fighting.”

, If you suspect or know that the argument has turned violent, your safety must be your biggest priority. Don't confront your parents and don't attempt to separate them if they are in a physical altercation. If you fear for your (or another's) safety, you need to call for help.Call emergency services, if needed. You might be afraid of getting in trouble, but remember, everyone's safety is your priority.
If you have siblings, quietly try to get everyone in the same room.
If you need to, get out of the house and get to safety - a neighbor's house, a friend or family member's house, or even the local police station.
Lock your door - this will block someone from freely entering your room.

Take a shower.,
Lie with your legs up the wall.,
Dance.,
Go for a walk.,
Give yourself a massage.",How to Relieve Stress Quickly2," Showering is a wonderful way to reset, interrupt anxiety, and reduce stress. Particularly if you’ve been stuck in a slump, just hopping in the shower is an excellent way to practice self-care and give your self-esteem a boost. Furthermore, the physical sensations of showering (hot water, happy smells, self-touch) are excellent for relieving stress., “Legs up the wall pose” or “viparita karani” is a wonderful yoga pose for reducing stress. This posture improves circulation to your head and upper body. It also provides rest for your central nervous system.Sit down on the floor and scoot your bottom as close as possible to the wall.
Relax your upper body to the floor.
Bring your legs up in the air to rest against the wall.
Stay here for ten minutes.

, Dancing is excellent for relieving stress in two ways: it exposes you to upbeat music and it provides all the benefits of exercise.You can achieve these benefits in just a few minutes. Anytime you begin to feel stressed, get up and dance for the length of one song. You can even schedule these mini-dance breaks into your workday to provide a regular release.

, Any form of aerobic exercise has been shown to calm nerves and improve moods. Walking can be a quick and simple way to receive these benefits. One study shows that a brisk 30 minute walk can be as effective as taking a tranquilizer.But even a 5 or 10 minute stroll can do wonders for relieving stress.


Any time you feel stressed out, go for a quick walk.
Work your way up to walking for 30 minutes at a time.
Do this a few times a week (or even every day) to minimize stress and feel good.

, Massage has been proven to relieve stress and promote well being. But you don’t need to visit a professional! You can get these same benefits by massaging yourself.Start with an easy massage for your eyes. (This is perfect if you have been staring at a computer.)


Close your eyes.
Place your thumbs under your eyebrows.
Apply pressure and move your thumbs in tiny circles, moving towards the outsides of your brows.
Continue this movement around your eyes.

Be present.,
Breathe deeply.,
State an affirmation.,
Laugh.,
Perform a “body scan.” A body scan is an easy meditative practice that can relieve stress and help you feel grounded.This can be done in as little as 30 seconds.",How to Relieve Stress Quickly3," Anxiety often occurs when we worry about the future or past. Spend a few minutes actively focusing on the present. Choose one simple task, such as washing the dishes or making a cup of tea. Take five minutes to focus intently on that one task, taking in as many details as you can. At the end of these five minutes, you will find yourself more at ease., Taking deep breaths is an excellent way to bring your focus into the present moment. Furthermore, focused breathing has been shown to slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure, which both have a profound effect on your stress level.Take 5-10 slow deep breaths.
Concentrate on making your inhale the same length as your exhale.
Inhale through your nose and exhale through either your nose or mouth.

, An affirmation is a positive statement about yourself. Affirmations can be written out, or recited in your mind, but they have the greatest impact when spoken aloud.Prepare some affirmations ahead of time. Do you experience anxiety when you try to write? A good option might be “I am a good writer.”
When anxiety and stress bubble up for you, calmly state your affirmation.
It may help to look in the mirror as you do so.
Other affirmation ideas include: I am a good person; I deserve to be happy; I am good at my job; and I am beautiful.

, Laughter has been proven to stimulate the production of beta-endorphins in the brain. In fact, even anticipating a laugh can stimulate this production. If you find yourself in a stressful moment, take some time to locate something funny. Even if you don’t laugh out loud, the anticipation might be enough!Look for a humorous video.
Recall a funny experience with friends.
Listen to a comedy podcast.

, The idea is to bring awareness to each part of the body; not to judge or even to change it.


If you have space, lie down on the floor. (If you don’t have space, that’s okay. You can perform the body scan seated in a chair.)
Close your eyes and begin by noticing any part of your body that is touching the floor (or chair).
Relax any part of your body that is holding tension (usually the jaw, neck, and shoulders).
Starting at your toes, begin scanning your body, part by part.
Imagine that you are taking a tour of your body, not evaluating, simply observing.
End your scan at the top of your head.

Call a friend.,
Try melatonin supplements.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Seek mental health counseling.,
Recruit the family pet.",How to Sleep With Severe Anxiety2," Sometimes we just need a little reassurance and a friendly voice to help us relax. If calming yourself does not work, try to call a friend (if a friend is available). Hopefully, the soothing voice on the other end of the phone will help put you at ease and help you get to sleep.Make sure to call someone who is already familiar with your anxiety problems so you won’t need to explain your situation.
Try talking to a friend who will only listen and not add more to the conversation. Talking to someone who will make you worry more will not help you.
Always make sure to call your friend the next day after you’ve settled down and thank them for their time.

, One way to get to sleep when anxious is to take melatonin supplements. Melatonin is a chemical that naturally occurs in our bodies and helps us go to sleep. If you’re lucky, a little melatonin will go a long way and put you to sleep in a jiffy.Melatonin is sold over the counter in 1, 2, 3, and 5 milligram tablets.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about using melatonin before you take it.
Do not take melatonin with alcohol or other controlled substances.

, If your anxiety is consistently undermining your ability to get to sleep, you should talk to a medical professional. Your doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist or diagnose your problem.If anxiety undermines your ability to sleep consistently over a short amount of time, make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.
Be truthful and honest with your doctor about what is causing your anxiety.
If appropriate, seek help from a psychologist or psychiatrist.
A doctor might put you on anxiety medicines or prescription sleep aids.

, One way to deal with persistent anxiety that interferes with your sleep is to get professional mental health counseling. A mental health counselor (whether a counselor, a psychiatrist, or a psychologist) will talk to you and help you identify the source of your anxiety.Psychiatrists might choose to treat you with medication.
Many counselors or psychologists will allow you to talk about your problems and work through them in a structured environment.
Some counselors might choose cognitive behavioral therapy, a technique widely used to treat anxiety.

, If you’ve got a pet in your household, you may want to consider recruiting them and stationing them nearby to make you feel relaxed and loved. Who knows, your dog’s snoring might relax you and help put you to sleep.Lure your dog nearby with a treat or a bone. If it’s okay with you, invite them to sleep in the bed with you.
Try to get your family cat to snuggle with you. It is possible that your cat’s purring might soothe you and put you to sleep.
Relocate yourself to the vicinity of your gerbil or ferret’s habitat. Just being near a cute little animal might help to relax you and relieve your anxiety.

Turn off any distractions.,
Darken your room.,
Utilize soothing sounds.,
Make yourself as comfortable as you can.,
Gather items that make you feel safe.",How to Sleep With Severe Anxiety3," The first step you need to take is to eliminate all and any distractions that can inhibit your sleep. As a result, after you’ve located where you’ll sleep, go around and systematically eliminate distractions.Shut off your radio, unless the music or program playing on it helps soothe your anxiety.
Turn the television off. While television could entertain you and relieve anxiety, it is more likely that it will keep your mind active and stop you from sleeping.
Silence your cellphone.
Mask your clock and don’t worry about time. However, if you have an obligation to attend to, make sure to set your alarm clock.
Turn off your laptop or tablet.

, Darkening your room will in many cases help soothe your anxiety and help you get to sleep. This is for a number of reasons, including the fact that visual stimuli and light may help keep your mind active and contribute to anxiety. In addition, bright lights are known to inhibit the release of melatonin in your body – a chemical that is important for sleep health.Shut off lights.
Close your blinds.
Turn off any electronics that might have bright lights or LED displays.

, Many people can rely on soothing sounds to help calm their mind and help put them to sleep. Such sounds depend on the person, so make sure you know what is calming and soothing for you before you turn anything on. Consider:


White noise. White noise may help relax you and put you in a mood to sleep.
Classical music. Classical music also has a calming effect and can help soothe you and put you to sleep.
Any other noises, sound tracks, or programs that relax you, make you feel safe, and won’t keep your mind active.

, Often times, making ourselves as comfortable as possible can help put us to sleep. Comfort not only has the ability to relax us and help us sleep, but to distract us from things that bother us and cause anxiety.Turn the thermostat to the perfect temperature for your comfort, whether hot or cold.
Find a bed or couch that is the most comfortable place to be. Sometimes our beds are not the most relaxing places for us. If you prefer the couch, go sleep there.
Grab some pillows and blankets. Don’t deprive yourself of pillows or blankets. If you need an extra blanket to be comfortable, grab a clean one.

, Part of creating a relaxing environment is to gather items that make you feel safe and relaxed. Whatever these items are, they might help put you at ease and help you go to sleep. Consider:An old teddy bear from when you were a young child.
Pictures of loved ones that make you happy.
Your favorite keepsake from last Christmas or anything similar that might make you feel safe.

Many teenagers try on different personas and experiment with different value sets from the ones they were raised with. It's an important part of growing up, and without that exploration, an adult risks finding himself without a consciously-chosen identity.If you've never explored your identity at any point in your life, doing so now will be an important step in resolving your identity crisis.


Think about the qualities and characteristics that define you as you are today.Examine your values. What is most important to you? What principles define how you live? How were they formed, and who influenced you in adopting those values?Assess whether those qualities and values have changed over the course of your life, or remained fairly constant. Whether or not they have changed, examine why that has been the case.;
, Everyone feels adrift from time to time. When you do, it's important to figure out what grounds you back in your day-to-day life.For many people, the things that are most grounding are our relationships with other people. Friends, relatives, colleagues, and romantic partners all form a network of relationships that we choose to surround ourselves with.


Think about the relationships that mean the most to you. How have those relationships shaped you, for better or worse?Now think about why those relationships are important to you. Why do you surround yourself with the people you choose to be with?If relationships do not ground you, think about why that is. Are you someone who does not seek out intimacy with others? Is that something you like about yourself, or something you wish to change?
Ask yourself honestly whether you would still be the same person without the relationships that you have had throughout your life.

, In addition to relationships, personal interests are often what help keep people grounded in life. Whether you realize it or not, your relationships and your hobbies/interests probably occupy most of your free time outside of work or school. You may have chosen your interests because of your personality and identity, or perhaps your sense of self was shaped by those interests and hobbies. Either way, these are crucial to understanding who you are at heart.Think about how you spend your free time. Which interests or hobbies do you spend the most time and energy on?
Now consider why those interests are important to you. Have you always had these interests? Have they defined you since you were young, or are they more recent acquisitions? Why did you develop those interests in the first place?
Ask yourself honestly, would you still be the same person without those interests?

, One way to feel more secure in your sense of self and more confident in who you want to be is to practice visualizing your best possible future self. This exercise forces you to examine your current self, then visualize and write about the best possible version of yourself you can realistically work toward becoming.Set aside 20 minutes to perform the visualization exercise.Imagine your life in the near future, focusing on specific aspects of your life that will have gone as well as possible.Write down the details of what you imagined for yourself.Think about ways to make the vision you have for yourself become a reality. Recall the future you've imagined any time you feel stuck or otherwise lost in life, and use it to center yourself., Loss and change can be devastating, but they also offer us new opportunities to evaluate who we are and what we are doing. Chances are your goals and dreams are different now than they were five or ten years ago, and yet you may have become blind to that change because of habit and circumstance.Any time you suffer a loss or a sudden change, use it as an opportunity to reassess and re-evaluate your life. Many people see a loved one's death, for example, as a wakeup call to do things differently or stop putting off long-term goals. A job loss can also be a wakeup call to find a job that offers more happiness and fulfillment.Ask yourself honestly if your current goals and personal values are the same as they used to be. If they are not, find ways to incorporate your new goals and values into your life., Many people fear change, especially big changes that can seem life-altering. But change isn't always a bad thing - in fact, it's normal and healthy for our circumstances to change, and some experts advise that anyone going through change should adapt and modify their identity, rather than resisting inevitable change.Ask yourself if, in ten or twenty years, you would regret not having taken a chance at trying something new or doing things differently.Allow yourself to go through a process of self-discovery. Figure out what it is that you want most in life, and find a way to work toward that goal from your current self.As you imagine your future self, don't forget that that self is still you. Don't expect to be a different person. Rather, anticipate that experience will make you wiser and more informed than you are, without distancing you from your core self., Some people who have been laid off or otherwise lost a job/status may feel a sense of identity crisis, not knowing what to do or how to pick up the pieces. Some experts advise that one of the best things you can do after losing a job that you loved is to explore other options, seeking ways to do the same work in a different setting.Consider freelance work in your chosen field. It may not be your ideal job position, but it will allow you to continue working in a field you enjoy, which can help renew your sense of purpose.Try networking. Some employment positions are only advertised internally, to other employees. This is why networking with other professionals in your field can be tremendously beneficial. It opens doors on new opportunities that you might have otherwise missed, and can help you feel like you are part of a larger community of likeminded professionals.Develop new habits that will help you get where you want to be. Doing the same things you've been doing for years probably won't get you on a different track, so work hard at making the necessary changes., The values you hold are central to who you are as a person. They help shape your identity in many ways. One of the easiest ways to find a sense of purpose in life is to always embody the values that you hold dear.If being kind and compassionate are part of your values, then find ways to practice kindness and compassion every day.
If religion is one of your values, then practice your religion regularly.
If fostering a sense of community is one of your values, then get to know your neighbors and try to organize a monthly get together.

, If you are passionate about your job, that will make you very happy in life. If you are not passionate about your job, that's okay - you just need to find things that you're passionate about outside of work. Having something that you are passionate about can help you feel more fulfilled and it will give you a better sense of purpose.Start doing what you love, and what makes you happy (provided that what makes you happy is safe and legal). There's no reason to put off doing things that you are passionate about. Many people even find ways of building their passions into a self-sustaining job. It takes work, but it starts with finding time to do what makes you happy.If you don't have anything you're currently passionate about, find something. Look to your set of values for inspiration on things that might bring you joy. Or, pick up a new hobby. Learn an instrument, take an instructional class, or go to a hobby store and ask someone who works there for suggestions on good beginner's crafts.

, Some people find that spending time outdoors gives them a sense of purpose and fulfillment. There are even wilderness therapy treatments that use outdoor activities, like hiking and camping, to help people overcome psychological problems and addictions.Search online to find parks and hiking trails near your home. Just be sure to follow all the necessary safety precautions, and bring someone with you if you're new to the area or the activity.

, Religion is not for everyone, and it won't necessarily give everyone a sense of purpose. But some people find that faith and a religious community help them feel connected to something outside of themselves.Even secular, spiritual-based practices, like meditation and mindfulness, have been shown to have positive effects on a person's psychological wellbeing.Try using meditation to feel more centered. Keep an intention in mind, such as centering yourself or finding a sense of self/purpose. Then focus on your breathing, ignoring any outside thoughts that pop into your head. Breathe through your nostrils and concentrate on the sensation of breathing in and out. Sit for as long as you are comfortable, and try to increase the duration of your meditation every time you practice meditating.Search online and read about different religions from around the world. Each faith has its own sets of values and beliefs, some of which may fall in line with your own values.
Talk to friends or relatives who are spiritual. They may have some insight and could potentially help you explore the practices and beliefs of various religions, if that is something you are interested in.

, Friends, family, and significant others are all sources of stability for many people. Having a strong connection with your family or friends can also help you feel more stable in terms of identity by giving you a sense of belonging.Call or email your friends and/or family members. Reach out to people you see often as well as people you only see occasionally.
Let your friends and family know that you care about them, and tell them you'd like to spend more time together.
Make plans to get coffee, go out to eat, go see a movie, grab a drink, or go on an adventure together. Putting time and effort into building stronger relationships will help you feel more happy and more sure in your sense of self., Whether you find satisfaction and personal growth in religion, athletics, philosophy, art, travel, or any other passion, pursue the things that are important to you. Let yourself be shaped and changed by your passions by making yourself vulnerable. Acknowledge that the things you enjoy are worth enjoying, and find ways to surround yourself with those things on a daily or weekly basis., A great way to feel a stronger sense of purpose is to earn praise and achievements at your career. No matter what you do, if you work hard at doing it well, there will be payoffs. While there is of course much more to life than just working, work does help validate us and make us feel that we have a purpose.If you are unhappy with your current career, look into finding ways to do something different. Some career paths may require additional education or training, while others may be accessible with your current education and work experience. Finding a way to work in a field that makes you happy will give you a tremendous sense of purpose and personal satisfaction.

Reflect on what you were just doing.,
Consider your most recent social interactions.,
Think about your current workload.,
Are you preparing for or going through a major life transition?,
Consider the relationships in your life.,
If you are a self-advocate, or if you are especially educated on autism, you will be exposed to additional stress.",How to Recognize Anxiety if You're Autistic," Look in a mirror, or feel your facial muscles and imagine how your face looks. Consider comparing it to drawings of faces with different emotions. Does your expression look tense, scared, or angry?;
, When you are stressed, you may naturally begin using stims to calm you down (such as putting things in your mouth or rocking). Self-calming stims are different for each autistic person, so it's important to learn your individual stims and what they mean. Here are some examples of stims that may feel calming to you:


Rocking or spinningDeep pressure stims(squeezing, hugging, placing heavy things on self)
Repeating words, sounds, phrases (echolalia)Using the mouth (gum, candy, mouthing non-food objects)
Using stims that are less subtle in public situations

, Stomachaches can arise from stress. This can be tricky to identify, because you must first rule out other possibilities:


Did you eat lately? Have you eaten enough within the last 24 hours? Is it possible that you went to bed hungry?
Are you on your period, or is it due?
Is there a stomach bug going around? There is a slight chance that it may be a flu.
Did you eat something different? For example, if you tried spicy bean soup, the beans might have irritated your stomach. This sort of pain can be piercing, but is temporary.

, Headaches are a common stress symptom. Anxiety can form tense, painful knots in the back of your neck. You may also feel a sore back, as if you lifted something too heavy. Sometimes, stress will also make it easier to injure your back when lifting things.

, Have you lost your appetite during situations when you are normally eating, or do you find yourself eating a lot? Are you using gum, candies, or vitamin drops as an attempt to prevent overeating?

, Stress may cause you to oversleep, or to experience trouble sleeping. Here are various examples of sleeping trouble that stress causes:


Trouble falling asleep
Waking up during the night
Trouble getting comfortable; rolling around a lot
Waking up before your alarm clock (Note: sometimes this will happen if your body adjusts to a rigid schedule, so this alone may not be a problem)
Nightmares
If you sleep with a partner, they may report something unusual about your sleep

, It may be difficult for you to tell, especially if you have trouble figuring out what others are thinking. Here are some signs that they've noticed something is wrong:


They're helping you more, or being more careful with you.
They ask you if something is wrong.
They're offering support: ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" ""Let me know if you need to talk, okay? I'm here for you.""
They look worried about you.
(Remember, some people will do some or all of these naturally, such as always offering to help. See if this happens more than usual, or feels out of the ordinary to you.)

, Panic attacks are when you have severe anxiety that causes incapacitating physical symptoms, sometimes completely out of the blue. If you get panic attacks, tell a doctor so you can get medical help. Here are a few of the many potential symptoms:Sweaty
Pounding heart (heart palpitations)
Confusion
Breathing too hard/rapidly (hyperventilating)
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or ""pins and needles"" in extremities (from hyperventilation)
Fear that you are dying, If you are anxious, you may feel that you have no control over what happens, and that you can't protect yourself or others from bad events.


Feeling powerless or overwhelmed may also be a sign of an oncoming meltdown or shutdown.

, If you were imagining how to respond to a negative situation, or worrying about something that could happen, this could make you stressed.


Is something bad going on, or did something bad just happen? (See the next section.)
Were you perseverating on a problem?
Were you thinking about a difficult situation or relationship in your life?
Were you thinking about a group of people who upset you, like racists or anti-autism organizations?

, Perseverating isn't always a bad thing, but it can be trouble if it hinders forward progress, or if it is making you upset.If you are perseverating on a problem—getting ""stuck in a rut"" and having trouble snapping out of it—this can be a sign of anxiety., A little ""what ifs"" can lead to creative problem-solving, but if you cannot rein them in, you have a problem.Focusing too much on the future can prevent you from staying calm in the present. Here are some examples of thoughts that can overtake you.


""What do I do if my social skills prevent me from holding down this job? How will I support a husband and kids someday?"" (what ifs)
""How am I ever going to get my degree in time? I don't have the organization skills for a side job yet!"" (hows)
""I can't believe I forgot the homework for the second time this month! I'm a terrible student! Maybe I'm too disabled for college after all..."" (spiral of faulty logic)

, You may stick to a place or person because they feel safe to you, and feel anxious about leaving them. (If this is a pattern, it may be agoraphobia.)


Following around a person (This includes constantly trailing behind your dad or big sister to avoid your homework. Just because they don't mind doesn't mean it's a good pattern.)
Avoiding leaving the house
Feeling/faking sick and wanting to avoid work/school

, Did you just witness something you consider bad or wrong? Have you just gone through something difficult? You may not have immediately realized that an experience was hard.


Were you reading/watching the news and hearing about sad things?
Did you just witness or fail to stop injustice (however small)?
Did your schedule abruptly change? Was somebody late when you were expecting them?
Did you undergo a rocky transition?Were you on an anti-autism website?

, Since autistic people can have trouble understanding social boundaries, you might not instinctively realize when someone else crossed them, and was being rude or mean to you.


Did you seem unable to get through to them?
Did they cut you off?
Did you feel at all small or insecure after the conversation, when you weren't before?
Did they make you feel that your feelings were invalid or unimportant?
Did they make you look bad in front of other people?

, If you have a major project, or exam/evaluation coming up, the approaching date might make you nervous. Anxiety can also happen if you feel that you are falling behind, or that you put off your work too much.


Is it painful to think about your workload? Would you prefer to skip this step and keep reading?
Do you feel prepared?
Do you feel that your boss/professor/supervisor likes you, or at least feels neutral towards you?
How are your time management skills?

, This might make you more stressed and anxious than usual.


Moving house
Changing jobs or schools
End of a vacation
Independence milestones (first sleepover, first sleepaway camp, preparing for college, moving out of parents' house or supported living)

, Are any of them particularly strained? This may lead to stress in your life. Run through the major family, school/work, and therapy-related people in your lives.


Do you feel that they will listen to you if you have a problem?
Do they listen when you say no?
Do you feel on edge, worthless, or incompetent when you are around them?
Do they force compliance or do things that cause you physical pain (including sensory-related pain)?
Does a specific person come to mind as you read this list? (Someone may jump out right away. Or it may take deep thought to realize that some of these things are true.)

, Autistic people are often silenced and spoken over, which makes your job particularly difficult.You must be careful to take care of yourself, because your empathy for other autistic people may make it difficult to handle the things you read. Be especially cautious when learning about the following:


Anti-autism rhetoric
ABA and destructive autism therapies, from chelationto the Judge Rotenberg CenterThe exclusion of autistic adults from the autism discourseSelf-absorbed parents whose attitude is belittling to their children
Therapies or techniques that personally harmed you

Choose a type of exercise.,
Exercise for a sustained period.,
Exercise in a group.",How to Release Endorphins for Pain Relief1," If you’re in pain, the idea of exercising might seem very unappealing; however, exercise is one of the best ways to get an endorphin release. Endorphins are what cause the famous ""runner's high,"" or feelings of contentment, happiness, and joy. You can even choose a type of exercise that will help mitigate the kind of pain you have.You don’t need to do anything particularly strenuous to get an endorphin release. You can take a water fitness class or simply go for a brisk walk. Tai chi and yoga can also be gentle ways to exercise.
Anything that gets your blood circulating more than average will stimulate an endorphin release. Try biking slowly, canoeing, ballroom dancing, gardening, walking briskly, or water aerobics. Do what you can and ask your doctor for advice if you need to.;
, In order to get an endorphin release, you need to exercise for a sustained period of time. Try to exercise for at least 20 minutes at a time. If you can exercise for closer to 45 or 60 minutes, that’s even better.It is recommended you aim for a total of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week. You can break this up into smaller chunks of time to make this more manageable.Pace yourself. Exercise at a lower intensity level for a longer period of time.
Listen to your body. If something hurts, stop and take a rest. It’s not worth hurting yourself in order to get an endorphin rush. That defeats the purpose!

, Studies have shown that group fitness helps boost endorphins partly because of the social aspect. You can take a class at a gym or form an exercise group on your own.In one study of note, group fitness improved mood in older women suffering from an acute illness.Find other people who are in similar physical shape as you. That way, you’ll all be able to agree on a pace or level of intensity.
Gyms and yoga studios often offer classes for people with limited mobility. If your pain prevents you from doing certain physical activities, these may be good options for you.

First time in the car.,
Take Driver's Ed.,
Before you take the written test / skills test.,
You have your license, but still feel anxious.,
In the early stages, it is best to stick with destinations you know and not to attempt to drive for long distances in unfamiliar terrain.,
When you do decide to go somewhere new, take a passenger with you the first time.,
Focus on one thing at a time.,
Don't worry about other people.,
It is good practice to always signal ahead of making a turn.,
Remind yourself that you passed the test, you have your license and you can do it!,
If you've caused / almost caused an accident.,
Reassure yourself that you are okay and that these things happen.",How to Reduce Anxiety About Driving if You're a Teenager," If you've never driven a vehicle before, then grab someone you trust and practice in your driveway or neighborhood. Try to get into the car before you take a driver's ed course so when you do your driving you can say you've at least been familiar with the car and it won't be scary.;
, For the most part...it's boring. But it is important to learn all the rules of the road and even if you can't remember them all, just pay attention anyway. Don't be afraid to talk to your driving instructor. Even if you don't know them, they are there to help you and teach you.

, Before you take the written test, read through your book. You don't need to study it hard core. Simply read through the sections and use your common sense to understand what you're reading. Make an attempt to drive around the skills test area a few days before actually taking the skills test. Drive the roads near the license branch and get used to the speed limits and traffic signs. Although you may not like the response, ask your parent or whomever is driving with you about any specific skills you need extra work on. Let their experience be of help to you.

, You may feel extremely nervous, and perhaps a little sick, the first time you drive alone in your car. Understand that this is natural and in time you will get over it. To put yourself more at ease, try to eliminate anything that might distract your concentration. Turn your cell phone and radio off. Once you become comfortable behind the wheel, you can play the radio again and obtain a hands-free device for using your cell phone. But for now, you need to focus on driving.

, More importantly, stick to the roads you know well. These roadways could be your school, a local restaurant, a friend's house, your church, a park, or the mall. Don't try to read directions and drive and don't try to follow someone who is leading you. If you're experiencing any anxiety about driving in general, you don't need any additional issues to worry about.

, At least, ask for precise directions ahead of time so you will know which roadways to avoid.

, Don't get worked up about getting on the highway before you even pull out of the driveway. Get out of your driveway and focus on what is immediately around you. As you continue to your destination, look ahead and be ready for what may be coming up. If you are coming up to an entrance ramp, for example, be prepared to slow down. Even if you've been to this place millions of times, it's different when you are the driver. Always keep a look out for stop and yield signs. And always, be on the alert for other drivers.

, The people in front of you don't know where you are going nor do they care. Sure, they will care if you rear-end them but for the most part you are just another car in the mirror. Same goes with the people behind you. They are not judging you or noticing every wrong thing that you do. If it affects them, then yes they will care. Like you, they are just another car on the road.

, This alerts drivers behind you about what your intentions and gives them advance warning. But be consistent and follow through on everything you do. If you signal you are turning left, then turn left. Don't confuse other drivers and put yourself in danger by changing your mind at the last second. Do NOT panic if you realize you are in the wrong lane or are making a wrong turn. If you got in the straight lane and meant to get in the right lane then just go straight until you find the opportunity to turn off the road. Then, simply turn around and re-do your steps. Yes, it may use more gas and take you slightly out of your way, but it's the safest thing to do.

, If you must, talk out loud to yourself while driving to remind yourself of what you must do. Say things like, ""OK I will need to turn left here"", or "" I have to get into the far left lane before I reach the traffic light"". Once you have successfully made your move, say to yourself, ""Alright you did it! Now I'm going to go straight and there is a stop sign at the end of this road..."" Or whatever is coming up next! Keep in mind: You control the car, it does not control you.

, The chances that you will get into a car accident are rare, but regardless of who you are or how good a driver you are, accidents happen. Every driver will encounter dangerous situations on the road. Oftentimes, drivers must make quick maneuvers to avoid accidents. But even the best driver cannot prevent every accident. Do not let this fact scare you. If you have an accident, try to remain calm. Stop your car and, if you are able to, pull your car off to the side of the road. Do not leave the scene. Take a quick inventory to see if you are okay. Once you feel it is safe to do so, look around and see where you are. Notice where the other vehicle is. See if the other driver is alright as well. If you can, get out of the car and carefully approach the other vehicle. If all is well, you may talk with the other driver and decide if calling for help is needed. If not, you may decide to exchange insurance information. Usually, if there is no damage to persons or property, you may proceed along on your way, if both drivers, and/or the police, agree.

, Realize what went wrong and do your best to avoid those mistakes in the future. Don't let this scare you. Drive again soon, even after you've been scared. You will have a lot of close calls in your life. One driving accident doesn't mean you're a bad driver. It simply means you must be more cautious and careful in the future.

Laugh!,
Have sex.,
Play music.,
Gossip.",How to Release Endorphins for Pain Relief2," You know how after a hearty laugh you actually feel good? That’s because laughing is a great way to release endorphins. Some people even practice laughing yoga, a practice that brings people together to stimulate a sustained period of laughing.Watch a funny movie or TV show that you know you enjoy.
Go to a comedy show at your local comedy club.
Spend time with friends who make you laugh.

, There’s a reason people seem to have that special glow after they’ve had a particularly passionate encounter. Sex releases endorphins. Of course, you probably don’t want to tell your partner that you’re only in it for the pain relief, but chances are that’s not the whole story anyway.Masturbation also produces an endorphin rush and can be used to get the same effect.

, Playing music is pleasurable partly because it helps release endorphins. If you sing or play an instrument, spend some time making music and see how you feel.Playing music with others can be helpful, too, for the social component.
If you don’t play an instrument, you may want to take one up if you have time.

, Your mother may have told you that gossip is a vice, but it’s one that can actually help with pain. Studies have shown that when people engage in some juicy gossip they release endorphins from the pleasure it brings them.Make sure you keep the gossip relatively harmless. You don’t want to create emotional pain for yourself or anyone else.

Eat hot peppers.,
Eat dark chocolate.,
Include some fats and sugar in your diet.,
Drink alcohol.,
Add a little vanilla flavoring.",How to Release Endorphins for Pain Relief3," Hot peppers are hot because they contain capsaicin, a compound that gets the body to release endorphins. The pain that your body feels from the heat of the pepper causes the endorphin release as a way to sooth the pain.The hotter the pepper, the greater the endorphin release is likely to be; however, hot peppers can be extremely painful. Experiment with different levels of heat before trying super hot ones.

, This one shouldn’t be too hard to get on board with. Part of the reason people crave chocolate is because of the endorphin rush they get after consuming it.The higher the cocoa content, the better the chocolate will be for an endorphin rush. Check the label, as many finer chocolates will list the percentage of cocoa in the product.
Milk chocolate usually contains significantly less cocoa, so it will not be particularly effective.

, People who have low endorphin levels tend to crave fats and sugar. Eating a moderate amount of comfort foods that contain these pleasurable elements can help release endorphins.Don’t go overboard. Eating too much fat and sugar can make you sluggish. Eat enough for it to be pleasurable, but not so much that you feel stuffed.

, Alcohol should always be consumed in moderation; however, if you’re of legal drinking age, a glass of wine or a pint of beer can help release the endorphins you need to ease your pain.It’s easy to develop a tolerance for alcohol. To avoid this, avoid drinking too frequently. That way, you’ll be able to get the endorphin release without needing to drink excessively.
If you are a recovering alcoholic, or you’ve struggled with substance abuse in the past, avoid alcohol altogether.

, The scent of vanilla is thought to improve mood and enhance overall well being. Vanilla helps to reduce anxiety, which is often associated with depression. To get the health benefits of vanilla add some to your coffee before it brews, buy some scented candles, or add the essential oil extract to your bathwater.Another scent that may be helpful is lavender, which can improve symptoms of depression and insomnia. Add a little lavender to frosting if you're indulging in a cupcake, or try a scented candle or use oil in a diffuser.

Listen to music around medical stressors.,
Deal with chronic pain with music.,
Use music during cognitive therapy.,
Use music in meditation.,
Relax your mind.,
Try binaural beats.,
Have a calm playlist for bedtime.,
Learn an instrument.,
Sing to release tension.,
Carry headphones.,
Listen to music while you work.",How to Reduce Anxiety with Music," If you have anxiety about a medical procedure, ease your tension with some music. Patients exposed to music while in a surgical holding area reported lower anxiety and stress than those not exposed to music.Similar findings have shown that music eases pain and anxiety when listened to before and following surgery.Listen to music you enjoy, as the type of music listened to doesn’t seem to matter as much as whether or not you appreciate and enjoy your music.Have a playlist ready for any medical procedure you may have. If you are having outpatient procedures done, ask if you can wear headphones or have a small speaker with you.
Ask yourself how you find the music helpful. Did you feel less focused on pain? Do you feel more relaxed?;
, Chronic pain can cause many problems, not just within your body. You may worry about pains or feel limited by mobility. Listening to music can help you cope with chronic pain. Music can help with sensations as well as distress related to chronic pain.It’s more important to enjoy the music than to choose a specific type of music.When you feel intense pain, allow yourself to listen to music and see how you feel during and after listening. Is there a difference than how you felt before you put on the music?

, When calming music is used during cognitive therapy for anxiety, therapy is more effective than when music is not included.If you see a therapist, talk with him or her about including calming and relaxing music during sessions, and see how you feel during and after session.

, Music can act as a slight distraction while still eliciting emotions. For this reason, it can be beneficial for use in a meditation practice.If you struggle with a wandering mind during meditation, add some music.


Use music that is soothing and not too distracting.
After meditation, ask yourself if you found the music helpful. Did your mind wander less? If not, try a different style of music.

, Slow, quiet Classical music can help reduce stress and relax your mind.Classical music can be beneficial for your body as well: studies have shown that it helps slow your heart rate, ease stress, and lower blood pressure.When your mind and body feel stressed and anxious, have a Classical music playlist you can listen to on the ready.
Reflect on your emotional state after listening to music. Do you feel less stressed overall? How does your body and mind feel?

, Binaural beats are tones delivered through headphones that help induce a certain brainwave state. Calming music can also be included when listening to binaural beats. Using beats that induce delta/theta states prove to be helpful in reducing anxiety.You can find binaural beats to listen to online or purchase an application for your phone or device.

, If you have problems falling asleep, have a bedtime playlist that induces feelings of calm and peace. Listening to relaxing music before falling bedtime can help induce restful sleep.Choose music that relaxes your body and your mind. If you feel to alert, it may hinder your ability to fall asleep.

, Playing an instrument engages more parts of the brain than any other known activity; you engage mental, emotional, and physical processes with each note.If you don’t play an instrument, don’t be shy to pick one up and start playing. Think of what music interests you and what instrument you would enjoy playing.


Remember that learning to play an instrument should be fun. If it’s causing you more anxiety or stress, slow down. You should enjoy playing music and allow it to enhance your day.
There are lots of ways to learn an instrument. You can take formal lessons, learn from a friend, or teach yourself. Think about what option is best suited for you, especially because you are using the instrument to cope with stress and anxiety. Think about what you want to accomplish (playing an instrument for fun and stress relief or playing to a certain skill level) and let that guide your decision.

, Whether you’re terrible or gifted at singing, singing can boost your mood and promote relaxation.Singing can help release tension and anxiety and overall make you feel good.There are lots of places you can sing. Sing in the shower or on your morning or evening commute. Sing a lullaby to your children before bedtime.
Sing songs that bring you joy and happiness. Have a sing-along playlist to listen to you when you feel anxious and feel the tensions easing.

, If you want to listen to music throughout the day, carry a small pair of travel headphones with you. That way, if you find yourself waiting for a bus, stuck in a waiting room, or killing time, you can calm any nerves or stress by listening to music. Especially if you find yourself waiting for something or someone, you can keep your stress or anxiety at bay and relax by listening to music.

, Listening to music while you work can improve productivity and enjoyment. For some, music can increase focus. Listening to music at work can boost your mood, which means you are in a better space to make decisions and approach problems more creatively.When you listen to music at work, ask yourself if your productivity, attention, and concentration are affected. Do you notice a difference on days you listen to music versus days you do not?
For better concentration and less distraction, listen to music without lyrics.
Make sure the music you listen to is enjoyable. If your workplace plays music over speakers that you don’t find enjoyable, consider bringing some headphones and listening to your own playlist.

Take a time out.Distancing yourself can immediately reduce your level of anxiety by reducing your number of stressors.,
Breathe.,
Acknowledge what you are feeling.Recognizing what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience those feelings rather than trying to stop them can help those feelings to pass.Some studies indicate that focusing on and accepting what you are feeling deactivates parts of the brain responsible for anxiety.Acknowledging how you are feeling also allows you to be a little more objective about the situation, which can reduce your anxiety by putting your feelings in perspective.,
Reassure yourself.,
Let the feelings pass.,
Redirect yourself.,
Bring yourself back.",How to Reduce Anxiety with Mindfulness1," The less you have going on around you, the more you can be mindful about what is going on within you.If possible, leave the area. Take a walk outside, go to the restroom, or at least go to a different area in the room.
If you can’t leave the immediate area, then take a time out by closing your eyes and turning down any noise that you can.;
, Focusing on your breathing is a mindfulness technique that reduces anxiety by lowering your heart rate and focusing you internally.There are several different breathing techniques supported by mindfulness including in/out, breath counting, finger breathing, and more.When you are in the middle of an anxiety attack, focus on your breathing by thinking ‘in’ when you inhale and ‘out’ when you exhale. Each time you exhale try to make it last a little longer.
If you are calm enough, count your breaths. Count up from one as you inhale, and then up from one again as you exhale. Try to extend your exhale about two beats longer than your inhale.
If you need to do something to release energy, try finger breathing. As you inhale, trace up the thumb of one hand with the index finger of your other hand. Hold at the tip, then trace down as you exhale. Trace up the next finger as you inhale, hold, trace down as you exhale. Repeat with each finger.,
Recognize how your body feels. Without trying to stop what you are feeling, scan yourself from head to toe and tune in with your body. Acknowledge any tension, queasiness, aches, etc.
Label your emotions and sensations. Part of acknowledging what you are feeling is naming the feeling without judgment.Label each sensation and emotion as if you were watching a video of it. Recognize fear, nausea, dread, anxiety, guilt, etc. for what they are.

, Even though you are feeling anxious, you are more than these thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Remembering this can help reduce your anxiety and then you can direct your attention to more positive thoughts.Try saying to yourself, “I am feeling anxious, but I am more than my anxiety. These feelings will go away…”

, Be aware of how your body feels as the negative feelings fade, as well as how you feel once the feelings are gone. Allowing the feelings to diminish on their own maintains your mindfulness and removes the pressure to “get over it” which can actually start increasing your anxiety again.You might say to yourself, “I am beginning to feel less nauseous” or “The tension in my shoulders is leaving”.
Don’t try to force the feelings to go away; just be mindful of the process your body goes through as your anxiety diminishes.

, Once your anxiety is reduced, acknowledge how you are feeling then focus your mind and energy on something else.Mindfully redirecting your attention to a calming activity prevents your anxiety from flaring up again.


Take a walk, stretch or do something physical to relieve any remaining anxiety you may have.
If you have to return to work, pick one task to focus your attention on and complete it mindfully. For example, if you have to organize some files, then focus on the sensations of filing. Notice how the paper feels in your hands, the sounds that the folders make as you flip through them, and the smells of the filing cabinet.
Write in your journal or talk to a close friend. Pay attention to how you feel as you do these things.

, If you feel your anxiety building up again at any time, return your focus to your breathing.Bringing your attention back to your breathing gives you something to think about other than the anxiety-inducing thoughts that you are having and physically calms you again.


Beating yourself up for being anxious again will not help you feel better. Give yourself time to adjust to new habits, build new skills, and create different ways of thinking. This takes lots of time and patience.
If you get angry with yourself, be mindful of feeling angry, then change your mind's focus by reiterating patience for yourself and performing a relaxation technique to help alleviate the anxiety.
You might say to yourself, “I’m starting to worry again. I’m thinking about everything that could go wrong. I need to breathe.”
Take a little more time to focus on your breathing than you did the first time. For example, if you turned your attention to breathing for five minutes at first, spend seven minutes being mindful about your breathing this time.

Adopt a positive attitude.,
Give yourself some relaxation time.,
Meditate.,
Create a stress-free home environment.",How to Recover from Chronic Stress1," The human body feels stress when there is a real or perceived threat. This causes a release of hormones that prepare us for a “fight or flight” response. Unless you are in real danger, many stressful situations can be eased by practicing a mindful change in attitude.Keep things in perspective. Work, school, and family commitments are common stressors in the 21st century. The pressures you feel are real, but are not always life-or-death situations. Try to recognize the positive and see how things can be worked out in the future.Set realistic expectations. Some people feel overly stressed because of the pressure they put on themselves to do things perfectly. Try to set expectations that are fit your situation. Stick to a realistic goal and try not to push yourself over the edge.Don’t over think things that are out of your control.

, Set aside time to relax and do the things that make you happy. Watch a movie, read, or take a warm bath. Make sure it is an activity that brings you joy and comfort., Meditation can make you more aware of your thoughts and general mental state. Bringing awareness to your stress can often help reduce its presence. There are many types of meditation, so do some research to find what is best for you.To do a simple meditation, find a comfortable place and sit or lie down. Then, you can focus your eyes on an object or candle flame, or close your eyes to begin meditating.
Try to clear your mind and focus on an object or repeat a mantra to yourself, such as, ""I am calm and serene.""
If your mind wanders, then try to notice the thought and then let it pass, like watching a cloud float away.

Watch for episodes of excessive or intense worry.,
Identify feelings of blankness or being unreal.,
Recognize episodes of fear or panic.,
Pay attention to your mood.,
Be attentive to avoidance behaviors.,
Be wary of drug and alcohol abuse.",How to Recognize Anxiety in Yourself1," Perhaps the most characteristic feature of anxiety is a long-lasting or intense feeling of dread and tension. Sufferers of anxiety often find themselves worrying constantly, even when they have nothing in particular to worry about. Worrying is often accompanied by physical tension and jitteriness, and is characterized by a pessimistic attitude, and an anticipation of the worst outcome in the situation causing the worry. , One of the most bizarre feelings associated with excessive anxiety is a feeling of detachment, or unreality, especially in situations where the anxiety sufferer is overwhelmed by the source of his or her anxiety. During such episodes, you feel utterly disconnected from others, and from the world around you, and you may find yourself unmotivated to do much of anything. For example, feeling as if your emotions and motivations have been turned ""off"", as if by the flip of a switch, following an episode of intense worry or stress may be a sign that you are experiencing excessive anxiety.

, The fear or panic may be associated with a real situation from your life, or may simply manifest as a general fear, such as of death, or loss of control. Alternatively, the fear may have no source you can identify. This fear may prove difficult to control, and difficult for others to comfort, which makes it one of the most debilitating symptoms of anxiety.If difficult or stressful situations — be they social, financial, or work-related, cause you to feel overwhelmed and incapable of dealing with your problems — you may be experiencing the effects of excessive anxiety.
It is normal to sometimes be troubled by thoughts of death and dying, either your own or that of someone close to you, but if these thoughts begin occurring with such frequency or intensity that they distract your from important activities or prevent you from sleeping they may be a sign that you are experiencing an unhealthy amount of anxiety.

, The symptoms of anxiety can be very difficult to cope with, especially if they are frequent or severe. The resulting strain can make it difficult to maintain a calm or happy mood, which can strain work, school and personal relationships, and making it a challenge to enjoy a normal social life. Frequent anxiety sufferers often find themselves feeling irritable and display difficulty concentrating or participating in social interactions.

, Regular sufferers of anxiety attacks will often find themselves fearful of situations which have, in the past, been triggers for stress or anxiety. If you find it very difficult to enter into situations which you associate with stress, or you often find yourself compelled to take significant steps to avoid such situations, this may indicate that you are experiencing an unhealthy level of anxiety.For example, if you find yourself often procrastinating school work, professional responsibilities, or social interactions because you fear being overwhelmed by the stress caused by these activities, you may be experiencing the effects of excessive anxiety.

, Self-medication, or use of unprescribed drugs and alcohol to treat the symptoms of illness, is common among chronic sufferers of anxiety. You should be honest with yourself regarding the role that drugs or alcohol play in your own relationship with anxiety. If you feel that your use of substances is out of your control, and is detrimental to you, it's important that you reach out to friends, loved ones, or medical professionals to help you deal with the problem before it impacts your health.

Do one thing at a time.,
Focus wholly on what you are doing.A major part of mindfulness is being absorbed in the present moment.,
Pay attention to sensations.,
Be aware of your emotions.,
Take your time.To be fully present in the moment and experience everything about it, you’ve got to slow down.,
Redirect your mind.,
Be mindful about everything.",How to Reduce Anxiety with Mindfulness2," Focusing on more than one thing (multi-tasking) forces your mind to be scattered, this makes it easier for anxiety-producing thoughts to pop up. Being mindful means focusing on only one thing and focusing on that thing completely.Often we multitask without even realizing it. For example, we eat lunch while checking email or talk on the phone while editing a report.
Think about what you are about to do before you do it, and then commit to doing just that activity.
Stop yourself when you find that you have started multitasking and return your focus to your one task.

, If your mind is completely occupied with what you are doing, then there is less opportunity for anxiety-inducing thoughts to creep in.When possible, reduce the number of distractions around you so that you can focus only on the task at hand.
When it is not possible to reduce distractions, be mindful of them, but don’t let them grab your attention.

, Getting used to recognize your sensations while make it easier for you to be mindful of them during times of high anxiety and will decrease the number of anxiety-starting thoughts that you have on a regular basis.Be aware of what you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell.


For example, while cooking dinner, pay attention to the different textures and colors of the ingredients, the sounds of your cooking tools, the aromas that are produced, etc.
When brushing your teeth, notice how the toothpaste tastes and smells. How does the toothbrush feel in your hand? Pay attention to the feel of it on your teeth, tongue, and gums.

, While you are performing your task, think about how performing it makes you feel. Think about how the sensations of the task make you feel. You will be able to better recognize and handle your emotions when you are anxious if you make a habit of being aware of them.For example, when you are taking a walk, be aware of your sense of peace and calm.
Think about how the fresh air in your lungs makes you feel proud that you are taking care of your health.

, Slowing down helps prevent anxiety by slowing your mind in general. It also gives you the opportunity to halt anxiety by fully focusing on what you are engaged in., The goal of mindfulness is to stay present in the moment. Being able to bring your mind back to the moment can decrease the number of anxiety-producing thoughts that enter your head during difficult situations.


When you notice that your thoughts have drifted, move them back to your task at hand.For example, you might say to yourself, “I’m worrying about my report that is due next week, but I don't need to think about that right now. I’m going to focus on driving instead.”

, Although life can often pull you in many different directions, try to practice mindfulness in everything you do. Whether it’s washing dishes, eating, journaling, etc., do it mindfully. Practicing mindfulness at every opportunity will make it much easier for you to do it when you are feeling anxious.

Increase your practice time.While at first you may only start with a minute or two, or even just a few seconds of focused mindfulness, try to work your way up to 20 minutes or more.,
Keep practicing.,
Try different techniques.",How to Reduce Anxiety with Mindfulness3," The longer you can be mindful, the less time you have for anxiety., Being mindful can be difficult with all of the demands life can throw at you at once. But keep in mind that the more you practice being mindful, the easier it will be for you to do, and in turn, the easier it will be for you to use it to address anxiety when it occurs.In fact, some research suggests that practicing mindfulness actually rewires how the brain handles stress., There are several different forms of mindfulness meditation and practice.Explore different techniques until you find the one that works most effectively for you. You might discover that specific techniques work better for specific anxiety-producing situations and develop a collection of mindfulness strategies.


A popular technique is simply to sit or lie somewhere that is comfortable. Start by focusing on your breathing, then open your awareness to the rest of your body, your emotions, and thoughts.Yoga and tai chi both include mindfulness components in addition to the physical actions."

Get a good night’s rest.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Exercise.",How to Recover from Chronic Stress2," Many people experience stress from lack of sleep or poor sleep quality. Stress can also cause people to stay awake at night and ruin the natural sleep cycle. Learn to improve both your quantity and quality of sleep.Most adults require between 7.5 and 9 hours of sleep each night.Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. Try not to change your sleep cycle, even on the weekends when there is temptation to sleep in. Take a nap if you lose a few hours of sleep due to a late night.Spend time outside during the day. Get as much sunlight as possible and stay active.Avoid screens one to two hours before bed. Try not to be on the computer, watch TV, or be on your cell phone before going to sleep. Instead, read a book or get ready for the following day., A healthy diet can help you improve your sleep, energy, and mood. Examine your current diet and see where you can make some small changes.Drink water. Water helps keep the body free of toxins and boosts energy levels. Fill your water bottle regularly throughout your day.It is best to completely eliminate caffeine, alcohol, and simple sugars. If going cold turkey is difficult, strive to significantly reduce these stress inducing substances in your diet.
Prepare your own meals. Focus on buying whole foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains. Health food stores tend to carry foods with fewer additives and chemicals, but remember to read the packaging. Even packaged foods that appear to be healthy are sometimes filled with added sugars and unhealthy fats.Kombucha tea and chamomile tea may also be helpful for people under stress.

, Exercise is a known way to blow off steam and improve your mood. Regular exercise will also improve your physical health. You don’t need to exhaust yourself. Choose something that works for you. Anything from yoga to a game of tennis can help with stress relief."
"
Take control of your schedule.,
Socialize.,
Consult your friends, family, or peers.,
Learn something new.,
See a therapist.",How to Recover from Chronic Stress3," An overwhelmingly packed schedule often brings on a stress-infused lifestyle. Organize your schedule and set limits on how much you can accomplish in a given day.Eliminate non-essential activities. Look through all your commitments and cross off the things that are not needed for your survival or stress reduction. Explain to your friends or peers that you need to take some time off to get back to a healthy lifestyle. Try saying, “I really want to continue volunteering at the shelter, but I need to take care my health. I will be in touch in the future.”
Talk to your boss or teachers about the minimal and specific tasks that you need to accomplish to stay up to date. Plan to have a private meeting to explain yourself. Try saying, “I am committed to my work here, but I need to focus on getting my health together. What exactly do I need to accomplish in the next few months to keep up?”
While some stressful situations cannot be avoided, there are many that can. For example, if watching the news is a stressful for you, eliminate or minimize the amount of time you spend on this activity. If a particular person stresses you out, take some time away from that person to re-evaluate your relationship.

, Spend time with people that make you happy. Have dinner with friends or see a movie. This can take your mind off your stress and help improve your general outlook.Have a laugh. Like exercise, laughter releases beneficial hormones and relieves stress and tension in the body. Whether you invite your friend over for a movie or chat with family about funny family moments, that belly laugh offers more advantages than you may realize.

, Talk to close friends or family members about the cause of your stress. Someone who has more experience with work, school, or life issues has probably faced similar challenges. You might also know someone who has also experienced your type of chronic stress and can offer some advice. If you are reaching out to a friend, for example, you might say, “Miguel, can I tell you about my situation at work? It’s really stressing me out, and I think you might have some good tips.”

, Take a group class or join a social group if you have time. Take your mind off whatever is bothering you and channel your energy into something positive. Make sure you really enjoy in the new activity. It should help balance out any negative feelings caused by stress.Think about something you’ve always wanted to do and see if it fits nicely into your schedule. Consider taking a dance class or joining a cooking club.

, If you are struggling to get through the day or feeling uncontrollably anxious, consider seeing a psychologist. A psychologist or mental health counselor is trained to listen to your challenges and help you come up with coping strategies."

Get a portable journal.,
Write an introductory entry.,
Write whenever you feel stressed.,
Write when you aren't stressed, occasionally.,
Use your journal to organize your thoughts.,
Look back to see how you have progressed.",How to Relieve Stress Through Journaling," Try to find a journal that you can stow away in your backpack, purse, or pocket. You never know when a stressful moment may arise, so being prepared at all times is best. Also take into consideration the journal's cover (do you like its appearance?) and paper (do you like the texture?).

On that note, be sure to have a pen or pencil (whichever you prefer) on hand at all times - maybe a backup as well, just in case.
There are also apps and websites you can use for this purpose, if you prefer. A text editor document would work, too. Storing your journal on the Cloud or Internet also ensures that you can access your journal nearly anywhere.
Consider having multiple journals, in the event that you forget one. Maybe you'll keep one in your desk at work and another in your nightstand at home.;
, You might want to start with an entry that states your name and the purpose of the journal. Go into a bit of detail on the latter, if you like. Where are you now and where do you hope to be with your journal's help?, If you feel anxiety or pressure coming on, pull out your journal and write about how you feel and, if you can identify it, the source of your stress. Perhaps when flipping through on a later date you might discover patterns you never noticed before., Your journal need not be completely focused on your stress - write about pleasant things, too! Reminding yourself of good things might help in the future. Some things you could write about include:

Good days
Your dreams and goals
Ideas
Things you'd love to do
Your favorite things

, Sometimes people feel jumbled emotions, which only makes them more stressed. Trying to put words to your thoughts and feelings helps put them in a logical order and, hopefully, understand them better.

Writing before bed can help your mind settle down; with all that's swirling through your mind on paper, you might find it easier to sleep.
Talking through/writing through all that's on your mind, such as tasks and what you need to do, might be able to help you prioritize and set goals, and monitoring goals is easier with a journal.

, Every so often, read some old entries from your journal. How far have you come from when you started? Has your stress decreased? Since these changes are gradual, you might not realize they have happened until your look back and see the contrast."

Pay attention to unexplained discomfort and pain.,
Notice signs of physical tension.,
Be mindful of changes in your sleep patterns.,
Monitor your digestion.,
Be aware of fluctuating appetite and weight.",How to Recognize Anxiety in Yourself2," Nausea, headaches, dizziness, and muscle soreness are all common symptoms of anxiety. If you regularly experience such discomfort, this may be a sign that you are experiencing excessive anxiety, especially if standard methods for relieving the discomfort are ineffective., The body often manifests psychological strain physically, through symptoms like muscle tension, rapid heartbeat and breathing, trembling, and shortness of breath. Often experiencing such physical tension, especially in the absence of a non-psychological cause, such as vigorous exercise, may be a sign of anxiety. Fidgeting behaviors, such as tapping your hands and feet, grinding your teeth, or clenching your jaw may also be signs of anxiety-related physical tension.

, Anxiety often has a very noticeable effect on how well you sleep, how much sleep you get, and how energized and alert you feel after sleeping. Oversleeping and insomnia (a sustained problem getting to sleep and staying asleep) are both common anxiety symptoms. Oversleeping intentionally to escape worry, or being kept from sleep by an overly active, worrying mind are both classic problems for sufferers of anxiety., Your digestive system is very sensitive to changes in your physiology, including psychological changes like experiencing anxiety.Anxiety is often associated with frequent feelings of nausea, as well as frequent urination or diarrhea. Many anxiety sufferers experience a frequent or even constant queasy feeling, much like the pit-in-your-stomach sensation associated with a stressful realization.

, Anxiety often affects what, and how much, you want to eat. If you notice that you are often not hungry, or simply not motivated to eat, this may be a sign of anxiety. Conversely, frequent overeating, especially as a distraction from worry, can also be a manifestation of anxiety. "

Watch for episodes of snowballing or overwhelming worry.,
Watch for intense physical tension or discomfort.,
Be mindful of obsessive thinking.,
Consult a medical professional.",How to Recognize Anxiety in Yourself3," For sufferers of anxiety attacks, the feelings of worry and dread associated with anxiety can ""snowball"", becoming so intense that they overwhelm everything else, and leave the sufferer stunned, panicking, and unable to process what is going on. These episodes are often brought on by high-stress events or situations, are extremely unpleasant and bewildering, and can last from a few minutes, to hours or even entire days. Anxiety attack sufferers often experience a ""deer-in-the-headlights"" feeling of being stunned and unable to decide how to respond to a stressful situation.

, Sufferers of anxiety attacks often experience sharp drops or increases in body temperature (hot or cold flashes), as well as feelings of intense shortness of breath or rapid, erratic heartbeat. , Anxiety attacks are often accompanied by obsessive thoughts, which are intense, and unwanted thoughts associated with a problem, worry, or stressful situation. During an anxiety attack, these thoughts may seem to engulf the sufferer, making it difficult or impossible for them to focus on anything else.While these obsessive thoughts may be associated with a concrete problem in the sufferer's life, they can also be much more abstract. For instance, the obsession may be centered on a disturbing or stressful image or sound which becomes ""stuck"" in the sufferer's mind, preventing thought of anything else.

, Anxiety attacks are painful, and often debilitating. The physical and emotional strain associated with regular, intense anxiety can also have long-term effects on your health. If you are struggling with anxiety , you should talk with a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or counselor about your symptoms, and possible treatments for anxiety. The simple act of asking for help from others can help alleviate your symptoms, and set you on a path for less-stressed living.

Be prepared to wait.,
Know your HIPAA Rights.,

Understand what information doctors can withhold.,
Appeal a refusal, if necessary.",How to Get a Copy of Your Medical Records," Medical records often contain highly sensitive and private information. Only specific individuals have access to your medical records.


States vary in procedures and policy in regards to handing out medical records, as do individual hospitals. However, federal law dictates that an individual has the right to access his or her medical records, make copies, and request amendments. For the most part, only you and your doctor have the right to access your medical records.In rare cases, you might need to obtain someone else's records. You will need a direct authorization signed by the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, legal documents will be needed to waive the signature. However, protocol for requesting someone else's records is a subject of debate and confusion in the medical community. If you need someone else's medical records for any reason, discuss the issue with an attorney to figure out the procedures necessary to obtaining that information.Married couples do not have the right to one another's medical records and signed authorization is needed to obtain a spouse's records. Parents usually have access to the medical records of children under 18 but there are some exceptions. If, for example, a child is over 12 some states allow records regarding reproductive health and sexual history to remain confidential.;
, To obtain your records, you need certain materials. Make sure you know you have all the necessary paperwork filled out before beginning the process of requesting records.


Your healthcare provider's Health Information Management Department (HIM) can provide you with the authorization form specific to your hospital. This will need to be filled out in full.Information included in the authorization form varies from state to state and hospital to hospital. However, most forms ask for your address, date of birth, social security number, and phone number. You will also probably have to provide the dates you received treatment, what documents you want released, and your reasons for requesting the records.Many hospitals, in order to speed up the process, allow the authorization form to be filled out online. Check if this is an option at your hospital if completing the forms online is more convenient for you.When you go in to request your records, you will need a photo ID., Fees vary from hospital to hospital, but there is specific protocol when it comes to charging for records. Be aware of this to avoid paying unlawful fees.


Hospitals do have the right to charge fees for medical records. However, these fees are limited to the costs of the labor required to obtain the records. In other words, your hospital cannot use your records to make a profit.Usually, a hospital will charge a fee based on the number of pages in your records. There is a cap as to how much this fee is that varies from state to state. In New York, it's 75 cents a page and in California it's 25. Know what the maximum price per page is in your state and make sure you're not being overcharged. You can usually find this information on the Department of Health's website.To avoid these fees, ask your doctor to send the last SOAP Note from your final visit, or if you are in the hospital, request the discharge summaries that were dictated by your physician.

, On the authorization form, you will be asked to select what kind of records you want. If you're unfamiliar with medical terminology, this can be confusing. However, for patients, the following forms are most useful for tracking medical history and transferring doctors.


Initial history and physical examination
Any consultation reports conducted by specialists. Consultation reports review the patient's history, explain their medical needs, and lay out the reason another physician's advise is being requested.Operative reports, which document the details of a surgery
Test results
Medication lists
Discharge reports, which include the dates you were dismissed from a hospital and any at home care your provider recommended, You have a variety of options when it comes to receiving your medical records. Paper copies are what is generally requested, but you can request digital copies as well. If your hospital uses electronic records system, you can get your records in the form of a CD or USB drive. You can also have your information sent through email. Figure out what is most convenient for you and then make the request., Receiving your medical records takes time. It is not a same day process and you should be aware of waiting periods.


Legally, your provider has to send you your records within 30 days of your initial request. They may be able to apply for a one time 30 day extension, but must explain the cause of this delayMost facilities will not take 30 days and, on average, the waiting time is 5 to 10 days.If you need your records because you are switching doctors or for insurance purposes, keep the waiting period in mind. Plan ahead and request your records well ahead of time., HIPAA is the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. You should be informed of your HIPAA rights when you start treatment with a new doctor, such as when you are admitted to a hospital or when you see a doctor for the first time. In general, HIPAA gives you the right to access your medical information and keep it private. This means that you have the right to:ask for a copy of your medical records.
request corrections to your medical records.
be notified about how your information may be used or shared.
decide how your information may be used.
get a report on how your information was used.
file a complaint if you think your information is not being handled properly.

, You are entitled to your medical records. This is federal law and a hospital cannot withhold records for any reason, including delinquent payment. As stated, hospitals can charge for paper but they cannot charge a searching fee. If a facility tries to refuse to release your records, or demands a hefty sum of money for their release, talk to an attorney. Refusal to release medical records is rare, but does sometimes occur. Understand this is illegal., While you are legally entitled to most medical records, a doctor has the legal right to refuse to release certain documents regarding your medical history. These documents include:


Personal notes
Information regarding a minor over the age of 12, if the minor objects
Any information the physician believes will cause substantial harm to you or others
Information obtained from other physicians
Substance abuse records or mental health records, In some cases, you might want or need certain information a doctor can legally refuse to release. If, for example, you're transferring to a specialist a doctor's personal notes and observations can provide your new physician important insight into your condition. There is an appeal process if your provider refuses to release certain records.


Regulations vary from state to state. Most states require you file a written appeal, citing your reasons for needing the information, to the Department of Health. Your provider must then submit an explanation for his or her refusal.A judge or committee decides whether or not the information should be released. If you win your appeal, your provider must legally release the documents. If you lose the appeal, the decision is final."

",How to React in an Emergency," Take a few deep breaths. This is mentioned in every article with the word ""emergency"" in it and it is necessary to properly deal with an emergency.;
, This will keep the people involved/injured safe. Depending on the size and location of the situation, this may be easy or difficult.


If the emergency is outdoors and is large, such as a car accident and is on a road, you will need a large object to physically place in front of the site of the situation. Depending on the size of the situation, you may need to only block off one lane or you may need to block off both. The easiest way is to park your vehicle horizontally directly in front of the emergency. Stand beside it and signal to vehicles to move into the adjacent lane. If you are on a four lane road, obstruct two lanes in the direction heading toward the situation and signal to drivers to move into the center oncoming lane. Drivers should have enough common sense to move back into the correct lane when they pass the situation. If possible, get a friend to move oncoming traffic into the curb lane on the side of the road opposite of the emergency. See the diagram if you are confused.

If there are traffic cones nearby, do not be afraid of borrowing them. If there is a municipal truck nearby, you have hit the jackpot.
Move blockades aside as emergency crews arrive.


If the situation is indoors, things will be a little bit easier. Use chairs or other objects to close off the area. Appoint people to stand by the area to explain to others what is happening and to tell them to walk around. Wet floor signs are also good for this purpose.

,,, Use a building's public address system if necessary. Most phones in a large building have a button labelled PA that you can use to access it in a hurry. This is useful for saying, ""Move along people, nothing to see here,""

If you want to control your breathing, then you should take the time to sit down wherever you are, to close your eyes, and to focus on returning your breath to its normal state. You can also try this exercise for good measure:Breathe in slowly through your nose for 5-7 seconds.
Hold your breath in for 3-4 seconds.
Breathe out slowly through your pursed lips like you're whistling for 7-8 seconds.
Repeat these steps 10-20 times, until your breathing has returned to normal.;
, Being out in the sun has been proven to ease anxiety and depression. Just make an effort to go outdoors, be in the sun, and deal with your problems in the daylight instead of inside your own home or a dark space can make a big impact on your overall mood and your feelings about your problems.Your problems won't feel nearly as bad if you're dealing with them outside while feeling the sun hit your face instead of indoors.

, Just being touched by a loved one can make you feel more loved, calm, and in control. Part of anxiety is feeling like you have to deal with your problems alone and that your worries are too big to tackle. Just hugging, holding hands with, or even cuddling with or kissing a loved one can ease your anxiety and make you feel more loved and in control of your world.


If you're prone to anxiety, spend more time with close friends who can give you a comforting touch and make you feel safe.

, If you're a person who is plagued with anxiety, then you should have your ""go to"" person that you can call whenever you're feeling an overwhelming worry about something in your life. This person should not only be a close and trusted friend, but it should be someone who makes you feel better when you're worried instead of yelling at you, giving you even more reason to worry, or making you feel foolish for having anxiety.Just making a quick phone call to that trusted person and talking about whatever is bothering you can do wonders for quickly easing your pain.
There's a difference between sharing your worries and talking about them so much that you work yourself up and feel even worse. Share your concerns with your friend, but don't overdo it.

, When you're feeling very anxious, your body is filled with adrenaline that has nowhere to go. You should use that worried energy and convert it into something positive, like a good a workout, whether you're jogging, running, climbing stairs, or just taking a fast-paced walk around your office building. Exercise can burn away the stress hormones that created your anxiety symptoms and it will tire your muscles, releasing all of that built-up tension from your body.Exercise also releases endorphins that can improve your mood. Your former worries won't seem so serious anymore.
You can plug your exercise into your routine during a time when you know you're likely to worry, such as right before or after work -- just don't work too late in the evening, or it'll be harder for you to unwind and fall asleep.

, Find a special CD or two that always gets you into a calm ""zone"" no matter what you're doing. It could be Norah Jones, Adele, or even classical music or jazz. Whatever your special music is, you should keep it on hand at all times, whether it's on your iPod or in a CD, so you can take a minute to fill your ears with the music, close your eyes, and feel truly relaxed by the music.


Listening to the music while keeping your body still and your eyes closed will help you prevent anxiety even more.

, Herbal tea is known to have calming properties, and just the ritual of sitting down over a cup of tea is guaranteed to slow down your mind and body. Enjoy a variety of non-caffeinated teas with flavors such as peppermint, chamomile, and mint when you start your day or as you wind down and get ready for bed.


You should avoid caffeinated teas -- or any caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or soda -- because they will only contribute to your anxiety and will make you more worried and anxious.

, If you've just been given some alarming news, or if there's been something that's been eating away at you all day, make time for a ""worry period,"" when you're free to do nothing but worry about whatever is on your mind. You can even make it a ritual -- every day from 6-6:30 in your favorite chair, and use this time and this time only to sort out all of the worries in your head.


If you set aside a ""worry period"" every day, then you can make a note to save your concerns for your ""worry period"" if they come up earlier during the day.
Making time for a worry period will also force to sit there and be alone with your worries, which may make it more likely for you to recognize any irrational or unproductive feelings.

, If you're having an anxiety-ridden day, stop whatever you're doing and make a list of all of the things that are worrying you. Once they are written down, they'll seem less unmanageable, and you may even find that a few of them can be easily tackled. For example, you may have put ""haven't made doctor's appointment"" or ""haven't apologized to Mary"" on your list, and you'll find that once you do these things, you'll feel better right away.


Pick your easiest manageable worry, tackle it, and cross it off your list.

, One reason that you may be feeling anxious is because you're worried about uncertainty and don't know enough about the subject. The more you know, the more in control of the situation you'll feel, and the less likely you'll be to think of the worst case scenario, or to make up consequences that couldn't possibly exist.


For example, if you hurt your foot while running and are worried that you'll never be able to run again, go see a doctor instead of worrying about it on your own.
If you're worried about how you're going to drive the family all the way to your Aunt Mary's new house next week, map the directions to her house and even look at a picture of the house to see that it doesn't have to be so unmanageable.
There's a difference between gaining knowledge and obsessing over a medical condition until you're convinced you have it. If you have a common cold, it's best to avoid WebMD, or you'll find a way to convince yourself that you're suffering from a much more serious condition.

Learn to recognize your anxious thoughts.,
Avoid ""all or nothing"" thinking.,
Avoid overgeneralization.,
Avoid catastrophizing.,
Avoid focusing on the negative.,
Avoid personalization.,
Know what you can and can't control.,
Challenge your anxious thoughts.",How to Prevent Anxiety2," If you want to prevent anxiety, then the first thing you need to know is to recognize when you're having anxious thoughts so that you can try to stop them as soon as possible. Once your heart rate is racing, you start pacing around or tapping your foot, and your thoughts turn to potential disasters, uncertain outcomes, and obsessions over the worst thing that can happen, then you're in full-on anxiety mode, and you need to cut off the problem at the source ASAP.


Develop a routine that helps you fight these thoughts before they're fully formed. Do whatever works for you, whether it's running, listening to Wilco, or raking your zen garden.

, ""All or nothing"" thinking is when you tell yourself that if something doesn't go perfectly, that you're a complete failure and that nothing will ever go right again. For example, you may be thinking that if you don't get an A on your next bio test, that you'll never be a doctor.To avoid this kind of thinking, just think of all of the many scenarios that can happen -- you can get a B, or even a C, and still pull up your grade. One grade won't influence your entire life.

, Overgeneralizing is when you draw from one negative experience and think that it should dictate the rest of your life. For example, if you go on one bad date, you may think, ""I'll never get married."" Instead of having this anxious type of thinking, you should remind yourself that you're drawing from a small set of data and that one bad date or one bad experience will have little impact on your entire life.Tell yourself that you will have plenty of opportunities for something in your life in the past.

, Catastrophizing means thinking that the worst possible thing in any situation will happen. For example, if your boss asks you to spend a bit more time on one report, you may think that you're going to get fired. If your plane is experiencing turbulence, you may think that it's going to crash at any minute. Avoid catastrophizing by writing down all of the possible outcomes, of varying degrees of positive or negative consequences, and see that it's likely that the worst thing ever won't happen.Combat catastrophizing by expecting the best possible thing to happen instead of the worst.

, Another type of anxious thinking is focusing on the negative aspects of a situation instead of the positive. Let's say you had a really great date with a guy, that you really hit it off, but that at the end of the date, you spilled some wine on his shoe. If you tend to focus on the negative, then you'll completely discount the great night you had and will instead tell yourself that you ruined everything by spilling the wine.To avoid focusing on the negative, make a list of all of the positive things that happened. You'll see that the positive aspects far outweighed the negative.

, Personalization is when you take a situation out of your control and blame it on yourself. Telling yourself that it's your fault that your best friend is suffering from depression because you haven't spent enough time with her, or that it's your fault your son has been falling behind in school because you've been a bad mother is your way of trying to deal with a sad situation. Unfortunately, blaming yourself for everything that goes wrong in the world will only increase your anxiety.


To avoid personalization, think of the actual cause of the problem, and realize that it's not you. Make a list of all of the things that could have contributed to the situation that have nothing to do with you.

, Knowing what you can and can't control can go a long way in preventing your anxiety. Make a list of all of the things that are worrying you, and mark the ones that you can and can't control. Tackling the ones you can control will make you feel more productive, and realizing that there are some things outside of your control will help you let go of your anxious thoughts.


Tell yourself that you're not helping anyone, not yourself, and not anyone around you, by wasting your time worrying about things you can't fix.

, When you've recognized any of these anxious thoughts or any others, you can go a long way in preventing further anxiety by challenging your anxious thoughts and finding a more optimistic and productive way of looking at the situation. When you're faced with a new worry, ask yourself some of the following questions:How likely is it that the thing I'm worried about will actually happen?
If the chances of the thing happening are low, what are some more probably outcomes?
What evidence do I have that any of this is true?
How is it helping me to worry about this thing? How is it hurting me?
What would I say to my best friend if she was worrying about the same thing?

Learn to live in the present.,
Minimize situations that cause anxiety.,
Spend time with calming friends.,
Keep a journal.,
Learn to accept uncertainty.,
See a doctor.,
Seek therapy.",How to Prevent Anxiety3," Learning to live in the present can take a lifetime, but it will be worth it. Embracing every moment and opportunity that comes your way will help you stay grounded in the present instead of worrying over something in the past or in the future that can cause you harm. Take the time to ""wake up and smell the roses"" by slowing down, enjoying your relationship, taking a daily walk, and unplugging from your computer and phone for several hours every day.Meditate. Meditating for 10-20 minutes every day can help you focus on your body and your mind and on what's happening around you.
Use all of your senses. Take the time to appreciate the sights, smells, and feelings around you.
Don't take a day of your life for granted. Write down all of the things you're thankful for and embrace them as much as you can.

, Though preventing anxiety should come from within, there are some steps you can take to prevent anxiety in your daily life. Try to avoid situations that cause you a lot of anxiety or extra stress and make your life easier and more manageable. For example, if you're always anxious about getting to work late, leave the house fifteen minutes earlier. If you're anxious about how your best friend really feels about you, have an honest conversation with her.


If going to loud concerts, crowded restaurants, or big parties where you don't know many people makes you deeply anxious, avoid these situations unless you can find a way to manage them.

, If you want to prevent your anxiety, then you should spend as much time as you can with friends that make you feel more calm, at ease, and at peace with yourself. Seek out the people in your life who make you feel grounded, and avoid the people who cause worry, make you more stressed, and make you feel like your problems are bigger than they really are. And if there's an acquaintance in your circle who always calms you down, seek him out.


Plug time with calming friends into your schedule. They'll make you feel even better about your struggles.

, Keeping a journal can help you trace your most anxiety-inducing thoughts and will make you see a pattern to your thinking. If you take the time to write in your journal for at least fifteen minutes a day, you'll feel better for having time to reflect and will get a better sense of the big picture. Writing in a journal is inherently a calming activity, and making time to do it every day can help you wind down, make sense of your day, and get ready to move forward.


Writing in your journal at the beginning of your day with a cup of herbal tea can help prevent anxiety.

, A big part of anxiety stems from not knowing what's going to happen next. Unfortunately, there's no way you can predict the future, no matter how hard you work on preventing anxiety. You have to learn to be okay with not knowing what's going to happen next, controlling only what you can control, and learning to take your life one day at a time.


Learning to accept uncertainty, like learning to live in the present, is a process that can take a lifetime.

, If you feel that your daily life is filled with overwhelming worry and that nothing you've done has improved the situation, then it may be time to see a doctor to see if getting some prescription medications or alternate treatments is the best route for you. If you're feeling completely overwhelmed with worry in your daily life, then you should see a doctor immediately. You may find that you have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or another anxiety-related disorder.Don't be embarrassed about it -- it'll be the first big step to preventing anxiety and getting the help you need.

, Even if you don't want or need medication, talking to a therapist can still help you deal with your problems. Just discussing your every day concerns as well as your larger worries with a professional can make you feel more at ease and less alone. Talking to a therapist about your worries instead of discussing them with a close friend can also help you gain a new perspective on your worries, and can also make you more comfortable about talking about them.

Look for a possible infectious cause (""infectious endocarditis"").,
Inquire about recent trauma to the chest.,
Consider rheumatic heart disease as a cause in developing countries.,
Evaluate for a congenital or hereditary cause of aortic regurgitation.,
Receive a transthoracic echocardiogram.,
Have a transesophageal echocardiogram.,
Obtain other diagnostic tests as needed.,
Opt for ""watchful waiting."",
Receive regular echocardiograms to evaluate your aortic valve function.,
Take medication to reduce the stress on your heart and minimize the rate of further damage.,
Ask your doctor about aortic valve replacement surgery.",How to Find the Cause of Aortic Regurgitation," An infection of the aortic valve — called ""infectious endocarditis"" — may damage the valve permanently leading to a leaky aortic valve (aortic regurgitation). To assess for this as a cause for aortic regurgitation, ask about the person's medical history and whether they have had any recent infections. Infective endocarditis normally begins as a less serious infection somewhere else in the body (such as in the lungs or in the urinary tract) that then progresses into the bloodstream (called ""sepsis"") and then affects the heart.A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be used for diagnosis and assessment of aortic regurgitation from a possible infection.A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be used once a TTE has been performed. It can be used to assess overall heart function as well as to detect the presence of valvular regurgitation from an infection on one or more heart valves.
A blood test and blood culture can identify the presence of bacteria in the blood, which would mean it is possible that endocarditis is the cause. Bacteremia is fairly common, but only a minority of cases are due to endocarditis.;
, Chest trauma can cause damage to the aorta (the big blood vessel leading out of the heart to distribute blood throughout the body). If the aorta is damaged near the aortic valve, or if there is a tear in the aorta, it may lead to the backflow of blood through the aortic valve.Ask about a history of recent trauma to the chest area.
A chest x-ray or CT scan may also help to visualize damage from trauma, pointing toward this as a potential cause of aortic regurgitation.

, Rheumatic fever (and subsequent rheumatic heart disease) is typically a complication of a group A strep infection that is not treated with antibiotics. It is uncommon in the United States because people diagnosed with strep throat receive antibiotic treatment, which prevents the development of complications; however, in developing countries, untreated group A strep infections can cause ongoing heart problems.An echocardiogram can be helpful in the diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease leading to aortic regurgitation., Many people with aortic regurgitation develop it as a result of congenital or hereditary causes. The most common is a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, meaning that the aortic valve that only has two leaflets as opposed to the usual three. It is thus more prone to wearing down with time, leading to the backflow of blood that is characteristic of aortic regurgitation.There are also hereditary conditions, such as Marfan's syndrome (a connective tissue disorder), that may lead to the development or aortic regurgitation at an abnormally young age.
Congenital or hereditary abnormalities can be tested for with an echocardiogram, a CT scan, and/or a cardiac MRI., A transthoracic echocardiogram (commonly called an ""echo"") is usually the first specific investigation to look at the function of the aortic valve. It uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the heart as it functions in real time. It shows each heartbeat, and can assess blood flow through the various chambers of the heart with each heartbeat.An echo can also be used to determine the underlying cause of aortic regurgitation.

, If a transthoracic echocardiogram is insufficient to determine the underlying cause of aortic regurgitation, the next step is to proceed to a transesophageal echocardiogram. This is when, rather than having the test performed from outside your chest, an ultrasound probe is instead inserted down your esophagus to provide a more close-up and detailed view of your heart., Depending upon what is suspected as the underlying cause of aortic regurgitation, additional investigations may be ordered to provide more information. For instance, if an infection of the heart valve is suspected, blood tests and a blood culture will likely be ordered to test for the presence of bacteria. If trauma is suspected, a chest x-ray or CT scan will likely be needed to evaluate for injury to the surrounding structures. If there is concern for atherosclerosis, a cardiac catheterization may need to be performed to plan a comprehensive treatment strategy. , Most cases of aortic regurgitation do not require immediate treatment. In the majority of cases, the heart is able to compensate on its own up until a certain point (with the help of medications), and then eventually surgery becomes necessary.Ask your doctor whether it is safe for you to continue with ""watchful waiting"" for the moment.
Your doctor will then let you know how frequently to come back for check-up appointments to assess your aortic valve function.

, They key to watchful waiting is to not miss any appointments scheduled to assess your aortic valve function. This is because, at a certain point, the heart can no longer compensate for a dysfunctional aortic valve and surgery becomes necessary to prevent serious damage.In order to identify this point promptly, you will need routine echocardiograms.
An echocardiogram with Doppler can look at the blood flow out of your heart, through your aortic valve, and the regurgitation back into your heart after each heartbeat.
It can quantify the amount of damage and indicate to your doctor when surgery is needed.

, While you are in the period of ""watchful waiting,"" medications may help to decrease the stress of ""afterload"" (pressure) on your heart with each heartbeat. These medications include vasodilators such as Hydralazine or Nifedipine, other blood pressure lowering drugs, and other cardiovascular medications depending on your risk factors and any other concurrent medical conditions you may have.

, The only definitive treatment for aortic regurgitation is to receive surgery. You will need a valve replacement surgery — it can either be replaced with a mechanical valve, or a biological valve. The valve replacement is normally done via open-heart surgery, and it will require three to five days in the hospital following the procedure for recovery.There are also minimally invasive techniques which include smaller incisions to replace your aortic valve.

Understand what is meant by ""a second opinion"".,
Be informed about who can request a second opinion.,
Evaluate whether you have valid reasons for wanting a second opinion.,
Recognize that there are poor reasons for wanting a second opinion.",How to Get a Second Medical Opinion for Your Child1," A medical second opinion does not mean that you will see another doctor regularly. Its main purpose is to get medical information or opinions about a health problem from a physician other than the regular doctor who has been providing care. The regular doctor may be your pediatrician, family physician, or a sub-specialist. Second opinions (consultations) may be obtained for several reasons:


To identify or confirm a diagnosis.
To help interpret a test result.
To provide additional viewpoints and information about risks, benefits, or expected outcomes.
To give recommendations regarding treatment choices .
To provide an opinion about the need, type, and timing of surgery.
To help parents make the decision to change care to another provider.;
, For health issues in infants and children, requests for a second opinion may come from several sources.


A second opinion may be recommended by your pediatrician or family physician, especially when there is an unusual or ill-defined medical problem that is outside your physician’s area of expertise.Your child's regular doctor may also ask for a second opinion if they believe that the input of a specialist will allow him or her to provide better management
A consultation may also be requested by your regular doctor when they are treating a condition that is not responding as expected, or when they disagree with opinions or recommendations from another doctor.
However, you — as the parents of family members of the child — may also request a second opinion, especially when the child is suffering from a serious condition that requires important or complex decisions.
You may also request a second opinion if you are concerned or confused about the diagnosis or treatment recommendations, if you want to be absolutely sure that all treatment options have been considered, or if you want to feel reassured that your child’s medical needs are being addressed in the best possible manner.

, Before you go ahead with arranging a second opinion, it's a good idea to take a step back and re-examine the situation to ensure that you have a valid option for requesting one. Some good reasons include:


Your doctor is uncertain about the cause or best treatment of a child’s problem, or your doctor thinks that your child may have a serious or chronic disease which would be better treated by a specialist. An example is a child with diabetes who has been treated by your family physician but is beginning to have more frequent problems with sugar control.
You are not sure whether your child’s condition is being treated in the best possible way and want reassurance from another expert. An example is the asthmatic child whose wheezing episodes are becoming more severe, despite following your current doctor's recommendations.
Your child’s condition has not had the expected response to a particular therapy, such as elimination of recurring serious kidney infections.

, Sometimes parents want to seek a second opinion on their child's condition just because their current doctor tells them something that they don't want to hear. Although this is understandable, it is not a good reason for seeking a second opinion and is often just a waste of time. Other poor reasons for getting a second opinion include:


“Shopping around” to find someone who agrees with your own opinion. Perhaps you are consulting with doctors until you find one that, like you, also opposes giving childhood immunizations
You are hoping to get “better news” about a recent serious diagnosis.
You are trying to delay the need to make an important treatment decision.

Your doctor knows you and your medical history and may provide a sense of ease. Before you consider other ways to seek treatment, call your doctor’s office first to see if they can accommodate you.


Accept whatever the scheduler tells you and offer that you are flexible in when you can see your doctor, which can help you get an appointment.It is possible the doctor will have a few ""walk-in"" slots reserved for people to be seen at the practice. You may not be able to see your specific doctor, but you would still be seen by someone that same day.
Make sure to remain calm and courteous with the scheduler at your doctor’s office. Threatening her may make her more reluctant to work with you and find an appointment.;
, When talking to the scheduler, give him a brief and detailed description of your symptoms. This can help him adequately assess the severity of your situation and may help you get into your doctor more easily. He can also advise you if you need to go to an emergency room for immediate treatment.


Consider the nature of your complaints, if body function is affected, how long it has been bothering you, treatments that you have tried, and any thing that makes it better or worse. Use adjectives such as “sharp,” “throbbing,” “gushing,” or “draining” to describe your symptoms.If you are having trouble breathing, or with your circulation, you should call 911 or go to the emergency room for immediate attention.

, In many cases, the person answering the phone has no authority to make exceptions that could get you in to your doctor quickly. Ask to speak either to the office manager or head nurse, who may be able to fit you into the schedule.Explain your situation to the manager or nurse as specifically as possible.You may want to gently remind the staff remember that you have been a patient of the practice for a long time and really value the advice your doctor gives you. You can say that you would rather see your doctor than any other health professional, but don't try to use this as a threat or something to hold over the nurse's head.

, If you can, email your doctor or find her email address. Explain the urgency of your situation and kindly request to be seen as soon as possible.You may need to do a little Internet research to find your doctor’s email address, but now many doctors provide an address at which they can be reached for advice.
Keep the email as brief as possible while describing your symptoms and the urgency of your situation. Most people won’t read more than one page., Doctors will generally work with other doctors to best serve their patients. If you cannot get in to see your regular doctor, ask the office to refer or suggest another physician.


Consider asking for the names of a couple of doctors in the event that the referrals are also busy.

, In either case, if the doctor’s office can or is unable to accommodate you, offer the staff a genuine thank you for their efforts. This can help you in the future if you need an appointment.

, If your primary physician’s office referred or recommended you to a different physician, contact this doctor’s office. Kindly explain that your primary physician referred you and you were wondering if this doctor can see you.


Remember to remain calm and kind and work with the staff as much as possible. This can help you get an appointment quickly and leave a good impression not only on the staff, but also on your primary doctor’s office.

, Many localities now have urgent care facilities for people who cannot get into their doctors or another medical professional. Urgent care facilities can help you avoid long waits in the ER while receiving immediate care for whatever ails you.Remember that an urgent care facility is not a replacement for a primary care physician.You can find a local urgent care facility either in the yellow pages or by searching on the internet.
The American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine offers an online service to help you locate urgent care facilities at http://aaucm.org/patients/findurgentcarecenter/default.aspx.

, Urgent care facilities provide immediate medical care without an appointment. When you realize you need to see a doctor for a non-life threatening condition, visit the urgent care facility at your convenience.You do not need to call ahead or make an appointment at an urgent care facility. You will be triaged, with patients with the most severe or communicable symptoms being seen first.
Be aware that you may have to wait for a short amount of time depending on your needs and illness.

, Some facilities may not accept insurance and will bill you after treatment. There may be a fee you must pay upfront, especially if you do not have insurance.

, If you cannot get an appointment and need to see a doctor immediately or are suffering from a life-threatening condition, go to the emergency room as soon as possible. Emergency rooms offer the benefit of always being open and they may be able to treat your illness or injury in less time than a doctor or urgent care center.Only visit the ER if your condition is serious. An emergency room is not a replacement for a doctor and you shouldn’t take away time from patients who genuinely need immediate care if you can wait.Visit the ER if you need to see a doctor during evening or early morning hours that your doctor or an urgent care facility is not open.Make sure to always have any insurance information for your visit.

, Emergency rooms can get very busy and address patients based on their need and severity of illness or injury.If you decide to see a doctor at an ER, be prepared to wait to see a doctor, though the time may be less than waiting for an appointment with your primary care physician or the urgent care center.If you are experiencing chest pain, difficulty breathing, or trauma that involves loss of blood, your care will be considered a priority.

, Every person feels the symptoms of illness in different ways, so use words that are as specific, detailed, and descriptive as possible. This can help the doctor diagnose you and develop proper treatment.Adjectives can help the doctor understand how you feel. For example, if you have pain, explain it to your doctor by using terms such as dull, throbbing, intense, or piercing., You should never feel embarrassed discussing anything with a doctor. Be absolutely honest when you discuss your symptoms or medical history. Not telling your doctor everything relevant to your health may make it hard to diagnose your symptoms.Doctors get training for different kinds of medical conditions and contingencies. Symptoms that could embarrass you are probably something your doctor sees regularly. Don't be afraid to discuss things like STDs, rashes, or personal habits.
Keep in mind that any information you give your doctor remains confidential by law., Many doctors will ask ""What brings you to the office today?"" Be honest and tell your doctor all your symptoms, which can give your doctor context and may help her more effectively diagnose any illnesses during your visit.Some common symptoms include:Pain, fatigue, Nausea, gastrointestinal distress, fever, respiratory issues, or headache.
For example, you can tell your doctor “I’ve been experiencing headaches and persistent vomiting for the past couple of weeks.""

, Describe your specific symptoms to the doctor, showing him where on your body where you are experiencing each ailment. This information may aid your doctor in making a definitive diagnosis and formulating possible treatment.Remember to use specific and descriptive vocabulary as much as possible. If you’re having elbow pain, don’t say it’s on your arm, but point out to your doctor the exact spot on which you have the pain.

, It could be vital to describe to your doctor when your symptoms started and how often you experience them. This may help your doctor formulate possible diagnoses.Tell the doctor when your symptoms began, if and when they stop and how often you experience them. For example, “I haven’t been able to keep any food down for the past two days.""Tell your doctor how the symptoms are affecting you and your lifestyle.Other things to mention include what helps relieve symptoms, what makes symptoms worse, any treatments you have attempted, any specific medication or substances you have taken to help alleviated the problem. Include how much over-the-counter medication has been used, and how your symptoms responded to treatment.

, Tell the doctor if anything relieves or exacerbates your symptoms. She may be able to make a diagnosis and formulate potential treatment plan for you based on this information.For example, if you have pain, describe movement that makes the pain worse. You can describe this by saying ""My ankle feels fine until I bend it towards my leg, and then I experience a sharp and shooting pain.""
Describe other situations or elements that make your symptoms worse. This includes food, drink, position, activity, or medication.

, Describe how bad your symptoms are using a numerical scale of one to ten. This may help your doctor more effectively diagnose your condition and may further indicate the severity of your condition.The severity scale should range from one having virtually no impact on you to ten being the most excruciating pain you can imagine.

, It’s very important to tell your doctor if someone else you know or with whom you have contact is experiencing the same issues as you. This may help your doctor formulate a diagnosis and any alert her to potential public health issues."

Stay hydrated.,
Balance your diet.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Drink natural juice.,
Take herbal supplements with caution.,
Try a cleanse.",How to Flush Your Kidneys1," Long-term dehydration can prevent your kidneys from functioning properly. Drink whenever you feel thirsty, and drink enough to keep your urine colorless or pale yellow.It's a myth that additional water beyond this baseline will help flush your kidneys, but it will help prevent kidney stones in at-risk groups., The foods you eat are very important to your kidney health. When you are trying to flush your kidneys, pay particular attention to your diet. You should always aim to eat healthfully, but it is especially important when you are cleansing a major organ like your kidneys.A healthy, balanced diet will help prevent high blood pressure and diabetes, the two major causes of kidney damage.Watermelon is a great food to add to your diet. It contains a lot of water, and acts as a diuretic, which will help flush the toxins from your kidneys.
Eat more berries. Cranberries and raspberries in particular can help rid your kidneys of unwanted substances.
Pumpkin seeds contain a lot of powerful antioxidants that can help improve kidney function. Consider adding them to your diet as a healthy snack.

, Diets that are high in sodium lead to a greater risk of high blood pressure. This can result in extra strain on the kidneys. Reducing the sodium in your diet is an excellent way to promote overall health, especially for your kidneys.Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh varieties contain lower amounts of sodium than the canned options.
Read labels. Start scanning ingredient lists to make sure the foods you purchase do not have high sodium content. Canned soups are an obvious one to avoid. Compare products to make sure you buy the one with the lowest amounts of sodium. Look for products that are advertised as low-sodium.

, Because your kidneys are your body's filtration system, they can collect some build up. Drinking natural juice with no added sugars is a good way to stay hydrated while delivering nutrients to your body.


Cranberry juice is one of the most effective choices for kidney cleansing, because it helps reduce the amount of calcium oxalate, which can cause kidney stones. Look for juices that are all natural and do not have any added sugar.
Beet juice is also a great juice. It contains betaine, which can help remove buildup of many substances.
The natural acidity in lemon juice helps flush your kidneys.Add water to cut the sharp taste.

, Many herbs are traditionally used to treat kidney problems, but overusing them or taking them in combination with other herbs or medication can end up causing more harm than good. Always talk to your doctor before beginning any dietary supplement.


Milk thistle and grapefruit seed extract are all examples of naturopathic kidney treatments. Herbal products are usually best taken as a tea, made by steeping the herb in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes.Dietary supplements are especially risky if you have a kidney disease, or if you are taking other medication.Even beneficial supplements such as vitamin C or cranberry tablets can backfire if taken in large amounts.To avoid contaminated products, look for supplements with a seal of approval from an independent organization, such as Consumer Lab, NSF International, or U.S. Pharmacopeia., A kidney cleanse is a good way to ""reset"" your body and begin new, healthy habits. Consistent healthy changes are safer and more effective than extreme changes, so don't feel the need to design a strenuous cleansing challenge. A few days — or even just one day — of cleansing can have good results.When you are doing a cleanse, you will only eat specific foods and liquids. These includes fruits, such as cranberries, and herbs, such as marshmallow root. Look for recipes that will allow you to integrate these foods into your meals.
Cleansing means that you also need to avoid certain foods that stress your kidneys, notably alcohol and caffeine. If you are at risk for kidney stones, also avoid chocolate, nuts, tea, wheat bran, beet greens, strawberries, rhubarb, and spinach."

Be as informed as possible before making a decision.,
Let your physician know about the second opinion as early in the process as possible.,
Find the right consultant.,
Check with your health insurance provider.,
Help the consultant to prepare for your office visit.,
Obtain the necessary medical records.,
Explain your hopes and expectations to the consulting physician.,
Compare the opinions and recommendations of both doctors.,
Understand the possible outcomes of getting a second opinion.",How to Get a Second Medical Opinion for Your Child2," Before taking any action to arrange a second medical opinion, be sure to do your homework! Whenever possible, work with your pediatrician, family physician or specialist to prepare for a second opinion.


Take advantage of on-line resources. You should identify sources of information written for patients and families. Also look for community or foundation sites for your child’s specific problem. These may even provide suggestions about helpful questions that you may not have considered. Being able to ask meaningful questions is a must to assure that you get meaningful information from a consultant.
Discuss your concerns and thoughts with your child’s physician and ask for feedback and suggestions. For these discussions, be candid and ask your doctor to be candid in return.
Discuss the reasons for a second opinion with your child and encourage questions. Otherwise he may worry that the health problems are even worse than he thought.

, As early as possible, explain to your child's primary physician that you want to arrange for a second opinion. Don’t worry about hurting your doctor’s feelings — most doctors welcome a second opinion.


They know that it can strengthen the family’s confidence, particularly when dealing with challenging health issues. Another’s doctors viewpoint can also provide your child's physician with valuable information and experience.
Not telling your physician or going behind her back runs a greater risk of generating hard feelings. Also bear in mind that if your doctor is “put out” or offended by the request, you’re probably seeing the wrong doctor.

, Ask your child’s physician or specialist to provide several recommendations. Feel free to ask as many questions about these recommendations as possible — it's okay to ask why certain doctor's were suggested, what their areas of expertise are and whether your doctor has worked with them before.


If possible, avoid seeing someone in your doctor’s group for the consultation; you will be more likely to get a fresh viewpoint from someone else.
Check with friends or relatives for suggestions, especially if any of them are in the medical field. Also ask your health insurance provider for the names of physician sub-specialists in their network.
Check websites for relevant patient organizations or foundations. There is often information available about qualified doctors by region. If there is a local chapter of the organization, contact them directly.

, Medical care costs add up quickly. You need to consider whether there will be additional expenses incurred from a second opinion. Inform your insurance provider of your wish to get a second opinion and, if asked, the reason for your request.


Many insurance providers will cover second opinions, but it's important to find out ahead of time what exactly will be covered. Be sure to take into account the cost of the consultation itself along with the cost of any follow-up laboratory testing or x-ray procedures.
If you have a particular institution or individual in mind for the second opinion, ask specifically about coverage. You may incur additional expenses if the consultant's facility is out of the network.
If you think that you may transfer care or have a surgical procedure done at another institution after the consultation is completed, be sure that your insurance provider will cover these services and, if so, what documentation is required.

, It's a good idea to be as helpful as possible in preparing the consultant for your visit. After all, you are asking for the doctor to evaluate and provide an opinion about your child’s previous medical course, current status, and future considerations. Any previous medical records or information you can provide will be useful.


Call your consultant’s office and ask what specific records should be obtained so that the information is relevant to the consultation. It is a waste of time for a consultant to have to wade through a huge packet of irrelevant information. When you request records, be specific about what you need and the inclusive dates
Provide the consultant with your child's medical records at least one week before your scheduled visit, earlier if you live far from the consultant. You may have to provide written permission to each site of care to release the requested information.

, As mentioned above, you should provide the consulting physician with any requested medical records. Previous records should include those from all individuals who have had significant involvement in your child’s health problem. Specifically, these records may include:


Specific office visit records: you may need all of them, just the ones to the specialist, or only the summary letters from a specialist to your doctor.
Other clinical records, such as hospitalization discharge summaries, surgery reports, specific hospital flow sheets, special studies.
Radiology studies including x-rays, sonograms, CT scans, fluoroscopy, MRI, or special procedures. Often, the consultant will want to see the actual radiology images, not just the reports. If so, inform the radiology facilities where studies were done and request that they provide copies. Today, nearly every major radiology facility or practice is able to easily copy the studies to a CD or DVD disk for your consultant.
Results of previous laboratory tests. If less common tests have been done and requested by the consultant (genetic studies or special hormone profiles for example), be sure you include these in your request.

, When you meet with the doctor, start by stating why you are there and what you hope to accomplish. Be sure to provide important background detail, but be as brief as possible so you don’t unnecessarily reduce the time for questions and discussion.


Understand and be clear about your concerns; be sure that those concerns are addressed in your discussion with the consultant. After all, that’s why you wanted a second opinion in the first place.
You may be anxious or pre-occupied during the visit. Be sure that you have written down your main questions beforehand so you don’t forget to ask. Also bring along a notebook to write down key information – you are not likely to remember all of it later.

, If the consulting physician's recommendations differ significantly from those of your original doctor, ask the consultant to explain the reasons and importance of the differences.


At the end of the visit, be sure to request a copy of the consultant’s report that is sent to your doctor. However, be cautious about interpreting the report without medical input. It’s advisable to review it with your original physician specialist.
Pay particular attention to any areas of disagreement between your doctor and the consultant. Some of these may be of little significance; a preference for one brand over another of the same drug, or two basically equivalent radiology studies.
However, more significant disagreements could pose a more serious issue, and you should discuss these with your child's primary physician.

, There are several possible outcomes following a consultation with a second doctor. The most likely of these include the following:



One: You feel reassured, and are satisfied with your doctor’s care management.

Two: Your doctor considers the consultant’s comments to be valuable and is willing to modify care accordingly and to your satisfaction.

Three: You decide to continue your child’s care with the consultant, with or without your doctor’s involvement.
If you are unable to decide whose recommendations to follow, consider asking the physicians if they would be willing to discuss the case with one another; as there may be factors that neither of them took into account. Your other choice, which is justified in certain circumstances, would be to obtain a third opinion from another consultant.

Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Take medicines as directed.",How to Flush Your Kidneys2," Physical exercise can help you avoid weight gain and high blood pressure, both of which put unnecessary pressure on your kidneys. Keeping your body healthy can help your kidneys function properly. Aim to get at least 20 minutes of physical activity each day.Look for an activity that you enjoy. For example, if you like to walk, recruit a friend and schedule a standing date to explore your neighborhood. If you like to swim, look for a community pool in your area.
If you're new to exercise, consult your doctor before beginning any program.

, If you smoke, quitting can help improve not only your overall health, but it will greatly benefit your kidneys. Smoking impedes blood flow to vital organs, including your kidneys. This means that they cannot effectively flush toxins from your body.Quitting smoking is hard, but there are many resources you can use. Ask your doctor about medication or nicotine cessation products such as gum or patches.

, While there are many benefits to medications, there can also be side effects. Some prescription medications have been known to cause damage to the kidneys. Make sure to discuss this possibility whenever your doctor issues you a prescription.Over-the-counter pain killers — especially the NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, Aleve, and Motrin — can also cause damage to the kidneys if taken on a regular basis. They are fine for occasional use, but talk to your doctor about alternatives if you need to treat chronic pain and have concerns about your kidney health.Acetaminophen is a kidney-safe NSAID."

Learn why your kidneys are important.,
Know the risks of poor kidney health.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Flush Your Kidneys3," You'll be better able to take care of your kidneys if you understand how essential they are for your health. Your kidneys remove waste from your body — think of it as your filtration system. Without your kidneys, your levels of sodium and potassium could reach harmful levels.Try to create habits that lead to good overall health. For example, try limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake. You'll see multiple health benefits, and your kidneys will thank you.

, Chronic kidney disease is the most common kidney ailment. If the condition persists, it can cause your kidneys to fail, meaning waste is not being properly filtered. Symptoms of kidney disease include fatigue, nausea, increased or decreased urination, fluid buildup (which may cause shortness of breath), and an increase in potassium levels.Chronic kidney disease is typically caused by high blood pressure or diabetes. If you suffer from either condition, have a doctor test your kidney function at least once a year.

Kidney stones are another common ailment. These are solid particles, frequently formed by minerals, and can be very painful. Symptoms include pain (sometimes extremely severe and stabbing) in the back, flank, and abdomen, as well as and difficulty and pain during urination.

, If you suspect you have a kidney ailment, you should seek medical attention. Be sure to describe your symptoms as specifically as possible to your doctor. You can also ask for information about preventing kidney ailments.

Consider using make up.,
Choose clothing that fits you well and complements your coloring.,
Consider strengthening/toning/firming exercises.,
See a physiotherapist for advice about posture.,
Change your diet.,
Avoid or minimize the use of drugs, alcohol, and other stimulants.,
Get your beauty sleep.,

Accept yourself for who you are.",How to Find Reliable Alternatives to Plastic Surgery," There are many different possibilities for changing, enhancing, and downplaying your own natural features and age. Purchase a good book that contain instructions on shading, highlighting, etc. techniques for reshaping your features and for covering up blemishes.;
, Quality clothing is an incredible supporter of your looks, no matter what your age. Don't let yourself down by wearing dowdy clothing when you could show off your looks to their best advantage in good clothes.

, If you are considering plastic surgery because you are feeling saggy or poorly toned, exercise might be the solution. There are so many possibilities that could work, including yoga, cycling, pilates, aerobics, swimming, etc. that it pays to do your research and to try a few out. Read about the benefits of each type of exercise to work out which areas of your body the exercise will target best.

, Posture is a very important part of keeping us looking youthful and helping us to stay flexible. If you don't know whether or not you have good posture, see a professional and get assessed. Pay attention to their advice on how to improve your posture. Once you practice these exercises, you might be amazed at the results in your overall appearance.

, Some aspects of your looks might be able to be improved with different nutrition. For example, you might be able to reduce puffiness, bloating, rashes, etc., by dietary changes. Seek professional help. Drink plenty of water as well; this can help keep your system clean and functioning properly, thereby removing impurities from your system.

, These indulgences age human beings very quickly and are definitely one thing that you can avoid.

, This cliché exists for a reason – adequate sleep rejuvenates. Don't sleep too little or too much; know the amount of sleep that works for you and keep this routine with great regularity.

, Think kind thoughts. How you feel on the inside is reflected on the outside and if you feel grumpy and irritable, you will get more frown lines, and a sallow demeanor than if you smile more and radiate cheerfulness. While this is not a given alternative to plastic surgery, feeling better inside and feeling better about yourself is one way to curb the desire to even seek plastic surgery in the first place.

, Sometimes a wish to get plastic surgery stems from not loving yourself as you are and from having low self-esteem. If this is the case, it is wiser to put your efforts into learning to love yourself than to undergoing the knife.

Act fast.,
Scrape the stinger out.,
Pull the stinger out.,
Do not worry if you don’t find a stinger.,
Wash the sting.,
Reduce swelling with an ice pack.,
Reduce pain with over-the-counter painkillers.,
Combat itching and swelling with a topical cream or spray.,
Monitor yourself for anaphylactic shock.",How to Get a Stinger Out," If you can remove the stinger before all of the venom in the venom sac enters your body, this will help minimize the effects of the sting.The venom enters your skin in seconds, so act as soon as you feel the sting.
When removing the stinger, be careful not to squeeze the venom sac at the end of the stinger. Doing so may increase the amount of venom that goes into your skin.;
, Scrape across the stinger until you dislodge it from your skin. You may be able to see the venom sac at the end of the stinger. Again, be careful not to squeeze the sac. For this method, a thin object with a straight edge works best. Items you can use include:The back of a pocket knife. If you are using a knife to remove the stinger from someone else, only do so if the person is able to be still enough that you are confident you won’t cut them. Do not use this method on a child whose movements may be unpredictable.
The edge of a credit card (or driver's license, etc.). This method is safe to use on a child because there is no risk that you could injure him or her with the card.

, Use a tweezers or your fingernails to pull the stinger out. Grasp the stinger as close to your skin as possible. Try to grip it below the venom sac so that you will not squeeze more venom into your skin. Pull out with a slow steady pressure.The stinger may be barbed, so it may be uncomfortable as you remove it.
Do not jerk the stinger out. This increases the risk that it will break, leaving a smaller, more difficult to remove fragment in your skin.

, Wasps and hornets usually do not leave the stinger in the victim’s skin, so you may not find a stinger.If you have been stung by a wasp or hornet, they can sting repeatedly. Calmly but quickly leave the area where you were stung to avoid getting stung again.

, After you have removed the stinger, wash the area with soap and water. This will clean it and reduce the chances of it becoming contaminated with dirt or bacteria.Hold the sting under running water for several seconds to thoroughly flush the area of dirt and debris.
Gently rub the area with a mild soap and rinse thoroughly.
Pat the area dry.

, Apply ice wrapped in a clean towel to the sting. Apply the cold pack for 10–15 minutes, and then remove it for ten minutes to allow the tissue to warm up, before reapplying it.If you have circulation problems, then use the ice for less time to reduce the risk of frostbite.
If you do not have an ice pack handy, a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel will work just as well.
Do not put the ice directly on your skin because it can cause frostbite. Wrap it in a towel or cloth.

, Consult your doctor before taking these medications if you are pregnant, nursing, treating a child, or on other medications which could interact. Do not give children or teenagers aspirin. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Possible medications include:Paracetamol
Ibuprofen

, The amount of localized swelling that people get varies from person to person. In addition, while the sting may hurt at first, it may itch more later. Possible treatments include:Hydrocortisone cream (1%)
Calamine lotion
An oral antihistamine with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton)

, If you know you are allergic to bee stings, you have likely been prescribed an emergency epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Twinject). Use it according to your doctor’s orders and the manufacturer’s instructions. If you have used an epinephrine injector or you are going into anaphylactic shock, call emergency responders immediately. Symptoms include:


Itchy skin
Red rash
Swelling of the eyes, lips, hands, feet
The feeling that your throat is closing or swelling of the mouth, throat, or tongue
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty breathing
Abdominal discomfort
Nausea or vomiting
Unconsciousness

Join a PTSD support group.",How to Ease PTSD with Electric Patches," Electrical patch treatment is also known as trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS). TNS treats PTSD by pulsing the trigeminal nerve in the brain with electrical energy while you sleep. This can help to reset the electrical network in your brain and help relieve your PTSD symptomsThe treatment uses a 9-volt battery, similar to the ones found in your television remote, to create a low-level current that zaps your brain through a forehead patch. The current targets your trigeminal nerve and other brain regions that regulate your mood, behavior, and thought.
In a recent test trial, one vet with PTSD noted that the first two weeks of treatment were a bit uncomfortable as the forehead patch would shock him with a sharp electrical pulse if he moved his head a certain way. But after two weeks, the vet’s sleep patterns improved significantly. He experienced less nightmares, and he had more energy and motivation overall. The positive effects seemed to continue even after his eight week trial. This indicates that TNS could have long-term positive effects on PTSD symptoms.;
, Most PTSD treatments involve medication, therapy, and coping techniques. Even some of the best PTSD treatments can leave patients with residual symptoms, such as anxiety, irritability, an inability to sleep, anger issues, and depression. However, in recent studies, TNS was shown to have very minimal side effects.In a recent test trial done by UCLA, 12 patients with PTSD between the ages of 18 and 75 underwent TNS treatment for eight hours a night for eight weeks. The patients all described mood improvements, an easier time getting to sleep, and less anxiety. Most patients noted their PTSD symptoms dropped by more than 30 percent and their depression severity fell by more than 50 percent. They also did not experience any side effects due to TNS besides skin irritation on their forehead due to the patch., TNS treatment for PTSD is still in testing phase, and is considered an investigational therapy. It is not yet commercially available or certified for commercial use.A follow-up trial to the UCLA test study is underway and may take two to three years to complete. The trial involves 74 veterans with PTSD and will look at how viable TNS is for veterans with PTSD., Your doctor may be able to offer more information on the ongoing test trials for TNS and give you more information on how TNS can ease your PTSD symptoms.


If you are on any medication for PTSD, your doctor may also be able to tell you how TNS might interact with your current medication.
You may want to speak to a doctor who specializes in PTSD or get a referral to a therapist who is trained in treating PTSD symptoms.

, Researchers focused on TNS treatment for PTSD are planning to recruit military veterans for the next phase of their study.If you are a vet with PTSD, you may want to ask your doctor if you can be a voluntary test subject for the TNS test trials. This would allow you to experience TNS in a highly regulated environment and be a part of a potentially life altering treatment.
You can also look online to see if the clinical trials for TNS are still recruiting applicants., If you are interested in using TNS for your PTSD symptoms, you may want to keep your eye on the results of the latest test trials for TNS. Do an online search every few weeks to see if the results of the test trials have been published or are available to the public. You can also have an ongoing conversation with your doctor around TNS to stay updated on when the treatment may be available commercially for individuals with PTSD.

, Cognitive therapy is guided by a therapist who helps you understand your trauma and its aftermath. The goal is to identify how certain thoughts about your trauma can cause stress and make your PTSD symptoms worse. The therapist will help you replace fearful or angry thoughts with more accurate and less disturbing thoughts. You will also learn about ways to process your feelings of anger, guilt, or fear.Your doctor may be able to refer you to a therapist that is trained in cognitive therapy. You can also talk to your local mental health clinic or a counseling center for a referral., Exposure therapy is when you talk to a therapist repeatedly about the trauma as a way to learn to control your thoughts and feelings around the trauma. It may be difficult or uncomfortable to do this at first, as you will need to confront your memories of the trauma. Over time, you will feel less overwhelmed by the trauma and learn how to react to these stressful memories.The therapist may have you start by focusing on memories that are less upsetting and then gradually move to memories that are more upsetting. This technique is known as ""desensitization"", and allows you to process bad memories a little bit at a time. The therapist may also suggest that you try to remember a lot of bad memories at once, a process called ""flooding"". This can help you to learn how to be less overwhelmed by stressful memories.

, Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) involves stimulating your eyes, and using hand taps and other sounds to help you process your trauma. Your doctor can refer you to an EMDR therapist. The therapist may move her hand and have you follow the movement with your eyes as you talk about the trauma.Though there is not a universal agreement by professionals that eye movement can help treat PTSD, the eye movements can help to ""unfreeze"" your brain's information processing system. This system can often get overwhelmed or disturbed by extreme stress., Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant medication that can help you feel less sad and stressed out by your trauma. SSRIs bring up the level of serotonin in your brain, which can then help the chemicals in your brain balance out. SSRIs come in several forms, including citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (such as Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).There are also other prescriptions medications that can be used to treat PTSD. Ask your doctor for more information about these medications.

, Doing group therapy can also help you to process your PTSD, whether this is in the form of a PSTD support group or a therapy group that focuses on certain types of PTSD, such as veterans with PTSD. It can be highly therapeutic to share your experiences with other individuals who can empathize and understand them. Sharing with a group can also allow you to process feelings of guilt, anger, and shame in a healthy way.Find more information on PTSD support groups in your area by talking to your doctor or another health care professional.

Know the complications of glandular fever if left untreated.",How to Ease Glandular Fever Symptoms," When you have a fever, your metabolism increases and makes use of more water. The body tries to regulate the temperature inside you by making the stored water evaporate through sweat to cool you off. These two factors combined lead to dehydration. Thus drinking more than 10 glasses of water a day is recommended in order to replace the lost fluids.Water is definitely best, though sports drinks with electrolytes can be good, too. Stay away from sweetened juices, sodas, coffees, and caffeinated teas. These are just empty calories and sugar and can ultimately be dehydrating.;
, A viral illness is usually associated with weakness and a feeling that you do not want to get out of bed.This is a way the body tells us to get more rest and sleep – and you should listen. It is recommended to sleep at least 8 to 10 hours a day to aid your body in fighting infection for the first two weeks of glandular fever.During sleep, the immune system releases cytokines, a protein molecule that the cells of the immune system use to send signals between one another. When you have an infection or inflammation, certain cytokines increase.Cytokines usually help fight off infections by telling the immune system which specific viral cells it should be attacking., Heat up a cup of water in the microwave, add the salt, and stir it up so it completely dissolves. Gargle the entire solution over the course of the next few minutes to alleviate the symptoms of your sore throat.


This is a hypertonic solution (high in salt). These concoctions can aid in reducing inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory signals to the brain.This is not recommended for children as they can swallow the solution., Certain foods can create problems for your enlarged tonsils. Eat warm soups that will aid in soothing your throat and tonsils; you can add a squeeze of lemon, some soy sauce or even some milk or cream to improve the taste. Some soups, especially vegetable soups, can be put into the blender to make them smooth, creamy, and easier to swallow, too.


Warm drinks will give you immediate relief from your sore throat. They also keep your body warm, which aids in getting rid of the virus or bacteria. You can drink hot peppermint, ginger, cinnamon decaffeinated teas, hot lemon drunk alone or to be squeezed on tea, green tea, or anise. All these natural herbs and drinks can bring about improvement to your throat and tonsillitis symptoms as they all share anti-inflammatory and anti-septic effects.

, To reduce your fever, taking showers or having a nice bath can be helpful. However, this is a very temporary solution and won't affect the longevity of your symptoms in the long term.


Be careful if you sweat excessively from fever. Avoid going out in the cold air suddenly or sitting in front of the air conditioner; abrupt changes in temperature can lead to additional muscle aches, sore throat pain, runny nose and other common cold or flu signs. Instead, always keep yourself dry and clean, wear cotton clothes that can suck away all your sweat and prevent irritation.

, Using a home steamer (available in most supermarkets and drug stores), you can inhale steam through your nose or your mouth for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time, 4 to 5 times per day. The key is to take in deep breaths and then breathe out slowly. This will help to soothe and hydrate your throat as well as helping to dilate your blood vessels.


Dilation of blood vessels will help drugs act faster, as well as provide better oxygenation to all the tissues in your body which will indirectly help relieve your symptoms.
You might remember from your high school biology classes that blood transports oxygen around the body, and oxygen is vital for all the body's tissues and vital organs to work and function healthily.

, Immerse some clean bath towels or flannels in ice cold water, then squeeze out the excess water and apply the towels over the body (but not the face and neck) when you have a high fever.


Though you already feel very cold and might be shivering because of the fever, in reality, your body is doing the exact opposite, i.e. heating up!
Though this might cause discomfort, placing cold towels over the body will help speed up the process of bringing down the fever and will help to put you at ease and make you feel better.

, Glandular fever is transmitted through close and personal contact with people affected by the virus. It can be spread through saliva by kissing, which is why the infection is also referred to as the “kissing disease.” The virus can also be transmitted through airborne droplets by exposure to cough and sneezing, sharing of eating and drinking utensils and contact with the hands of the carriers. Here's what to keep in mind:


Never kiss or hug anyone while you’re infected with the virus.
Always keep adequate space between you and person in front of you while talking or working.
For spontaneous sneezing or coughing, always keep a tissue in your hand to cover your nose and mouth with and to be thrown immediately in the trash after using.
Never keep used tissues on your desk, in your pockets, bags or anywhere that anyone can touch to avoid spreading the virus on different surfaces.
Always wash your hands with certain medical soaps that contain antibacterial antiseptic agents to keep your hands clean while holding shared objects like pens, books, door handles, keys, money, etc.
Never share your cups, plates or anything you can eat or drink from at your work, school or home. Get rid of disposable utensils or put them in the sink to have a good wash.
Never share your personal things as towels, toothbrushes, or dental floss with others. They can easily carry infected saliva to others.

, Pain killers or analgesics help in reducing the sharpness of the pain and fever, especially in the first week of the symptoms. They will help you recover and be able to return to your simple daily activities. Paracetamol (Tylenol) is widely used for children and adults as it’s safe and available in many dosage forms. Naproxen and aspirin are also commonly used.


A dose of two tablets of 500 mg Paracetamol for adults is enough to be taken up to every six hours daily. It can be taken as regular tablets, acti-fast tablets like Panadol, or liquids according to the age of the patient.
These medications work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin E2 which causes the cells in the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates temperature) to fire at a rapid rate, therefore increasing the body’s temperature.These medicines also work by blocking specific body chemicals that send pain signals to the brain.
Aspirin is not recommended for children suffering from viral illnesses because it can lead to the development of Reye Syndrome, a rare disease that damages the brain and liver, that can be fatal.In addition, patients with hepatic failure should ask their doctor before taking certain painkillers, Paracetamol included.

, It’s considered a powerful antioxidant and immune stimulant agent. The normal dose for adults is 500 mg tablets to be taken twice daily. However, talk to your doctor to find out what dosage is right for you.


Some lozenges with vitamin C can be taken to ease the soreness of the throat, too. Lozenges such as Strepsils are available in many flavors such as lemon, orange, strawberry and menthol. They'll help in soothing your throat and locally fighting the infection.

, These can be used to fight glandular fever due to their analgesic, anti-pyretic (anti-fever) and anti-inflammatory effects. Common examples of NSAIDs are Diclofenac salts (Voltaren) and Ibuprofen (Brufen). Both are available in many dosage forms as tablets, effervescent sachets, and injections.


A dose of Voltaren 50 mg twice daily for adults can be helpful for treating glandular fever. Brufen is available in syrups for children, to be taken as one teaspoonful twice daily after meals.
NSAIDs have some side effects especially when it comes to gastrointestinal disorders, nausea, and gastric or peptic ulcers. Patients having hepatic or renal disorders or taking any blood thinning drugs like Warfarin should ask their doctor before taking these medications.
Aspirin acts as NSAIDs in inhibiting COX enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandin, which is contributed in the inflammation and fever process, and responsible for pain too, Aspirin is contraindicated in children below the age of eighteen to avoid the risk of developing Reye’s syndrome (affecting mainly the brain and liver).

, The virus can cause swelling of the tonsils that partially blocks the respiratory passage and leads to breathing difficulties. In such cases, a short course of oral steroid therapy can also be utilized to reduce the inflammation. The following common steroids are used:Corticosteroids. These work by blocking chemicals in the immune system that are in charge in the process of inflammation. Dosage is usually lowered as the condition improves since it can cause serious side effects.

Hydrocortisone. This is used to reduce the severity of swelling in joints and tendons. It can be in the form of cream, lotion or injections.

Prednisolone. This is used to treat autoimmune and allergic reactions. It is available in tablet, suppository and injection form.

Dexamethasone. This is used as an emergency medicine to control symptoms of serious conditions such as difficulty in breathing due to an allergic reaction. It is usually given in injection form.

Fludrocortisone. This is used to treat Addison’s disease.

, Glandular fever is caused by a virus. Antibiotics don’t work against viruses, but the complications can lead to the development of a secondary bacterial infection wherein antibiotics can be used to treat and prevent further damage to the body.


Wide spectrum antibiotics are mainly used, like Clavulanic acid and Amoxicillin (Augmentin). They're available as tablets or liquids and should be administrated according to the patient’s age. An adult dose of Augmentin is usually 1gm every 12 hours to be taken after meals.
Another type of antibiotics is Ciprofloxacin (Ciprobay), but its contraindicated in children below the age of 18. If prescribed, do not take it with any dairy products, multi vitamins or antacids, as it interferes with calcium and many minerals in them, leading to a decrease in Ciprofloxacin blood concentrations.

, This is a medical intervention that replaces lost fluids in the body by inserting a sterile needle into the vein, which is connected to a tube and fluid bottle. This is reserved for serious cases of dehydration.


If you have a fever, your increased body temperature also increases your metabolism. This means that all the biochemical reactions in the body needed to keep us alive start to speed up. In order for the body to do this, it needs both water and oxygen. We are able to breathe faster because the body supplies more oxygen. As you breathe faster, more moisture is expelled along with carbon dioxide. The body makes use of more water, thus resulting in dehydration.Also, if you have a fever, the increase in temperature causes you to sweat more because your body tries to regulate its temperature by making the stored water evaporate through sweat to cool you off. More sweat leads to dehydration.

, When EBV infects a person, it’s mainly located in the saliva. The virus can then be transmitted from one person to another through this route, even if the infected person doesn’t show any signs – the virus has an incubation period that can reach up to eight weeks. An EBV infection can be transmitted one of the following ways:



Kissing. Kissing and close contact can spread the EBV infection to a healthy person when they kiss an infected one. This is why glandular fever is sometimes called the “kissing disease.""

Exposure to coughing and sneezing. These two actions get infected saliva on various surfaces, in your hands, or even directly on you if you're in close contact with an infected person.

Sharing personal things with others. This includes toothbrushes, towels, cups or kitchen utensils like plates, spoons or forks. All these things are used directly in the mouth or around the face. If used by an infected person, others are at high risk of developing the disease if they use them, too.

, Glandular fever symptoms can be uncomfortable, but in most cases are not a threat to your health. Symptoms of glandular fever usually develop one to two months after being infected by Epstein Barr virus. The symptoms include:



High grade fever (38°C or 100.4°F) or above. This symptom is usually felt for 10 to 14 days. Fever occurs as the body’s compensatory mechanism to infection.

Sore throat. If large amount of microorganisms are trapped in the throat, the tonsils will swell and become inflamed.This generally lasts for three to five days.

Swollen lymph nodes (Lymphadenopathy). These are in the neck and in some cases under the armpits and groins. Viruses, bacteria and other foreign bodies are trapped in the lymph nodes and are destroyed by lymphocytes which are special white blood cells. This causes the lymph nodes to swell.Severe fatigue and aching muscle pains. Extreme tiredness can last for several weeks up to six months. The common cause of temporary muscle fatigue and weakness is infection. The muscles become inflamed and pain receptors send pain signals to the brain whenever infection is present.Enlargement of the spleen (Splenomegaly). The spleen enlarges if it is asked to do excessive work in filtering or manufacturing blood cells, if there is abnormal blood flow to it, or if it is invaded with abnormal cells or deposits.Swelling of the liver. The infection can reach the liver causing it to swell and become inflamed due to the production of inflammatory chemicals of the body.

Jaundice. Yellow discoloration of the eyes and the skin may occur. If the liver fails to excrete bilirubin, which it can in cases of glandular fever, its level in the body will increase and this yellow pigment will contribute to yellow skin and yellow eyes.

Loss of appetite. Infection alters the normal eating habits of a person. When higher body temperatures occur, the enzyme’s function in your taste buds stop and therefore cannot send messages to the brain because they are able to work only in an environmental temperature of 77-98.6° F (25-37°C).Headache. Infection triggers the occurrence of headaches. Specific nerves of the blood vessels are activated and send pain signals to the brain. It’s not clear, however, why these signals are activated in the first place., A physical examination is the first step to diagnose a glandular fever. If your doctor suspects you have this ailment, they'll likely recommend a blood test known as the antibody test and a throat swab performed to eliminate the potential of a bacterial infection.


For pregnant women, tests to verify rubella and toxoplasmosis can be done to make sure that the health of the unborn baby is not at risk. The Epstein Barr virus can shorten the duration of the pregnancy leading to low average birth weight, length, and head circumference of the baby., Commonly, glandular fever is not a life threatening disease; however, in some instances serious conditions occur. Here's how it can affect you if left untreated:



Low white blood cell count. Low production of white blood cells makes a person more vulnerable to infection. And a low amount of platelets in the blood will contribute to abnormal bleeding and easy bruising.

Swelling or rupture of the spleen. A sudden, sharp abdominal pain can be an implication of a ruptured spleen. An enlargement of the spleen does not pose an immediate health problem but when the spleen bursts it is considered to be a life threatening emergency because it can cause severe internal bleeding.Neurological Complications. The Epstein Barr virus affects the nervous system and generates neurological complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell's palsy, viral meningitis, and encephalitis.

Secondary infection. The infection causing glandular fever can spread to other parts of the body. Secondary infections cause pneumonia and pericarditis.

Breathing difficulties. Swelling of the tonsils can hinder good breathing.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Glandular fever infection affects the nervous system, which leads to prolonged fatigue that can last for more than six months.

Know that distraction can be an unhealthy response.,
Acknowledge the feeling that you’re having.,
Recognize that distractions can help you through unhealthy responses.,
Transform your response into a healthy distraction.",How to Distract Yourself1," Distraction is a mechanism used to avoid dealing with difficulties and feelings in our lives. Some distractions that are considered unhealthy include eating junk food when stressed or turning to alcohol or drugs. For example, if you have an anger management problem, you might turn to drugs to handle your overwhelming feelings.;
, It’s healthier to acknowledge and let go of the negative feeling that you’re experiencing. You can still use a distraction, but know that the distraction is drawing you away from something that may need to be processed. Otherwise, you’re just covering up or ignoring the negative emotion you’re feeling., If you have an addiction, you might use a distraction to prevent yourself from using more. This need for distraction happens because you’ve acknowledged the negative feelings of wanting to use. You are making a conscious decision to positively address your addiction.Count to 100 to buy yourself time when you feel the desire to use drugs or alcohol.
Use a distraction to give yourself a time-out before you deal with the negative feelings.

, Your natural inclination to a stressful situation or feeling might be to engage in an unhealthy distraction. You might want to eat too much junk food, for example, or drink too much alcohol. It’s fine to distract yourself after acknowledging the feeling. But choose more productive activities so that you’re treating your body and mind with respect and care. These might include:


Taking a walk
Eating some fruit instead of a candy bar
Reading a book
Cleaning up your desk

Identify negative people in your work life.,
Think about any negative people you interact with at school.,
Identify negative people in your home life.,
Focus on spending less time and energy with negative people.,
Establish boundaries with negative people.,
Adopt a positive attitude around negative individuals.,
Identify your unhealthy habits.,
Cut back on these unhealthy habits.,
Avoid negative self-talk.,
Use positive affirmations.,
Follow a healthy, balanced diet.,
Get eight to nine hours of sleep a night.,
Stay physically fit.,
Focus on building positive relationships with others.",How to Erase Negative Influence and Live Positively," Take a moment to identify any negative company you may be associating with in the office. Ask yourself if any individuals take your time for granted on a regular basis or if they demand—overtly or covertly—that you divert effort from your task set in order to appease them. Such individuals may act selfishly by squandering their time while siphoning yours. They may show up late for work, meetings, or group activities may consistently contribute little, thereby placing undue burden on you and your coworkers.A negative individual may also display envy or jealousy towards you and make you feel bad about your accomplishments and achievements at work. They may tell you that you are not accomplished or that you did not deserve recognition for something you did. For example, when you receive a promotion or a bonus, the negative individual may tell you that ""you got lucky"" or ""you didn't deserve such a pay bump"".;
, This could be individuals in your group of friends, peers in your class or even a professor or teacher. The negative individual may talk over you in class, put you down in front of others, or tell you your thoughts are stupid or incorrect when you share them at school. They may also try to embarrass you in front of your group of friends and make you feel worthless as an individual.


A negative person may think the worst is going to happen and always see things as only good or bad, with an emphasis on the bad. This could be a friend who likes to remind you that ""we are all doomed and alone"" or a peer who tells you that you are ""not smart"" or ""not unique"".

, A negative person in your home life, like a parent or sibling, may try to change you or convince you that you need to improve upon who you already are. You may doubt who you are and what you stand for due to the influence of this person and start to feel like your opinions and ideas are not valid or not worth sharing.


The negative person may also continuously remind you that your opinions are not worthwhile or correct and try to chip away at your self-esteem and self-confidence. They may tell you you are ""stupid"", ""worthless"", or ""dumb"". They may also disregard your opinions when you talk by telling you to ""shut up"" or disregard what you have to say completely.

, To remove a negative person from your life, you should first put some distance between you and this person, whether they are at school, at work, or at home. This could mean not spending every weekend with a negative friend or not answering a negative friend’s calls right away. Try to allow yourself time and space to release yourself from this person, especially if she is a close friend or relative.This could also mean shifting the amount of time you spend with negative individuals so it can be more positive and productive. Invite a negative person out with your more positive friends so she can see what being around positive conversation and attitudes can feel like.
You could also limit the amount of airtime the negative person receives by going out together in a big group rather than one on one so you both have a chance to talk to others, rather than talk to each other about negative things.

, Though you may be tempted to cut out negative people from your life completely, you may be forced to work with a negative person on a project or live with a negative person as a roommate. Rather than let the person’s negativity drive you crazy, you can try to create boundaries so you feel in control and safe around the negative person. Try to talk to others more than the negative person when you are working together on the group project or maintaining a different schedule than your negative roommate so you are both never home at the same time.Try to maintain these boundaries even if the negative individual attempts to encroach on them. Remind yourself that setting these boundaries will help both of you avoid a potential conflict and allow you to still work or live around this person out of necessity.

, Take back the positivity in your life by adopting a more positive and open attitude when you are around negative individuals. If the negative person makes a negative comment about the weather, for example, remind her that tomorrow will be sunny and better than today. Or, if the negative person comments on a person in a negative or hurtful way, point out that the person is actually very nice and generous.Countering negativity with a positive attitude can also help you defuse the negative perspective of your friends or relatives and address the negativity in a way that feels proactive and open.

, Everyone has their own personal unhealthy habits, from binge drinking, smoking, and partying to eating unhealthy foods or having unhealthy emotional habits like self-hate and low self-esteem. Take a moment to write down any unhealthy habits you are currently practicing in your life. Think about any habits that make you feel unhappy or sucks away all your energy.


Though more obvious unhealthy habits like partying and drinking may be an issue, other habits like unhealthy eating or unhealthy relationships with others can also bring you down and contribute to the negativity in your life.

, Activities like binge drinking, smoking and partying may feel good in the moment, you will likely wake up in the morning with a pounding hangover and negative feelings. Cutting back unhealthy habits will allow you to use your time on other activities that could lead to progress in your career, your personal passions, and your development as an individual.


Rather than stop doing all of these activities cold turkey, you can try to reduce the amount of time you devote to them. This may mean going out only one or two times a week instead of every night after work, or choosing one night a week as your going out night with friends or your partner.
Blowing off stress by being social with friends does not always have to mean drinking at bars; instead you could try to spend more time at home by inviting friends over for a relaxing night in or cooking for friends as a way to socialize.

, Negative self-talk can sometimes be just as damaging as negative habits. You may practice negative self-talk by only focusing on the negative aspects of a situation or an event, rather than the positive aspects. For example, maybe you had a great, productive day at work and rather than come home to celebrate it, you can only focus on all the tasks you will need to get done the following work day.You might also consciously or unconsciously blame yourself when something bad happens, making every bad moment personal for you. For example, a friend may cancel a night out with you and a group of friends, and rather than let it go, you may convince yourself that plans were changed because no one wanted to hang out with you. You may think, ""It's all my fault"" or ""No one likes me"".
When you have negative self-talk, you may convince yourself the worst is going to happen and that disaster is imminent at every turn. You may also have a very either/or view of the world, where situations are either good or bad and there is no grey zone or possibility for the positive. You may think, ""Everything sucks"" or ""Nothing good is happening to me"".

, Turn your negative self-talk into a positive force by focusing on healthy self-talk that makes you feel good. This means never saying anything to yourself that you would not say to anyone else. Evaluate any negative thoughts that enter your mind, consider it, and then respond with a positive thought instead.Say positive affirmations out loud to yourself every day, focusing on the phrase “you are what you think”. Vocalize positive thoughts in the morning to start your day on a good note and focus your energy on positivity for the rest of the day. This means phrases that start with “I can” and “I will”. For example: “Today, I will acknowledge and celebrate my accomplishments”, “I am a powerhouse; I am strong”, “I can overcome negative thoughts”.

, A big part of positive living is doing self-care through what you consume every day. Follow a healthy diet that includes lots of home cooked meals and healthy portion sizes, with at least three meals a day. You should consume a healthy balance of protein, grains, vegetables, fruits, and dairy every day, three times a day at close to the same time every day.You should also drink lots of water throughout the day so you stay hydrated, especially if you have a physically active lifestyle. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and carbonated drinks.

, A full night’s rest will ensure you are not exhausted the next day and in a negative frame of mind. Get ready for bed by following a strict sleep schedule and by ensuring your bedroom is set up to help you get to sleep.

, Try to exercise at least three times a week on a consistent basis to up your endorphins and give your body a healthy stress release. Commit to a workout class one to two times a week or a running schedule where you work out at the same time every day. Working out will help you to feel positive about yourself and positive about others around you., Pursue relationships with people who make you smile or laugh out loud, rather than individuals that make you feel depressed and lonely. You should try to create social situations where you feel welcomed and supported by everyone around you. Building new relationships with positive individuals or strengthening your existing relationships with positive people will help you let go of the negative."

Listen to music.,
Watch TV or a movie.,
Play a video game.,
Read a book.,
Work on a big project.",How to Distract Yourself3," Load up a new playlist and listen to some music. Find a comfortable spot to sit and listen closely to the music. Focus on the lyrics and the musical strains. See if you can hear when different instruments are played.


Listen to the music through headphones. Music with a faster tempo will require you to pay closer attention if you’re trying to track the music, instruments and lyrics., Turning on the TV or watching a good movie can distract you from the task or thought at hand. Get absorbed in the storyline of a TV show or movie.


Make sure to choose a movie or TV show that doesn’t remind you of your problem. For example, if you’re distracting yourself from the emotional pain of a breakup, don’t watch a movie that focuses on a person who ends a relationship with someone.

, Video games offer compelling narratives that can suck you into their worlds. If you are playing a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, you will interact with others online, which will take your attention away from your problem.

, Find a good, juicy story or revisit an old favorite novel. It helps if the book is a fairly easy read. If you have to process a lot of what you’re reading or constantly look up vocabulary, then you might lose your momentum to get lost in the story.

, Dive into a project with multiple parts. This will engage your attention with various steps and instructions. A good project could be working on a model, painting a picture or building some shelves for your living room.

Observe something in minute detail.,
Pay close attention to your body.,
Pinch yourself.",How to Distract Yourself4," Don't turn your attention to one element of your surroundings. Look at that element as though you needed to paint or draw it. Sharpen your attention on this item, examining how it looks and how it might feel. For example, look at the arm of a chair. Notice the wood grain and pattern. Observe how smooth the arm is and how it curves downward., Rub your index finger and thumb together. Notice how your skin feels. Notice what happens when you press your fingers together more gently. Listen to your breathing. Pay attention to your eyes blinking., If you are experiencing physical pain or sharp emotional pain, distract yourself by inflicting a small amount of physical pain on yourself. This will redirect your attention to one area, such as when you pinch the webbing between your index finger and your thumb.

, When you distract yourself with something you enjoy, you will find that you can endure pain or uncomfortable feelings more easily.You might enjoy doing woodworking, gardening, or hiking.

, Pass the time with people you enjoy being around. This will enable more sustainable and interesting conversation. When you are on your own, you start to feel isolated and you may tend to focus on negative feelings more readily., Distract yourself from old patterns of thinking by forcing yourself to try new routines. Retrain your brain to think about life in a different way. For example, if you had a difficult breakup, you might need to stop visiting familiar restaurants that remind you of your ex. Instead, find a new restaurant and make new memories."

Ask what you can expect.,
Arrange to take someone with you.,
Take a shower.,
Know your rights.,
Interview your doctor.,
Communicate your religious needs.",How to Feel Comfortable Undressing at the Doctor's Office1," Asking the doctor’s office staff what you can expect in your upcoming appointment will help alleviate anxiety, because you will have a good idea what you’ll encounter during your visit. If you’re having a specific procedure done, watch some videos and read articles about how the procedure is conducted, why it’s done, and even potential complications.Your doctor’s Office Manager may be helpful in directing you to resources that are specific to your visit and your doctor’s specialty.
The doctor or nurse should have no issue explaining the process step-by-step to you.
Also, especially for younger patients, asking the doctor to explain every step of the appointment or procedure as its being done can significantly reduce anxiety and discomfort.;
, Consider bringing your partner, parent, or a close friend to the doctor’s appointment with you. Bringing a companion with you for emotional support can be just the boost of encouragement you need. Your companion will also help alleviate your anxiety by being a loving and familiar presence.Understand that you will likely have to expose yourself to this companion, so make sure that you’re comfortable with them seeing you in any state of undress.

, While it definitely isn’t necessary, you may be more comfortable with undressing at the doctor’s office if you take a shower or bath beforehand. Perhaps you want to shave your face, legs, or underarms as well.This is entirely to make yourself more comfortable. Your doctor is used to seeing all kinds of bodies and types and whether you shave or shower is of no importance to them.

, Under a Patient Bill of Rights, patients are guaranteed certain protections about receiving fair treatment, their personal information, input in making medical decisions, and more. In some states these are laws, and others they are signed proclamations by physicians. Knowing what protections you have can be empowering ease your anxieties about your doctor visit., Nowadays, who we choose for a doctor is largely determined by insurance, availability, and proximity. We often don’t even meet the doctor before our first appointment. It doesn’t have to be this way, though. You can call a prospective doctor’s office and ask to schedule an interview appointment as you’d like to make sure you and the doctor are a good fit for one another.If the office staff tell you that isn’t possible, thank them for their time and call another office.
You will likely have to pay the doctor for their time, so be prepared for a visit fee.

, You may be nervous about undressing at the doctor’s office because of your religious beliefs. When the appointment begins, simply tell the intake nurse that you are uncomfortable undressing for religious reasons. Medical personnel have been trained to sensitively and respectfully accommodate cultural and religious needs, and this should pose no issue."

Explain your preferred pronoun.,
Bring a distraction.,
Ask for a nurse.,
Manage the power dynamic.,
Exercise your option to decline.,
Stop the appointment.,
Don’t be embarrassed by biological reactions.",How to Feel Comfortable Undressing at the Doctor's Office2," If you are gender variant, begin your appointment by telling the nurse or doctor the correct pronouns to use when speaking with you, the name you are to be called (as it may differ from that on your insurance card), and how you refer to your body parts. If you are comfortable with gendered anatomical language, let your doctor know that as well, but reiterate that you are firm that your pronouns and name reflect who you are.Some hospitals or larger practices employ Trans Health advocates or experts. Ask if one is available to assist you in making and managing your appointments. Many times they will contact office staff before your appointment to address your name, pronouns, and preferred body conversations.If you are a transman, you might consider going to Planned Parenthood for gynecological exams.
Also, wherever you fall on the spectrum, consider going to LGBTQIA health centers for your medical needs.

, Distracting the mind does wonders for alleviating anxiety and even helping block out pain. Bring something engaging to do with you while at the doctor’s office, which should distract you and calm your discomfort a bit. Make sure that whatever you bring is not noisy or distracting to others.Books and e-readers are great options.
Smartphones and tablets are also great to bring along. You can surf the web, play games, or explore other apps.

, Some patients are more comfortable if someone of the same gender is present during the appointment. If you are a female being examined by a male doctor and you need to undress completely, you can request for a female nurse to be present, and if you’re male, of course the same is true for you. If no nurse is available at that time, you may ask for a new appointment or an alternate doctor. Usually this is unnecessary, but you have a right to feel secure., A doctor that doesn’t seem interested in listening to your concerns, talking with you, or who has one foot out the door can be off-putting and make you pretty nervous. This may make you even more uncomfortable about undressing for an examination. Let your doctor know how you’re feeling can go a long way in helping alleviate your discomfort and improving the power dynamic between you both.If you’re interrupted, simply say, “May I finish talking, please?
If you’re uncomfortable with how you’re being treated, say so. “You seem to be pretty distracted and I’m uncomfortable with the idea of undressing for an examination because of it.”

, Although you’ve been asked to disrobe, completely or partially, and to cover back up with a gown or large paper sheet, you have the right to decline. No doctor or nurse can force you to disrobe for an examination. Politely decline and ask for an alternative to disrobing.You can say, “I’m uncomfortable with undressing here and choose to keep my clothes on. What alternatives do you suggest?”
The nurse may tell you that you have to disrobe so that the doctor can examine you. You don’t have to disrobe for anyone unless you choose to do so. You can say, “I appreciate that you’re saying that taking my clothes off would make the examination easier, but how about the doctor just lift up my shirt as necessary?”
As a compromise, you can request a gown or sheet so that you’re covered but still accessible for the doctor.

, You have a right to stop the appointment or examination at any time, which must be respected by doctors and nurses alike. The only exception to this is if you are in the middle of a procedure that would put you in an unsafe position were it not completed, or if equipment is being used that makes stopping immediately an impossible choice., Your body may react to your anxiety about undressing, the temperature of the room, or even the doctor’s examination. While these reactions are not probably what you’d hope for, they’re nothing to be embarrassed about. Your doctor understands that the body has varied reactions and that your reactions aren’t at all sexual.Some common reactions are erections, hardened nipples, underarm odor, and flatulence.

Deal with your anxieties.,
Give yourself permission to be nervous.,
Learn meditative techniques.,
Communicate your gender variance.,
Addressing past trauma.",How to Feel Comfortable Undressing at the Doctor's Office3," Think about what it is that is worrying you about undressing at the doctor’s office. Once you’ve identified the root of your anxiety, you can start the process of dealing with your worries.You might find that your anxiety is dramatically reduced simply by identifying the cause.
If it isn’t, consider talking with a counselor to help you work through your anxiety.

, It’s normal and perfectly acceptable to feel nervous about undressing at the doctor’s office, especially if this is a new experience for you. If you’re nervous, remind yourself that your doctor is a trained medical professional that is there to give you a routine examination, one that they’ve given hundreds of other patients. Take a deep breath, try to relax, and your appointment will be over before you know it., Meditation helps regulate breathing and calm the mind. Learning a few simple meditative techniques will help calm your anxiety, will help you focus when you’re nervous or uncomfortable, and will help you control noisy thoughts that might be distracting you. Fortunately, there are books, websites, videos, and local centers that can teach you a variety of meditative techniques.If you find yourself feeling uncomfortable, close your eyes and breathe. This simple action encourages you to stop, quiet down, and instantly diffuses anxiety.
This is especially helpful during any uncomfortable procedures, too, such as a pelvic or rectal examination.

, Medical personnel are obligated to treat you with respect and dignity, and with that, address you as the gender with which you identify. You might be uncomfortable undressing at the doctor’s office because you identify as a gender other than cis-male or cis-female and do not want to be in a vulnerable position of undress. Remember that these are medical professionals who are not there to make judgment, only to assist you medically.As always, you have the right to ask for alternative solutions to undressing or stop the appointment should you become too uncomfortable.
Communicating about your medical needs and issues with your doctor may be uncomfortable also as some of the conversation may use verbiage that relates to biological sex. Your doctor should understand this and be appropriately patient.

, You may have experienced physical, emotional, or psychological trauma in the past that makes undressing or disrobing in front of others an anxiety-producing experience. Communicate this, as you are comfortable, with the intake nurse so that they can pass along to the doctor that you will require accommodations, such as not undressing.Medical personnel are bound by confidentiality rules, so they will not share what you tell them with anyone other than those in the office that must know, such as the doctor.

Some expressions of passive-aggressive behavior include sarcastic remarks and responses, being overly critical, temporary compliance (the person verbally agrees to the request but chooses to delay acting upon it), intentional inefficiency (the person complies with the request but fulfills the request in a poor manner), allowing a problem to escalate through inaction and taking pleasure in the resulting anguish, sneaky and deliberate actions taken in order to get revenge, complaints of injustice, and the silent treatment. ""I'm not mad"" and ""I was just joking"" are some common things that passive-aggressive people say.Other signs of passive aggression can include hostility toward demands made on their time, even if it's understated, hostility toward figures of authority or those more fortunate, procrastination in dealing with other people's requests, purposefully doing a bad job for other people, acting cynical, sullen, or argumentative, and complaints about being under-appreciated.Passive-aggressive behavior is defined as indirect resistance to the demands of others and an avoidance of direct confrontation. The avoidance of direct confrontation is where we may find the most trouble.;
, It might seem like a person's trying to get under your skin, but it's also possible that you are being overly suspicious and taking their behavior personally. Examine your own insecurities — are you used to people in your past giving you a hard time? Does this person remind you of that? Are you assuming this person is doing what the people in your past did?


Put yourself in the other person's shoes. From that perspective, do you think a reasonable person might act similarly in those circumstances?Bear in mind, too, that some people may be constantly late or slow to complete a task because of a disorder like ADHD. Don't be quick to assume that their behavior is actually directed at you.

, Dealing with a passive-aggressive person can make you feel frustrated, angry, and even despairing. It may seem as though there is nothing you can say or do to please the person.You may feel hurt by being on the receiving end of passive-aggressive behaviors. For example, perhaps the person has given you the silent treatment.
You may feel frustrated that the person often complains, but never seems to take steps to improve his or her situation. Pay close attention to your instincts.
Being around the person may leave you feeling tired or deflated, since you've spent so much energy trying to deal with the passive aggressive behavior.

, The power of positive thinking helps in coping with the daily affairs of life. Passive-aggressive people will try to drag you into a vortex of negativity. They are looking for a negative response sometimes so they can put the focus back on you without getting blamed for it. Don’t allow this to happen.Staying positive means you don’t sink to their level. Don’t be passive-aggressive back. Don’t name call, shout, or become overtly angry. If you remain positive, you will be in a better position to keep the focus on their own actions, not yours. If you become angry, you will divert attention away from the real problems.
Model positive behavior. Whether you're dealing with children or adults, address your own conflicts in a manner that lets others know how to interact with you. Passive aggression vents emotion from behind a mask of indifference. Instead of doing that, be open, honest, and direct about your emotions. When you encounter passive-aggressive behaviors like the silent treatment, guide the conversation in a productive direction.

, If you’re upset, calm down before you address the issue (take a walk, crank up the music and dance, do the crossword), and then figure out exactly what it is you need from this situation, such as what reasonable outcome you can live with.


Do not overreact in anyway, especially with anger. And do not directly accuse someone of being passive aggressive, for this opens a window for them to deny everything and to accuse you of ""reading into it"" or of being too sensitive/suspicious.
No matter what happens, don’t lose your temper. Don't let the person see that he or she got a rise out of you. If you do, it reinforces the behavior and could increase the chances that it will occur again.
Resist the urge to act out any reflexive anger or emotionally colored reaction. You'll appear much more in control, and you will come across as someone whom you cannot just push around.

, Assuming you are emotionally stable, self-respecting, and calm, the best approach is to simply express what seems to be happening (For example, ""I may be wrong, but it seems that you're upset that David wasn't invited to the party. Do you want to talk about it?"")


Be direct with the person and specific. Passive-aggressive people can twist your words using technicalities if you speak too generally or vaguely. If you're going to confront a passive-aggressive person, be clear about the issue at hand.
A danger of confrontation is that statements turn too global with phrases like ""You're always this way!"" This won't get you anywhere, so it's important to confront the person about a specific action. For instance, if the silent treatment is what gets on your nerves, explain that a specific incident where you were given the silent treatment made you feel a certain way.

, Do this in a non-confrontational manner, but firmly, such as saying, ""You seem to be pretty upset right now"" or ""I feel like something is bothering you.""


Express the way their behavior is making you feel, such as saying, ""When you speak in such a curt way, it makes me feel hurt and dismissed."" This way, they have to acknowledge the effect their behavior is having on you. Focus on how you feel, and don't use blaming language that castigates them.
Use “I” statements. When communicating with someone, especially during conflict, try to use “I-statements”, rather than “You-statements.” For example, rather than saying, “You’re so rude,” you could instead say, “I felt bad after you slammed the door because I felt like you didn’t want to listen to me.” The first statement is a you-statement. Typically, you-statements imply blame, judgment, or accusation. In contrast, I-Statements let you express feelings without pointing fingers.
The person who is being passive-aggressive is beating around the bush. Don't beat around the bush back at them. Be straight, but kind. Be honest, but gentle. Don't sugarcoat it either, though.

, Although you don’t want to provoke an angry confrontation, you also don’t need to be a passive-aggressive person’s punching bag. Passive aggression can be very damaging and a form of abuse. It’s your right to set boundaries.


One of the biggest mistakes people make is to be way too lenient. Once you give in to passive-aggressive behavior, you lose your options. This is, at its root, a power struggle. You can remain positive and calm, while still being strong and firm about how much you are willing to take.
Follow through on the limits you set. Make it clear that you won't tolerate being mistreated. If a person is constantly late and it bothers you, make it clear to the person that next time she is late meeting you for a movie, you're just going to go in without her. That’s a way of saying you’re not going to pay the price for his or her behavior.

, The best way to deal with this type of anger is to detect any changes as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to get to the root of the anger.


If this person is one who doesn't typically show anger, then talk to someone who knows the person well enough to tell what angers him or her, and what subtle signs that the person may give when angry.
Dig deeply, and honestly assess what might be driving the passive aggression. Passive-aggressive behavior is usually a symptom of another cause.

, There's aggressive communication, there's passive communication, and there's passive-aggressive communication. None of these is as effective as assertive communication.


Assertive communication means being assertive and nonreactive, yet respectful. Show confidence, be collaborative, and express that you want to solve the problem in a way that works for both people.It's also important to listen and not inject accusations or blame into the conversation. Consider the other person’s point-of-view, and acknowledge it. Validate their feelings, even if you think they are wrong.

, If a person is passive-aggressive towards you on a regular basis, it is perfectly reasonable to avoid that person. You have to put your own well-being first.


Find ways to spend a limited amount of time with the person, and try to interact with them when you are in a group. Avoid one-on-one interaction.
If they are not contributing anything significant besides negative energy, ask yourself whether it is worth keeping them around in your life at all.

, Don't tell the passive-aggressive person your personal information, emotions or thoughts.


They may ask questions about your life that seem innocent or kindly concerned. You can answer such questions, but avoid giving detailed information. Keep it brief and vague, but friendly.
Avoid topics that are sensitive or reveal your personal weaknesses. Passive-aggressive individuals tend to remember such things you've told them, sometimes even little things in passing, and will find ways to use it against you later.

, This person should be an objective third party, whether it is an HR representative, a close (but objective) family member, or even a mutual friend. The point is to use someone whom the passive-aggressive person can trust also.


Before meeting with the mediator, give him or her a list of your concerns. Try to see things from other people's points of view, and understand why they are so angry. Don't be obnoxious and just get all passive aggressive about them pushing you away, even if you are trying to help.
When you confront the individual yourself, you may hear ""relax it was a joke"" or ""you take things too seriously."" That’s why having a third party intervene can work better.

, Since passive-aggressive individuals operate covertly, they will almost always put up resistance when confronted on their behavior. Denial, excuse making, and finger pointing are just a few of the likely retorts.


Regardless of what they say, declare what you're willing to do going forward. Importantly, offer one or more strong consequences to compel the passive-aggressive person to reconsider his or her behavior.
The ability to identify and assert consequence is one of the most powerful skills we can use to ""stand down"" a passive-aggressive person. Effectively articulated, consequence gives pause to the difficult individual, and compels her or him to shift from obstruction to cooperation.

, The goal of reinforcement is to increase the rate of that behavior.


This might mean rewarding good behavior that you want to perpetuate or punishing bad behavior you want to eliminate. Positive reinforcement is easier said than done, because bad behavior is more noticeable than good behavior. Be on the lookout for good behavior so you can take every opportunity to reinforce it.
For example, if a passive aggressive person is open and honest about their feelings — “I feel like you are being mean to me on purpose!” — that's a good thing! reinforce this behavior by saying “Thank you for tell me how you feel. I really appreciate it when you tell me how you feel.”
This will draw positive attention to the good behavior, communicating their feelings. From there you can work to open up a dialogue.

Surround yourself with positive experiences.",How to Deal With Sadness," Sadness is a natural response to loss, including negative or undesirable outcomes. Loss can include many things such as the death of a loved one or the loss of self-identity or material possessions. Sadness is a normal reaction way to react to the loss.


For example, you might feel sad if a good co-worker leaves her job, since you might be losing her friendship too. Another loss leading to sadness could be finding out you did not get into the college you wanted. This could be a sense of loss of the future or desired outcome.;
, Sadness might just be the root emotion of what you're feeling. Root emotion describes the underlying cause of other emotions you're feeling. A common example is the person lashing out in anger, but who is actually dealing with sadness. Other feelings might be blame, shame, jealousy, etc. Often these feelings are determined by the type of loss leading to your sadness.For example, you could blame someone for your loss. You might feel ashamed if you blame yourself. While you're feeling sad, blame or shame are actually the root emotions that you need to work through.

, Sadness is not the same as depression, although it may be a symptom of depression. Since the two terms are often incorrectly used, it's important to understand key differences. The following describe the terms and their symptoms:Depression: This is debilitating and not a normal response to a stressor like sadness. Symptoms are more severe than sadness, and include a complete loss of interest in activities you once found enjoyable, irritability, agitation, lower sex drive, struggles concentrating, changes in sleep patterns, and feeling tired all the time. Depression can last for months.Depression requires treatment, because it will often get worse if left untreated.
Sadness: This might last moments, hours, or days. It's a normal response to negative events such as a break up, unemployment, or loss of a loved one. It is okay to feel sad. The goal is to feel and acknowledge your sadness without getting stuck there.

, Grief, or bereavement, is an intense aspect of loss. It lasts longer than sadness and includes the emotional and cognitive impacts on daily functioning.Grief is a way to deal with loss and adjust to life without whatever you lost. It's different for everyone and often happens before sadness. After a loss, you may move through a variety of stages, such as denial, isolation, anger, bargaining, sadness, or acceptance.People grieve in different ways, so acknowledge what you're feeling as valid responses.


Grief is more than just death. People can grieve loss of jobs, loss of material items, loss of sense of self/ identity, or loss of a future., While these can occur together with common symptoms (including, decreased mood, sadness, and avoiding social interactions), there are significant differences. Depression impacts one’s self-esteem and sadness is ongoing. With grief, one doesn't feel worthless or inadequate and the sadness decreases over time. Grief doesn't increase thoughts of suicide, create severe sleep issues, increase agitation, and decrease energy which a common symptoms of depression. Those who are grieving are also able to experience happiness (like thinking positively about the loss) while still grieving, but someone who's depressed has difficulty feeling happy.Research shows that individuals with clinical depression before experiencing grief are more likely to show depressive symptoms or more extreme symptoms even after a year of loss. This does not mean a person is suffering from a depressive episode but the experience may be complicated by grief., While sadness tells us you that you've lost something, it also helps you appreciate the good. Sadness is also a coping mechanism that lets you get support from your community of family and friends. Remember that when someone is sad, family or friends often respond with support and encouragement. Sadness also lets you reevaluated life goals or values to lead to greater enjoyment of life.For example, when you've lost a loved one, you feel sad but also remember the good times you had with the person.

, Give yourself permission to be sad. Don't feel as though you should just be able to ""get over it."" This can lead to avoidance of sadness, which can deprive you of other experiences, emotions, and opportunities. For example, if you're afraid of being sad, you might avoid trying out for a part in a play or interviewing for a new job because you might not get it. Remember that sadness has a purpose, to remind you that you've lost something or need to make a change.If you are struggling to let your self be sad try this exercise: write down or say a loud….

“ I am sad when………………………. and that is okay.”
“ I am allowed to be sad about…….”



, Don't belittle or downplay your feelings or let anyone belittle your feelings for you. Remind yourself that you're allowed to feel sad. Keep this in mind if someone's attempt to comfort you is not really helpful and actually minimizes your feelings.Avoid letting someone else tell you how you feel.


For example, someone might try to point out the positive of the situation by saying, ""Now that you've lost your job, you'll have all this free time."" Kindly, but gently correct your friend. You might say, ""I know you're trying to make me feel better, but this job was important to me. I need some time to think about what I've lost before I start trying to fill my time.""

, Call a friend or loved one who you can tell your sad story to. Whether it's just listening to you or talking and distracting you, your friend may be able to help you. When you're with people who you love, they'll try to lift your spirits. It is okay to tell your friend, co-worker, or family member that you are sad and need time to be sad.


Although people may have trouble understanding your sadness, your loved ones likely want to help you through it.

, Let yourself release your emotions by letting them out. Have you ever had a good cry and felt a lot better afterwards? That's because crying is a physical outlet that allows you to move through emotions. Research suggests that a stress hormone is released through tears.In addition to crying, there are other things you can do to release your sadness. These might include:


Listening to sad music: Research shows that sad music might help when feeling sad. It connects you to your feelings, providing an outlet to help process them. If you are not ready to deal with your feelings, music can provide a distraction till you're ready to process and deal with the sadness.Storytelling: If your sadness is based in grief or loss, write a story or create piece of art focusing on the details of your loved one. It is helpful to focus on sensory details including what you see, smell, touch, and taste. Then focus on the the feelings when thinking about your loss., Start each journal entry by writing down 3 words that relate or describe your feelings. End each entry with 3 words describing how you're feeling. Journaling is more than unstructured writing of feelings, thoughts, and consciousness. Plan on writing for a set amount every day. Set a timer and write for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes a day (not exceeding 15 minutes at a time).If you have tried releasing your emotions, but are still feeling sad, there could be a good reason. There may be a situation or internal conflict that you need to work through. Journaling is a good way to document and process these issues.
Find a journal or type of journal that fits you. You might choose a physical journal, a digital journal, or pre-printed annual journal that tracks your progress over the year.

, People process and understand their feelings in different ways. If you're feeling emotionally overwhelmed, try keeping yourself organized. Write a list of your feelings, memories, creative ideas, dreams, and anything else that helps your process your sadness. At the end of each day, check things off the list. Take a few minutes to write down your experience focusing on hope, pleasure, success, and happiness with your decisions.You can also process and manage your emotions by making a to-do list, calendaring appointments, and planning for the next day.

, When you feel sad or overwhelmed by negative emotions, you can forget that you have positive emotions like happy, relaxed, excited, joyous, encouraged, etc. Take a minute to write down and remind yourself of a happy or relaxing memory. Sometimes you just need to remember that you have felt something different to help you feel something positive again.While you can focus on happier memories, you can also spend time in places that are removed from your sadness. Go see a movie or have fun with friends. These can take your mind off your sadness and remind you that you can still enjoy things.

Increase all fruits and vegetables.,
Eat complex carbs.,
Increase the fiber in your diet.,
Limit red meats.,
Eat poultry.,
Add more wild caught fish.,
Incorporate more plant proteins.,
Drink organic, whole milk.,
Avoid sugars.,
Avoid trans fats.",How to Eat Right when Undergoing IVF1," When you are going through IVF, you should increase all your fruits and vegetables. These foods provide your body with essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed to support a healthy pregnancy.


Be aware that pesticide use may be associated with decreased fertility.There is a commonly held belief that organic produce is not treated with pesticides — this is not true. If you're looking for pesticide-free produce, find out the source and how they treat their crops. If you shop locally, you may be able to ask the farmer directly.
Increasing fresh vegetables help increase your intake of iron, which is important for fertility.;
, The majority, roughly 90%, of the total carbohydrates in your diet should be complex carbohydrates.This can help control any weight gain because complex carbohydrates take, in general, longer to digest and allow you to feel fuller longer. In addition, complex carbohydrates are recommended to lower the risk of gestational and type 2 diabetes.Avoid simple carbs. Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods. Eat complex carbs instead. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods, such as whole grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.
The reason that processed foods should be avoided is that they include both simple carbohydrates along with added sugars.

, Fiber helps keep you full and aids in digestion. Beans, legumes, fruits with rind, and vegetables provide great sources of fiber. These foods also provide vitamins and minerals, including the important B vitamins, which boost your health and lay the groundwork for a healthy pregnancy.Eating beans also helps increase your iron intake., When you are pregnant, limit the consumption of red meat. You should aim for three servings or under each week. When you do eat red meat, make sure to antibiotic and hormone-free beef and buffalo.Consider buying lower fat beef, such as 90/10 or 93/7. Lean meats may help boost fertility, while meats with high fat contents are believed to lower fertility., If you want to eat meat, increase the amounts of skinless poultry you eat. The poultry you buy should be hormone and antibiotic free and free-range.Don’t eat the skin on the poultry. The skin can be high in animal fat as well as any added hormones and antibiotics. If you are trying to get pregnant, you definitely do not want to add outside sources of hormones.

, Wild caught fish is another great meat source. They are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory. They are also good sources of protein. Wild caught fish also tends to be lower in contaminants, such as mercury.Look for wild-caught fish, such as salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna.

, If you are trying to get pregnant, studies have shown that women who increase the amount of plant protein in their diet have fewer problems than women who eat more animal protein.Plant sources of protein include beans, legumes, nuts, soy, and seeds.

, When you are trying to get pregnant, choose full-fat dairy instead of low-fat or skim. A glass of whole milk can help boost your fertility. You can have one to two servings of full fat dairy per day.You can also get full-fat dairy from other sources, like yogurt or ice cream.

, Sugary foods and drinks should be limited in your diet. Added sugars can come in different forms: glucose, sucrose, fructose and high fructose corn syrup are often listed on food labels. Ingestion of large amounts of the aforementioned sugars is linked to diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes) and adult onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes) as well as other conditions like obesity and cardiovascular disease., Avoid trans fat when you are undergoing IVF. These fats have been shown to decrease fertility.Trans fats are not found in nature, but are man-made and found in processed foods, fast foods, frozen dinners, and meals.

Eat the same food as the mother.,
Incorporate more zinc.,
Add foods with folates and magnesium.,
Eat selenium.,
Incorporate CoQ10.,
Increase vitamin C. Men also want to make sure they get enough vitamin C. This helps maintain healthy sperm and the quality of sperm.Vitamin C can be found in citrus fruits, papaya, broccoli, strawberries, brussel sprouts, kale, and bell peppers.

",How to Eat Right when Undergoing IVF2," Men should eat basically the same foods women do when going through IVF. The foods described above provide an outline for promoting health and wellness for anyone who wants to get pregnant. If men have a diet too high in bad fats and void of nutrients, they can suffer from decreased libido and lower sperm counts,Approximately 1/3 of the infertility cases are a result of the male. By eating a healthy diet, you help eliminate problems with fertility and support healthy fertility health;however, there are additional foods men can eat to help support healthy sperm production to increase fertility.

, Zinc helps boost a man’s fertility. It helps raise testosterone levels and sperm count. You can find zinc in in red meat, shellfish, lamb, deer, and poultry. You can also find zinc in sesame seeds, raw pumpkin seeds, and green peas.Zinc can be damaged by cooking, so you should look for foods containing zinc that can be consumed raw, like seeds and peas.

, Folate helps lower the number of abnormal spermand improves sperm counts.These nutrients are found in vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables.


Folate is vitamin B9 which is important in DNA and red blood cell production. It can be found in green leafy foods like spinach and kale as well as avocado and beans.

Drink plenty of water.,
Read labels.,
Maintain a healthy weight for fertility.,
Perform meal prep.",How to Eat Right when Undergoing IVF3," Try to keep your food as close to its natural form as possible. Try to limit any processed or prepared foods in your diet. Cook your meals and prepare your snacks from scratch as often as possible.Avoid buying processed foods, such as packaged snacks or prepared meals. Also avoid eating candies, cookies, cakes, and other dessert snacks. Processed foods have many unhealthy elements, including trans fat and added sugars.

, Increase the amount of filtered or purified water you drink. Try to get about six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day., When you shop for groceries, you need to read the labels. Foods that claim to be good for you can hide harmful, processed, or unhealthy ingredients. For example, read the labels to determine the amount of sugars in a food. A good general rule to follow when you shop is to refrain from buy white foods: no white bread, white pasta, or white rice.


However, companies are not required to list added sugars. Avoid this trap by avoiding processed foods.

, Women with too little body fat tend to have greater difficulty getting pregnant. You should keep your body mass index between 20 to 24.For example, for a woman that is 5’4”, that is a weight between 116 to 140 pounds.

, You may not always have time to prepare your meals from scratch each day. To aid with this, do meal prep each week. Cut vegetables and fruit for the week ahead of time.


Preparing the basics, like rice, beans, and even meats, ahead of time. You can freeze those ingredients or refrigerate the ones that will last in the refrigerator.If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot. You can leave a crock pot on all day and have the meal ready when you come home from work.

Be aware of the different types of negative thoughts.,
Keep a thought record to better understand what motivates your negative thoughts.,
Identify your automatic thoughts.,
Determine what type of negative thoughts you are having.,
Identify your underlying concerns.,
Examine the root cause of your negative thoughts.,

Identify areas for positive change.",How to Deal With Negative Thoughts1," Even though negative thoughts may be disruptive and cause you to feel inadequate, they are meant to be beneficial. Some psychologists even believe that a dose of pessimism can be healthy because it forces us to be more resourceful and reflect when things are not going well for us.If you've been having negative thoughts, know that you're not alone. Negative thinking makes up a large portion of our thoughts. Negative thinking might even be inherent in the psychological makeup of human beings. Like our ancestors, we're constantly taking in our environment and trying to make it better. This process becomes a problem when we start to think that these negative thoughts are true.;
, If your negative thoughts are affecting your behavior or interfering with your daily life, then they are causing a problem and you may need to seek the help of a mental health professional. Too much negativity may lead to an intensification of your problems because you expect things to go wrong. One way to describe this phenomenon is the self-filling prophecy which refers to the cycle of having an expectation or thought of a situation that creates a new behavior that makes the expectation of the situation true.For example: You think you will fail the test in English tomorrow. Because you think you will fail no matter what, your behaviors or action is not to study for the test. And then you fail the test. The long term consequences of this are starting to think that you are stupid or a bad test taker, which leads to more problems with test taking., Negative thinking comes in many different forms. Being aware of these forms may help you to know when you are having a negative thought and work to counteract that thought. Not all negative thoughts will fit into a category, but there are some common types of negative thoughts that you may be dealing with.Filtering is when you ignore any positive aspects of a situation. For example, if you passed a very difficult course with a C+, you were hoping for an A, you might think to yourself “I am a mediocre student.”

Black and white thinking is when you refuse to see gray areas and make all or nothing judgments. For example, if you get a B- on a test when you were expecting an A, you might think to yourself, “I am a failure.”

Overgeneralization is when you assume that because something happens once it will always happen again. For example, if you get a B- on a test when you were hoping for an A, you might think to yourself, “I will always get B minuses on my tests.”

Jumping to Conclusions is when you assume you know how someone else thinks or feels. For example, if you get a B- on a test when you were hoping for an A, you might think to yourself, “The teacher thinks I am dumb.”

Catastrophizing is when you think the worst is going to happen all the time. For example, you might be catastrophizing if you think to yourself before each test you take, “I am going to get the lowest grade in the class!”

Personalization is when you believe you have had an effect on situations or events you have no control over. For example, if your boss yells at you all of the time, you might think to yourself, “It’s my fault that my boss yells at me all of the time.”

Control Fallacy is when you feel that you have no control or you have all the control. For example, you may think to yourself, “Nothing I do will help me to get an A on my math test.”

Fallacy of Fairness is believing things happen because life is not fair. For example, you might think to yourself, “I got a B- on my math test because life is not fair.”

Blaming is believing other people are responsible for your emotions. For example, you might think to yourself, “Susie is the reason why I am sad all of time.”

Emotional Reasoning is when you assume an initial feeling is true just because you had that feeling. For example, you might think to yourself, “I feel like I am a failure, therefore, I am a failure.”

Fallacy of Change is when you believe that other people need to change for you to be happy. For example, you might think to yourself, “I will never be happy until Susie changes her attitude.”

Global Labeling is when you attach an unhealthy label to yourself or others because of one event or action. For example, if you forget to study for a test, you might think to yourself, “I am unreliable.”, Journaling about your negative thoughts may help you start to understand them and deal with them. Start by writing down an event that you wish had gone differently or that you think you could have handled better. When possible track your feelings about the event as well.For example, you might record something like, “I did poorly on the English test. I felt anxious before the test because it reminded me of another time that I failed a test.”

, In addition to recording your situational negative thoughts, you should also keep a record of your automatic thoughts. These are the thoughts that pop into your head all of the time. They may seem to occur without warning or reason.For example, your automatic thoughts might be something like, “I am stupid,” “I am a disappointment,” or “I will never succeed in life.”

, Reconsider the most common types of negative thoughts to help you determine what category your thoughts fall into. Identify the type(s) of thoughts that you are having and label them as such in your thought record.For example, if you often think to yourself “I am stupid,” then you might label this thought as “Black and White Thinking” because you are ignoring things that you do well.

, In order to deal with negative thoughts, you will need to become more aware of those thoughts and what assumptions and beliefs are associated with them. Choose a negative thought and think about the concerns that might be driving that thought. This process may make you feel uncomfortable, but it is important to understand the motivation for your negative thoughts.For example, a negative thought might be something like, “I am stupid.” The motivation for this thought might be related to concerns about your intelligence and natural abilities.

, Remember that your negative thoughts are related to a belief or assumption that you hold. It is important to try to find the root of that belief or assumption and begin to break it down.For example, if you often have the thoughts about failing tests, consider the role of your parents and teachers in developing that belief in you. Do your teachers or parents say that you will not be successful in life if you keep failing tests?

, You can also better understand your thoughts by challenging them with certain questions. This technique can be used when you are aware and able to recognize your negative thoughts. The goal of challenging negative thoughts is to realize that most thoughts are not true but just a reaction to something. Ask yourself the following questions:Is the thought true?
If you think the thought is true, how do you know it is true? What are the facts?
How do you react to the negative thoughts? What do you do, think, or feel as a result?
How would not having the thoughts change you actions or behaviors?

, Finding areas for positive change can help you to redirect your focus and generate more good things in your life. Ask yourself if your negative thoughts tend to be connected to certain things in your life, such as work, a relationship, or physical health. Start with one of those areas and identify ways in which you can improve the situation.


For example, if your job constantly stresses you out, think of things you can change about it. It may be that you'll still need to work long hours, but perhaps you're taking on more than you need to. You could think of ways of trimming off unnecessary tasks or improving time management. In addition, you could teach yourself stress-reduction techniques.

Stop seeing failure as a measure of your self-worth.,
Focus on what you do well.,
Seek guidance from those you trust.,
Accept your limitations.,
Define failure as only temporary.,
Learn to anticipate failure.",How to Embrace Failure1," Failing can lead to sadness and frustration. Perhaps you anticipated success or feel embarrassed that the situation didn't pan out; however, failure is not a measure of your worth or value as a person. You are not dumb because you failed one exam. You are not weak because you lost one karate match. Use this moment for push forward rather than giving up.


Believe that you are resilient and can bounce back from failure. Often your harshest critic is yourself.
See your self-worth through your ability to keep trying rather than giving up.While you may not be good at one thing, that doesn't mean that you're bad at everything.;
, After failure, you may feel like there's nothing good about you. But in truth, everyone has something unique to them that they do well. Some people are good listeners. Some are handy with fixing things. Some are dependable. Some are artistic.


Use what you do well to your advantage in the future. While it is important to improve things about yourself, it is also important to keep those good things strong.
Avoid overly negative thinking by focusing on the positive aspects of yourself and your life. Think of three things that are going well in this current moment.

, Don't let others determine your worth and value. Avoid listening to negative people or those who bully you to get what they want. When looking for guidance, trust those who care about and who are a dependable part of your life.Some friends or family may offer healthy criticism. Avoid dismissing it, but also ask them to focus equally on the positives as well as the negatives. Consider saying, ""Thank you very much for the advice. I will take it to heart. I was also wondering, from your perspective, what are some things I've been doing well?""
By opening up about your failing to others, you will feel less burdened or alone. It can be a very important step to letting go of your negative feelings. Chances are these people will have plenty of stories about their own failures, too.

, The only person that you can control is yourself. You may have had to forfeit a match after you accidentally got injured beforehand. You may have submitted a team project that failed to meet expectations because one of your team members didn't do the work. Your company may have failed to reach its goal of serving more than 500 clients due to a lack of resources. By learning to distinguish what you can change, and what you can't, you can better understand how external things can impact your life.Take this as an opportunity to focus on what you can do.
For example, failing to get to work on time due to extreme weather circumstances may have been out of your control. Yet, failing to get to work on time routinely due to time mismanagement may have been within your control.
When looking at a recent failure, consider writing down two lists, side by side. One side includes the things that you can change about yourself or your situation. The other side includes the external forces that you cannot control.

, Failure is a loss, but avoid looking at this loss as permanent. Failure happens at various points in our lives. These points are temporary moments or small snapshots in the larger scope of your month, year, or lifetime.By seeing failure as temporary, it will seem less overwhelming. It will feel like a small hill rather than a huge mountain.
When something is temporary, that means that it is more likely to adapt or change. Thus, failure can become a positive thing as times change.

, Accept that it can and will happen at some point. This doesn't mean that because failure exists, then the best way to avoid it is to not try your best. Anticipating failure means that you have considered different scenarios. It means that you are flexible about what happens — whether you succeed or fail.Think about the possibility of failure in any situation. See it as a way to be motivated to be more organized, more thorough, and more engaged.
Consider the scenarios in which you both win and fail. Imagine how you might react. Plan accordingly. Focus your energy on how to be positive and stay motivated no matter the outcome.
Making back-up plans can help you avoid a fear of failure. If you can anticipate failure and have a plan B and C, then you can more successfully face the prospect of failure with less fear.

Understand the benefits of addressing your thoughts out loud.,
Reframe negative thoughts as they occur.,
Point out that your negative thoughts are not real.,
Identify the motivation behind your negative thoughts.,
Identify your ""stories."",
Turn your negative thoughts into a song.",How to Deal With Negative Thoughts2," In addition to writing and thinking about your negative thoughts, addressing your thoughts out loud can also help you to deal with your negative thoughts. Using positive self-talk to address negative thoughts can help to change your perspective and help you to become less critical of yourself over time., To begin using positive self-talk, do not allow a negative thought to go by without reframing it as something positive. This process might seem awkward at first, but over time it will become easier and you will begin to develop a more positive outlook. The next time you have a negative thought, turn it into a positive one.For example, if you think to yourself, “I am never going to lose weight.” Force yourself to reframe the thought into a positive statement. Say something like, “I am going to keep trying to lose weight.” By changing the negative thought into a hopeful statement, you are forcing yourself to focus on a positive part of the situation.

, You can deal with your negative thoughts by pointing out that they do not reflect you and that they are only thoughts. When you have a thought, repeat the thought to yourself out loud. As you repeat the thought, make sure that you label it as a thought.


For example, if you think to yourself, ""I'm a failure,"" acknowledge that it is just a thought. You can acknowledge that it is just a thought by saying to yourself, ""I'm having the thought that I'm a failure."", Remember that sometimes your negative thoughts have a purpose. Sometimes your mind is just trying to protect you from getting into trouble or having something bad happen. That does not mean that these thoughts won’t still bother you. It just means that you will have to take a different approach to address these types of thoughts. One way that you can deal with negative thoughts that are a result of your mind trying to protect you is to thank your mind out loud.


For example, you may think, ""I'm going to be late for work because of this traffic jam and my boss is going to yell at me."" In this case, you can say to yourself, ""Thank you, mind. Thank you for looking out for my best interests, but there's nothing you need to do right now."", Negative thoughts have patterns that can be made less disruptive if you label them according to what kind of story they tell. In other words, you may have a variety of different thoughts that all boil down to the same basic meaning. Figure out the patterns of your negative thoughts and label them. This can help you to let them go.


For example, if you tend to say to yourself, ""I am bad at my job,"" you can say to yourself, ""Oh, this is my ‘I’m a terrible employee’ story.""Framing a thought this way will help to remind you that you often have these types of thoughts.

, Sometimes you can address and a correct a negative thought by making a joke out of it. As silly as it sounds, you may be able to dispel your negative thoughts by singing about them. Use the tune of a familiar song, such as ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat,"" or the alphabet song to turn your negative thoughts into a song.


If you don’t feel like singing, you can say your thoughts out loud in a funny voice, like a cartoon character."
"
Accept that you will continue to have some negative thoughts.,
Distract yourself with positive activities.,
Take care of yourself.,
Use positive daily affirmations to build yourself up.,
Forgive yourself when you make a mistake.,
Congratulate yourself for little victories.",How to Deal With Negative Thoughts3," There's no shame in negative thinking; negative thoughts are caused by anxiety and not by who you are as a person. Wishing away your negative thoughts will most likely exacerbate the situation. Negative thoughts can lessen with practice and time. As long as you get into the practice of examining your thoughts and the role they are playing, whether it's to protect you or from feeling anxious, you can control how they affect you., Keeping busy gives you less time to dwell on your thoughts and can also remind you of the things you enjoy. Look for activities that you enjoy or try something new. For example, you could:


Go for a jog: this tires your mind and helps reduce stress through physical activity.
Take a walk somewhere you enjoy, like a park.
Watch a funny movie or TV show, read a funny book, or listen to a podcast of a favorite radio show.Spend time with a friend, family member, or social community. Staying connected with others can help you feel more positive and turn your mind away from yourself., Taking good care of yourself can help you to deal with negative thoughts as well. Eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly can help you feel better mentally and physically.Make sure that you are eating well, sleeping enough, and getting regular exercise to feel your best.


Try to eat a balanced diet that include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid junk food, as well as excess sugar and fat.Get between 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Keep in mind that this is only the recommendation for adults. Some people may be okay with less than 7 hours or require more than 8 hours of sleep per night.Exercise for 30 minutes three times a week. Even a 30-minute walk, or two 15-minute strolls, can count., Positive daily affirmations can help you to deal with the negative emotions that often accompany negative thoughts. Take a few moments every day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something encouraging to yourself. You can either say something that you believe about yourself or something that you would like to believe about yourself.Some examples of positive affirmations include:


“I am intelligent.”
“I am a caring friend.”
“People enjoy spending time with me.”

, Forgiving yourself, just like you would forgive a friend, is an important part of learning how to deal with negative thoughts. If you are dealing with negative thoughts that stem from mistakes you have made, you need to learn how to forgive yourself. One way that you can begin to silence your inner critic is to learn how to forgive yourself when you make mistakes, just like you would forgive a dear friend.


The next time you make a mistake, take a deep breath and try to stop yourself from thinking any negative thoughts. Instead, practice saying something like, “I made a mistake, but that does not make me a bad person.”, Another way to combat negative thinking is to congratulate yourself when you do something well and remind yourself of things that you have done well in the past. Giving yourself a little pat on the back now and then will help you to stay focused on your positive qualities and stop dwelling on negative thoughts and feelings.For example, instead of dwelling on something bad that happened at school, pick one positive thing that happened and congratulate yourself. You might say something like, “You did an awesome job in gym class today!”

Use failure as inspiration.,
Learn from mistakes.,
Focus on how failure and success go hand-in-hand.",How to Embrace Failure2," Sometimes failure can make you work even harder, and give you the motivation to push yourself further. Use each mistake as a way to build strength and courage. By embracing failure, you will become more comfortable with it as a part of your life and work. Think about the most difficult challenge that you have overcome. Use this as motivation that you can overcome what's happening now.
Use failure as wisdom for the future. When you look back in a week, month, or year from now, you may feel stronger for having faced your failures.
Remember this as a way to embrace failure: ""Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."", Who doesn't make mistakes at some point in their lives? While mistakes are things that happen, it is about what we learn from them that matter. We can't take back the past, but that doesn't mean that history is going to repeat itself.Try thinking of mistakes as experiments. You won't know whether or not something works unless you try it. And if you try, and it is a failure, then now you have more information moving forward. Place the importance on what you learned, rather than what was. When something doesn't work, you become more informed about what might work in the future.
Find people that support you. Listen to their advice about what to learn from this experience. If you're on a sports team, your coach and fellow players may have helpful advice about what to do.
Think about how many famous businesspeople, inventors, artists, and scientists all had failures before they had success. They learned from their mistakes, and kept going., If you never try, then you never succeed. Perseverance is key to many successes. Few people succeed by sheer luck. You often have to work hard and avoid letting others determine your fate. While your measures of ""success"" may not always be attainable, that does not automatically mean that you have failed.


Many athletes, scientists, and business tycoons will all tell you the same thing: failure is a part of what makes you successful.You will learn more from the hard failures than from the easy successes. You will actually be stronger and more resilient from those failures.

"
"
Focus on the future rather than the past.,
Evaluate what worked and what didn't.,
Own up to your own faults.",How to Embrace Failure3," If you see failure as an opportunity to get closer to your goal, then it becomes something to be expected and even anticipated. In all likelihood, if you're not failing, then you're probably not pushing yourself enough.


Be future-oriented rather than dwelling on the past. While the past can help you to understand what to do better, fixating on past mistakes will deter you from seeing the possibilities for the future.
Don't let fear of failure determine your future fate. Believe that the willingness to try new things and learn from them will help you grow in the future.See your future goals as challenges. You likely will find greater reward when doing something difficult rather than something easy.

, Assessing what happened shouldn't be about your character flaws. Take an objective look at what occurred, and focus on what you can do better for next time. Depending on the situation, utilize your co-workers, teammates, friends, and family to help you get a different perspective.Review the challenges that occurred even before the failure. For example, let's say you had a team project with three other people, and this project ended up failing to meet your teacher's or company's expectations. Assess how the team could have communicated more effectively. Determine which aspects of the project were lacking and how they could have been improved. Evaluate external forces that your team could not control.
Avoid blaming yourself for all the problems, or blaming others for a mistake that you took part in. Be respectful to yourself and others regardless of the success or failure.
This review process should help you to prevent or decrease mistakes in the future. While finding solutions to your mistakes may not be easy or fun, it will help to prepare you for next time.

, Being accountable for your actions is an admirable quality in life and at work. It means that you embrace your own part in a difficult situation. Taking ownership of what you can do to improve or change will help others to see you as a flexible and resilient person. By taking ownership of your own faults, it shows that you are mature.
If you avoid admitting wrongdoing, you may lose out on an opportunity to move forward with your work, team, or situation. While it can be uncomfortable to admit fault, it may be worse when you avoid doing so.

Have Guts.,
Be Resilient.,
Take Initiative.,
Be Tenacious.",How to Embrace Failure4," Be courageous. Take risks. Risk means the possibility of failure. You need to have guts in order to do things outside of what’s easy or your comfort zone.It takes guts to ask someone out for a date. Don’t give up because one person says no — ask somebody else you like!
It takes guts to start your own business. Small businesses and start-ups have a high risk of failure. But your product also might lead to the next best thing., Being resilient means the ability to bounce back from failure. You might feel depressed or upset with yourself. You may feel like giving up. But with resilience, you look on the brighter side, since you have these three traits: Optimism. You strive to do better.
Confidence. You believe in yourself.
Creativity. You have a plan for how to improve.

, When you take initiative, you’re forcing yourself to do something that’s hard. If you’re on a team project, and you’ve already failed once, you can take the initiative to make improvements and admit faults. That way, instead of beating yourself up about the situation, you are a leader for yourself and for others.


Find out what you can do better by asking others about your strengths and where there is room for improvement.
Be a support for those around you. When you’re helping others, you’ll feel less like a failure.

, Persistence is key. Life is about trial and error. Whether in your studies, career, or personal life, having tenacity will make you stronger and wiser for the failures ahead. It means that you don’t give in.

Identify what sparks your envy.,
Write down your values, needs and worldview.,
Recognize if you’re extending the boundaries of your core self-concept.,
Recognize some of the characteristics of envy.,
Practice gratitude.,
Stop judging yourself based on others’ experiences.,
Focus on moving forward.,
Accept that you'll make mistakes in life.,
Embrace your uniqueness.,
Correct thoughts that devalue yourself.,
See a mental health professional.,
Surround yourself with supportive people.,
Avoid spending time with people who compare themselves to others.",How to Deal With Envy," Consider what sets you off and causes you to hunger for what other people have or the way that someone else is. Research has found that often envy results from comparisons to others who are of similar background, ability, and achievements in relative or important areas of one's life.For example, you may compare yourself to a coworker who is of the same status and gender as yourself. The pain of envy is a result of seeing yourself surpassed by another’s ability, especially in an area of life that is a deep part of your self-concept by which being surpassed is seen as a threat to your concept of who you are.Some other examples are:

You feel insecure when someone else appears more intelligent, funnier, more entertaining, happier or more glamorous than you consider yourself.
You cannot help but continuously compare yourself to the other person, either personality-wise or by yearning for the same opportunities they appear to have.
You feel deprived and wish for the same property and possessions as someone else. You consider that your life is pale by comparison and somewhat impoverished.
You feel miserable because you think that other people have what you don't.

;
, Ask yourself what your values are, what your needs are, and what your worldview consists of. Get to the essence of what is really important to you. These things make up your core self-concept.

, Begin to pull apart the things that are not who you are at your core, and that are causing you to be envious. It is important to understand that people often extend their boundaries of their self-concept to include things that are not necessarily apart of who they are at their core. When these extension areas are threatened, the person often experiences defensiveness, hostility, or envy.


Examine if you have extended your boundaries of your self-concept to include other areas such as work, friendships, abilities, or status. Begin to make a distinction between who you are at your core (your values, your needs, your worldview, and your purpose) and what you possess in belongings, personal traits, work success, and identities in your social groups.
For example, say you give a presentation at work, and you interpret criticisms of the presentation as a personal attack. This means that you have extended your self-concept to include your work. In fact, however, you are not your work, and it is not a part of who you are at your core. Your work is simply something you do. Yes, it is part of your life experience, but it is not who you are as a person, and it is not your personality trait.
In another example, you may be envious of a friend in your social group who is similar to yourself. Perhaps you are usually the entertainer in the group or the one making others laugh. When this friend’s talent for making others laugh surpasses your own, you may see this as a threat to your self-concept. In actuality, you are not your ability to entertain others. Who you are at your core is much more than this one trait.
These types of scenarios are more common for those who suffer from low self-esteem. This is because their evaluations of themselves are lower than how they evaluate those around them, thus producing feelings of envy.

, Envy is a complicated emotion that has many facets and can take many forms. Research has found that envy can be social in nature when one perceives that he or she is being left out of the group or left behind because they are being outperformed by another in the group.Studies have found that some types of envy, termed “envy proper”, contain feelings of hostility, whereas others forms of envy, termed “benign envy”, do not include feelings of hostility.In addition, researchers make a distinction between envy and jealousy, noting the envy is a feeling of inferiority when compared to another, whereas jealousy involves three persons and stems from being afraid of losing a relationship with one person to another., Practicing gratitude helps you to practically and systematically recognize what is good or going right in your life.Gratitude can be defined as identifying what is important and creates purpose for you.Being intentionally grateful can help you put greater emphasis on what you have, rather than what you do not have that is causing you to be envious. Cultivating feelings of gratitude has been shown to produce feelings of connectedness to those around you, to a higher power, and connectedness to a deeper meaning or larger perspective of your situation and feelings.Furthermore, research has found that cultivating feelings of gratitude increases self-esteem, reduces stress, and increases feelings of empathy.Practice gratitude by writing or saying daily what you are thankful for in your life. Focus on positive life events, relationships, or the small everyday occurrences that enhance positive feelings. For example, you could adopt the practice of writing down three things you were grateful for during that day: “I am grateful for the opportunity to catch up with old friends at lunch today,” “I am thankful that we did not have any rain today,” and “How fortunate for me to find such close parking!”

, Because the basis of envy starts with comparing yourself to others, you can prevent envy by focusing on yourself and avoiding judging yourself based on comparisons with others. It is a normal phenomenon to evaluate yourself in comparison to those who are similar to ourselves in terms of status, skills, and ability.


Social comparison theory hypothesizes that there are several reasons for this type of comparison: gaining information about a person or group of people, a motivator to improve one’s own skills or abilities (when compared to someone who has superior skills), or as an ego-boost (when compared to someone who has inferior skills).So because self-comparison is a normal process with many different and valid reasons, the problem becomes evident in that envy is produced after making a value judgment about yourself after a social comparison. This means that comparing yourself to another person is not inherently bad. But the judgment and value you place on your judgment is what can lead to envy.

, Instead of comparing yourself to others and competing with others, focus on yourself. Stop competing. The only person you should ever compete with is the person you were yesterday. Learn from that person and strive to be better, stronger and smarter today, learning from yesterday's lessons. Focus your energy not on what was, but on what you're becoming.

, It's called learning. Some people might tell you that you’re bound to fail. Don’t let that deter you. They’re just stating the obvious that everyone fails now and then. The difference between you and them is that you learn from the experience and get on with trying again, while they simply criticize and do little else.

, Notice that you are different and unique. Having these differences is neither bad nor good – they just are. When you label the outcomes of your comparisons as good or bad, or as inferior or superior, you are making your self-worth contingent on someone else. You are a unique person who deserves your attention and confidence.

, Catch yourself placing more value on another’s abilities and devaluing your own, and correct your false assumption that one is better or more valuable than another.


For example, a judgement thought might be: “I’m not noticed as much in the group now that Justin has been hanging out with us. I used to be ‘the funny one’ and now everyone pays more attention to him. Sometimes I wish he’d have an off day and say something stupid.”
Corrected thought: “I know that I am feeling left out or undervalued by my friends, but that doesn’t mean that Justin is funnier. We are just different. We even have different types of humor, and that is okay.”

, Counseling can help to change your thinking, automatic assumptions, negative evaluations, and distorted expectations. Ask your counselor about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can improve how you evaluate yourself and others.It can also help change your feelings of envy by helping you evaluate your feelings and subsequently changing your behavior.

, These people are your rocks, your champions. They are not the naysayers or detractors. They support you in your endeavors and genuinely want you to be happy.

, When you spend time with someone who is preoccupied with how much money he makes compared to other people, or the kind of car he drives, you might start to find yourself also comparing yourself to others. You might not intend to do so, but this person’s constant attention to these matters can rub off on you, sparking your envy."

Accept that you are unique.,
Re-frame your unique qualities.,
Realize what you have in common with others.,
Be proud of your background.",How to Deal With Being Different1," Accepting yourself can help you embrace your special characteristics and learn to deal with being different form others.Instead of trying to change anything about yourself, you must first be able to accept who you are and how you look at this very moment.Begin by defining your unique qualities. Some examples might be your: religion, culture, diet (if you are vegan, etc), medical history, disability, and physical characteristics. Make a list of all of these ""different"" qualities and consciously accept each one. Go through the list and say or think to yourself, ""I accept my religion. It may be different from others but that does not make it less positive. I embrace my unique beliefs and values. They are just as important and credible as other people's beliefs.""
If you find yourself thinking negatively like, ""It makes me not good enough,"" about one of your unique qualities, think to yourself, ""No, I accept it. It is not bad. It is part of who I am.
Differentiating yourself from others by thinking you are different may actually help to protect your self-esteem in certain situations.Say to yourself, “Yes, I am different. Yes, I am unique. I am cool and awesome and no one can change that!”;
, Perhaps you see you different qualities as flaws, but they aren’t, they are what make you special. Try to take each different characteristic you have and make meaning out of it.


For example, let's say you have a physical handicap, how has this disability helped you grow? What have you learned from it and what values have you gained? Many people find that their struggles teach them great lessons in life, especially to value and appreciate what you have instead of focusing on what you don't have.
Avoid thoughts of inadequacy. If you think, ""I'm not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough,"" change those thoughts to, ""I am good enough for me. I don't need to be the prettiest or the smartest to feel good about myself. I am who I am and I love myself for it."", Don’t define yourself as completely different from other people.This can lead to you feeling ostracized, left-out or rejected. Instead, look at how you are similar to others.


For instance, we are all human beings and share much of the same genes. In fact, we actually share 98% of our genes with chimpanzees, so we aren't that different from them either.We are all living, breathing creatures.
If you feel very different from certain people, identify your commonalities. Some examples might include being human, having certain interests, or speaking a certain language. You may begin to notice just how alike we are in certain respects.

, Being different isn’t all bad – embrace the unique characteristics you have which are due to your upbringing, culture, and family values.


Find the positive aspects of your own unique culture and focus on those. For example, cultural components can include: language, religion, traditions, clothing, holidays, values, standards, gender roles, social roles, occupations, and more.
If you dress different or have a different religion, this means you are interesting.

Recognize that you're having an existential crisis.,
Choose the meaning of your life.",How to Deal with an Existential Crisis1," If you're questioning the meaning or purpose of your existence, or if the foundations of your life seem shaky and transient, you might be experiencing a crisis (usually called ""existential"" because it relates to ideas explored by the philosophical school of existentialism), which may result from:


The sense of being alone and isolated in the world
A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality
Believing that one's life has no purpose or external meaning
Awareness of one's freedom and the consequences of accepting or rejecting that freedom
An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning., Existentialism posits that each individual is empowered to choose the parameters of his or her existence. Choosing to add meaning to your life yourself, without the help of anyone else, can ultimately help you resolve an existential crisis. Below are some methods that can help.

"
"
Increase your self-confidence.,
Find people who are similar to you.,
Be genuine.",How to Deal With Being Different2," Having positive relationships with others is a crucial component of being able to cope with being different. We need social connection, and to feel like we fit in somewhere, in order to have a positive sense of well-being.People are drawn to positive and confident individuals. You will need confidence to face your fears and meet new people.


Use positive self-talk. Avoid blaming yourself or beating yourself up.Examples might include thinking, “What a loser! I can’t do anything right!”
Try mindfulness.Mindfulness can help individuals become nonjudgmental and more accepting of themselves. Simply notice everything around you. What colors or objects do you see? What do you currently feel? What do you hear? Be aware of your own thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.
Everyone has something that makes them feel cool and perfect. So do it. Buy cool clothes, sing, dance, act - whatever makes you feel awesome.

, When you feel different and possibly social rejected, it can help to find a group of people who are similar to you (in culture, ethnicity, religion, interests, disability, appearance, values, etc). Everyone needs to feel a part of a community to have a sense of happiness and well-being.Join a club or class of like-minded individuals. Some examples include: science, math, drama, dance, choir, yearbook and student government.
Try playing a sport at school or for fun such as: basketball, volleyball, football, soccer, track, cross country, water polo, tennis, dance, or cheer-leading.
Try Meetup.com, where you can identify any type of group you want including: hiking, painting, video gaming, rock-climbing, and many more. Make sure it is safe and if you are a minor ensure that your parent or legal guardian is aware.

, Authenticity is important in making positive connections with others. Nobody wants to interact or connect with someone who is putting on a facade. Be your very own unique self. Avoid changing your personality (talking or acting in a certain way) to try to fit in.


Scream when you want (and won't get in trouble), run everywhere, make up crazy songs. Do what you like to do! Don’t change for anyone else, only if you want to yourself.
If you are quiet, be quiet. If you're a hippie at heart, then be a hippie.
Create your own style. If you truly love Abercrombie, wear it, but don't wear it because everyone else is. If you like jeans and dresses, wear them.

Educate others about yourself.,
Be assertive with bullies.,
Learn about “different” people.",How to Deal With Being Different3," Letting others know about your culture, values, and personal characteristics can help to reduce the stigma, or negative stereotypes associated you’re your unique qualities. If people are informed, sometimes their minds can open and they can learn to accept diversity and differences in people.


Begin by talking about yourself with people whom you trust and feel like you can confide in.
The more you practice being confident while talking about yourself, your history, and your culture, the easier it will be.

, Unfortunately, being different including having a disability or being overweight, can sometimes increase social rejection or bullying.If certain people put you down or call you names, you can deal with this appropriately by being assertive with them. Assertiveness means being open about how you think and feel, while being respectful toward the other person.


An example of assertiveness is using, “I statements.” An example would be if you said, “I feel angry when you say that I am weird.” Here, you focus on your own feelings instead of on the other person’s behavior. Their behavior is secondary to how you feel. You could follow up this statement with further explanation by saying, “I am different, but we all are. I would appreciate it if you didn’t call me weird. I respect you, and I expect to be treated fairly in return.”
Another way to be assertive is to set a boundary. For example, you could say, “I would like for you to stop calling me weird. If you decide to continue, I will need to get distance from you. I won’t tolerate being called names.”
If you are bullied consistently either verbally or physically, get help from teachers, counselors, or the principle of your school.

, Look up Led Zeppelin, Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, and the hippie movement, there is a lot to learn from them. They are, in the opinion of some, the original unique and cool people. They stood out in a crowd, dared to be different, and some of them even risked their lives in order to fight for what they believed in.


Develop a role model or personal hero that you can look up to. Think about how this person might act and behave if she was in your situation.

Isolation: Dismiss all upsetting or negative thoughts and feelings from your consciousness and actively deny them.,
Anchoring: Combat feelings of isolation by ""anchoring"" your consciousness to fixed values or ideals, such as ""God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future."",
Distraction: Keep your thoughts from turning to distressing ideas by filling your life with distractions.,
Sublimation: Refocus your energy toward positive creative outlets, such as music, art, literature, or any other activity that you find allows you to express yourself.

, Focusing your attention on these things (whether you support or contradict them) can help you feel like your consciousness is not adrift, or as Zapffe said, build ""walls around the liquid fray of consciousness.""

Understand what caused the problem.,
Try to see life and your place in it as it really is.,
Acknowledge that this is a common problem.,
Consider how well orchestrated life seems to be.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Don't be afraid to make up your own rules.,
Try to voice what your problem is.,
Imagine several different people you like or respect giving you advice.,
Imagine giving advice to someone else in your situation.,
Problem solve.,
Take what you've learned.,
Aim to create peace and joy.,
Clean whatever room you're in.,
Remember that tomorrow is a new day.,
Question yourself.",How to Deal with an Existential Crisis3," The issue is not your thoughts — it is your attachment to the thoughts. Your thoughts (and the language in which you experience them) come from your conditioning, your society, your reaction to experiences.

, Question everything and attempt to see past all social, political, spiritual and personal conditioning and falsehoods.

, Know that we humans often feel that we are stuck in a game designed and controlled by others who do not have your or humanity's best interests in mind. When you're in crisis, it looks like others succeed through ignorance, fear and the ability to lead you around by the nose. Research the history of civilization and how this rat race began, and how it is perpetuated, then begin to formulate your own understanding as to where it may be heading.

, Some type of consistency does appear to exist, at least on a micro level.

, Your ability to experience joy will grow dramatically when you stop comparing yourself to other people and only compare yourself to yourself, if to anyone at all. In an ironic twist of fate, this can be achieved incrementally by holding a more stoic subjectivity.

, Remember to let go of ""should"" — you are in charge. (This message is a ""should"", so take it with a grain of salt.) You are the lightning of your values, and don't forget that, ultimately, value is genetically grounded in the body, even if it appears to be emotion. If you feel anxiety about ""what to do"", now that nobody else is telling you what to do, that's the most exciting part of the journey ... remember childhood? Mystery? Adventure? Smelling new smells and feeling new fabrics? New foods? Do something to improve your experience of joy.

, Some people write full-length sentences to help determine what their issues are. Others start by writing a poem in order to get their thoughts and feelings flowing. Later, you can elaborate in prose.

, Don't pick anyone abusive. Try Mr. Rogers, your first grade teacher, or that person you had a crush on in 9th grade. They don't help very much, do they? But it's fun talking to them.

, Would you still think this was as big a problem?

, If you can't figure out your problem, that means it's legitimate. If your solution involves making big changes, take a few days to think about it.


If you can't do anything about your problem right now, accept it. If it's late, go to sleep; if you can't sleep, find something to do that does not involve a television or computer screen (blue light causes insomnia). You'll want to go to sleep later. If it's daytime, get some exercise or finish your job. Be professional. A few successes never hurt anyone.

, If after exhausting research you still feel unsatisfied, you still have gained a lot of insight into the philosophy of the situation. You must know by now that a will to truth is absurd (to use the terminology). Since we truly don't know whether there is meaning to existence or not, we can always fall back on risk assessment.

, In whatever situation you find yourself, do no harm to yourself or others; even though sometimes it hurts, it will pass. Find meaning in the simple pleasures of life through your senses. Stop to smell the roses, feel the sunlight, taste the food, see the beauty and listen to your heart calling. You can create your own meaning for yourself and your own life. After all, it is your life, your game, your experiment. Play your game with respect for others, and deal with your circumstances to the best of your ability. To really succeed, respectfully enlist the help of others.

, This will help you clarify your power over the world and give you a few minutes to do some basic problem-solving. Don't just straighten things up, clean. Use a cleaning product.

, It's another opportunity for you to make changes in your life to seek happiness and self-fulfillment. This power is yours — claim it.

, If you did not care about the philosophical problem of existential despair, then you would not experience existential crisis because the impossibility of absolutely proving anything would bore you. If you are reading this page, then you are upset. Therefore, you must care about the philosophical problem: why? To be consistent, you must scrutinize your motivations like you do everything else. A helpful question in this scrutiny is, ""If I discovered the Truth and meaning of life, then what would I do, think, and feel?"" You may either discover a fresh meaning of life or simply realize that your former goals and ends were quite it. In any case, should the new or old ends be unhealthy, seek professional help.

Try to adopt a nickname.,
Use a different name at some public places.,
Prepare to explain your name in certain settings.,
Be understanding if someone mispronounces your name.,
Ignore teasing.,
Ask that people not use embarrassing nicknames.,
Avoid those who tease you.,
Use humor to deflect jokes.,
Consider your name's history.,
Use an unusual name as an icebreaker.,
Be aware people are unlikely to forget your name.",How to Deal With a Bad Name," Many people mostly go by a nickname. You probably know a lot of people named James who are always called Jamie. If you can find a fun nickname for yourself, you may be able to avoid using an embarrassing name.Choose a nickname that makes sense. People may be resistant to calling you something with no connection to your name or personality. For example, your name is Gertrude, which you dislike, and so you ask people to call you Samantha. People may resist this.
You can ground your nickname is your existing name. For example, Trudy could be a fun way to avoid Gertrude. You could also ground your nickname based on a physical characteristic. Say you have light red hair. You could have people call you Ginger.
Do not try to force a nickname. You have to gradually transition into the name. You can ask that people call you by this name, and remind them on occasion, but don't refuse to respond to anything other than your nickname. People may find this rude.;
, If your name is very unusual or hard to pronounce, there are times when it's simply easier to use a different name. Have a go-to name to use when ordering coffee or making reservations.For example, say you have a very difficult to pronounce celtic name. It may be hard to explain how to spell or pronounce this at a coffee shop when ordering a drink, or over the phone while making reservations.
You can try using your last name for reservations. At a coffee shop, just use a different name. You can introduce yourself as something easy to pronounce, like ""John"" or ""Mary.""

, In some situations, however, you may be unable to use a different name. Professional situations, such as setting up a bank account, may warrant use of your real name. If someone asks questions, be prepared to explain.If your name is extremely unusual, people may suspect you're using a fake name. Be ready to explain how and why you have the name you do.
Bring a second ID. This is a good precaution if you have the kind of name that may sound fake.

, While it can be frustrating, people will occasionally mispronounce your name if it's unconventional. Try not to get angry in this scenario. You have probably stumbled over someone's name at some point in your life.Correct the person politely. Say something like, ""No, it's actually pronounced differently"" and then repeat your name.
People may feel bad or be embarrassed, so reassure them you're not upset. Say something like, ""Oh, it's fine. Everyone gets it wrong the first time!""

, As people often tease hoping to get a reaction, this is often the best means of deflecting it. If someone mocks your name, try to simply tune them out.Just do not respond at all if someone makes a comment. Act like you didn't hear anything and continue on your way.
People who tease others thrive on the response they get. If they see you are not going to be bothered by teasing, they'll move on.

, A bad name may be turned into an embarrassing nickname. Say you have a foreign name that sounds like an embarrassing word in English. A bully may call you by this word. If this happens, stand up for yourself.Do not get aggressive. Remember, bullies thrive on the response they get. If you start shouting and act seriously upset, the bully will know he or she got to you.
Instead, state calmly, but firmly, ""Please do not call me that. I am not going to answer to it."" If the bully continues to call you by an embarrassing nickname, just walk away.

, This is oftentimes the easiest way to cope. If some people won't stop tormenting you, just avoid being around them.If you're getting teased in school, know where the bullies usually congregate. Try to avoid these areas.
Travel in groups through the hallways, and in areas like bathrooms and locker rooms. Friends can help protect you from bullies in areas you cannot avoid.

, If you're willing to make fun of yourself, bullies will have no ammunition to use against you. If someone teases you about your name, laugh and make a joke right back. A bully will likely back off if they don't get the response they want.For example, say your name is Gertrude and a bully is calling you ""Gerdy Turdy."" Instead of getting mad, laugh and say, ""That's not half as funny as how the Starbucks barista spelled my name last week. Nice try though.""
Bullies will be shocked if you take their abuse with good grace. Humor can be a great way to deflect jokes and take down bullies.

, This can make you appreciate the name more. Where does your name come from? Why did your parents choose it? Maybe it speaks to your heritage or culture.For example, you may have a name rooted with a particular ancestry. If your great grandma migrated from Finland, for example, you may have a Finnish name. While a name like Lempi may sound a little silly, it means ""love"" in Finnish. It's unique to have a connection to your heritage through your name.
You may also have an odd name due to a piece of art or culture. For example, you're named Eponine after your mother's favorite character in Victor Hugo's famous novel Les Miserables. While it may get frustrating to constantly have to tell people how to spell and pronounce your name, some people may appreciate the reference., You likely have less trouble starting conversations with an unusual name. You may have to repeat yourself several times when asked what your name is. However, you can strike up a conversation about the topic right away.Some introductions are awkward, as you're often unsure what to say to someone new. Conversations on, say, a first date are always hard to start. Think of your name as an advantage. You have a conversation starter right there.
An unusual name can also help you tell if someone was listening to you or not when you introduced yourself. For example, if the person asks what your name was again after you have already introduced yourself, then you will know that the person was not paying close attention the first time you introduced yourself.
If someone raises an eyebrow at your name, you can say something like, ""Oh, it's my great grandma's name. She moved from Finland in the 1900's."" From there, you can talk about family history and Finnish culture. Without your name, you wouldn't have had that conversation starter ready.

, For better or for worse, unusual names are not hard to remember. Elizabeths, Michaels, and Johns may have people forget their names all the time. However, with an unusual name, people are more likely to remember as it sticks out from the pack. While your name may be annoying sometimes, at least it's unforgettable.An unusual name may even be an advantage to you for certain career-related events, such as:


on your resume
during interviews
at networking events
when meeting new clients

Start with an outlook that combats the negativity.,
Use coping strategies specific to the negative emotion you are feeling.,
Take time to calm down if you're angry.,
Take a step back if you're envious.,
Be proactive if you're fearful.,
Look for resolutions if you're feeling guilty.,
Seek help if you feel helpless.",How to Deal with Negativity1," Here is a scenario: You woke up late, so the kids got off late to school. You call into work, talk to your boss, and let him know you are running behind, but will get there as quickly as you can. Today of all days, traffic is worse than usual, so you are a half hour late. As you walk to hang up your jacket, apologizing to your boss for your late arrival, he says ""No problem, thanks for the heads up. Oh, by the way, I sent Jay over to head office for training and then Taylor called in sick, so we'll be pretty busy today."" What? You have two people to handle a four people work day!?! How are you going to get your day back on track?

You could ask your boss if he is nuts, expecting you to pick up the slack for two absent employees (knowing full well that he typically sits in his office playing with numbers and budgets on his computer).
You could stay silent, your fury slowly building throughout the day, as customers complain about ""what is taking so long?"". You think you are covering it up well, plastering a smile on your face, but a miserable, self conscious, angry wreck on the inside. By the end of the day, you are mentally and physically exhausted, and leave work feeling absolutely miserable. Tears of anger stream down your face as you drive home, and all you want to do is go to bed.
You could decide that you are going to make the best of a bad situation. You know you are in for a long, hectic day. When a customer snarls ""What is taking so long?"" you calmly apologize. With an understanding smile on your face, let the line up at the counter know that you are sorry for the wait they are having, but you are unfortunately short staffed today because some of your team is sick. Let them know you will get to them as quickly as you can. Alas, when the day is done, you know you did the best you could, and yippee, you survived!;
, It is a fact that we spend a large portion of our adult lives at work. In a perfect world, our days would be filled with happy communication with our coworkers, and enthusiasm at the assignments our boss throws our way. Alas, we do not live in a perfect world. Tackle the feelings you have appropriately depending on which of the following emotions you're facing., When you find yourself angered by an event at work, step away from the situation. Go to the break room and get a glass of water, step outside and take a few deep breaths. Take a few minutes to gain your composure. It will give you a chance to cool down emotionally. Then, when you return to your work space, you can deal with the situation with more rationality., The feeling of envy towards a fellow coworker, because of an accomplishment or promotion, is a common feeling. Most often, if you take the time to consider the why they got chosen, you may find that there was a valid reason. Perhaps your coworker has education or experience valuable to the position they were promoted to. In that case, it is not fair to compare yourself to the promoted coworker. Be happy for them, and understanding why they got the recognition should help quell you feelings of envy.

Also remember that there will always be situations where the boss tends to favour one employee over another. In that situation, like it or not, you have to either accept it or look to change jobs.

, In the competitive world we are working in, job security can cause us feelings of unease and even fear. Be proactive. Keep your resume up to date, and keep an eye on the job market, so that you feel more prepared should the worst happen. Fear can also come in the form of workplace bullying or an unrelenting supervisor. You should speak to someone you trust; a human resources counselor where you work, or a member of the management team that is in a senior position to the employees involved., The feeling of guilt often arises when you think you are not getting your work completed or you feel that you have offended someone in the office. This form of negativity can ultimately be a positive for us in the long run. When it comes to your work, set reasonable expectations for yourself and make sure that you meet, or exceed, these goals. With your coworker, take them aside and tell them that you think you may have said something that came across incorrectly, and wanted to apologize. In both situations, the opportunity for these negative situations to turn around or resolve themselves is within your control., This is a form of negativity that should be taken quite seriously. It often is a sign of you feeling hopeless about where you are going in your career, or worse, it could be a sign of depression that should not be ignored. Seeking counselling, through a qualified therapist or psychiatrist, can assist you in gaining focus and help with your feelings of depression."

Prepare yourself for difficult situations at school.,
Be gentle on yourself about what you're feeling.,
Avoid 'stuffing.',
Get help if you're being bullied.,
Consider counseling if you have a big fear of failure.",How to Deal with Negativity2," Another scenario: It is your first day back to school after being home sick for two weeks. You got caught up on all of your homework. You did two weeks worth of homework in four days. You are pretty proud of yourself knowing you are all caught up. First period, you have a test in history and that you did not know about. You are a straight A student, but you did not get a chance to study, and you have an algebra/chemistry/literature/history cocktail swimming in your head from all of the homework you just did. You tell your teacher that you did not know about the test, to which she replies curtly ""You are part of this class, you will take the test when everyone else does"". How are you going to handle this one?

You 'could' angrily tell your teacher that it is not fair, you hate her class and she cannot do this. This might make you feel better, for a couple of seconds, get some cheering from your classmates, and ultimately get you sent to the principal's office.
You could keep quiet and take the test with the rest of your class, knowing darned well that you are not going to do well. Your stomach will be in knots until you finally see your results. You do not want to even think about what grade you will get on the test.
You could take a deep breath, try to relax, and do the very best you can. Yes, you are likely not going to get the A that you are used to, however, whatever grade you get, you be proud of. You are taking a test for which you were unprepared, after doing a mountain of catch up homework. When the time comes for the term grade to be posted, maybe, just maybe, your teacher may surprise you, and give you an overall grade based on the type of student you have been the whole term.

, As any child becomes a teenager, they go through many changes, physically, mentally and psychologically. For some, it is a time of great memories and friendships. For others, it can be a time of insecurity, isolation and loneliness., When a person is in a situation where they are angry, but they know it is not appropriate to vent their anger, they hold it inside. This is called ""stuffing"". It is alright for a short time, but we cannot ""stuff"" our feelings forever. It is not healthy to bottle up your feelings. It can cause irritability and irrational behaviour over time., Sadly, this does not occur solely between children anymore. It is reported that students are now being victimized by their teachers.Children are in a particularly precarious situation, because the teacher is in a position of power and children are taught to treat their teachers with respect. In cases, such as the example given above, the child will typically suffer in silence. The children need to be coaxed out of their silence, if and when their parents see a change in their child's demeanor. The parents then need to meet with the school executives to do what they can to get the situation resolved.

If you are a victim of bullying, do not:

Think it's your fault. Nobody deserves to be bullied!
Fight back or bully a person back.
Keep it to yourself and just hope the bullying will ""go away."" ...
Skip school or avoid school or afterschool activities because you're afraid of the bully.
Be afraid to tell someone....
Hurt yourself., When a straight 'A' student conceives that they will not do well on a project or test they have taken, they feel that they have let themselves down, their parents down. They feel the weight of the world on their shoulders. They, too, feel helpless, hopeless, and they should seek professional counseling."
"
Be aware of negative triggers in your home life.,
Sort through the negative emotions that come up in your family.,
Show compassion instead of succumbing to anger.,
Tackle it head-on if you feel defensive.,
Talk to your partner if you feel like they're criticizing you.",How to Deal with Negativity3," Alas, the final scenario: You ran around doing errands all day. You had to go to four stores to find the exact DVD player your husband requested you pick up for your mother-in-law's upcoming birthday. You picked up the dry cleaning, got groceries, and as soon as you get the car emptied, you will be able to breathe a big sigh of relief. Ten minutes later, your spouse arrives home and what are the first words out of his mouth? ""What is for dinner?"" You stand there speechless. Now, what is your reaction!?

You could go with the explosion of ""Are you kidding me? You can't even say hello? Do you have any idea what kind of day I have had? It took four stores before I could find the stupid DVD player that you wanted for your mother! And that's just for starters buddy!""
You could say you have not had a chance to get it started yet, but as soon as you get the groceries put away, and the dry cleaning hung up, you will get dinner started. You hear him flop down on the couch as the evening news is coming on TV. Inside you are steaming with anger ""why couldn't he offer to make dinner?"". You realize that you could have asked him, but why bother, you will end up having to do most of it yourself anyway, so you would rather he just stay out of your way.
You could say ""and 'hello' to you too"" with a big smile! Both of you will likely chuckle, and after a welcome home kiss, you tell him that you are still emptying the car. It has been a long day. ""Why don't you decide if you want Chinese, Italian or Mexican for supper! The take out menus are in the top drawer!"" You might even find yourself a really lucky lady, and hubby will help you unload the car!

, Marriage involves a variety of emotions, covering a variety of situations. Naturally there are going to be some events that are more trying than others, but you can prepare for and deal with the emotions involved., This occurs you feel your partner is speaking or acting in a way that is disrespectful. It can quickly affect your marriage bond, making you feel unworthy of respect. The best way to keep the anger from growing out of control (and growing into contempt) is to show your partner some compassion. In the example above, try asking your partner to help you out. You show him some compassion instead of anger., Feeling defensive often results from an unwillingness to take responsibility for our actions. When you feel defensive, it is best to deal with it right away, by admitting to your spouse that you are feeling attacked or misunderstood. This can lead to a reasonable dialog, rather than anger and hurt feelings., Receiving criticism can feel like an attack. If you complain to your spouse about a particular action, you are being specific about what is bothering you. When you criticize, it tends to be more generalized and exaggerated. Instead of saying, ""You could have helped me empty the car"", it turns into ""I have to do everything around here"". Sit down and discuss this with your partner rationally and together try to focus on specifics over exaggeration."
"
Deal with your negative self-image.You self esteem has an impact on every situation you encounter throughout your day.,
Work on your personal development.,
Find someone to talk to.",How to Deal with Negativity4," If you suffer from negative self esteem, this can cause a you to react negatively to what might simply be a minor incident.

Exploding in anger in a situation is not going to solve anything. In fact, it will likely make things worse. If you constantly exhibit anger and rage, it is going to affect friendships, dealings with your teachers, supervisors and coworkers, and the relationship with your family.
Keeping anger or sadness, or other negative emotions bottled up is not the solution either. Suppressing your emotions, or stuffing as therapists call it, can lead to mental health problems, as well as physical symptoms that can truly harm your health., You need to do some deep personal exploration, getting to understand your feelings and why you respond the way you do.Ask yourself some questions:

Who is causing you feelings of insecurity? Is it a family member, kids at school, or coworkers?
What event(s) in your life do you feel has had a negative influence on your life? Is it a health problem? Do you have self esteem issues?
Are you filled with dread at the thought of going to school? Are you stressed out when you head home at the end of the day?
When do you feel the most anxious? Is there a time of day, perhaps the morning, or afternoon when you start to feel depressed? What is going on at that time?
Why do you feel this way? Why is probably one question you ask yourself alot:

Why do my classmates hate me?
Why can't I be skinny?
Why does my sister pick on me around her friends?
Why can't I catch onto things as quickly as my coworkers?



, You cannot keep exploding into angry fits at people, or bottling things up inside you. It is not healthy. If you have been having these feelings for a long time, you need to talk to someone!

Do you have an aunt or teacher that you are very close to? You can talk to a friend that you trust, but talking to someone older than you can give you a different perspective. They have more life experience, and chances are that if they have not been in your spot, they know someone who had similar feelings.
If you have been dealing with this for a long time, and you are depressed, or have feelings of self loathing, or worse, thinking of harming yourself, you need to talk to a professional.There is no stigma in asking for help. If someone picks on you for talking to a counselor or psychiatrist, they are the ones that have the problem, or need to grow up. Life is so much better when you have a positive outlook. Life is about new experiences, and looking forward to the future. Dealing with your emotions is the step you need to take to secure that happiness. Take the time now, because your positive journey to the future awaits.

Accept yourself and your situation.,
Think about the positives of being left out.,
Change your negative thinking about yourself.,
Build up your defenses.,
Focus your attention.,
Move on.","How to Cure ""Being Left Out Itis""1"," Individuals with lower self-esteem may be more likely to be sensitive and reactive when left out or socially rejected.Increasing your acceptance of yourself can help to increase your self-esteem, and reduce your negative reactions to being left out.Self-acceptance can be attained by looking at your strengths and your weaknesses and accepting all of these factors as they currently exist, without necessarily trying to change them immediately.
You can start by saying to yourself, “I accept who I am. I was left out, but that is okay. I accept that this happened and I can deal with it.”;
, Focusing on the positives may help you cope with feelings of inadequacy or rejection. For example, you may be skilled in an area that helped you identify you were being left out. People who pick up on non-verbal cues are more aware of being left-out because they are advanced at reading the nonverbal communication that suggest they are being left out.These individuals are better at telling whether someone is faking a smile, or displaying genuine happiness. Additionally, some people argue that individuals who are left out may become more creative due to feeling different or unique.Think about and list the possible positive components of being left out. Some examples might include that you get to focus on yourself, and it may help you to identify which friends are worth keeping versus people who may not be trustworthy or fair.

, Being or feeling left out can often result in negative thoughts about yourself such as, “Nobody likes me,” or, “I’m not good enough.”These types of thoughts can lead to negative emotions such as shame and humiliation. In order to reduce the likelihood of experiencing negative emotions, you can train yourself to think more realistically by catching yourself when you think negative thoughts.


Identify the negative thoughts that come up when you are left out, and purposefully change the thought to a more realistic perspective. For example, if you think, “Nobody likes me,” this is an example of a negative thought; work on thinking something more realistic such as, “Some people like me, but this particular person may not. That’s okay, not everyone has to like me. I’m still a good and valuable person.”

, Individuals with higher defensiveness may be better at dealing with social rejection. They tend to have lowered cortisol levels (stress hormone) when they deal with being left out.Think about happy memories when you were included and focus on those thoughts. Be tough and distance yourself from people who leave you out or reject you.

, If you have doubts about yourself or low self-esteem (thinking low or negative about yourself), controlling your attention can reduce your negative reactions to being left out.Shift your attention to thoughts about the social rejection issue and think about something else. Focus on your school work, homework, or another activity.
Become involved in another task in order to distract yourself from the negative feelings associated with social rejection. You can do something fun like sports or go shopping at the mall.

, If you are being treated unfairly and excluded, perhaps these individuals are not worth your time and effort. Unfortunately, no one can force people to like them or interact with them.


Try to focus on the positive relationships you do have and let go of relationships with people who exclude you or treat your poorly.

Allow yourself a day or two to feel disappointed.,
Don’t take an admissions rejection personally.,
Reach out to your social network for support.,
Speak with a counselor at your school.,
Plan your next move because you still have choices.",How to Deal With College or University Rejection1," You've worked hard to get to the point of submitting your application. As a result, reading that you weren't accepted at a desired college or university can understandably be devastating. Therefore, it’s normal to feel upset for a day or two, but don’t let yourself wallow. , Universities make admissions decisions based on a competitive applicant pool. Not getting into a particular college isn’t a personal rejection, but an outcome of many complex factors.Many times, the school just didn't have enough openings to accept all of the good applicants. In fact, even top-notch students get rejected from colleges. , Don’t isolate; rather, let your friends and family comfort and support you. Seek out people who love you no matter what. They'll encourage you and help you feel better about yourself.

, A school counselor will help you deal with the feelings of rejection that you may be experiencing. He'll also be able to improve your application by evaluating it for any weak spots. He'll then be able to help you understand the admissions process as well as assess your options. , This isn’t the end of your life. Even though you’ve been rejected from some or all of the colleges to which you applied, you still have options. You can still go to college. With four thousand colleges in the U.S., you can find one that fits your needs and goals."

Obviously, there are some cases where you cannot do this, but in many cases, there will be some work that someone else can take care of.For example, if you have a very busy week coming up, and you don’t know how you’ll manage it all in addition to making dinner every night for your family, ask your partner if they can take over dinner duty. If you don’t have a partner, see if you can find help another way.
If you aren’t sure how to ask, you can try saying, “I’ve really over-committed myself this week. It would be a big help if you could take care of dinner for the next couple of nights. Would that be OK for you?”
In today’s technology age, you can get almost anything delivered to your home, even groceries. Why not pay a service to do your grocery shopping for you?;
, Think of the things you have to do that are most important to you or the things that you have to do (e.g. work to make money so you can pay your bills). Schedule your top priorities into your day. Then, order the things that you’d like to do, but don’t have to do in order. Put the things you’d most like to do at the top of the list, and the things that are the least important to you at the bottom. Use the time you have left in your schedule to do those things, starting with the most important things, and doing the things that are least important whenever you have a bit of extra time.This also means including free time. It may seem oxymoronic to schedule free time, but if you feel that you are overextended it is important to view that time as time in your calendar where you are not free to do other things. If you don’t do this, you’re more likely to over-commit yourself to other things.
For example, if you often find that you have something going on every night after work, you might set one night a week where you don’t go to any social events after work. During this time, you can spend your evening relaxing at home, whatever that means for you.

, Many people end up overextending themselves because they don’t want to let anyone down. You don’t even think about it before offering to help out your neighbor, or agreeing to watch your sister’s dog. Unfortunately, this means you’ll have one more thing to take care of in addition to all of the other things you have going on. Try to be more aware of agreeing to help someone out, and be honest if you simply don’t have the extra time.


For example, you can say, “I’d really love to help you out, but I simply have too much going on right now.” If you want, you could make a suggestion about someone else you know that might be able to help them, though it isn’t completely necessary.Remember that you don’t have to justify your decisions to people. You may feel like you’re being rude, but you aren’t. In order to take control of your tasks, you have to practice putting your own well-being before the needs of others.

, When you prioritize your schedule, you’ll have the things that absolutely cannot wait (e.g. going to work, making food to eat, etc.), but you will also notice that there are some things that can wait until later. When you feel overextended, remind yourself that you’re not a superhero. You don’t have to do everything for everyone, and some things can wait until another day.For example, your home doesn’t have to be constantly ready to be shown on the cover of a magazine. A little dust won’t make anyone think less of you. Likewise, unless you are completely out of clean clothes to wear, your laundry can probably wait another day or two.

, There is lots of research confirming the importance of exercise for reducing stress. You might think you don’t have time for it, but just like all the other things you are doing, you have to make time for it. In this case, you have to make it a priority.If you don’t enjoy traditional exercise (e.g. lifting weights, running, swimming, etc.) that’s OK. Find a way to get moving that you do enjoy, even if it is just walking.
Even just 20 minutes of brisk walking each day can make a huge difference in how you feel. Start with that and work your way up, if you aren’t sure where to begin.
This will give you time that is just for you and nothing else, and the endorphins will help you feel less stressed at the same time.

, Meditation is a great way to give you some time to focus only on yourself and the moment that you are in. You don’t have to meditate for hours, or even 30 minutes if you don’t have the time or don’t want to. Spending even one or two minutes focusing on nothing but your breath can be a great way to feel a little less frazzled.For example, if you’ve only got a few free minutes, find a quiet place where you can sit quietly. Set an alarm on your phone or watch for one to three minutes. Close your eyes. Until the alarm goes off, all you have to do is breathe, and focus on your breathing. Don’t think about any of the things you still have to do, or worry about something that hasn’t been done. When the alarm goes off, you can go back to whatever you were doing.Another, more active form of meditation that many people find enjoyable is yoga. If you can’t stomach the thought of sitting quietly, thinking about nothing, yoga might be a more appealing way to relax.

, There are lots of stereotypical suggestions that can be made about what you should do to help yourself unwind. However, what works for everyone else might not work for you. Therefore, you should do whatever it is that you find relaxing and enjoyable. If exercise, meditation, or yoga work for you, then great. If it doesn’t sound appealing to you, then think about what does.For example, for many, cleaning, working on cars, and mowing the grass, are all chores that have to be done, but if it is what helps you relax, then you should do it. There is no correct way to unwind.

, For some people, the best way to recuperate from a lot of stress is to simply do nothing every now and then. That can be whatever it means to you. For some people, doing nothing might mean sleeping all day on Saturdays. For other people, doing nothing might be watching whatever is on TV or simply sitting in the park watching people go by. In today’s society, many people feel a lot of pressure to constantly be doing something. Just being for a little while can be a big help.


On the other hand, if you constantly find yourself lacking the motivation to do anything at all (e.g. get out of bed, do things you would normally enjoy, maintain your hygiene, etc), you could be suffering from depression.Depression is a difficult illness to deal with, especially alone; thus, you should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think you may be suffering from this illness.

, Problems such as overextending yourself can sometimes be difficult to identify. It isn’t like a broken leg or the flu; you can’t look at a list of symptoms and know for sure. This is because everyone is different. Some people thrive on a lifestyle that keeps them busy every moment of the day, while some people find this lifestyle overwhelming and stressful. Some people aren’t as aware of their feelings, and so they may not even realize they are overextended.


Determining whether or not you are overextended is largely an exercise in self-awareness. You have to take some time to really think about how you’re feeling both emotionally and physically. Your body will tell you if you’re doing too much.

, If you are overextending yourself, you might feel anxious, worried, or stressed, and you probably don’t feel very energetic. Taking time to reflect on how you’re feeling both emotionally and physically can give you a good idea about whether or not you are overextending yourself.For example, a person who is overextended likely spends a lot of time feeling worried about time itself. When you have too much to do, every minute counts. This can be very stressful for most people.

, A person who is overextended will often eat on the go. You might be picking up a sandwich that you eat in the car on the way to your next commitment, or you might not even be eating throughout the day at all; not because you don’t want to, but simply because you have too much to do. This is a sure sign that you’re overextending yourself. Of course, there may be the odd day that you can’t sit down for 15-30 minutes to have your lunch, but if this is happening regularly, you should do something to make your schedule more manageable.Food is fuel for your body. There are lots of different ways that people spread their meals out throughout the day, and you should do what works best for you. However, try to be conscientious about what you eat. If you constantly eat on the go, you’re more likely to eat whatever is convenient. Unfortunately, convenience foods are usually not the healthiest.

, If you often find yourself thinking that there simply aren’t enough hours in the day to do everything, you’re probably overextending yourself. You might try to find a few more hours by cutting out a couple hours of sleep every night. If you are trying to sleep, you might find it difficult because you are too caught up worrying about all that you need to get done. This works in a sort of vicious cycle; the more work you have to do, the less good quality sleep you get, the more tired you are, the more difficult it becomes to accomplish everything, and so on. Do your best to break out of this pattern.Try to improve your habits. For example, you can do this by making a rule for yourself that you will get in bed at a certain hour every night. Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night, so try to aim for at least the minimum.Try to find a way to get electronics out of your routine a few hours before bedtime. The blue light from smartphone screens, TVs, and computers makes it more difficult to get to sleep.If you must do something on the computer, try downloading an app that helps reduce the amount of blue light in the screen during hours of darkness.

, A person who is overextended is under a lot of stress. This is coupled with not eating healthy, not having time to exercise, and not getting enough sleep. This is a terrible combination for your health. Thus, the state of your health can be a good indicator of whether or not you are overextending yourself. Of course, not all health conditions are directly related to how well you take care of yourself, but a lot of them are. If you are noticing new aches and pains, headaches, skin rashes, etc. These could all be signs that your body is not being taken care of.Make sure that you visit your doctor if you have any unexplainable symptoms occurring as they could be a sign of a serious health condition. As a busy person, you may think you don’t have the time, but nothing is more important than your health.

Figure out what you can do about your situation.,
List possible solutions to your problems.,
Make a plan to deal with your hard life.,
Move on!",How to Deal With a Hard Life1," Give yourself a few minutes to reflect on your situation and figure out a plan of action. Ask yourself, is this a situation I can fix? Is this a life situation that calls for patience? Or is this a situation that I need to walk away from? Once you have clarity about what you can do about it, you will feel better about moving forward., Give yourself 5 minutes to imagine as many possible solutions as you can come up with.

Look at your own behavior.,
Reduce your expectation of rejection.,
Focus on yourself.,
Keep positive people close to you.","How to Cure ""Being Left Out Itis""2"," It is possible that some of your behaviors may increase the likelihood of being left out? For example, research suggests that kids who are socially ostracized have more difficulty entering into social groups (i.e. starting conversations), dealing with peer provocation (i.e. a peer doing something to aggravate a child such as throwing a piece of rolled up paper at his head), and coping with failure.Try building your social competence by learning new social skills. You can attend a Social Skills Training group, attend therapy, or find useful information online to learn to develop better interpersonal skills., Thinking you are likely to be rejected may result in you acting in a way (such as avoiding social interaction or seeming overly nervous) that influences other people to reject you. This is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy.Instead of thinking thoughts such as, “They are not going to invite me, I know it,” think something like, “I can’t really predict what they will do, but either way – I will be fine.”

, Learning to focus on, accept, and love yourself is integral to getting other people to do the same. If you are confident and secure, you will act in a way that shows this to others.


Focus on your schoolwork or your job. Being and feeling successful may help reduce social rejection.You will feel more successful and confident and others are likely to notice this.
Instead of staying home and thinking about how you were left out, do something positive for yourself; go out for a long walk or meet up with some friends. Keep your mind off the people who are leaving you out. They're not worth your time!

, Try getting new friends or cultivating existing friendships that are healthy are supportive. People who leave you out simply don't deserve your time, and will most likely continue to mistreat you.


Tell a person who you trust how you feel. It is healthy to let emotions and thoughts out in a trusting and supportive environment. If you talk to a friend or family member that you trust, he may stick up for you and intervene if you are going to be rejected or left-out in the future. It is good to have people on your side and looking out for you.
Surround yourself with individuals that you are confident won’t reject you or leave you out.
Seek out individuals who do not bully or mistreat others because they are likely to do this to you as well.
Sometimes it can help to find people in the same situation as you who are also left out, and bond together.
If you continue to have issues with peers, you can talk to a school counselor or administrator to help with conflict resolution.

Identify the possible causes of your exclusion.,
Think about the rejection you are experiencing.,
Identify the negative effects of feeling left out.","How to Cure ""Being Left Out Itis""3"," Understanding the reasons that contribute to your feeling left out may help you develop goals in order to reduce these negative thoughts and feelings. Analyze the factors that might contribute to your being left out.


Some individuals who have mental health diagnoses may be more sensitive to and unfortunately more likely to experience social rejection.Ask yourself if a mental health concern might contribute your feelings of being left-out.
Those with medical conditions may also be more likely to be social rejected due to social stigma and the belief that some medical issues such as obesity and type II Diabetes are preventable.Is it possible that a medical issue is a factor?
Research suggest that people may be more sensitive and angry when socially rejected by members of different races or ethnic backgrounds.Identify if you are reacting to a social rejection more strongly because the other person is a different race than you.
Gender and age may also play a role in the perception of being left out; for example, females, especially adolescent females, may be more sensitive to social rejection.People who are more socially anxious may also be particularly fearful about people thinking negatively about them or excluding them.Does your anxiety about social situations contribute to your being left out?

, There are two types of social rejection, the first type is covert, such as when a friend does not invite you to a party. The second type is when you are explicitly rejected, such as that same friend telling you that you are not invited to the party.


Think about the reasons for your feeling of being left out. For example, perhaps you feel left out because your group of friends went out together and they didn’t invite you. Think about other ways of looking at the situation; is it possible that your friend wanted to invite you but forgot? Make sure you know the facts before you conclude that you are being left out on purpose.

, Understanding how being left out and feeling rejected affects you both mentally and physically may serve as additional motivation for positive change. Individuals who are socially rejected (other people not wanting to work with them or be around them) have higher cortisol levels, indicating higher feelings of stress. Another consequence of feeling left out is that social stress can make you more susceptible to diseases associated with inflammation; stress related to social rejection can cause inflammation.Being left out can also lead to depressed mood and possibly aggressive behaviors toward others.People who are rejected tend to spend money more freely.Ask yourself, “What are the bad things that happen when I am left out?” Do you feel depressed, stressed, or have aggressive behaviors?

Getting into the right school is less important than having a good college experience.,
Realize that there are many ways to get an education, build a career, and live one’s life.,
Expect the possibility that embarking upon the college journey can be stressful and can lead to haphazard decisions.",How to Deal With College or University Rejection2," A 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index Report from interviews with 30,000 U.S. graduates found that “where graduates went to college ... hardly matters at all to their current well-being and their work lives in comparison to their experiences in college.” A key is to focus on having a good experience, not on getting into the “right” school. Some good experiences include involvement in extracurricular activities and/or having an internship. Ultimately, it's not where you went to school but what you did while there that will have a stronger impact on quality of work after graduation., College can be an important part of that process. However, if it doesn’t go the way you planned, there are many ways to get the education and experience you need. You can obtain an education through mentorships, apprenticeships, internships, and studying abroad. Attending another school affords most of the same benefits as your dream college. While there, you'll still make some great friendships, have the opportunity to get involved in activities for both fun and professional reasons, create memorable experiences, and get a quality education., Don't expect this expedition to be clear-cut and predictable. For most people, going from high school to desired college to internship to fantastic job is more of a dream than a reality. Actually, it's become more common to change majors more than once in a college that wasn't a first choice. "

Gather information on other schools and alternative paths.For instance, if you want to pursue a career as attorney, you may want to consider attending a technical or vocational school to become a paralegal or court reporter, or you may want to attend a police academy to become a police officer. You'll then have hands-on experience that you can add to your application and apply when you do become an attorney.

, This can be a way to improve your grades and build a proven track record of academic success while saving money.Numerous community colleges have open admissions policies.You can then later transfer courses to a four-year institution.

, Some colleges accept applications for terms other than the fall term. For example, you might be able to enter during the winter or spring term.Summer terms can offer smaller classes and more individualized attention.

, You could write a letter asking the school to reconsider, although it is extremely rare for a college to reverse their decision. You should include persuasive reasons why they should change their mind about you. Whether or not your appeal is accepted, you can at least know that you tried everything you could to get into that college., Taking a year off between high school and college can be a great choice for some people.You can work, travel, or simply enjoy this time in your life. It's a great opportunity to learn about yourself. It’s also possible to participate in an organized gap year program. There is always more time later to pursue an education, and pausing for a year can help you reassess your career goals.

, Many factors go into college admissions decisions.Look at the weakest points of your application. Then incorporate any feedback you received from colleges into your plans to improve your application. You may need to improve: Standardized test scores.
Personal statements and admissions essays.
Academic performance.
Volunteer experience.
Work experience.
Extracurricular activities.
Portfolio.
Subject test scores.
Interviewing skills.

Assess the likelihood of someone you know being on board.,
Keep trying to reach the person in question if you are certain that they were expecting to catch a plane from the crashed plane's airport at the relevant time.

,
Find out the number of the airport, emergency services numbers or hotlines and contact them for information.,
If you do find out that a loved one or someone you know was on board a crashed flight, there are some things that you will need to consider:


Keep abreast of the news as to victims.,
When things become clearer, make a decision as to whether or not you want to go to the location nearest the crash site to either be there as support when victims are brought back for treatment, or to make necessary arrangements to return bodies back home.,
Remember that the ""right"" decision for you is the one made by you.",How to Cope With News of a Plane Crash1,"


Find out where the plane flew from. Is here anybody you know living, working, or traveling there?
Were you expecting this person to be catching a flight for any reason from this place at this time?
Try phoning or emailing the person in question if you have a real reason to be concerned. Reaching them will settle your concerns.
If you don't reach the person, scan the news for more information. Be aware that some airports are extremely busy and that there are many flights leaving around the same time as the crashed flight.;
,, Expect them to be very busy and for the lines to be engaged. Be patient and keep trying.


Search online for airport contact details.
Search online for the local (relevant) police or rescue authorities. You might need to use news stories to reach a decision as to which country's authorities are dealing with the plane crash if it happens over sea - consider trying the departure country, the destination country, and any nearby countries closest to the crash location (if known).

, The news stories will change frequently and there may be a lot of mistaken reporting, so hold onto your hopes, as there may be survivors yet.
Find people to support you immediately. Making decisions from afar under unknown and very upsetting circumstances cannot be done alone.
Stay in touch with emergency officials. Give them your details, your relationship status to any persons on board, and how you can be contacted at any time.

,


If you need to get on a plane to be there, you might suffer additional anxiety. You might wish to see your doctor for medication to help you through this.
Consider asking someone you trust and can rely upon to accompany you, or to go in your stead if you don't feel that you can go.
Consider not going but relying on the authorities to do all that needs to be done.
If you have children impacted by this news, keep them informed as you have the facts and try to avoid scaring them unnecessarily. If you cannot cope, consider asking a friend or relative to look after the children for a time.

, Don't give into the advice of other people if it feels wrong for you. If you are in the awful position of receiving the worst news that a loved one or friend has died, the way in which you respond and grieve are entirely personal and down to who you are and your relationship with this person.

Send it soon.,
Choose a format.,
Stay formal.,
Get to the point.,
Keep it short.",How to Overcome Anxiety After an Interview2," Make sure to send a thank you within the first couple of days after an interview. That way, the interview is still fresh in the interviewer's mind.Sending a thank you is a good way to channel your anxiety because it gives you something physical to do to help you get the job.

, Today, companies are often fine with an email thank you letter. You can use email unless you know the company to be very formal, such as they requested you send in your resume rather than submit it by email. Nonetheless, a mailed letter can show that you are committed to the position.It can be nice to write a short handwritten note, even. Just make sure your handwriting is neat, and write it out first somewhere else so you don't have typos.Mostly, though, you should only use handwritten notes with somewhat informal companies.

, Start with ""Dear Mr./Ms."" with the person's last name and a semi-colon. If you're sending a typed letter, include the formal heading, with your name and contact information, the date, and the employer's name and contact information above that.In an email, it's not as necessary, but you can still include it., Start out with thanking the person for the time it took to interview you. In the middle, talk about a connection you made with the interviewer or reiterate what makes you valuable. End the letter with another thank you and convey how much you would like to join the company.For instance, to note the connection, you could say, ""Thank you for the time you took to interview me the other day. I was pleasantly surprised to find another OU grad. Go Sooners!""
As for what makes you valuable, you could write, ""As we discussed, this job requires sharp attention to detail. With my work experience as an editor, I have the keen eye you need.""

, You shouldn't be writing a dissertation. This note is just a short, simple way to remind the interviewer of your presence and to show that you really are interested in the job.Definitely keep it under a page. You don't want to overwhelm the interviewer. Five paragraphs is also a good maximum, if you're writing an email, but shorter is probably better.

Keep applying for jobs and making contacts.It may take a while to hear back, depending on the job. For instance, some companies may take up to a month to get back to candidates. It's fine to ask at the interview how long you can expect to wait to hear back, so you have a good idea.

, Try to get the recommended 8 hours of sleep. When you're not getting enough sleep, it makes you more stressed.Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. If you can't remember to go to bed on time, try setting an alarm on your phone an hour before you want to go to sleep. At the point, shut down all electronics and get ready to head for bed.

, Once you've figured out if anything went wrong and how you can correct it, spend your time thinking about what went well, if you must think about the interview. Think about how well you did answering a particular question, and remind yourself that you remembered to ask a couple of questions. Staying focused on the positive will help keep you upbeat., Hobbies are a great way to de-stress because you can lose yourself in what you're doing, much like meditation. Pick a hobby you love to do, and spend a couple of hours doing it the week after the interview.Even better, visit a local group that was created around the same hobby. That way, you engage with others and enjoy your hobby.

, Volunteering is a way to help others, but it also builds up your skill set at the same time. Plus, it makes you feel better about yourself and gives you a chance to meet new people and network.Try volunteering at a local library or school. Visit hospitals, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and other similar organizations to see if you can help. Spearhead a community garden. Try to pick something that partially uses the skills you have.

Stop reading or listening to any news about the crash.,
Talk to someone else you know about your feelings.,
Expect some people to react badly to your voyeuristic grief.,
Try not to identify so heavily with the situation.,
Seek professional help if you find that you cannot work through your upset easily.",How to Cope With News of a Plane Crash2," There is nothing to be gained by wallowing in mass negativity over an event that has happened, has no personal connection to you, and that is upsetting you greatly.


Accept that it is a sad, terrible event and that such news is painful to learn, but don't allow it to paralyze you personally.
Accept that your feelings are real but are not to be given free rein to make you feel worse. Ask yourself: ""What is to be gained by taking on board all the sorrow?""
Do something else to distract your mind. Go for a walk, a run, visit a cafe (and don't read the papers!) or go to the gym.

, Make sure that it is someone who connects well with you and understands that you can be easily upset by such stories. Ask them to help you work through your feelings of sadness and upset.


If other people start talking about the crash around you, excuse yourself.

, If you try to voice your concerns to someone who doesn't understand that you are highly sensitive to such information, or if you leave a tweet or forum post about how upset you are and someone reacts with negativity to your pain, walk away from them. You do not need to add other people's irritability or insensitivity to your very real feelings of sadness.

, The majority of planes reach their destination and flying commercial aircraft is far safer than traveling in a car. If you're worried about the safety of planes and whether you'll ever catch one again, keep in mind that the odds of crashing are low, and the reality is that many people survive crashes but the press isn't so excited about reporting those ones!

, You might need to learn some coping techniques for dealing with highly negative news stories, to learn to separate and distance yourself from other (usually unknown) people's pain and loss that you're trying to take on board.

Visit your doctor.",How to Manage Anxiety Naturally With Food," Omega-3 fatty acids help protect against inflammation and have also been shown to improve people’s overall mood, ability to cope with stress, and ability to kick substance-abuse habits.Omega-3 fatty acids are especially prevalent in oily fish like tuna, mackerel and salmon. In addition, walnuts, olive oil and avocado are also good sources of healthy fats. Include 1 serving daily.;
, These carbs are believed to increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This neurotransmitter is thought to be responsible for mood balance.Higher levels have shown to have a calming effect.Complex carbohydrates include foods such as: quinoa, whole grain oats, brown rice, 100% whole grain bread and pasta.
Complex carbs are also known to be higher in fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals compared to refined or simple carbohydrates., Recent studies have demonstrated that chamomile can reduce symptoms of anxiety.Most people with generalized anxiety disorder noticed modest benefits after regularly consuming chamomile tea.


Chamomile is available in a variety of forms including: tea, topical ointment, capsules, liquid extracts and dried flower heads.If drinking chamomile tea, drink three to four cups daily for a modest benefit., This is an essential amino acid in the human diet - meaning we have to get it from foods, we cannot make it ourselves.Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsible for mood balance.


In addition, tryptophan can reduce anxiety by promoting better sleep.Examples of foods high in tryptophan include: cheese, chicken, soy products, eggs, tofu, fish, milk, turkey, nuts, peanuts and peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds.To make tryptophan-laden meals more effective, make them high in complex carbohydrates. Carbs make tryptophan more available in the brain to make serotonin., These vitamins (primarily folate, B12 and B1) are believed to combat anxiety by affecting your brain’s production of certain neurotransmitters (like serotonin).Eat a variety of foods containing these vitamins at every meal.


Many B Vitamins including folate, B12 and B1 are found in a variety of foods. However, they are predominantly present in: animal products (like poultry, eggs, meat and fish), dairy, fortified grains and cereals and dark leafy greens.
Older adults, vegetarians and those who suffer from GI diseases like Crohn's or Celiac disease are at a higher risk for B vitamin deficiency.This may cause symptoms of anxiety. Additional supplementation with B Vitamins may be required.

, Making your breakfast more energizing can help combat the effects of anxiety during the day.A protein rich breakfast can also help you stay satisfied longer throughout the day and keep your blood sugar levels more steady.


Great sources of protein at breakfast can include: eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, whole grain oats and other cereals and lean meats.

, Even mild dehydration can negatively affect your mood and energy balance.Drinking adequate amounts of clear fluids throughout the day can help you maintain adequate hydration status.


Aim for about 8 glasses of clear fluids daily. The amount you need specifically may differ, but 8 glasses or 64 oz or about 2 liters is a good rule of thumb to follow., These fats, which we largely get from vegetable oils, can increase inflammation in the brain and have been linked with mood imbalances.The most common sources of omega-6 fats include: safflower oil, corn oil, sesame oil and soy oil.Try to use olive oil or canola oil for cooking and food preparation instead of oils high in omega-6 fats.

, Despite its immediate calming effect, the process of metabolizing alcohol can actually make you feel edgy and interfere with your ability to sleep.Alcohol has also been shown to trigger panic or anxiety attacks.The maximum amount of alcohol is one glass daily for women and two glasses daily for men. One glass is generally about 12 oz of beer (1/2 liter) or about 5 oz of wine.However, it might be worthwhile to give up alcohol completely to help manage anxiety., In addition to heightening anxiety by making you feel jittery, the stimulating effect of caffeine can take up to eight hours to wear off and interfere with your ability to rest.Like alcohol, caffeine can also trigger or cause anxiety and panic attacks.Caffeine is most commonly found in coffee and tea but is also present in some sports drinks, energy drinks and other supplements.
Stick to decaf beverages like decaf coffee and decaf tea.

, Refined carbohydrates and simple sugars have been shown to have negative side effects in regards to mood, energy and anxiety.Try to minimize these foods as much as possible.


Types of simple carbohydrates or sugars to avoid include: sweetened beverages, sweet treats like candy or cakes and foods made out of white flour like white bread or plain pasta.

, Some foods and food additives (like preservatives) can cause a variety of issues in people who are sensitive to them. Some people experience mood changes, irritability and anxiety in response to the consumption of these foods.The most common irritants included: wheat, milk, eggs, tobacco, smoke and sugar., Some herbal supplements have been shown to have natural anti-anxiety like effects. However, prior to adding any herbal supplement to your diet, check with your doctor to make sure it's safe and appropriate for you.


Take valerian root. Some studies have indicated that valerian has a sedative effect, which is why it’s commonly used as a sleep aid.Other studies have shown that it helps manage stress and anxiety.Take passionflower extract. Some studies have shown that passionflower has shown to reduce overall anxiety.Take lemon balm. Studies have shown that lemon balm can reduce the symptoms of anxiety and stress.However, you should avoid lemon balm if you have hyperthyroidism.

, Including regular exercise can help you manage and deal with anxiety. Studies have shown that exercise can have an immediate and long-lasting positive effect on anxiety.Aim for 150 mins of moderate-intensity aerobic activities each week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activities each week.Find a friend or exercise buddy to work out with. This can help make it more enjoyable to exercise regularly.

, When your body is stressed or you're experiencing higher levels of anxiety, your body needs more sleep and rest.It's recommended to get at least 7-9 hours of sleep each night.Go to bed early and wake up late if you're able.
Turn off all lights and electronics prior to going to sleep. If you can, leave them out of your bedroom as well.

, Sometimes anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder requires further treatment and evaluation outside of dietary/lifestyle changes. Consult with a doctor or mental health professional if the symptoms become severe, interfere with daily life, or cause a lot of distress.


Common symptoms of anxiety include: nervousness, panic, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, and trouble concentrating.More severe symptoms of anxiety that may require medical treatment include: feeling like your worries are interfering with your work or personal life or you have suicidal thoughts or behaviors."

Decide on which format you want to chart.,
Choose what you will be tracking.,
Purchase a journal.,
Create a rating scale from which to rate each element.,
Determine how many times a day you would like to chart.",How to Create a Mood Chart for Yourself1," There are many options for creating your own mood chart. The method you choose will depend on you preferences. You can create a mood chart using tables from either Microsoft Word or Excel and print several copies. You could use blank sheets of paper, a pencil, and rulers to draw your own chart. You could also simply write out the details of each day on a journal page.


If you are not creative or do not want to take the time to keep up with a paper chart, you can track your mood online at websites like Mood Panda or MedHelp Mood Tracker. Or, you can keep a paper chart that you have downloaded.You also have the option to log onto the iTunes and Google Play stores and search for ""mood chart"" or ""mood tracker"" apps to download on your phone.;
, Mood charts can be as simple or elaborate as you like. Some people merely track their sleep, moods, anxiety and medications, while others keep tabs on sleep, mood, energy, eating, behaviors, medications and so much more. Decide which factors are most relevant or helpful to your case and include them in your chart.


For the purposes of creating our chart we will be focusing on mood, anxiety, sleep, and medications by documenting them in a journal.

, If you want to describe your sleep and mood status daily and also have the option of writing additional notes about what happened that day, a diary or journal would be most helpful. Buy one that is attractive to you and have at least 10 to 15 lines of space on each page. Every page in your journal will represent a day in your life.

, Since we will be tracking mood, anxiety, sleep, and medications, we will only be required to develop spectrums for mood and anxiety. Sleep will be documented as hours slept, and medication will list which pills you took, at what time, and at what dosage. We can include a precise rating scale on the first page of the journal so that the ratings are always accessible. Your rating scale might look like this:1- Extremely Depressed
2- Very Depressed
3- Somewhat Depressed
4- Mildly Depressed
5- Stable
6- Mildly Manic
7- Somewhat Manic
8- Very Manic
9-Extremely Manic
If you are tracking additional factors, such as anxiety, you can follow a similar protocol. Create a rating scale from 1 to 9 (or some other number) ranging from Extremely Low to Extremely High in anxiety.

, If you are up for about an 18-hour period, it might be most helpful to chart three times a day - every six hours. Create a special spot for each time-frame in your journal and leave 3 to 4 lines open beneath the time spot. Then, leave a number of lines clear at the bottom of each pages for additional notes on your mood, energy, stressors and/or behaviors for that day.

Identify the source of your anxiety.,
Determine if your worry is solvable.,
Consider the worst.,
Accept uncertainty.,
Consider the use of your worry.",How to Overcome Anxiety1," Whether you have a panic attack or a sudden bout of worry and fear, it is important to determine what is causing your anxiety. Is something in your environment the primary source? Is a possible mishap the origin? Is an impending activity, meeting, or event the cause? You can handle a fear much easier when you are clear about what it is.;
, If you know what your fear is, the next step is to determine if it is something you can deal with, or something that only time (or your imagination) can manage. If your fear is largely imagination or can’t be dealt with now, then make the conscious effort to put it out of your mind. If your worry is something that needs to be dealt with, then take steps to create a course of action.


What can you do to lessen this fear or worry?
Is this a long term or a short term fix?
What can I do to prevent this worry or fear from recurring?

, If your fear is mind-consuming, take a moment to think about the honest and absolute worse thing that could happen as a result of it. Perhaps you’re getting ready to do a huge presentation, and you begin to panic. Stop and think “what is the worst that could happen?” No matter how creative your response may be, thinking critically will lead to find that should it occur, there are few endings that can’t be dealt with in a reasonable manner.

, It can be tough to stop worrying when you’re never quite sure how a scenario will play out. At this point, it is important to simply accept the ever-present fact of uncertainty. We can’t know how something will go, or what the ending may be; worrying about the unknown is an unnecessary source of fear that can be avoided with the simple acceptance of chance.

, You are worried for a reason - anxiety is a fear response to a real or imagined scenario. Problems arise when we begin worrying about things that don’t actually cause us danger. So, think about the purpose of your worry. Is it helpful? If you’re afraid of a legitimately dangerous situation, then your worry is being put to good use. If however, you are anxious without a purpose, then your worry has the best of you. Remembering that can help to bring you down off of an anxiety high."

Be yourself.",How to Be Cool Without Being Bullied by Jealous People1," Being yourself is trusting in your own worth and not being afraid to express yourself. When you let others see your real self and the fact that you believe in what you're doing and being, other people find this alluring and see it as something to look up to. you are unique, and you don't need to join a clique to validate yourself. Make your own friendships, on your own terms.


Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you are quiet. It is not about being sullen or passive/aggressive.
Don't try to be like anyone else. Live life for who you are and what you believe matters. Don't lose sight of yourself or your morals. Being cool isn't about changing who you are, its about being confident enough to let people see how awesome you really are.;

Track your mood.,
Develop a regular habit of mood-charting.,
Review your progress.",How to Create a Mood Chart for Yourself2," As you begin you may need to sync your charting with your medications to help you remember. Over time, charting will become a natural and productive part of your day. See the example below for how your chart might look.October 18th:
Sleep: 7 hrs
8:00am:
Mood: 3
Medications: 200 mg Tegretol; 100 mg Wellbutrin
2:00pm:
Mood: 4
Medications: None
8:00pm:
Mood: 4
Medications: 200 mg Tegretol; 100 mg Wellbutrin
Notes: Worked. Ate 3 meals. Walked 2 miles. Day got better as it went on. Decent focus and attention. Had negative thoughts ""I screwed up that presentation; I'm a failure."" ""My girlfriend didn't call; No one cares about me."" Was able to pull myself out of them and challenge their truth. No alcohol or non-prescribed drugs today.

, The only way you and your doctor can learn anything useful from your mood chart is by doing it daily. Missing one day can cause you to forget or minimize a new change in your mood, anxiety or sleep. Even good habits like charting can be hard to follow at first. To ensure that you regularly chart, and to build motivation, follow the 3 R's of habit change:Reminder: Cement this new behavior by notifying yourself of when you should be doing it. It may be simpler to set a firm rule that each day you will chart your mood right before breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Routine: Follow the same procedure for charting each day so that you physically and mentally become accustomed to incorporating this new behavior into your day.
Reward: In addition, to learning new and interesting facts about yourself through charting, you should also create some other regular reward for sticking to this behavior. Maybe you could tell yourself that if you chart 3 times a day for a week, you will reward yourself with a treat over the weekend.

, Charting your moods is especially helpful when you are switching to a new medication, noticing repeating cycles in your mood states; wanting to verify that your medication is working; and to show your doctor your progress. Look over your journal each week and at the end of each month to note patterns in mood changes or repetitive stressors that influence your mood and behaviors."

Focus on both the positive and the negative.,
Avoid thinking in terms of ""all or nothing."",
Don’t make it into a catastrophe.,
Try not to jump to conclusions.,
Don’t let your emotions control your reasoning.,
Avoid making everything personal.",How to Overcome Anxiety2," When you are anxious about something, it can be incredibly easy to see only the negative aspects of it. As with all things though, there must be a positive facet to your fear-filled situation as well. Don’t focus on a single negative event while completely ignoring other related positives ones at the same time.

, No matter what situation is about to go down, it’s unlikely that the outcome is completely black or white. Don’t allow yourself to ignore gray areas and overdramatize something. For example, assuming that if you don’t get accepted to a particular college, you’re a total failure and nobody will want you. This type of thinking is common with anxiety, but is also totally irrational.

, If your fear is of something non-dangerous and possibly even imagined, one of the surefire ways to make it worse is to turn it into a catastrophe. If you’re anxious about flying on a plane, and at the first sign of turbulence turn it into a crash, you are making your anxiety worse. See every situation as it really is, rather than what it could be.

, If you lack facts and have yet to experience your worry or fear, then jumping to conclusions about what might happen will do you no good. If an uncertainty lays before you, you can reduce your anxiety by realizing (and admitting) that you don’t know what may happen. Consider all possible outcomes, rather than jumping to the most morbid or unlikely.

, When you’re scared and anxious, it is easy to let emotions get in the way of logic. Your emotions will do just that though, and they will fool you into thinking you are in more danger than you really are. Don’t let your fear convince you are in danger, unless you really are. The same goes with all negative anxiety-based emotions, including stress, guilt, and embarrassment.

, When anxiety strikes, don’t allow it to force you to take blame for a situation outside of your control. If you’re anxious and scared because your house was broken into, it may be easy to take it personally and blame yourself for the break-in. This type of thinking is illogical though, and will make you feel worse. Unless you invited thieves knowingly into your home, you can’t be held accountable for the robbing they did."
"
Breathe deeply.,
Take some time to exercise.,
Meditate or pray.,
Keep a healthy diet.,
Take a magnesium supplement.,
Try an herbal remedy.,
Visit a therapist.",How to Overcome Anxiety3," When you get anxious, your breathing quickens, which reduces the amount of oxygen your brain gets. This makes it more difficult to think clearly and form logical reasoning. Take a moment to focus on taking deep belly breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 4 seconds, and then release it for 4 seconds. Doing this for 1-2 minutes should help to calm your nerves quickly.

, Whether anxiety has just struck or you are chronically anxious, exercising is sure to help. Physical activity releases endorphins which increase happiness, and reduce cortisol - a stress producing hormone. As soon as you start to feel anxiety hit, go workout or take a walk. Aside from immediate treatment, regular exercise will decrease the amount of anxiety you feel over time.

, Consciously taking your thoughts off of your stressor and focusing them inwards on something peaceful will reduce your anxiety and fear immensely. When anxious thoughts start to hit, retreat inwards and repeat a positive mantra to yourself or pray. Focus entirely on this, and eventually your anxiety will evaporate on its own.

, Although it may seem silly to link your anxiety to what you ate for breakfast, the foods you eat have a big impact on your mental functioning. Studies have shown a correlation between unhealthy eating and high anxiety and stress. Try to incorporate more fruits, veggies, and whole grains into your daily diet. Get tested to make sure you don’t have any food allergies that may be triggering your anxiety as well - a common experience.

, Magnesium works in your body to reduce the effects of anxiety from regular worries to panic attacks. If you have a magnesium deficiency, you may be more anxious than you should be. Grab a magnesium supplement from a local health foods store and see if it improves your mood.

, You don’t have to rely solely on chemical filled medications to relieve your anxiety. Instead, try an all-natural herbal remedy. Many scientific studies have shown a strong correlation between reduced anxiety and taking supplements of St. Johns wort, valerian root, and chamomile. Try one of these supplements before heading for heavier medications., If your anxiety is so strong that you can’t seem to overcome it, there is no shame in going to a professional. The same way that you wouldn’t question the intelligence of visiting a medical doctor for an injury, it is similarly healthy to go to a psychologist for emotional and mental wellbeing. If you experience chronic anxiety or recurrent panic attacks, you may have a psychiatric diagnosis that can be easily dealt with through specialized therapy or medication.

Remember that people are your equals.,
Be respectful of other people, but expect that they will accept you in turn.",How to Be Cool Without Being Bullied by Jealous People2," Even a group of people is equal to you. Whether you're talking to a potential employer, a group of wealthy donors, a child, a stranger, the President of the United States, or an attractive guy or girl, remember that they are neither better than you nor worse than you. They are human beings with the same rights and responsibilities you have. Treat them as you wish to be treated.

, In other words, just as you are expected to treat them with respect, expect that they will return the favor. When someone is disrespectful to you, ignore them until they figure it out. Do not ignore as if you didn't hear your antagonist; instead, casually and conversationally disregard their hurtful, hateful or ignorant remarks. There is usually an undisclosed reason that they didn't show respect towards you or the person didn't do what you asked of them. It may be because they are unhappy, someone hurt them recently, they felt that you were disrespectful towards them, or because they were never taught the correct way to act around people. Provided that you understand there is some reason behind their behavior, this will allow you to be willing to find out what the reason is, as long as you want them to respect you."

Understand why some people seek refuge in bullying.,
Know the type of bully you're dealing with.",How to Be Cool Without Being Bullied by Jealous People3," People bully for a number of different reasons. However, the most common reason that people resort to bullying is that they're envious of something you represent and that they don't possess, such as status, money, smarts, or health. Or, they may be jealous of your relationship with someone they want to have in their life too.Be sympathetic, for trying to be like you is a strange form of flattery and it shows that they are truly misguided by not realizing that bettering themselves requires looking deep within, not scouting for scapegoats external to themselves., Along with understanding why people bully, you need to understand what kind of bully you're dealing with. The most common types are:


Aggressive bullies: These people are likely to abuse physically and without hesitation. Aggressive bullies hurt people to get their anger out physically and make you fear them. However, aggressive bullies usually get into the most trouble when you report them. Some aggressive bullies might threaten you by saying something like ""report me and I'll beat you up"". Learn to ignore the nonsense threats, they won't touch you.






Taunting bullies: These people are verbally abusive (calling names, making jokes, teasing, etc.). Taunting bullies usually work when there's a big crowd around you so they can make people laugh. They aim to make you hurt on the inside as opposed to on the outside. They could hurt you saying something against the way that other people think that you're cool. Remember that this is only because they wish people thought they were cool and they're trying to act big so people respect them.






Cyber bullies: These people harass other people through instant messaging, e-mail, and any other electronic means. Cyber bullies hide behind computers so that they don't have to face you. Unlike the other two types of bully, cyber bullies very rarely strike when you're with other people. This is because they can easily be caught out; what they've said is on the chat history. Cyber bullies often have nothing to say when you're around them, however you should still stay away.







"
"
Avoid the bullies.,
Show minimal reaction to bullying.,
Be consistently non-reacting.,
Be aware that you cannot talk sense to an irrational person.,
Catch the bully out.",How to Be Cool Without Being Bullied by Jealous People4," Don't pass them and don't talk to them. This does not mean be scared and hide, but things will only get worse if you cross their path. If you are in class, ask to be seated far away where they can't hurt you, physically or mentally.

, Do not show the bullies that you feel hurt if they do something that makes you uncomfortable; just walk off. Bullies gain satisfaction from making others feel hurt or uncomfortable, so giving them a reaction may only encourage them further. Instead, make them look silly by just leaving them to it, they'll find themselves shouting horrible things for no real reason.

, The tactic of not reacting to a bully may backfire initially, depending on the bully. Read the situation carefully. Some will feel safe tormenting you, as they enjoy that action itself, if they see that you aren't suffering from their actions. However, given a little time, such as days and weeks, most bullies will give up because your deadpan reaction becomes boring and they realize that they truly can't break you. Keep with it!

, Walk away with dignity, saying you have better things to do with your time. And mean it; fill your time with things you enjoy doing, as it serves as a great distraction and builds your talents instead of wasting time worrying about the meaningless taunts of unkind people.

, This step ties into the next, so be sure to read them both very carefully. A good way to end bullying is to catch them out. You catch out different bullies in different ways. Since you have already identified the type of bully (see above), you just need to identify the way to sort them out, as follows:


Aggressive bullies: Aggressive bullies are probably the scariest, however that doesn't mean that you shouldn't report them. Catching out an aggressive bully is also pretty easy. They'll probably be trying to hurt you as much as they can, leaving bruises and cuts everywhere. Simply show these bruises to an authority figure and you're sorted. Also, if you know that they always get you at a certain place, you could get that authority figure to hide and watch or get a close mate to hide and film it. Give the film to whoever you're reporting them to. Make sure they record it with your device. That way, they can't show other people because you have the footage.






Taunting bullies: To catch out a taunting bully, you could record them saying something mean with a sound recorder or phone. Simply keep the recorder hidden in a pocket while they shout mean things. Make sure the recorder is well hidden and don't accidentally say anything mean to them, as you could get into trouble too. When you go to report them, play the recording back. Try to get one with good sound quality so it can be easily heard by those you're asking for help from.






Cyber bullies: Cyber bullies send messages through texts or social network sites such as Facebook. If they're texting you, save the texts and show somebody. If they're bullying you online, you can do two things. The first thing is to save the messages then ask to log on and show the person that you're telling once you get to their office. The other, simpler, way, is to screenshot the mean messages and print them all off. That way, it can't go missing. Print a copy off for yourself too. Keep dates and times where possible, to verify the extent of the bullying behavior.







"
"
Report serious bullying to an authority figure.,
It is very important to learn self-defense.",How to Be Cool Without Being Bullied by Jealous People5," Consider your parents, school guidance counselor, principal, or someone else who can punish the bully and protect your safety. It's important that you talk to someone about your problem to get it to end. Do not worry about revenge that the bully may take if you report the incident; they will hurt you anyway and appeasing them doesn't solve your problem.


If there is a bullying survey in your school, always write your name down. Do not be embarrassed. You will probably start to talk to someone who is very experienced and this can be surprisingly helpful. You might want to talk to your Mom, Dad or guardian too. Remember: Never be embarrassed by your situation. You are a normal and good person and you're equal to everyone else.







, It is always better to use the bully's strength against them, rather than to attack. Should you need to fight, do so with all your strength, not half-heartedly. The defense courses will teach you to do this. There are many martial arts to choose from--pick yours and learn.


A quick kick in the groin will make the person feel dazed and look embarrassed long enough for an escape. Bullies aren't always used to others getting the best of them.






If the bully is grabbing you or pushing you, it's actually an advantage. Try real hard to keep your balance. Grab one of his or her arms with your left hand and hit his or her elbow with the other. Then, using your left hand, push away the remaining arms.






If the groin doesn't work, try the solar plexus (right below the ribs), or kick a knee to make the person trip.






Run and call for help.

, For example, let's say you want to get higher grades. Ask yourself what type of grades do you want. Let's say your goal is have a 90 GPA in the next marking period.

, In this case take this task one test at a time.

, By studying for that one test over a weeks time, you should get a very high grade, but like any high school student you don't just have one test.

, Study for the test from when you find out about the test(s) to the day before the test(s)this will let you study for multiple tests without causing too much stress.

, Set a time for study and time for play. Perhaps you like to do your homework/ studying in the morning. This lets you enjoy your weekend while also getting work done.

, If you don't do well on one test, don't get saddened. Try to do better on the next test.

, If you lack discipline this might be a hard task. Never give up and try to remember your original goal.

Stand back from everything at least once a day.,
Find a way of calming yourself that really works for you.,
Learn to view time as a whole rather than as something that is always running away from you.,
Give it up.,
Seek assistance.,
Go for a walk.",How to Manage Stress Under Time Constraints," When you feel as if things are out of control, it's easy to feel stressed. By standing back and taking stock of things, you can regain a sense of personal control, even if the deadlines and expectations are outside of your management purview. In taking stock, consider the following:


Prioritize. It's a cliché for good reason––sorting out what really is urgent from what others insist is urgent because they want it off their to-do list is important. Which items on your to-do list should be at the top, which can happily bubble along in the middle and which will be just fine if left until later? Prioritizing can bring you peace of mind but also alert you to potential time pressures that you may need to seek help with or change deadlines for.
Take the long view. Consider how things are supposed to pan out in the longer term. Then compare this to how you've handled similar events in the past. This is a way of helping yourself to recognize potential problems and to know that things will eventually turn out as they should, provided you stick to the fundamentals and follow through with these.
Communicate. If things appear to be overwhelming, talk to people who are in a position to alleviate the burden you're carrying. This may be a supervisor, a manager, a coworker, a fellow professional, another student, a friend, or anyone else who is relevant. Carrying the load alone may be at the heart of your stress. If you're in a position to delegate, consider doing it.;
, There is a range of de-stressing approaches available, including exercise, meditation, yoga, volunteering, prayer/reflection, mindfulness, therapy, taking a short break, participating in a hobby, and so forth. Find the approaches that work for you and include them in your day. If you feel guilty for making the time for this in place of whatever is causing you the pressure, remind yourself that you will be giving the task or outcome your full attention after you've calmed yourself and restored your sense of balance.


Consider meditating. Give yourself the company of only yours alone for at least 15 minutes. Several thoughts may conjure up in your mind, let them. When you think freely, you will feel relaxed. Talk with yourself. Call yourself silly or whatever, feel free.
Take a few minutes to think about all that you have been gifted with. Be grateful for all you have and how lucky you have been in life. When your attention is attracted towards the good things in your life, good things can be attracted to you because you're open to the opportunities when they present themselves. Of course, you need to make the effort to avail yourself of such opportunities!
Try introspection. Introspection is viewing yourself and analyzing what you find within. This can help you to realize what you have done which has made you feel stressed. Analyzing the root of your stress will usually also present you with the solution for dealing with it too. Telling yourself why you are stressed gives you the same feeling as you would get if you have solved the cause of stress.
Listen to music. Listening to songs can uplift your mood. Choose music that helps you to feel better.
Take deep breaths during the day. This can often give you quick relief and remind you to stand or sit up straight and to take a moment to regain your composure. Close your eyes and focus only on your breath. Take at least six seconds to complete one inhalation and exhalation. Doing this can help you to feel your mind becoming light and free.

, Time constraints are imposed upon everyone, in the workplace, at college and school, in sports and competitive environments and even at home due to the fact that time is viewed as limited. By seeing time as a whole, this can help you to see the longer term view and not just what is happening to you right now; view the past, the present and the future, see the linkages and remind yourself that everything is connected and that what matters is not so much making the most of the time in aid of someone else's deadline but in ensuring that your own skills, talents and self-expression are woven into the threads of time in meaningful ways. In other words, if you feel pressured by other people's demands and time limits on you, make time to fulfill what matters to you at least once every few days amid that chaos!


Schedule ""you time"" in a diary or calendar. Fight time running away from you by working with it, using appointment block-out times to go and do the things you care about, to be with the people you want to spend time with and to stop yourself from being overly engrossed in someone else's deadlines instead of attending to your own needs.

, Sometimes it reaches a point where the time constraints are not who you are. If you find that rushing about meeting urgent things all of your life, and that you are aging, ailing and chafing at the bit to throw a tantrum, your body is telling you to slow down. Regardless of the socially condoned impetus to keep working harder and push yourself harder, there is a need for a reality check at some point. Maybe the time constraints are something that don't fit with who you are anymore, and the stress is simply a warning signal that change is very much needed. Some things to think about include:


Is this time constrained job, study, outlet, experience, etc., really what you want at this point in your life? Remember that it may have worked for you initially but every person changes. Perhaps it isn't the right thing anymore.
Is your stress a symptom of you being a square peg trying to fit the proverbial round hole? If you tried one thing and threw yourself into it wholeheartedly, only to discover you're probably something else completely, why keep forcing yourself into that wrong hole? If you do, everything will stress you, not just time constraints but you will feel as if your life is fleeing from you.
Is it the workplace? In workplaces where people who ""can't cope"" are easily replaced with the next group of eager recruits, the pressure can be immense to work too hard and try to cover up the fact that you're not coping. If this fits your concerns, you could consider tackling the problem by raising the need for change (but this often comes with its own stress) or perhaps consider moving into an area or new job, or even demoting yourself, to work where the pressures are less. It's not a failure; it's looking after yourself.

, In some cases, an inability to manage stress under time constraints may be symptomatic of things you can change, with help. Perhaps getting help from someone who can teach you better ways to organize your work or studies will make a big change. Or, maybe getting counseling about managing lots of different things at once will help you.


Get plenty of sleep. Sleep deprivation can cause a lot of time perception problems and cause you to feel overwhelmed. If you're experiencing troubles with sleep, speak to your doctor first, who may be able to refer you to someone who specializes in sleep disorders. Remember that inability to sleep can be compounded by stress but it may have some other underlying cause too.

, Getting outside and simply walking is a wonderful way to shake off stress and clear your head. Get away from the office, the desk, the homework, the screaming kids. Give yourself a break outdoors, breathe in the fresh air and let your thoughts roam freely. A break such as this now and then will allow you to think freely.


Try for a beautiful environment wherever possible, such as a vibrant neighborhood, a museum district, the local park or a hike in the woods.

Arrange your home to facilitate calmness.,
Build a calm workspace.,
Take advantage of color and light.,
Get away from it all.",How to Live a Calm Life1," There are many things you can do to make your home a place of tranquility, even if you have a busy family life. Use interior design and organization to your advantage and give yourself a little breathing space at home.


Organize your entryway to reduce clutter. Being greeted with a mess as soon as you walk in the door is a recipe for stress. Give your shoes, umbrellas, and other everyday items a dedicated place near the door. They’ll be out of sight, and out of mind.
Dedicate a space for clutter, and try to confine it there. Keeping an entire house neat and tidy all the time is impractical, especially when children are involved. Instead, dedicate just one or two areas where everyone can drop their bags, pile up the mail, and so on.
Add a little music. Classical music, or other instrumental styles like jazz, can calm nerves and soothe tempers. The music should be slow and quiet to get that calming effect.Keeping a little ambient music going is a great way to keep an even keel.
Pamper your bedroom. You will spend up to a third of your life in bed: make sure your bedroom is a place of refuge. It’s the last place you see in the evening, and the first you encounter in the morning. Use comfortable bedding, with soft, high-thread count sheets to give yourself a good night’s rest, and consider a wake-up light as an alternative to a conventional alarm clock for a smoother start to your day.;
, You’ll probably spend a good portion of your waking hours at work, so it’s wise to build a soothing space there where possible. Workplaces vary widely, from offices to the outdoors, so tailor changes to suit your individual needs.


Reduce clutter and clear your work area of unnecessary items. This can help reduce distractions and keep you focused on the task at hand.
Keep it clean. Get rid of trash, stains, spots, and smells to reduce potential sources of displeasure. Just as with clutter, this will be an ongoing battle, so don’t let the cleaning itself become a distraction or source of stress. Regular maintenance is the key.
Post pictures of pleasant things. Photographs of your family, or of calming scenes, or places you’d like to visit can enhance your workday with reminders of what’s good in life and why you’re at work in the first place.
If you have your own office, shut the door. It will discourage visitors, keep out noise, and give you a sense of privacy and perhaps even isolation. If your job requires frequent collaboration with others, pick out brief periods of the day for some closed-door time before reopening to the world., Certain arrangement of color and lighting can have dramatic effects on your mood and productivity.Adjusting the shade, tone, and intensity of the decor around you is an under-appreciated way to maintain a peaceful environment.


Choose muted colors over bright ones. Bright tones can lead to anxiety, so softer shades are a better choice. Relatedly, use matte (non-reflective) rather than glossy tones to reduce reflections and distractions.Blues and lavenders are preferable for bedrooms and areas that should be calm and tranquil.Use recessed lighting and floor or desk lamps to create a sense of closeness. This also reduces the harsh light from bare, direct light bulbs. Install warm-white bulbs (check the packaging when you buy) to keep the tone soft. Bright-white bulbs can give off an industrial vibe and are harsh to look at.

, Spend time out in nature to calm yourself and recharge. Anything from a quick walk in the park, to an extended trek in the wilderness can be calming and restorative, especially if you spend most of your time in urban environments.


Take it slow. Get out in the outdoors, and take the time to soak in your surroundings. Watch clouds for a bit, or perhaps kick off your shoes and enjoy the feeling of grass between your toes.
Do a little photography while you’re out. If you come across a landscape that inspires you, capture the moment so you can come back to it later for a bit of restoration.
Engage with nature. If you’re so inclined, take up a hobby that requires active involvement with nature. Fly fishing, for example, requires both peaceful, relaxing motion and the willingness to understand the mechanics of rivers, lakes, and many forms of aquatic life. Rock climbing can take you to breathtaking views and some personal knowledge of geology. In any case, feeling closer to the natural world is a great way to de-stress and build a calm space in your life."

Establish a morning ritual.,
Be mindful of how you react to things.,
Don’t multitask.,
Get regular exercise.,
Get creative.,
Try yoga or meditation.,
Interrupt the fight-or-flight response.",How to Live a Calm Life2," A great way to reduce stress and turbulence is to develop reliable, repeatable systems for your everyday life that keep you centered and reduce stress. If your days get off to a frantic start, make a conscious effort to slow things down in the morning.Get up a little earlier, make coffee, and include calming activities like yoga, meditation, or something else that you find relaxing. Make it a part of your day, every day.Identify what you would like to accomplish each morning, then customize your ritual to give you the time to do those things without rushing or added stress., If you frequently find yourself getting worked up during everyday interactions, make it a habit to analyze your own responses.


If someone cuts you off in traffic, pause a moment instead of laying on the horn and consider if your response will help the situation, or merely add to your stress.

, Study after study shows that multitasking is a less-efficient way of getting things done than focusing on a single activity, and constantly diverting your attention between multiple things is a surefire way to maintain anxiety rather than calm.Simple changes like leaving your phone in another room, or turning off email notifications can remove common temptations for distraction.Having a prioritized to-do list helps. Focus on completing your most important task before moving on to others. Keep in mind that recreation, exercise, or family time can be a “task” — this isn’t only about work., Not only is it good for your health, it is also shown to reliably reduce stress levels.If you can integrate exercise into your routine, do so. Even 20 minutes of moderate exertion can do wonders for you.
You don’t have find time for the gym to get the benefits of exercise. Get out of your desk chair and take a walk. Take the stairs rather than the elevator.
Integrate soothing music or pleasant imagery into your post-exercise cool down. It will help maintain a sense of serenity as you get back to what you were doing., Creative activity, especially when you can work with your hands, is a fantastic way to keep your thoughts and days tranquil. You can lose yourself in your task, and gain a sense of accomplishment along the way.Woodworking, pottery, and knitting are great ways to engage your hands and mind in a focused, calming manner.
Others find similar solace in art, be it painting, sculpture, or even writing.
The kitchen can also be a place for creative handiwork. Baking, cooking, and even more specialized tasks like brewing can be great outlets for stress and creativity., The health benefits of both yoga and meditation are numerous and well-documented. Both endeavor to give you peace of mind and reduce stress, and yoga can also enhance your strength and flexibility.Yoga engages your parasympathetic nervous system, prompting a “relaxation effect.”Both yoga and meditation have the added benefit of being relatively simple to do just about anywhere. Try a few simple poses in a free moment at work, or in your bedroom just after your rise in the morning to help smooth out your day., Your body’s instinctive reaction to stress and danger, the “fight-or-flight” response, is a fine evolutionary adaptation, but one not always well-suited to a calm, modern life, free from the dangers of wild animals and hostile hunter-gatherers. Luckily, there are ways to mitigate this occasionally unwanted reaction.


Reflect on your feelings. This sounds cliche, but the simple act of identifying feelings of panic, stress, fear, or anxiety can interrupt the neurological processes of fight-or-flight and help you redirect your energy usefully.Focus on your breathing. When you find tension or even panic rising, focus on taking deep breaths. This cuts down on the instinctive tendency toward shallow, quick breaths and engages your autonomic nervous system, which usually controls your body’s physiological responses without your conscious input.Finally, re-label the feelings you identified previously to make them more positive. Recast your panic as excitement, or your frustration as ambition and you can regain control of your body’s stress response, lowering your heartbeat, respiration, and sweating.

Learn how to calm someone who’s upset.,
Defuse an angry situation before it escalates.,
Use kindness and humility.",How to Live a Calm Life3," Inevitably, someone around you, be it a friend, co-worker, or family member, is going to get upset, and this is likely to disrupt things for everyone around them.


Use the E.A.R. method to settle the situation.Empathy — Show the other person that you understand he is upset with statements like, “I can see how upset you are,” or “I understand that you are feeling frustrated,” and indicate your willingness to help him.

Attention — Ask him to explain the problem and listen attentively. “Tell me what’s bothering you. I want to understand.” Body language can help you here as well. Make eye contact with him and sit or lean forward slightly to show your attentiveness.

Respect — People, especially those prone to conflict, often need to feel respected when they’re upset. Acknowledge this as best you can with statements like: “I respect your commitment to this,” or, “I can tell you’ve put in a great deal of effort here and it shows.” , Someone who is very angry may not be receptive to discussion until she has had a chance to cool down. You can help this process along by redirecting her anger and acting appropriately to reduce the level of tension.


First, try to communicate respect for her needs or concerns. Acknowledge their importance, and refrain from openly judging them. Try to do this with non-aggressive body language by not moving quickly or taking an aggressive, chest-out posture.Cooperate with the angry person, so long as it does not cause harm to others. The objective is to not escalate the situation any further. Effective listening will help here too. Don’t interrupt her, but take the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, both to avoid misunderstanding and to slow things down.Redirect her aggression by rephrasing her concerns in a less confrontational manner.Restate, “I want to beat Janet with a pipe,” as, “So, you are upset with Janet for scratching the paint on your car and want her to make it right.” This, when successful, can leave the person calmer and more open to a constructive discussion of her problem.
Disengage yourself from the interaction if your efforts are not working or you find yourself getting angry as well. Your safety is paramount, and you should get away from the person, and call security, a supervisor, or the police as appropriate., Research shows that being humble and kind to others can materially improve your relationships at home, at work, and socially. Being good to others, it turns out, can be good for you as well.


Being kind to others can make you physically and mentally healthier, an NIH study has found.Humility — a willingness to self-critique — can also help repair damaged relationships.Kindness is also linked to happiness. Acts of charity and kindness release dopamine and endorphins in your brain, giving a chemical element to your happiness."

So put those clothes away, mop up the floors, and dust those blinds. This is the first step of getting rid of that stress.;
, When you're stressed, it's easy to let important things pass you by quickly. Write down the most basic to the top priority of things you need done. (ex. brush-teeth, eat breakfast, complete English assignments, bathe the dog, etc.)

, Get all assignments done before they build up.

, Get off the internet, get off that TV and enjoy the beauty of nature. Even if it's cold and raining (then, you may want to bring a jacket), get some fresh air.

, If you work online or go to online school, this could be difficult for you. However, you want to limit as much time as you can on the internet. Of course you need some entertainment, but over 30 minutes of pure ""nothingness"" on the internet is not healthy. You'll waste so much time and not even be aware of it. Stay off that net!

, Music is mental medication and it can get you that jump start in the morning that you need to start the day.

, Coffee and energy drinks work great for keeping you awake temporarily. However, they can cause unhealthy effects on your body. They both contain caffeine which can make anyone more anxious throughout the day, suppress your appetite, and interrupt sleep patterns.

, Get strong and do some weightlifting, have a healthy heart and work that cardio everyday. Exercising is great for getting rid of that stress, so make sure you do it. Also, it doesn't count if you don't break a sweat.

, Talk to your girlfriend, sister, best-friend, therapist, or your dog. Just talk

, Go out to a movie, mall or a park. Do something that makes you feel good.

, Take care of your body. Don't smoke anything, don't drink a full cup of alcohol often (yes, including wine). Make water your main beverage and drink it at least 5 times a day. Try to be only around positive people. Stay away from those racist, sexist, homophobic, and ethnocentric, unfriendly, negative, jealous people. They have issues and will try to bring you down with them. Don't try to argue with the stupid. Don't argue with family. Spend time with your pets. Laugh. Go out with your friends or family. Be selfish for once and buy yourself a bundle of roses or a nice watch. Appreciate the person you are. Get plenty of rest.

However, you can avoid having a meltdown if you step away and take a moment for yourself. If presented with bad news that is overwhelming, you can say “Excuse me for a moment,” and step away to a restroom or private space to get your thoughts together, cry, or collect yourself.;
, When you are beginning to feel upset or overwhelmed, calm yourself through some deep breathing exercises. Breathe in deeply for 5 seconds through your nose and then exhale slowly from your mouth. Do so until you can feel calm again., In addition to focusing on staying calm, it is important that you talk about your feelings. Talk to your friends and family who know about the situation and who are compassionate and empathetic. Avoid allowing your negative feelings to fester.For instance, if you are going through a divorce, you might reach out to your close friends or to your parents. Call them when you are having a rough day.

, In dealing with this time of difficulty, your thoughts and feelings might be a mess in your mind. However, you can begin to sort these out through documenting your thoughts on paper. If you don’t know where to start, begin by writing out what you did that day. Write how you’re feeling in the moment and any highs and lows of the day.


Pour out your feelings about the trauma on paper rather than letting them run wild.

, During this difficult time, though you may be on the verge of falling apart every day, work to keep your emotions in check until the appropriate moment. Schedule time each day to think about the issue, cry, and truly feel the intensity of the situation. Scheduling time will allow you to process your emotions while also not spending too much time being down in the dumps.


Consider scheduling an hour or two per day for this.

, During this time, you might not be feeling very social, but being reclusive will likely make the difficult time you are facing all the more lonely for you. Schedule time each week to spend with friends and family. Try not to make all of your interactions about the hardship you are facing.Make plans to do fun things like going to the movies, concerts, festivals, or the beach.
Don’t turn your friends down when they try to make plans with you.

, It can also be tempting to spend all of your free time consumed with thoughts of your difficulties, but try to avoid this. Fill at least some of your free time with activities so that you can get away for a bit in your mind. Do things like listening to music albums, watching new TV shows, or going shopping.If your time of difficulty is financially related, consider getting a part-time job or not indulging in costly activities.

, It is critical that you take care of yourself so that you can function at your maximum capacity. Take some time each day to engage with your spiritual side. Spend some time in prayer or meditation.You might meditate on words like “Peace” or “Strength” to help calm and strengthen you.

, Be sure that you are also attending to your physical needs. The average person needs around eight hours of sleep per night, but you might need a bit more if you are feeling mentally exhausted in the midst of your trauma. Get on a set sleep schedule and aim for nine hours when possible.Practice good sleep habits so that you will be able to go to sleep easier, like taking a hot bath or cutting out caffeine after noon.

, In addition to sleep, be sure that you are eating foods that will help keep you energized and healthy. Avoid foods high in fat or sugar, as they may make you feel sluggish and even more depressed. Opt instead for fruits, veggies, lean meats, and water., Exercise can be a wonderful stress relief in difficult times. Many doctors recommend this as a form of treatment to patients who are dealing with anxiety or depression. Take some time each day to visit your local gym, run around your block, or do some at home exercises with friends.Yoga is a great way to work out while incorporating meditation.

, Perhaps you have recently lost your mother and some coworkers have made some insensitive comments to you during this time. Avoid people who make you feel worse about your situation. If they are your coworkers report them to your boss, if necessary.Avoid any friends who have been selfish or unfeeling to you during this time, as well.

, Take care of yourself professionally and academically, as well. Though you should try to keep up with all of your responsibilities as much as it is possible for you, don’t take on any new work if you can help it.

, Though it is vital to cope with the issue and take care of yourself, at some point, you will have to begin addressing your feelings and creating some possible solutions to the stress. In creating these fixes, first consider what you would advise a friend if this were happening to them. Use these thoughts to guide you in developing your own response.For instance, perhaps you have recently lost your job. You may have had a friend lose their job a few months ago, who you told to update their resume, reach out to their contacts, and use those connections to find a new job. Work to apply these tips to your own life.

, Write a list of everything you can do to either fix the issue or provide some relief to yourself. For instance, if you have a child who has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, you might want to create a list of things that you can do to make their final months as wonderful as possible. You may also want to consider getting a second or third opinion., Once you have figured out everything that you need to do to move forward, put your plan into action. Having a plan can help you feel much more calm and assured than if you are without one.For instance, if you have recently lost your home due to flooding, you might contact your insurance company, FEMA, or any other agency tasked with assisting people in these kinds of emergencies.

, Remember that it is okay to seek help. Your friends and family will often be eager to help you. If you need a little money, help finding a job, help figuring out what to do, or just emotional support in general, reach out to them for this.You might say something like “Aunt Jenny, I know you know that I have recently fallen on tough times and I was wondering if you could give me a bit of money to tide me over until I get back on my feet. I can pay you back or work for you for free.”

, Sometimes, the issues you are facing may seem to heavy for you to deal with alone or even with the help of family and friends. Perhaps you don’t really have any family or friends to rely on. Though you should try to expand this network of support, it is important to take care of yourself in the moment. If you feel that you need a bit of professional help, don’t hesitate to find a therapist in your area. They will be able to help you talk through your problems and provide you with some coping strategies moving forward.

You may feel you are locked into your job, your relationship, and your career path. You may be living on “autopilot” rather than living to the fullest. Acknowledging that you are feeling trapped can be the first step to overcoming your crisis.For example, maybe you have been stuck at the same frustrating job for three years. Or perhaps you feel trapped by an unhappy relationship that you have been trying to work through for too long. Identify what is making you feel trapped so you can address it.;
, In the second phase, you may feel like you need take some time away from everything. You may decide you need to get out of your situation, such as by getting a new job or changing to a different school. Use this time to take a timeout, and reconsider your life goals and plans before you make any big decisions.Try to avoid making any hasty decisions and instead give yourself some time to think. For example, instead of quitting your job, you could use some of your vacation days or ask to have your hours cut down. Instead of switching to a different school, you could take a semester off to think about what you really want to do and where you would like to go.

, You may then shift into the third phase, where you start to consider the possibility that you can change the course of your life. Free of the element that is making you feel trapped, you may be able to start thinking about how you would like to change your life.Once you get used to the idea of change, you can make the choice to redirect your life. This will help you tackle your crisis head on and be willing to take some risks to see positive change.

, Once you have worked through the first three phases of your quarter life crisis, you can start to consider making new commitments and new goals. You should focus on personal development during this time to help you overcome the crisis. You may be ready to take actionable steps to make a shift in your life.Getting to the fourth phase of your crisis may take time, especially if you are dealing with the emotional upheaval of leaving a job or a relationship that you were in for a long time. Once you get to this phase, you should be ready and willing to make new commitments and goals for yourself.

, Making a list of what your strengths and assets are may help you as you start thinking about your life goals. Try writing down everything that you or other people think you are good at. Your strengths and assets can be things like technical skills, special knowledge, or personality traits.


For example, you might list that you are good at building computers, you know a lot about movies, or you are good at interacting with people. List anything that you think you are good at as well as anything that someone else has complimented you on.

, Start by doing a serious self-assessment of your personal passions. Ask yourself, what do you like? What do you dislike? What types of activities inspire you and motivate you? Try to write down detailed answers to these questions and identify your personal passions.Keep in mind your passions may change as you experience more and grow as a person. But considering your main passions can help you get a better sense of your ideal career path.
For example, you may list personal passions like ""working with young people"", ""mentoring and teaching"", and ""learning new skills"".
You may take self-assessment tests on Livecareer.com to help determine your personal passions and goals.

, Think about what you wanted to do when you were in grade school. Often, passions can be detected at a very young age. This can help you tell the difference between an “interest” and a “passion.”


Think about what you always wanted to be, but told yourself you couldn’t. For instance, if you always wanted to go into a risky career, but everyone talked you out of it, take a second look at this passion. Now that you’re a bit older, can you come up with a better plan on how you can achieve your dreams?
For instance, if you always wanted to be a writer, but your parents actively discouraged it, see if you can get a part-time job first, or go back to school to earn a degree, like a master of fine arts for creative writing. You can also make a plan on how you are going to support yourself until your passion career takes off.

, Try to picture what you will do for work, where you will work, and perhaps who you will be with. Write down a detailed image of your future self. Ask yourself, where do I see myself in five years? What type of life do I want to have?You can also help yourself visualize your ideal career by asking yourself, What am I good at? What do I love?, and What does the world need? Considering the needs of others could help you visualize what you would like to do in the future.You should write down detailed answers to these questions. You can then use this vision of your future self to help you set realistic goals that you can address now.
For example, you may write down, “I love to work with young people, especially teenagers. I am good at teaching young people new skills and I love science. I think the world might need another high school science teacher who is dedicated to the job.”

, Create a list of realistic goals, using your strengths and assets, passions, and your image of your future self as guides. Include a timeline of when you would like to achieve these goals. Keep the timelines realistic and intentional, as you will be more likely to achieve your goals if they seem attainable.For example, you may write down, “Talk to a science high school teacher to get feedback on the job in the next two months. Consider applying for teacher’s college by June.”

, Try to avoid comparing yourself to other people, especially friends and peers in your age group. Only you can determine your purpose and use your purpose to get over your crisis.Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram can make it seem like everyone is living their dream life, but these sites are often designed to only show the good side of people’s daily lives. Remember that everyone struggles with their own issues and problems, even if their social media account say otherwise. Try not to compare or measure yourself against other people’s lives or goals because basing your goals on these views may lead to a perspective that is skewed, not realistic.
You may also have lots of friends who are having children and getting married during this phase of your life. Be accepting and supportive of their choices but do not feel you have to make the same choices as them. You may not be at a place in your life where you are contemplating marriage or children and that's okay.

, Also, consider your current personal relationships and how meaningful they are to you. Try to surround yourself with positive individuals who have their own life goals and appear motivated in their lives. Being around people who have a sense of direction could help you get a better sense of your own goals and life direction.


You may feel a lot of social pressures during your quarter life crisis and this could contribute to your crisis getting worse. Try to cultivate personal relationships that offer you a sense of support and guidance, rather than a sense of pressure or anxiety. Your friendships and romantic relationships should make you feel encouraged and empowered.

, Along with your new career goals, you may want to evaluate your personal life and how well it is syncing up with what you envision for yourself. This may include relationships, where you live, and other personal matters as well. Think about the things that you would like to accomplish in your personal life and how you can alter your trajectory to accomplish those things.


For example, if you are single and want to get married, then you might consider joining an online dating website or letting your friends set you up with their husbands’ guy friends.
If you want to work through some personal issues, then you might set up an appointment with a therapist to begin that process.
If you want to have children, then you might start taking steps in that direction, such as by talking with your partner, meeting with your doctor to assess your health, or looking into adoption.

, Once you have identified your passions and goals, consider how you can turn them into a prospective career. You may start by making a list of prospective career fields that may speak to your interests and skills.You may want to review a list of prospective careers based on your interests and skills to get an idea of your options. You can search online for prospective careers and review a list of careers that relate to a particular interest or skill.

, Do some research on your goal career to determine if you need more training or education, and if so, what level of training. Then, consider how you would acquire the training or education necessary to qualify for your goal career.For example, if you have decided to pursue a career in teaching high school science, you may need to apply for teacher’s college or a teaching degree at an accredited university. You may also need to apply for loans or work to raise enough money to afford going to school for your teaching degree.
You may also need to improve on your existing skills and abilities to attain your goal career. If you are going for a career as a high school science teacher, perhaps you are strong in science but you lack a lot of experience working with young people. You may then volunteer as a tutor or a mentor for young people to get more experience in this area.

, You can also lean on the support of others around you to get some perspective on your options. Try talking to family members, close friends, former colleagues from school, and peers at work. Ask them how they found their direction and how they developed their career goals. You may try to talk it out with them to determine your own career goals.You can also reach out to individuals who are currently working in the field you are interested in. You may ask them for advice and guidance, as well as mentorship on your career.

, Try to form new relationships with people as part of your life goals. This is especially important if you feel your current relationships are not helping you feel supported and are only adding to your life crisis. Cultivating new relationships can help you feel you are moving into a new phase in your life and help you recover from your crisis.You may reach out to a new person at work who seems positive and interesting to you. Or you may broaden your dating pool to outside your immediate friend group to try to meet new people and form relationships with different people.

, Draw out an action plan that you can follow and adjust as needed. You may plot out each step you need to take to achieve your career goal, along with set times for when you achieve each step. Then, put the action plan somewhere you can see and study it on a daily basis.For example, you may write down “Apply to teacher’s college by June. Speak to a mentor about improving my skills. Volunteer with young people at the tutoring center.”

, Try to put your action plan to work so you can overcome your crisis. You may want to take the action plan one step at a time so you do not feel overwhelmed or stressed out.You may also reach out to others around you for support so you can implement your action plan to the fullest. Getting encouragement and support from others may help you stay on track and work through your crisis.

, Though change and new goals can help you get over your crisis, you can also try to focus on finding new ways to enjoy the life you have. You may focus on all the things you have to be thankful for, such as your health, your proximity to your family and friends, and your education. These things are not a given for everyone and appreciating what you have can help you realize you are stronger and more viable as a person than your crisis would have you believe."

Be the good role model they need.,
Establish daily routines.,
Look out for mental illness and/or PTSD: A common effect of becoming a child refugee is developing a mental illness or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).,
Encourage your child to talk about what has happened.,
Send your child to school.,
Learn your new local language, if applicable.,
Help them build relationships.,
Help them develop good problem solving skills and coping mechanisms.,
Be reassuring.,
Never forget, but be optimistic.",How to Help Your Child Cope with Being a Child Refugee," As a parent, you lead by example. Therefore, it is essential that the examples you set for your child are positive.


Be sure to take care of yourself. Put your physical health first by eating proper meals, sleep as needed, etc. your child will take note of your healthy habits and pick them up as well, keeping themselves healthy. You should also avoid taking drugs, drinking alcohol, or resorting to other hazardous ‘outlets’ to feel better.
You shouldn’t forget the importance of good mental health, either. Whether you realize it or not, your child takes emotional cues from you. If you present yourself as anxious, scared, angry, or sad, your child will mimic your emotions, feeling that there is a good reason to be feeling that way. Therefore, remaining calm and optimistic will give your child reason to do so as well.
This is not to say that you should keep all negative feelings bottled up; you should definitely speak to others about how you feel (this will teach your child that being connected, socializing, and having healthy relationships with others is beneficial and that it is okay to trust others); just don’t dwell on these negative feeling to much because your child might do the same.;
, While child refugees are migrating/seeking asylum (looking for a country to legally accept them to live in their country), their daily routines are disturbed. Some lose siblings, parents, as well as other relatives and friends. Their homes are destroyed, or they may now be living with a physical disability. Establishing daily routines once again can offer a child comfort.


Try to make this new routine as close to your child's old daily routine as possible while making sure there is time for you and your child to speak, connect, and communicate feelings. Daily routines can include getting them back into school, and finding a place to live as soon as possible. Set a bed time, shower/bath time, etc. Knowing what to expect throughout the day gives children a sense of familiarity and they will find comfort in stable daily routines again.

, According to the Refugee Health Technical Assistance Center, child refugees are actually at higher risk of developing mental illnesses in comparison to adult refugees. An estimated 10-40% of adult refugees suffer from PTSD and 5-15% suffer from major depression - - while about 50-90% of child refugees suffer from PTSD and 6-40% suffer from major depression.


These mental illnesses may develop for many reasons. Perhaps your child lives in constant worry/fear that another catastrophe may occur, witnessed the death of a loved one, lost their home, barely escaped death, etc. signs and symptoms of PTSD and other mental illnesses include: intrusive memories, negative changes in thinking and mood, irritability, trouble concentrating and sleeping, etc.If you suspect that your child has developed PTSD or another mental illness, please seek the help of a medical professional.

, Your child cannot keep everything bottled up inside. Children need some sort of outlet or opportunity to talk about what happened, what they went through, and how they feel about it. Try to ask your child if they would like to speak about what happened and communicate your own feelings with them. Have thoughtful conversations with them and be sure to remain empathetic.


It is extremely important that you pay attention to your child's concerns and emotions. Let them know that the way they feel is completely normal, and that you feel the same way they do about many things. Through these conversations, your child will be able to speak about what they went through with more ease in the future, and the most important part- your child will feel that they are heard and important.

, One of the most effective ways of helping your child cope with the struggles of being a child refugee is the opportunity to go to school. Your child may even have to learn a new language, which is actually proven to lower the chances of developing PTSD. In school, your child can make new friends and learn to build normal and healthy friendships. They can continue their education- which is obviously very important- and feel as if they are living a normal childhood once again.

, As previously mentioned, while learning a new language can be very beneficial to children, under certain circumstances, it can cause even more stress for them. If you yourself do not learn the first language of the new region you live in, your child can become your primary translator.


In addition to the burden they carry with them every day (whether that be memories of war, natural disasters, death, mental illness, physical disabilities, etc.) and school work, they have to help you pay your bills, do paperwork, read, write, navigate new technology, speak to others for you, etc. You will also gain the ability to help them with homework. Learning this new language will take a huge load off of your child and allow him/her to live more of a normal childhood.

, Strong relationships are inarguably important to a person's wellbeing. For child refugees, these relationships are especially important, as they need as much emotional support as possible. Their friends can offer advice about how to cope with their struggles and take their mind off those struggles through play or conversation. Make some friends yourself and teach by example that it is fine to confide in others and look to good friends for support and positivity. In the end, this will boost their overall mental health and happiness.

, As a parent, you should promote good ways to cope and solve problems. Through conversation and example, you should push your child to develop ideas of how to cope with any stress or negative feelings.


Options can include reading books, writing, watching a favourite show or movie, playing a game, listening to music, going for a walk, exercise, etc. Ask your child what makes them feel better when they are sad and tell them to do that whenever they feel stressed, anxious, etc. Your child will continue to carry this advice with him/her for the rest of his/her life, improving overall happiness and satisfaction with life itself.

, Your child is most likely afraid/worried that something like this will happen again. One of the most important things you can do for your child is reassure them that everything is going to be alright. As previously said, if your do not have a reason to worry, neither do they. Remind your child that you made it this far together and that each passing day will become progressively better. Speak to your child about past wars, natural disasters, etc. Discuss how the community returned to its normal self, and the people surpassed every obstacle, recovered, and are now living normal and happy lives again.

, Of course, you could never forget whatever horrendous event changed your life forever- and you shouldn't try to. Try to look at what happened in a positive, and new light.


Encourage your child to remember how it changed your lived for the better. Maybe it brought you closer together, perhaps it made you both stronger as people, or maybe your new home brought new and better opportunities. This mentality is something that your child will carry with them forever, allowing them to appreciate even the worst of days and look at each moment in a positive way.

Teens are not only encountering changes in their bodies and minds, but also must deal with greater responsibility at home and at school. Consider these possible causes for your teenage daughter's stress:school work
parental expectation to perform well academically and athletically
self-esteem issues
lack of sleep
sibling rivalry
dating
physical changes in appearance
onset/ coping with menstruation
psychological changes
being unprepared
peer pressure;
, Everyone feels stressed at some point. Having trouble focusing or concentrating, feeling nervous or anxious, experiencing changes in her sleep and eating patterns, and procrastinating are all indicators that your child may be overly stressed. Your child may also neglect responsibilities and feel tired often.Stress may also show up in your child's perceptions of herself. She may say things like ""I'm stupid"", ""No one likes me"" or ""I hate my body/face/thighs"". Take note of these statements and strive to help your child see herself how you see her.

, In some cases, stressors may be affecting the whole family, such as a move to another state or a divorce. Try to be understanding and empathetic to your children even if you, too, are having a hard time. Think of stress like a backpack with a few bricks inside. You attempt to walk up a big hill carrying the backpack. Even though the weight of the backpack doesn't change, the load becomes harder to bear over time. Stress works the same way.Chronic or prolonged stress can take a toll on your child's (and yours) overall functioning and even make her sick. Researchers have linked stress to increased anxiety, hypertension, headaches, heart disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity., As you aim to help your child cope with stress, go all the way back to how you felt at her age. Although you may not have dealt with the same life experiences, it can still be helpful if you try to remember what it's like to be in her shoes. If you'd like, you may even approach the topic by sharing an anecdote about a difficult experience that you got through at her age.

, Teens are faced with incredible social pressures. The internet, TV, social networks, all cause teens to compare themselves to one another. Your teen may be overwhelmed because she has not yet discovered her natural strengths and abilities. If you helped her uncover these characteristics, she might feel more capable of managing in everyday life.


Remind your child of something she's good at. For instance, if she's a musician, you might tell her how amazed you are at her discipline and patience to learn a piece. If she does community service you can highlight her giving and compassionate nature.

, Parents often make the mistake of lecturing to their kids when they make mistakes or experience setbacks. Remember that although you may be disappointed, your child probably is, too. Offer support rather than nagging or guilt-trips. Your teen will appreciate this tactic, and maybe even open up more to you.Talking with your daughter means engaging in a give and take conversation in which you both are able to express thoughts and share ideas. Starting such a conversation should begin with a statement that opens your daughter up to talking, rather than a question that often intimidates teens. Try to use phrases that your teen would use or be receptive to.
Say something like, ""Soccer practice seems to be really kicking your butt"" or ""Your math study guide makes me think the test will be really hard"". Then, stay silent to see if you daughter is willing to open up to you about what's stressing her.

, On occasion, you might have caught yourself distracted or not really paying attention when your child is talking. Many teens clam up and avoid sharing with their parents. If your daughter does this, it may be because she does not feel heard. Tips for actively listening to your teen include:Give her your full attention. Save important discussions for a time when you will not be interrupted. Put away your phone and turn off the TV.
Give her eye contact but sit/stand beside her if possible. Sometimes, adolescents are intimidated by face-to-face conversations. Aim to hold conversations while you both are cooking, cleaning, or performing other activities to ease any intimidation.
Reflect her emotions. If your child is sad, your face should exhibit concern. If she is happy, your face should be filled with joy or excitement. Try to match your expressions with her emotional presentation.
Be mindful of your body language. Just as face-to-face contact can be intimidating, so can a parent with crossed arms and a sneer. Sit/stand with your arms at your sides with a relaxed posture and oriented in her direction.

, While your child is talking, refrain from 'parenting' or trying to tell her what to do; just offer her a listening ear. When she's done talking you might ask, ""Would you like me to offer some advice, or were you really just needing to talk?"" If your child asks for advice at this time, offer it in a gentle and nonjudgmental manner., If your teen opens up and shares something really personal with you, thank her for showing vulnerability. Tell her that you appreciate her opening up and being honest, and reassure her that the discussion will stay between the two of you (with exception of telling the other parent). Stick to your word and avoid telling siblings, grandparents, or friends sensitive material your daughter has shared with you.

, Consider this quote: ""Children close their ears to advice, but open their eyes to example"". You can tell your teenage daughter again and again what she needs to do to appropriately cope with stress, but your example will motivate her to do them. Sure enough, you can model healthy behaviors and still have your daughter choose unhealthy behaviors. However, modeling is a great way to practice what you preach.Be cautious of how your respond to stress in front of your teenage daughter. Do you fly off the handle when you are frustrated? If you do, she might inadvertently pick up this behavior.
Take the time to identify and manage your own feelings, and your child will have a great model for emotional responsibility in her home.
Modeling healthy behaviors also involves watching how you speak about your body or others' bodies. Teen girls frequently develop negative body images due to references they hear at home. Strive to foster an environment that focuses on loving your body (and your daughter's) for all it does, instead of how it looks or how much it weighs., Just as businesses often do, you can create a phrase that builds your child's self-confidence and reminds her of where she comes from. This could be displayed somewhere in your home, or simply repeated to your children so that they understand the family values. Such a motto also gives her something to ground herself with during stressful times.


Examples for a family motto include ""Try, try again"", ""Return with honor"", or ""Work hard and be grateful."", Regular exercise can help your teen manage stress, improve cognitive functioning (i.e. better focusing and concentration at school), and fend off depression. In an age when American teens and adults spend a fair amount of their time in sedentary behaviors - watching TV, browsing the internet, or playing addictive games on smart phone - it is extremely important to plan in exercise.Ask your teen to choose from a few active extracurricular activities that she may be interested in. Recommendations may include gymnastics, soccer, track, basketball, dance, or swimming.
You can also reinforce these healthy behaviors by adopting a few family activities to enjoy together. Go for hikes on the weekend, ride bikes as a group, or play tag in your backyard.

, Food can have a surprising impact on your daughter's mood and susceptibility to stress. What's more, teenagers often react to stress by engaging in unhealthy behaviors like bingeing on junk food or drinking alcohol. Clear the pantry of processed foods with refined carbohydrates and empty calories (sodas, snack cakes, potato chips). Provide plenty of complex carbs like fruits, veggies, and whole grains with lean meats, eggs, and nuts.Caffeine can exacerbate stress, but teens often turn to it to get through finals or long nights of studying. Encourage your teen to drink more water and avoid excessive amounts of caffeine, especially later in the afternoon as it affects sleep.

, When your teenage daughter's schedule is jam-packed with activities and projects, sleep may be the first thing to go. However, sleep is essential in stress management, and it helps her body to stimulate hormones for growth, appetite, muscle repair, and memory consolidation.Missing out on sleep hurts overall health and development.


Talk to your daughter about cutting down on some of her obligations if they are detracting from her getting enough sleep. Cut off the television and electronic devices a few hours before bed, and limit caffeine. She should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of shut-eye each night., Having a crammed schedule is one culprit to your child's stress. Purchase a planner so that she can write down all of her activities and become better organized. Talk with her and see if she needs to give up some activities so that she has enough time to relax and sleep. A planner can also help your daughter stay on top of homework and tests, since forgetting assignments or procrastinating could also be a source of her stress., Writing all her thoughts and feelings down on paper can be a terrific way for your daughter to unload and debrief during stressful periods in her life. Visit a stationery store and have her select a journal or diary that appeals to her. Encourage her to write daily to get the most out of this activity.In addition to allowing her to unload problems and concerns, regular journaling can also help your daughter recognize patterns of stress. Perhaps she constantly feels stressed near the end of each week because she has saved all her assignments to the last minute. Or, maybe she is really stressed during her special time of the month, so she needs to engage in regular self-care and monitoring to get her through these times.
As your daughter picks up on patterns of behavior, journaling can also be a great way for her to problem-solve ways to fight stress and improve her mood.

, Teens are going through many changes and taking on greater responsibility. However, amidst schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and chores, your child should still schedule in time to relax and have fun.


Encourage your child to participate in a hobby that she enjoys (one that you will not pressure her about) and allow her regular opportunities to spend time with friends. Make an effort to provide frequent family nights where the whole family can let their hair down and have a good time.

Help them set goals.,
Treat your loved one with understanding.,
Listen to your loved one.,
Be patient.,
Discourage negative talk.,
Encourage them to stay active.,
Help promote a healthy routine.",How to Help Loved Ones with a Stress Response Syndrome2," Stress response syndrome is a short-term illness. This means that is it important for your loved one to set short-term goals as they deal with the disorder and receive treatment. Your loved one may come up with goals in therapy, but if not, help them set goals on their own.Goals may be about reaching out to friends and family, using coping skills learned in therapy, or implementing stress relieving techniques.
For example, you may help your loved one make a goal to call or text a family member or friend at least once a day. Another goal may be to do yoga four times each week.
Try asking your loved one, ""What goals do you have? How about you make a goal to reach out to one family member at least once a day?""

, You may not understand what your loved one is going through. You may not understand how they cannot cope with what happened, especially if you have experienced a similar situation; however, your loved one is coping with the major life event in a very different way than you. This is okay — people respond to things in different ways. You should be understanding of how your loved one is reacting.Don’t judge your loved one for their inability to “get over it.” Your loved one won’t just suddenly move on. It will take them awhile to process and move on. Remind your loved one that you love them and support them.
For example, you may say, ""I know you went through a major life change. I understand you are having difficulty dealing with this. I am here for you.""

, One thing your loved one might need is a listening ear. Since stress response syndrome occurs after a major life change or stressor, your loved one may need to talk to someone about what has happened. Offer to let your loved one talk to you if they need to.Your loved one may need to talk about the event multiple times as they work through the feelings and process the change or what has happened.
Tell your loved one, “I am here if you need to talk. I will listen without judgment.”

, Though most cases of stress response syndrome are overcome within six months, this may not be everyone’s experience. Your loved one may have a harder time getting over the stress than someone else. Be patient with your loved one as they go through the recovery process. Don’t try to speed them up or tell them they aren’t trying hard enough. Let them recover at their own pace.If your loved one already has depression or an anxiety disorder or a substance abuse problem, they may take longer to recover or develop related mental disorders.
Tell your loved one, ""Take your time to recover. Don't compare yourself to other people. You are recovering at your own pace.""
If their symptoms persist for longer than six months, they may have generalized anxiety or some other diagnosis like a panic disorder that will need to be evaluated by their therapist and psychiatrist.

, People suffering from stress response syndrome may feel hopeless, depressed, and like nothing will ever get better. This may lead them to talk negatively about themselves and life. Try to discourage this kind of talk by reminding your loved one that they will get past this and be fine.For example, you may say, “I understand you feel this way because of what you went through; however, remember that this is only temporary and you will be fine.”

, Stress response syndrome may cause your loved one to want to spend a lot of time alone and do nothing. Encourage your loved one to see their friends and family and to stay active. You may want to ask your loved one to do things with you to get them out of their house or to help them do something active.Help your loved one get back into their favorite hobby, or help them find a new hobby to get involved in.
You may suggest that you and your loved one go to dinner, go to a movie, take a class together, or go for a walk. If the person is your partner, suggest a romantic outing or date night.
Try saying, ""Let's go have dinner at your favorite place,"" or, ""Why don't we meet a few friends for a movie?""

, Another way to help your loved one recovery from the major life event is through healthy routines. This includes regular exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. This can help your loved one deal with the stress and negative physical symptoms.Healthy eating means that you incorporate all food groups into your daily meal. Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, lean protein, and complex carbohydrates. Refrain from eating processed food, refined sugar, and simple carbohydrates.
According to the President Council on Fitness Sports and Nutrition, you should try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week. This can include brisk walking, jogging, bicycling, gardening, lifting weights, or dancing.
Your loved one should try to get seven to nine hours of sleep every night.

Be sure to celebrate the big things, such as people building houses and shelters for homeless people, as well as small things such as people going out of their way to be kind to strangers. Light and beauty includes your hobbies, too.

Anesthetize the area.,
Make the incision.,
Place a drainage tube if necessary.,
Suture the area if necessary.,
Take antibiotics as instructed.",How to Drain a Cyst1," Getting a cyst drained requires local or general anesthesia, depending on the severity of the cyst. Before draining your cyst, your doctor will administer a local or general anesthesia to prevent you from feeling any pain from the procedure. For a small skin cyst, only a local anesthesia may be necessary, and these procedures can often be performed in the doctor's office. If the cyst is deep or large, then general anesthesia may be necessary. This may require a hospital visit, but is usually a day surgery., After the area has been anesthetized, your doctor will make an incision in the cyst using a sterile surgical knife. The incision will allow your doctor to drain the contents of the cyst and remove the cyst wall if necessary. Removing the cyst wall may help prevent the cyst from returning., In some cases, it may be necessary to place a drainage tube in order to allow a cyst to continue to drain for a few days. Your doctor will secure the tube using stitches and the opening will be less than a ¼ inch (6 mm) in diameter. This process is called “marsupialization.”, After the cyst has been fully drained and the cyst wall has been removed, your doctor will suture the area where the incision was made. You may need to wear a bandage over this area as well. Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions for caring for the surgical wound.

Warmth
Swelling
Pus
Intense throbbing at the wound site

Work and leisure -- career and recreational events that impact all areas of life like the social, cultural, physical and educational development and progress so that it can affect all areas of ones mental health.

Friendship -- relationships with mutual esteem, loyalty, affection, respect and ""being there"" in need or crisis. Their similar tastes and interests usually allow sharing fun activities, hardships and values of one another's advice. Compassionate love (friendship) is interpreted as affection and feelings of certain levels of intimacy not accompanied by passionate, physiological arousal.

Love -- attachment expressed in combinations of intimacy (sharing), commitment (permanence and persistence), and various kinds of caring and passion as shown in family love, as well as romantic love.

Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by physiological arousal (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate). Emotional and physiological arousal may also be present in mental stress, fear and aberrant behavior.



Self-direction -- self-actualizing so one finds their place and calling in life, while continuing to learn, along with serving and helping or even competing with others throughout all phases and stages of life. One may make progress and have feelings of success. Success is contagious--you'll want more of that...

Make sure your appointment won't coincide with your period.,
Avoid doing anything that will interfere with the results of the pap smear.,
Remember to empty your bladder before you go to your appointment.,
Be prepared to undress from the waist down.,
Lie on the examination table and place your feet in the stirrups.,
Expect the doctor to do a physical examination first.,
Take deep breathes and try to relax.,
Allow the doctor to place a lubricated speculum inside your vagina.,
Prepare for a certain amount of discomfort during the procedure.,
Watch the doctor place the cell samples onto a glass slide.,
Learn why the pap smear is necessary.,
Understand who needs to receive a pap smear.,
Be aware of what abnormal results could mean for your health.",How to Do a Pap Smear," When scheduling an appointment for a pap smear, try to time it so it doesn't overlap with your next period. Blood from your period can interfere with the results of the pap smear, making it less accurate.However, if you experience any unexpected bleeding or spotting right before the appointment, there is no need to cancel the appointment.
The gynecologist will assess the amount of blood and determine whether the pap smear is worth doing or if you will need to reschedule for another day.;
, In the 24 to 48 hours before the pap smear, it is important to avoid engaging in any activities or putting anything on or around the vagina that could interfere with the test results. Avoid the following:


Having intercourse
Taking a bath
Using a tampon
Douching (douching should never be done)
Applying vaginal creams or lotions, The pap smear will involve having an instrument inserted into your vagina and possibly having the doctor press down on your lower abdomen. Therefore it is a good idea to avoid drinking too much fluid before the appointment and to make sure that you empty your bladder.

, Before the pap smear can be performed, you will need to undress from the waist down.


You may be given a hospital gown to wear for the duration of the procedure, or you may simply be asked to remove any clothing from your lower half.
Normally, you will be given a sheet or towel to place over your mid-section and thighs so you don't feel completely exposed.

, In order for the doctor to perform the exam, you will need to lie on the examination table and place your feet in the metal stirrups.


The stirrups will keep your legs spread and your knees flexed, so the doctor will have a clear view of your vagina throughout the procedure.
If you are unsure how to get your feet in the stirrups, ask the doctor and they will be happy to guide them into place.

, Before the actual pap smear begins, the doctor will do a physical examination of your vulva (the outer lips of the vagina).


This is done to check for HPV (human papillomavirus), a sexually transmitted disease which is the most common cause of abnormal pap smear results.
Symptoms of HPV include genital warts and post-coital bleeding. If left untreated, HPV can lead to cervical cancer.

, Before and during the pap smear, the doctor will ask you to concentrate on taking deep breaths.


Focusing on your breathing helps to relax the stomach, leg and vaginal muscles, allowing the doctor to insert the speculum more easily.
If this is your first pap smear, focusing on your breathing will also help you to remain calm and feel less nervous before and during the exam.

, Once the physical exam is complete, the doctor will gently insert a lubricated speculum into the vagina.


A speculum is a metal or plastic device which opens up the walls of the vagina, which allows the doctor to exam the cervix for any abnormalities.Once the speculum is in place, the doctor will use a small mascara-like brush (called a cytobrush) to take samples from the walls of the cervix.

, As the speculum expands and the samples are taken from the cervix, some women will experience a certain level of discomfort, similar to menstrual cramps. Other women will experience no discomfort at all.


Following the procedure, you may experience slight bleeding or spotting, but this is completely normal and will quickly subside.

, After the doctor collects the cell samples from the walls of the cervix, he/she will place the samples onto a glass slide, which is then placed inside a protective blue case.


This entire procedure only takes three to five minutes. Once the doctor has finished collecting the samples, they will remove the speculum and you will be able to take your feet out of the stirrups and begin to get dressed.
The cell samples will be sent to the lab for testing. You will be notified about the results as soon as they are ready.

, The pap smear is a screening test — this means that a large number of healthy people are tested in order to identify a small number of people with abnormal cells. The samples collected during a pap smear are examined under a microscope to look for pre-malignant (pre-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) cells.The pap smear is an easy, effective wear to detect early signs of cervical cancer. This is important, as cervical cancer can be completely cured with a simple treatment to the cervix if it is caught early enough.
Later stages of cervical cancer require more involved treatment, such as hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Although there has been news of promising research into a vaccine against HPV, the main approach to this type of cancer is early diagnosis and treatment.

, Pap smears are recommended for every woman, beginning at the age of 21. If the results of your first pap screen are normal and HPV is negative, you are considered low risk and you will only need to return for a pap smear once every 3 years.


Women over the age of 40 are most at risk for developing cervical cancer, so if your are above 40 and you have never had a pap screen, it is highly recommended that you make an appointment as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that the pap smear is not used to detect other forms of cancer, such as cancer of the ovaries or uterus. Therefore, you will still need to schedule an annual gynecology exam to evaluate the health of the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries and pelvis.
The only women who do not need to undergo regular pap smears are those who have no prior history of cervical dysplasia and have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix.

, When a pap smear produces abnormal results, further testing or follow-up is needed. The next step depends on the precise results of the pap smear, your previous history of pap smears, and any risk factors you may have for cervical cancer.


If the cells are identified as being cancerous or pre-cancerous, your doctor will decide on the best course of treatment. If the condition is caught early enough, a simple course of HPV immunization drugs will be enough to eliminate the cancerous cells. The most commonly prescribed medication is called Gardasil.
It the cancer is more advanced, more extreme treatments such as radiotherapy or a hysterectomy may be required.

Your doctor may also be able to suggest natural remedies to help dissolve your nodules.Nodules are growths that form under the skin. They may be filled with fluid, tissue, or both.They resemble acne, cysts, tumors, boils, and abscesses, so it’s important to see a doctor to rule out these conditions.Nodules can grow anywhere in the body, but are most common in the thyroid, lungs, underarms, groin, and vocal cords.;
, An iodine deficiency may cause thyroid nodules. Taking iodine supplements or eating iodine-rich food may minimize or prevent nodules.You can buy iodine supplements at most drug and health food stores. Follow the instructions on the packaging for dosage, but aim to take at least 150 μg iodine per day.In many countries including the United States, iodine is added to table salt, so you may ingest plenty through salt use.You can also get iodine through whole foods such as seafood, dairy produce, eggs, and meat., Taking Chinese herbal supplements such as sargassum and ginseng every day may help dissolve your nodules naturally. There is little clinical proof these herbs work against nodules, but holistic and Eastern medical practitioners suggest using them to aid healing.


Ginseng contains anti-inflammatory compounds that may shrink thyroid nodules. Taking ginseng extract every day may help cure your nodules.Sargassum is an iodine-rich herb that may help treat thyroid nodules. Drinking three cups of sargassum tea every day may help shrink thyroid nodules and prevent any recurrences.One study found no conclusive evidence that Chinese herbs can treat nodules., If you have lipomas, or fat deposits, drink a mixture of apple cider vinegar and honey every day.

Wear appropriate PPE.,
Close the area and contain the spill.,
Procure appropriate waste disposal container(s) and kit(s), along with cleaning equipment.,
Use a dustpan and broom or tongs to carefully pick up each sharp and place it in a sharps disposal container.,
Use appropriate decontamination agents.,
Disinfect the area with appropriate disinfectant.,
Do not forget to close disposal containers.,
Disinfect and inspect cleaning equipment.,
Label all waste disposal bags and seal them completely.,
Dispose of sharps using the appropriate method for your workplace.,
Complete proper documentation and report the incident.",How to Dispose of Discarded Needles and Sharp Objects Safely," Make sure you are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) before collecting medical waste or performing decontaminating procedures. PPE provides a barrier against your skin, so you can work with biohazardous substances without contracting pathogens or coming in contact with hazardous substances. Laws mandate that PPE must be worn when there is anticipated splashing of body fluids. Splashes may also occur during decontamination, also making PPE necessary. Essential PPE items that must be worn during decontamination include gloves, masks, goggles and aprons or gowns.;
, Sharps spills present a hazard to anyone. No one wants to sustain a contaminated needlestick injury by simply walking in a hallway. Prevent further harm by enclosing the affected area to limit others’ access. Cordon the area and place hazard signs to alert individuals about the spill. Contain spills involving large amounts of fluids so that the contamination will not spread. This can be done by placing inert material like sand or clothing around the spill.

, After you’ve protected yourself and communicated the hazard, the next thing you should do is acquire equipment for cleaning, and appropriate containers for sharps and hazardous waste. Cleaning equipment must work properly as intended, and must be either cleanable or disposable. Only use cleaning equipment and materials that are effective in cleaning contaminants in the spill. Always use appropriate containers for the waste. For example, use a red bag for biohazardous waste and sharps disposal containers for sharps.

, Before starting the actual cleaning or decontamination, it is necessary to remove sharps first. Attempting to decontaminate a spill with sharps still present is hazardous. Avoid puncture injuries by removing sharps using tongs, or with a broom and dustpan, before the actual cleaning. Do not pick up sharps using your hands, even if you wear gloves! Always place sharps in sharps disposal containers that follow OSHA specifications.

, Use appropriate decontaminating methods to clean the spill. Decontamination removes, inactivates or dissolves the hazardous agent. The decontaminating agent or method must be tested and proven effective against the substances in the spill. Examples of appropriate cleaning tools for decontamination are the use of absorbents for liquids. Using alcohols or ether solvents for spills involving nonpolar compounds is an example of inactivation decontamination. Spills involving inorganic compounds and salts may be decontaminated by dissolving them in water. Check with your hospital or institution for the up-to-date, most appropriate decontamination agents or methods to clean up a particular spill.

, You may need to disinfect a spill that contains pathological substances. Even if visible pieces of sharps or other biohazardous waste have been removed, you need to disinfect the area to remove any infectious substances that are not visible to the eye.

, After cleaning the spill and placing the waste into containers, make sure to close the waste containers to reduce the risk of spills. OSHA guidelines describe the type of containers that should be used to prevent spills.

, Make sure to clean the cleaning equipment itself thoroughly after it is used on spills containing sharps waste, biohazardous waste, or chemical waste. In addition, inspect equipment for signs of wear and replace it if necessary.

, Do not forget to label waste disposal bags. Place a secure biohazard sign on containers and bags that contain biohazardous waste. Include sharps warning labels for sharps.

, Institutions have different methods of disposal for medical waste. Some methods include drop box or supervised collection sites, mail-back programs, or disposal through waste disposal contractors.

, Make sure that the spill is reported in accordance with local and state laws.

Hold onto all of your bills.,
Review your bills.,
Find out how much your insurer will cover.,
Research the fair price of each procedure.,
Think about paying with cash.,
Call the hospital.,
Write a dispute letter.,
Think about hiring an advocate.,
Negotiate with the hospital.,
Negotiate directly with the doctor.,
Ask about financial assistance.,
Use the threat of bankruptcy.",How to Dispute a Hospital Bill," Effectively disputing a hospital bill requires that you know exactly what you are being charged for. Preserve every bill that you receive from the hospital. Also hang onto bills from medical centers, labs, and the doctor’s office.When a hospital bills for medical care, the bills are often incredibly vague and wordy. Also, you may receive multiple bills for one procedure or visit. Oftentimes you will get separate bills from surgeons, hospitals, medical groups, specialists, and other physicians. Finally, it is not uncommon to receive a bill six to eight months after treatment. Be aware of all of these things when collecting your medical bills.


To make things easier, have a giant folder that you can throw bills into once you have looked over them. You can also scan bills so that you have a PDF of the bill on your computer.
All bills should be itemized, i.e., broken down by individual charge. These are called “line-item” or “detailed” bills. Call the hospital and request a detailed bill if you are not sent one.;
, You want to make sure that the hospital hasn’t double-billed you or made other errors. For example, an exam charge could show up on a hospital bill but also on your doctor’s bill. You want to make sure that you catch all errors.


Make sure that the hospital doesn’t charge you for medications you brought from home. Also, check that the hospital does not charge the full-day rate for the room if you were discharged in the morning.Also look to see if you were charged for supplies like sheets, gowns, or gloves. These supplies should already be included in the cost of the hospital room., Before disputing the hospital bill, you should see how much of the bill is covered by your insurance. Try to get your insurer to cover all legitimate charges.


Your insurer might claim that your policy does not cover certain drugs or procedures. Take out your policy and check.You can appeal any rejection by a health insurer. For more information, see Resolve a Claim Dispute With Your Health Insurance Provider.

, To challenge a bill, you will need proof that the hospital’s prices are out of line compared to those charged by other hospitals. You can find the prices that other hospitals charge by looking online. Visit the websites for Healthcare Blue Book and FAIR Health to find prices.Medical costs will vary greatly among hospitals even though they are in the same town or region. In addition, the cost of procedures are not typically transparent or rational. You may have to do some digging to uncover competitor pricing.


You also might want to use the Medicaid rates as a guide. They can be found at https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html.
If you find that your hospital is charging more than other hospitals in your area, offer your hospital what other hospitals in your area are charging. This is a great way to cut your costs and having other hospitals' pricing is great evidence of what your cost should be.

, If you do not have insurance or if insurance is not covering all of your costs, you can usually get a sizable discount if you offer to pay in cash. Healthcare providers will often cut their prices by 66% or more if you are willing to pay everything up front in cash. In some cases, hospitals and doctors have taken 1/10 of the original bill.


Wen you negotiate an all cash deal, start with a lower offer, maybe around 1/4 the original bill. You and the other party will negotiate from there.
If you cannot pay everything up front and you have to create a payment plan, be prepared to pay a little bit more. However, never be afraid to negotiate.

, You can begin the dispute by calling the hospital. Share with them that you are unhappy with the charges and explain why.


Keep careful notes of who you talk to. Note the person’s name, the day and time, as well as the substance of the conversation. You need to keep careful notes because you are likely to talk to a new person each time you call the hospital., After calling, you should follow up with a letter. Summarize the conversation and repeat the reasons why you are challenging the bill. Be sure your letter includes the following:Your account information. State your name and whatever patient identification number the hospital gave you.
The charges you are disputing. Make reference to specific charges on the bill. For example, “In particular, I don’t think I should have to pay the charges of $24.55 for rubber gloves on both March 21 and 22.”
The reason why you are disputing the charge. You might write, “As I explained over the phone, items like rubber gloves should be included in the room rate, as they are standard items used.”
Supporting documents. Here, you can print off any information that shows what other hospitals charge. You can reference them in your letter. “As you can see, the average cost for the other two hospitals in the city is less than half what you have charged me. I have included a print-out of costs for your competitors.”

, If the hospital won’t lower the bill to an amount that makes you happy, then you need to think about hiring a patient or medical-billing advocate. These advocates often work on contingency; that is, they will take a portion of your savings (e.g. 20-30%) as their fee.If the advocate saves you $20,000, then he or she might get $5,000.


Some advocates may also be willing to work for an hourly fee. Typically, they can charge from $50 to $175 an hour.You can find a patient advocate online or in your phone book. They can be listed under different names, including “claims assistance professionals,” “medical-claims professionals” or “health-care claims advocates.”You might also want to hire an attorney instead of a patient advocate. Like advocates, many attorneys will work on contingency, and they will charge around 30% of whatever savings they get for you., If you have an advocate or lawyer, they can negotiate with the hospital to lower the amount of the bill. Should you attempt to handle negotiations on your own, then keep the following in mind:


Refuse to pay for anything you didn’t use.If a charge appears on the bill erroneously, refuse to pay. Ask the hospital to look at your medical reports to confirm that the doctors and nurses actually used the item you have been charged for.
If the hospital made a mistake, then insist that they pay for it. For example, if you got an infection while in the hospital, try to get the hospital to cover the extra time spent in the hospital.Be frank about your financial situation. If the bill is so high you don’t think you can ever pay it, say so.
Offer to pay a lump sum in exchange for a discount. Some hospitals might agree to cut the bill significantly if you can pay it all at once., If your bill comes from the doctor or another healthcare professional directly, negotiate with them directly. Use the same tactics as if you were negotiating with the hospital. If you have an advocate to help you, discuss a strategy with them.

, By law, non-profit hospitals must offer financial assistance programs. You should check with the hospital to find out the eligibility requirements.Typically, eligibility is based on your savings and income. Ask the hospital about any financial assistance, as hospitals tend not to advertise these programs.Even if you used a for-profit hospital, you should still ask about potential financial assistance programs. These programs can reduce the overall amount that you owe or offer flexible repayment plans.

, As a last ditch effort to come to a deal, consider discussing your willingness to file for bankruptcy with the doctor or hospital. If you file for bankruptcy and have medical debt, a doctor's or hospital's ability to collect is greatly diminished. You can use this to come to a deal as a doctor will not want their debt to go through bankruptcy.


Don't ever be afraid to put your cards on the table and tell the other party what you are looking into. You will be surprised at the deals you can make if you try.

Set aside at least an hour.,
Be prepared for the registration process.,
Go through the physical.,
Give blood.,
Recover with refreshments.",How to Donate Blood to the Red Cross2," The process of giving blood takes around an hour, although the act of donating only takes around 10 minutes. You will have to go through registration, a physical, and a short recovery time when you give blood.At busier blood drives, you may have to wait longer than an hour.
Make sure to wear short sleeves or a shirt with a sleeve that can easily be pushed above the elbow., When you arrive at donation site, you will have to register. This means you will fill out a form where you provide basic information about yourself.Make sure to bring your ID. This can be your donor card, your driver’s license, or two alternate forms of ID. One form of ID must have a photo. If you do not have a photo ID, bring two other forms of ID. These IDs must have your name on them. The two forms of ID can be a credit or debit card, checkbook with name and address, social security card, pay stub, fishing license, library card, or any other card that has your name.

, Before you give blood, you will be given a physical. This physical includes a session of private, confidential questions. The questions cover your health and your travel history.In addition to questions, someone will take your temperature and pulse, and check your hemoglobin and blood pressure.
Some of the personal questions to expect include the use of IV drugs, piercings and tattoos, and history of sexually transmitted diseases. They will also ask if you have taken any payment for sex. If you are a male, they will ask if you have had sex with another male. Regardless of gender, they will ask if you have had sex with someone who fits into any of those categories.Health and behavioral related questions help screen for potential problems that may preclude one from donating. It is important to be honest, but they will also test your blood to ensure no incorrect information is given. If you are completely honest it can save time and money in not processing blood that will not be able to be used.

, When you give blood, you will sit in a chair. One of the blood drive staff will cleanse your arm before she inserts a new, sterile needle into your arm. You will sit in the chair while the bag fills. When you have donated the appropriate amount of blood, the staff member will remove the needle and bandage the wound.Donating blood takes eight to 10 minutes.
When you donate blood, you will give around a pint of blood.

, After you give blood, you will be given refreshments, like juice and cookies. This allows you a few minutes to rest while your body recovers from losing a pint of blood. You stay for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then you leave the blood drive.Make sure you eat the snacks provided and rehydrate with the recommended fluids. This can help avoid dizziness or fainting later.

If you have been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea, you have to wait at least a year to donate blood., If you have ever used any intravenous drugs not prescribed by a doctor, you cannot give blood., Depending on where you have traveled, you may need to wait to give blood. Traveling to Mexico, Central or South America, or the Caribbean requires you to wait 28 days to give blood. If you have traveled outside of the US and Canada in the last three years, you will be required to give a travel history.


You must wait three years after malaria treatments, 12 months after returning from malaria-risk countries, and three years after living more than five years in a malaria-risk country to give blood.
If you have spent extended periods of time in countries with mad cow disease, you cannot donate., To give blood, you need to feel well. If you have a cold or the flu, you cannot give blood and will have to wait. If you are taking antibiotics for any illness, you have to wait until after the treatment is complete.


If you have a blood condition where your blood doesn't clot or are taking blood thinners, you shouldn't donate blood.
If you have high blood pressure, you can give blood as long as it is below 180/100.
If you have had leukemia or a cancer of the blood, you are not eligible to donate."
"
Make sure you are in good health.,
Know how often you can give blood.,
Eat iron-rich foods before giving blood.,
Hydrate before donating.,
Come back if you are declined.",How to Donate Blood to the Red Cross4," Blood donors should overall be healthy and feeling well. This means that you are not sick, running a fever, have an infection, or other illness. You should be able to perform normal activities.You may be eligible to give blood if you have certain chronic conditions, like diabetes, if you are treating it and it is manageable. If you are unsure about your condition, contact the Red Cross or your doctor.

, You can give blood multiple times a year. However, each donor must wait 56 days between each blood donation., To make sure you have enough iron in your body, eat foods that contain a lot of iron before and after you give blood. These foods include red meat, fish, poultry, spinach, cereals fortified with iron, and beans.Don’t eat fatty foods before you donate blood. This includes hamburgers, fried foods, French fries, or ice cream. These foods can negatively affect your blood and cause you to not be able to donate.

, Before you donate blood, make sure to hydrate yourself. Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water or other non-alcoholic fluids the days leading up to your donation. On the day you give blood, make sure to drink an additional 16 ounces of water or fluids., Sometimes, potential blood donors are declined. Many factors may influence this. If you are declined for a reason that is not related to an unchanging lifestyle or medical situation, then go back to try to give blood again. Many people are turned away up to three times before they can give blood."

Do the prayer stretch.,
Stretch the wrist flexor.,
Stretch the wrist extensor.,
Do wrist circles.,
Squeeze a ball in the palm of your hand.,
Do weighted wrist curls.",How to Do Hand Stretches for Carpal Tunnel1," Stretches alone will not resolve an issue you have with carpal tunnel, but combined with effective treatments, they can help you to relieve moderate symptoms.The prayer stretch can help you to increase blood-flow to the median nerve. Try the prayer stretch for early relief of carpal tunnel pain, and to reduce sensations of numbness and tingling.


Begin with your palms pressed together in front of your chest, below your chin.
Slowly lower your hands (still pressed together) downwards, keeping them close to the stomach.
When you feel a moderate stretch, hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds.
Repeat two to four times.The stretch should cause no pain. If you feel an increase in pain or numbness and tingling in your hands, then stop the exercise and see your doctor or physical therapist.;
, Stretching your wrist flexor might help. Start by extending one arm forward, parallel to the floor with the palm facing the ceiling. With the other hand, bend the fingers down towards the floor.


When a stretch is felt, hold for 15 to 30 seconds.
Switch arms and repeat two to four times.If it is not possible for you to straighten your arm out, then you can also do this stretch with your elbow slightly bent.

, Extend one arm forward, parallel to the floor with your palm facing the floor. With the other hand, bend your fingers down towards the floor.


When a stretch is felt, hold for 15 to 30 seconds.
Switch arms and repeat two to four times. If it is not possible for you to straighten your arm out, then you can also do this stretch with your elbow slightly bent.

, Wrist circles can help you to decrease tension in the fingers and flexor tendons. Clench your fists then release the index and middle fingers, pointing them straight.


With the two fingers draw five circles in a clockwise direction, then another five circles in a counterclockwise direction.
Alternate hands, but repeat three times with each hand.

, Squeeze a tennis ball or something similar to help you to increase mobility of the entire wrist. Using a pressure or stress ball can help alleviate carpal tunnel pain as well as provide stress relief.Gently squeeze the ball for five seconds and then release.
Then switch to your other hand, and continue alternating.
If you don’t have something to squeeze, make a fist and hold it for five seconds.
Release, and then repeat five times.
Switch to the other hand and repeat.If a tennis ball is too difficult to squeeze, then try squeezing a soft stress ball or even some clay.

, You can help strengthen your wrists and potentially release tension by performing some weighted wrist curls. Take a light weight, a can of food is good to start with, and hold it in one hand. Hang your hand over the edge of a surface, such as a bench, table or your lap. Your palm should be facing down. Make sure that your forearm is supported.

Then slowly curl your wrist up, hold it for a moment and then slowly bring it back down.
Repeat this for 10 repetitions.
Then turn your arm over so your palm is facing the sky, and do ten more repetitions.You can also use a resistance band in a similar manner. Place your forearm on a surface, such as a bench, table, or your lap, but allow your hand to hang over the edge of the surface. Then, place the other end of the resistance band on the floor and secure it under your foot. Then, complete the curls. You can adjust the ‘tension’ on the elastic band by increasing or decreasing the length of the band.

You also have the option of donating to a stranger or participating in a paired exchange donation, which means you will donate your kidney to a stranger on the condition that a compatible stranger also donates a kidney to your loved one.Some kidney transplant centers allow you to be a good samaritan donor, which means you can initiate a chain of donations by donating your kidney to a stranger. When you donate your kidney, the recipient’s loved one will donate hers, and so on and so forth. This will probably not directly impact anyone you know personally, but it will help a lot of people.
If you don’t want to donate your kidney while you are still alive, but you want to help someone after you die, you can register to donate all of your organs or specific organs by signing up on your specific state’s registry or indicating your preferences on your driver’s license.;
, Once you have decided that you would like to donate a kidney, you must contact a transplant center in order to initiate your application. The transplant center should have a nurse available to answer all of your questions and help you decide if donation is really right for you.If you are donating to a specific person, you must contact the transplant center that has approved them for a transplant. If the person has not yet been approved, you will not be able to proceed with donating your kidney until that happens.If you are not doing a direct donation, you have a choice regarding which facility you work with. Contact multiple facilities and ask questions regarding their success rates, their policies for matching donors and recipients, and the financial assistance they offer in order to choose the right one for you.
Consult the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for a complete list of transplant centers in the United States., If you want to donate to a specific person, you will need to undergo blood testing to determine if you are a match. The initial screening involves a simple blood test.You must have a compatible blood type in order to donate your kidney to a specific individual. People who have type A blood can accept blood from donors with type A or type O. People with type B blood can receive blood from people with type B or type O. People with type AB blood can receive blood from someone with any blood type. People with type O blood can only receive blood from a donor with type O blood.
The antibodies in your blood must also be compatible with those in the recipient’s blood. In general, the more antibodies that recipient has, the more difficult it will be to find a match.
Doctors also consider antigen matching. You do not need to be an exact match in order to donate, but research has found that an exact match does increase the success rate of the transplant.
If you have passed all of the other tests, doctors will then perform a cross matching test, which may actually be a series of several tests. Doctors will collect cells and serum (blood without the cells in it) from both the donor and the recipient and mix them together to see if the recipient’s body is likely to reject the donor’s organ. If these tests come back negative, you will be considered a match.
Keep in mind that if you are not a match for your loved one, you still have the option of participating in a paired exchange donation program, which will greatly increase the chances that your loved one will receive a kidney in a timely fashion., In order to donate a kidney, you must be healthy enough to undergo surgery and to do well afterward with only one kidney. You also must have a sufficiently low risk of developing kidney problems in the future.Your doctor will likely perform blood tests, urine tests, x-rays, an EKG, and a CT angiogram to check your overall health and look for any abnormalities of your kidneys.Certain chronic conditions, such as diabetes and liver disease, may disqualify you from donating your kidney.
If you are a smoker, you will be required to quit at least one month before undergoing surgery to have your kidney removed.You may also be disqualified from donating a kidney if you have certain diseases that could be passed on to the recipient, such as HIV or hepatitis.
You will also be required to undergo a psychological examination in order to confirm that you are aware of the risks of donating your kidney and are choosing to do it of your own free will.
If you have any health conditions, you might require a pre-surgical clearance from your treating doctor in order to be approved for surgery.

, Donating a kidney requires that you undergo major surgery, and this is not without risks. Make sure to talk to your doctor about the risks before you agree to undergo surgery, and always ask if you have an increased risk of complications for any reason. Although rare, some risks of surgery include the following:Bleeding
Infection
Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism)
Death

, Kidney donors do not usually have shorter lifespans or a diminished quality of life as a result of the surgery.There are, however, some long-term risks to keep in mind.


While your body is perfectly capable of functioning normally with only one kidney, you will be at a disadvantage should your remaining kidney fail. If you end up needing a kidney transplant, you will be given preference as a prior donor.Kidney donors may have a somewhat higher chance of developing high blood pressure.Having only one kidney may prevent you from being eligible for certain military, police, and fire fighting jobs., Most of the time, your medical expenses will be covered by either the recipient’s insurance or by the transplant center if you choose to donate a kidney. Make sure to find out if you will be responsible for any costs. Also, keep in mind that the surgery may have many hidden costs that are not covered. The following expenses are typically not covered, although you may be able to get help with them by contacting a nonprofit agency:Expenses for travel to and from the transplant center
Childcare
Lost wages during your recovery period
Medical expenses related to long-term surgical complications

, There are two different surgeries your doctor may perform to remove your kidney: an open incision removal and a laparoscopic procedure. The laparoscopic procedure is much less invasive, which means there are fewer risks involved and the recovery time is shorter.A laparoscopic procedure means that instead of making a large incision and the surgeon using their hands to do the surgery inside your body, a very small set of incisions are made and instruments with long handles are inserted into the holes. The surgeon uses the instruments to do the surgery without ever opening up the abdomen.
The laparoscopic procedure may not be an option for all patients, depending on their surgical histories and the anatomy of the individual's kidney and whether it can be accessed and removed with the laparoscopic instruments alone.

, Your doctor will give you specific instructions that you must follow prior to surgery. Most commonly, you will be restricted from eating and drinking in the hours leading up to your surgery, usually beginning the night before. This is to prevent aspiration of food into your lungs when you are under anesthesia. It is very important to follow these and all other instructions, as they are meant to reduce your risk of surgical complications.Make sure your doctor knows about all of the medications you are taking. You may be required to stop some medications prior to surgery.

, Depending on the type of surgery and a host of personal factors, recovery typically takes anywhere between one and six weeks. You should expect to experience pain, discomfort, and fatigue while you recover.It’s a good idea to have a caretaker available to help you with daily activities, like preparing meals and
You may have to spend a few days recovering in the hospital before you are sent home.
People who are in good shape tend to recover from surgery faster than people who are out of shape, so you might want to begin an exercise regimen before your surgery.Moving around in the days following your surgery will help you avoid complications, such as blood clots., Your doctor will probably have you come in for at least one post-surgical check-up. The purpose of this is to make sure you are healing properly, so be sure to go to all scheduled appointments.It is also important to continue getting regular medical checkups throughout your life. Your doctor may want to monitor your kidney function to make sure your remaining kidney is functioning properly.

, When you are released from the hospital, your doctor will give you a list of activities that you should avoid for certain periods of time. These restrictions are meant to help you heal and to protect you from injury, so it is very important that you follow them.You should not do any heavy lifting in the weeks following your surgery. Your doctor will provide you with specific guidelines.
Depending on the type of work you do, you may not be medically cleared to return to work for several weeks. The more strenuous your job, the longer you will be out of work.
Women are typically advised not to become pregnant for six months after donating a kidney.
Some doctors recommend that kidney donors avoid contact sports like football and wrestling, due to the potential for injury to your remaining kidney.

Fan out your fingers.,
Extend and clench your fingers.,
Do a thumbs-up stretch.,
Stretch your thumb under your hand.,
Use rubber bands for a resistance exercise.",How to Do Hand Stretches for Carpal Tunnel2," If you have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel, exercise alone are not likely to significantly relieve symptoms, and they don’t replace other treatments. You may find that stretches help to lessen pain and tension to some degree if your symptoms are not too severe.You can extend and clench all your fingers to loosen ligaments in your wrist. Loosening your ligaments can help relieve tension within your carpal tunnel.


With your arms relaxed at your sides, stretch out your fingers far apart.
Hold this stretch for five seconds.
Relax your hands and fingers, and then repeat the stretch.
Repeat this exercise four times., Standing, extend both arms forward with palms facing downwards, parallel to the floor. Extend fingers upwards as if making a ""stop"" sign, and hold for five seconds.


Relax your fingers downwards so they are once again parallel to the floor.
Squeeze your fingers into a tight fist and hold for five seconds.
Unclench your fist.
Then bend the wrists down towards the floor for another five seconds.
Straighten both wrists and relax the fingers.
Repeat this exercise 10 times, and then hang your arms loosely at your side and shake them out a little., Close all your fingers, keeping the thumb out and pointed up. Create some resistance with your hand and wrist to keep your thumb from moving. Then grab your thumb with your free hand, and gently pull it back.


Hold it under tension for around five seconds.
Release and repeat five to 10 times for each hand., Another way to stretch your thumb starts with you holding your hand out flat in front of you. Fan out your fingers and ensure that your palm is facing the floor.


Bend your thumb under your palm and try to touch the base of your smallest finger.
Count to five, then release.
Repeat for 10 times with each hand., Resist rubber bands to build strength in your flexor tendons. Place small rubber bands over all five fingers, then try to flex your fingers open to work the flexor tendons at your carpal tunnel.


You can double the band to reduce its size and add more resistance, to strengthen weakened hand muscles.
You can also place the rubber band around the thumb and the index fingers only, or any two fingers you want to train.
Expand them, then relax.
Do each movement for one minute, or until you feel fatigued. Do not push yourself too hard. Instead, try to gradually build up your endurance. If you feel an increase in pain or numbness and tingling, stop the exercise and see your doctor or physical therapist. .

Pull one arm behind your back.,
Stretch your neck gently.,
Do a shoulder shrug stretch.,
Stretch your hands and elbows against a wall.",How to Do Hand Stretches for Carpal Tunnel3," You can ease tension in your neck and shoulder by stretching one arm (bent at a 90 degree angle) behind your back. Slightly twist your head in the opposite direction till you feel a stretch at your shoulder.


If you are bending your right arm, turn your head to the left. You will feel a stretch over your right shoulder.
Count to five then relax.
Repeat three times then switch to the other arm.
This may prevent the triggering of some of the carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms., You can gently stretch out and ease tension in your neck, if you have some tightness connected to carpal tunnel or repetitive strain injuries. Start by sitting upright, and then placing your right hand on to the top of your left shoulder. Hold your right shoulder down and slowly dip your head forward, and slightly to the right.

Hold the stretch for five seconds, and only apply a light amount of pressure.
Release slowly, and then repeat this stretch on the other side., Start by standing up, with your arms relaxed by your side. Then raise your shoulder in a shrugging motion. Squeeze your shoulders back, and then stretch and pull them down. Hold it for a moment and then push your shoulders forward.

This should give you a good and comprehensive stretch for your shoulders.
The whole movement should take you around seven seconds to run through., You can perform this stretch to help you to strengthen your arm muscles between the wrist and inner elbow. This can help create mobility and support through your wrist.


Facing a wall, raise your arm until it is parallel to the floor and then place your palm against the wall with your fingers pointing up.
If you can't feel the stretch, lean gently into the wall.
Then count to 30 and release.
Repeat this three times with each arm.
For a deeper stretch, turn your palm so your fingers point to the ground.

Prepare your sterilizer.,
Wipe off your clippers.,
Allow your sterilizer time to warm up.,
Sterilize your clippers.",How to Disinfect Nail Clippers1," Sterilization requires you to get your clippers to a hot enough temperature to kill bacteria and micro-organisms. Autoclaves or bead sterilizers are special machines that are intended specifically for this purpose.Each sterilizer will be different, so you should follow the setup directions for your sterilizer for best results.
You could also use your oven to sterilize your clippers. To do this, lay your clippers on an oven-safe pan and bake your clippers at precisely 170°C (340°F) for 60 minutes.If you use your oven to sterilize your clippers, you should remove them with caution, as they'll be hot after being sterilized.
Plastic nail clippers, or any clippers you worry might not hold up to extreme heat, should be sanitized with another method.;
, Use a clean cloth or a piece of paper towel to give your clippers a thorough wipe down before sterilizing. This will remove any loose bits of gunk or buildup from your clippers. Pay extra attention to ridges and contours on your clippers. Gunk and buildup love to hide in these places.









After you finish wiping your clippers, you should wash or throw away your rag or paper towel to prevent the potential spread of bacteria or micro-organisms.
A little bit of water or some cleaning agent on your cloth can add more cleaning power to your wipe down.
If you get your clippers wet while wiping, be sure they are completely dry before sterilizing, especially with a bead sterilizer. The beads in bead sterilizers can become stuck to your clippers if you attempt to sterilize them while wet., Depending on your method of sterilization, the time it takes your sterilizer to reach heat up will vary. Many bead sterilizers, for example, only take about 15 to 20 minutes before they're ready for your clippers.


Exercise caution whenever using heat to sterilize. The extreme temperatures can easily cause burns.

, Some methods of sterilization may require more time to completely sterilize your clippers than others. Generally, you can expect a metal tool to be sterilized if it has been held at a minimum of 170°C (340°F) for 60 minutes, but sterilizing machines may take as little as a single minute.








Heat conducts easily through metal, so you may want to use gloves or an oven mitt whenever handling tools that are freshly heat sterilized.
When using a bead sterilizer, glass beads can sometimes stick to your clippers. Be careful, these will be extremely hot."

Assess the nature of your shortness of breath.Asthma is a respiratory condition that is characterized by shortness of breath.,
Tell your doctor if you are experiencing wheezing.Wheezing is a high pitched whistling sound often heard when breathing out, but it can also occur when breathing in.,
Take note of things that trigger your respiratory problems.One of the cardinal signs of asthma is that it most often has consistent and recognizable triggers.,
Get a blood test to rule out other conditions.,
Have spirometry testing.This is a lung function test that assesses how constricted your lung passages are by measuring how much air you exhale and how quickly you can exhale it.,
Ask your doctor for lung imaging tests as needed.,
Opt for an electrocardiogram.,
Take preventative medications.Preventative medications taken over the long-term is the mainstay of asthma treatment.,
Have a medication for short-term relief of asthma flare-ups.It is also key to carry with you an inhaler (usually a short-acting bronchodilator) that can be used for the short-term relief of any asthma flare-ups.,
Receive immunotherapy for triggering allergens as needed.If your asthma is triggered by allergens, speak to your doctor about receiving ""allergy shots."",
Keep a journal to identify triggers.",How to Distinguish Asthma from Similar Conditions," It usually begins earlier in life (often in childhood, although it may happen in adulthood too), and it often gets worse with time. However, shortness of breath alone is not enough to make the diagnosis of asthma as there are a number of other respiratory conditions which may all lead to shortness of breath.


Other respiratory conditions that may lead to shortness of breath include congestive heart failure, bronchiectasis, COPD, or an infection, among other things.;
, It is a very characteristic symptom of asthma that can help to differentiate it from other similar respiratory conditions. You may also experience coughing, and/or troubles sleeping due to coughing and wheezing.


Other possible causes of wheezing include congestive heart failure, COPD, heartburn, and vocal cord dysfunction, among other things.If you are evaluating a child for asthma, see if you can hear a whistling or a wheezing sound when the child exhales. Wheezing in a child may be related to asthma, or to an infection (these are the two most common causes).Note that, if the wheezing is due to asthma, it is most often reversible (as opposed to having a constant wheeze)., For instance, it may be triggered by exercise, by temperature (particularly the cold), or by environmental or occupational allergens, among other things. If you notice that your shortness of breath and wheezing gets worse with triggers, take note of what these are and tell your doctor. Also know that the association to triggers increases the likelihood that it is indeed asthma.


Asthma symptoms (such as cough attacks and/or wheezing) tend to also get worse when you have a respiratory infection, such as a cold or the flu. If this is a trigger that worsens your shortness of breath, tell your doctor as it may be asthma.
A correlation of shortness of breath to exercise is less likely to be correlated to asthma as it may also be due to a number of other heart or lung related problems, such as angina, heart failure, or a pulmonary embolism.

, Although there is no specific blood test that is diagnostic of asthma, blood tests can be used to rule out other lung conditions that may present similarly. For instance, if your white blood cell counts are normal you are likely NOT to have a respiratory tract infection. If your D-dimer (an evaluation for blood clots) is not high, you are unlikely to have a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) as the cause of your shortness of breath. , The slower (and less volume) you exhale, the more constricted your airways are likely to be.


You can also evaluate your peak flow. Peak flow is another lung function test that measures how forcefully you can breathe out. The force with which you can exhale is a general indicator of your overall lung function.
Following lung function tests, you will be given a bronchodilator medication. If your results improve following administration of the bronchodilator (a treatment for asthma), it is very likely that asthma is your diagnosis.

, Another way to rule out other lung conditions that may present similarly to asthma is to opt for lung imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or a CT scan.Here's how these tests can be helpful:


A chest x-ray can rule out shortness of breath from congestive heart failure (which can lead to fluid build-up in the lungs). It can also rule out masses such as lung cancer, infections such as pneumonia, or traumatic causes of shortness of breath such as a pneumothorax.
A chest CT scan can rule out conditions such as interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and COPD, all of which have characteristic appearances on a CT scan and present with respiratory challenges. A chest CT can also rule out a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung).

, An electrocardiogram (ECG) is another way to rule out heart-related causes of shortness of breath, as well as to assess for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Although an ECG is unhelpful in the specific diagnosis of asthma, it can be used to rule out a suspicion of other things.

, You will generally be given an inhaled corticosteroid such as Fluticasone (Flovent) to decrease inflammation in your airways and to minimize unnecessary immune responses, as well as an inhaled bronchodilator such as Salmeterol (Serevent) to help open your airways.


Inhaled corticosteroids (unlike oral corticosteroids) have minimal side effects and are safe for long-term daily use.
You can also opt for a combined inhaler (with both corticosteroid and bronchodilator medication in it), such as Advair.
Long-term control medications should be taken every day regardless of whether or not asthma symptoms are present. The purpose of these medications is to treat inflammation not asthma symptoms. If these medications are stopped airway inflammation may return., Flare-ups may be caused by environmental allergens, temperature (such as cold weather), and exercise, among other things.


If you know you are about to be exposed to a trigger for your asthma (such as before a workout if you have exercise-induced asthma), you will want to take your short-acting bronchodilator medication prior to being exposed to the trigger (for instance, prior to commencing your workout).
You may also use the short-term bronchodilator for unexpected asthma flare-ups to help get your symptoms under control.
If you are use your short-term inhaler to control symptoms four or more times a week, not including before exercise, consult your physician. This is a sign that your asthma is not well controlled., These expose your immune system to a small amount of the allergen over time, so that gradually you become less and less reactive to it.


Allergy shots are generally given once a week for the first few months.
They are then given once a month for a few years, until they become fully effective.

, Preventing contact with known triggers may reduce the frequency of flares and your need to take short-term medication. Once a trigger is identified, take steps to reduce your exposure. Some triggers may require more effort than others to avoid. In some situations, you may have to enlist the help of others to reduce exposure to such things as pet dander and second hand smoke."

Purchase a suitable disinfectant.,
Dilute your disinfectant, if applicable.,
Add your disinfecting solution to a suitable container.,
Wait the time proscribed for full disinfecting.",How to Disinfect Nail Clippers2," In the cleaning section of most stores, you should be able to find a ""hospital grade"" disinfectant. This will be more effective against a wide range of bacteria than other disinfectants. In many cases, you'll find this sold in concentrated form and will have to dilute it.


If hospital grade disinfectant is not available, you could use a mixture that is 80% ethanol, 5% isopropanol, and 15% distilled water., If your disinfectant came ready to use, you won't have to dilute it, but in many cases you'll have to add distilled water to the concentrated solution. The amount you'll have to dilute your solution will vary between products, so you should consult the directions on your disinfectant for best results.


On the label of your disinfectant, there should be various suggested amounts for diluting. Use these to determine the amount you need to dilute your disinfectant.
Impurities or additives, like fluoride, in your tap water can negatively impact the strength of your disinfectant. For this reason, you should only dilute with distilled water., The disinfectant you'll be using will be very strong, so plastic containers might not hold up well to it. However, a simple glass container, like a cup, can be used for your disinfectant.


Your disinfectant should be high enough in the glass to completely submerge the used part of the clippers., Different formulas of disinfectant may take less time than others to work. To guarantee your clippers are fully disinfected, soak them for full time indicated on the label of your disinfectant.


After your clippers finish soaking, you can wipe away excess moisture with a clean, dry cloth or a piece of paper towel, or allow them to air dry. Your clippers are ready to clip!"
"
Use a toothpick.,
Soak your clippers.,
Scrub your clippers.",How to Disinfect Nail Clippers3," Small bits of buildup can become caked on your clippers. In some cases, this may have accumulated in a crevice. This kind of unsightly buildup may even remain after sterilizing or disinfecting. Use a toothpick to scrape the buildup from your clippers.


After you've popped the buildup free from your clippers, loose remnants might remain. Wipe the area with a dry cloth after using your toothpick to remove any remaining buildup.
You may find that more rigid tools, like tweezers or a paperclip, work best to remove exceptionally stubborn buildup.

, Allowing your clippers to soak in a cleaning solution or disinfectant can cause buildup to loosen or dissolve. Generally, the longer you soak your clippers, the greater the effect of your cleaning solution or disinfectant will have.


It may be most time efficient to set an hourly alarm and periodically check your clippers to gauge whether or not they need more time to soak., You might be surprised by how effective a simple dry scrubbing with a stiff bristle brush can be. Take your brush and apply it to your clippers. Switch your scrubbing direction and angle frequently while doing so.


By changing the angle and direction of your brushing, you'll attack gunk and buildup from all sides, improving your chances of scrubbing it free.
Since buildup has a tendency to accumulate in nooks and crevices, you may want to consider a small stiff bristle brush, like a toothbrush, to have better access to these narrow spaces.

Know what causes malaria.,
Know the signs and symptoms.,
Pay attention for signs of spleen failure.,
Take your temperature to identify a high fever.,
Get a diagnosis.","How to Differentiate Between Malaria, Dengue, and Chikungunya1"," Malaria is caused by plasmodium, a single-celled parasite often transmitted by infected mosquitoes.The parasite is injected into a person’s circulatory system through the saliva of the mosquito. It then travels to the liver where it will mature and reproduce.
When the plasmodium matures, it will infect red blood cells until they burst. Then, newly developed plasmodium from the red blood cells will spread, and infect more red blood cells.;
, In most cases, the manifestations of malaria will begin 8-25 days after the mosquito bite. However, those who have taken prophylaxis (medication to prevent infection) may have an extended incubation period.


When the infected red blood cells spread throughout the body, the cells will eventually die off.
This can lead to severe liver infection.
Sometimes the infected red blood cells become ""stickier"" than usual and clot easily, which can lead to stoppage of blood flow to the brain.
The severity of the signs and symptoms of malaria may depend upon three factors: the type of malaria, your immune system, and health of your spleen.
There are 5 types of malaria. These include P. Vivax, P. Malaria, P. Ovale, P. Falcifarum, and P. Knowlesi., The spleen is the graveyard of your red blood cells.


During a malaria infection, red blood cells rapidly die, and the spleen may not be able to keep up with the demand, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
Notice an enlarged spleen, which can happen when the spleen is overwhelmed by the amount of dead red blood cells and becomes unnaturally enlarged.

, High fever is very common in malaria patients.The temperature may reach as high as 40 °C (104 °F).
Fever is a systemic immune response of the body, that works to suppress bacterial growth.
Fever is often accompanied by chills, which allow the muscles to burn calories and increase your body temperature. This may also include sweating.

, Because malaria has non-specific symptoms, it may be more difficult to diagnose when it occurs in an uncommon country, such as the US.Your health and travel history will be assessed to determine if you have traveled to a malarial country.
Get a physical examination. Although the physical findings might not be specific, they will be used to make a preliminary diagnosis of malaria.Get a blood film done. Your doctor will take a drop of blood and place it in a microscopic slide. The blood will be stained to make the blood cells visible under the microscope. Your doctor will analyze the film to see if there are visible plasmodium parasites. Two or more tests are required within a 36 hour period to confirm malaria."

Watch for new symptoms.,
Get vaccinated.",How to Diagnose Typhoid Fever," Typhoid fever is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection if treatment is not received promptly. Therefore, if you suspect you may have it, it is important to be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible.Start by seeing your family doctor who can refer you on to an infectious disease specialist. However, if you are unable to get a same-day appointment with your family doctor, you may proceed directly to the emergency room for the fastest evaluation and treatment.Your doctor will ask you for a travel history, as places to which you have travelled is a key factor in diagnosing typhoid fever.;
, Typhoid fever is most commonly caused by the bacteria ""Salmonella typhi.""Humans are carriers of the disease, and it is passed on via fecal-oral transmission. What this means is that fecal remnants get on someone's hands, and then they touch food or water, which is subsequently ingested by another who then becomes infected with the disease.


People can also become carriers of the disease, without necessarily knowing it, and this can contribute to disease outbreaks.Typhoid fever is most prominent in under-developed countries, where hand hygiene is less enforced.

, The illness usually takes about 1-2 weeks to present with symptoms after it has entered your system (so there is a delay post exposure).Once symptoms begin to appear, they typically last 3-4 weeks and then remit if appropriate medical treatment is administered. Common signs and symptoms include:


A fever which gradually worsens (up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit)
Poor appetite
Fatigue
Bowel disturbances (diarrhea or constipation)
Headaches
Often abdominal pain and discomfort
Sometimes chest congestion
Note that, even after treatment, 10% of people have a relapse of symptoms.Therefore, always be on the watch for these symptoms if you suspect you may have typhoid fever, or may be developing a relapse.

, If you have typhoid fever, the following tests can be used to aid in diagnosis:


A stool test can look for the presence of ""Salmonella typhi"" bacteria in your stool. Since the bacteria initially enter your body via the gastrointestinal tract, it can often first be detected in the stool.If a stool test is inconclusive, your doctor will likely proceed to blood tests.The infection quickly spreads from the GI tract to various other parts of the body, so can be most often be detected in the blood as well.

, If a stool test and/or a blood test is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis of typhoid fever, your doctor may proceed with a urine analysis or bone marrow test.Both of these methods can also be successful at diagnosing typhoid fever, since it tends to be widespread throughout the body.


A bone marrow test is more complicated to conduct, but it is also the most precise method to confirm the presence of the ""Salmonella typhi"" bacteria in your body., If typhoid fever is confirmed, it is generally treated with antibiotics.Cipro and Rocephin are the two most commonly prescribed antibiotics for typhoid fever. Take the antibiotics as directed by your physician.


Prior to the use of antibiotics, about 20% of people died of typhoid fever. It can be a very serious illness, and this is why prompt medical evaluation and following through with treatment are key.

, You may start to feel better once you are taking a prescribed antibiotic that is effective against the strain of typhoid you are carrying. Even if you feel better, continue to take the full course of antibiotics prescribed.This type of bacteria lingers. It likes to live in the gastrointestinal tract of people that are infected.
Take steps to be sure you are rid of the bacteria before you prepare food for others or care for small children.
Some states will not allow you to work in areas of food preparation or child care until your doctor clears you. This involves repeated testing of stool samples or blood cultures to be sure you are no longer carrying Salmonella typhi.

, Since the bacteria lives in the gastrointestinal tract, it is easy to pass the infection on to someone else if it gets on your hands.Use warm soap and water and wash your hands carefully after using the bathroom.
Continue doing this until you have been cleared by your doctor that you no longer have any signs of ""Salmonella typhi"" in your body.

, Even though you have been treated, you may still be carrying the bacteria and are at risk for getting sick again.Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any symptoms that may indicate a relapse.

, If you plan to travel to underdeveloped countries, talk to your doctor about receiving a vaccination to prevent contracting typhoid fever. In the United States, vaccinations are available as both oral doses and injections.Oral doses are given in the form of capsules. This is a series of four doses given every other day. You should complete the series at least one week before your travel. This type of vaccination requires boosters every five years.
Injectable vaccines require only one dose and should be completed at least two weeks before your travel. Vaccines by injection require boosters every two years.
If you have ever had an episode or infection of typhoid fever, let your doctor know this before you get vaccinated.
If you are a carrier, then you should not receive the vaccine.

Monitor for blurred vision.,
Watch for any weakness.,
Check for other symptoms.",How to Diagnose Orthostatic Hypotension1," The most common symptom of orthostatic hypotension is being dizzy when you stand up. This can happen after sitting or lying down for a time. The dizziness or lightheadedness generally only lasts for a few seconds.You may find that the world spins around you and you need to grab onto something or sit back down for a moment.;
, Another symptom of this condition is blurry vision. When you stand, you may experience blurry or unclear vision. This may linger for a few seconds after the dizziness or lightheadedness has passed.Your head may also begin to hurt., You may feel weak after standing and feeling dizzy. Your body may suddenly feel fatigued. In more severe cases, you may faint due to the lightheadedness and weakness.You may start to tremble, and you may feel some heart palpitations., The other symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are confusion. This generally occurs in conjunction with the dizziness. While feeling light headed, or right after, you may be monetarily confused.After standing and being dizzy, you may feel nauseous.
Sometimes, you may feel chest pain or cold in your extremities."

Know what causes dengue.,
Recognize the signs and symptoms of dengue.,
Use a thermometer to identify fever.,
Take note of an intense headache.,
Notice pain behind your eyes.,
Look out for any excessive bleeding.,
Keep an eye out for rashes.,
Know how dengue is diagnosed.","How to Differentiate Between Malaria, Dengue, and Chikungunya2"," There are four types of dengue viruses, all of which all of which are spread by mosquito. Humans are the primary host of the disease and it is a very common illness in tropical areas.When a mosquito is infected by the virus, it will spread the virus through its saliva when it bites.
Dengue can also be transmitted from human to human. For example, infected blood used in a blood transfusion can cause dengue. Even organ donation and mother to child transmission are possible.

, The incubation period of dengue (period before which symptoms are visible) is about 3-14 days. Your symptoms may vary, depending upon the type of the virus and your level of immunity.The virus will circulate around your body after infection, attacking white blood cells and other antibodies, which will compromise your immune system.
The virus will further replicate within the cell until the cell bursts and dies, releasing cytokines that initiate the inflammatory response of the body as it tries to ward off the virus.
The death of the white blood cells will trigger leakage of other fluids from the cells, leading to hypoproteinemia (low protein), hypoalbuminema (low albumin), pleural effusion (fluid in the lungs), ascites (fluid in the stomach area), hypotension (low blood pressure), shock, and eventually death.

, A high fever will take place as a result of the body’s effort to suppress the virus.Like any other type of systemic infection, the body will increase its temperature to kill the virus.

, Intense headache is reported by most dengue patients.The exact reason for the headache is not known, but it is probably related to the high fever.
Increased body temperature can irritate the nerves of the head and cause a gnawing, radiating head pain.

, Dengue-related eye pain is often exacerbated when there is bright light in the room.The pain is characterized as dull and deep.
The eye pain is a side effect of the intense headache. Since nerve endings in the head share the same pathway, pain can be felt not just in the head, but also in the eyes.

, Widespread bleeding can occur, because the virus attacks your capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body.When the capillaries burst, blood escapes to outside the blood stream.
Blood pressure decreases as blood leaves the body, eventually leading to internal bleeding, shock, and death.
During a severe case, bleeding is more common in the nose and gums, where small blood vessels are located.
Your pulse may also become weak due to the decreasing blood volume in your body.

, As your fever decreases, skin rashes may start to appear.The rash is reddish, and similar to a measles rash.
The rash is caused by the bursting of small capillaries.

, The diagnosis of dengue is done through performing a physical exam, taking the history of the illness, and doing laboratory tests.Your doctor will try to identify your signs and symptoms. He will take into account whether or not you live in, or have recently visited, a common dengue area.
Your doctor will suspect dengue if there are warning signs such as abdominal pain, liver enlargement, mouth bleeding, low platelet and white blood cell counts, restlessness, and decreased pulse.
Your doctor may use an ELISA test to identify immunoglobins in your bloodstream that are unique to dengue infection.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of chikungunya.,
Notice rash and fever.,
Take note of any muscle or joint pain.,
Recognize a loss of taste.,
Get a chikungunya diagnosis.","How to Differentiate Between Malaria, Dengue, and Chikungunya3"," This virus is transmitted through mosquitoes and was recently declared as an emerging global health threat.


How the virus affects the body is not fully known, however, chikungunya and dengue have almost identical symptoms and disease processes.
Chikungunya infects the muscle cells of the body. From there, it reproduces until the cell dies, and then replicates and finds a new host cell to infect.

, The incubation period of the chikungunya is 1 to 12 days. Chikungunya usually attack the muscles, joints, skin, connective tissues, and even the central nervous system.

, Because chikungunya is a systemic infection, it is usually accompanied by fever and skin rash.


The skin rashes are almost identical to the rashes that are present in a case of dengue, and is a result of damage to the blood vessels.
Fever occurs as the body raises its temperature in an attempt to kill the infectious agent.
As a consequence of the fever, you may suffer from headache, nausea and vomiting.

, Because the virus destroys cells in the muscles and joints, you will experience muscle weakness and joint pain.


Joint and muscle pain can be severe and acute.

, Partial loss of taste is reported by many chikungunya patients.


This happens because the virus attacks nerve endings on the tongue and desensitizes the taste buds.

, Acquiring an accurate diagnosis is very important to get the right treatment.


A virus isolation is the most conclusive exam used to diagnose chikungunya. However, it takes 1 to 2 weeks before it is completed and should be done in a biosafety level 3 lab, which is not available in many developing countries where chikungunya is prevalent.

The technique involves acquiring a blood sample from the patient and then introducing the virus to it. The blood sample will then be observed for specific responses.


RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) makes the genes of chikungunya more pronounced and shows evidence of the disease. The result can be obtained in 1-2 days.
An ELISA assay can be used to measure the levels of immunoglobin to identify the chikungunya virus. Results can be obtained within 2-3 days.

"

Understand that the diseases are carried by different types of mosquitoes.,
Recognize that the infectious agents are different as well.,
Notice the differences in incubation periods.,
Pay attention to differences in symptoms.,
Get different diagnostic tests to differentiate the three diseases.","How to Differentiate Between Malaria, Dengue, and Chikungunya4"," Dengue and chikungunya are commonly transmitted by the Aedes aegypti.However, malaria is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito.

, Malaria is caused by anopheles, which is a protozoan.


Dengue and Chikungunya are both viral infections.
The former is caused by the dengue virus, while the latter is caused by Alphavirus.

, Dengue has a shorter incubation period, usually ranging from 3 to 4 days.


Chikungunya will take around 1 week before its signs are obvious.
Malaria will take at least 2 weeks to show symptoms.

, The main differences between dengue and chikungunya lie in some of their signs and symptoms.


Most obviously, dengue is associated with low platelet count, high bleeding risk, and pain behind the eyes, whereas chikungunya does not exhibit these symptoms.
Both dengue and chikungunya display joint pain, however, chikungunya’s joint pain and inflammation are more intense and pronounced.
Malaria is best known for paroxysm, the cycle of chills/shivering, then fever/sweating. This cycle usually occurs every two days., Though signs and symptoms may serve as rough guidelines for diagnosis, laboratory and diagnostic exams are needed to confirm a specific disease.


Malaria is diagnosed via blood film.
Dengue and chikungunya are often diagnosed through ELISA.

Check for dehydration.,
Determine if you have a preexisting related condition.,
Remain cautious after periods of bed rest.,
Track your alcohol consumption.,
Avoid exposure to heat.,
Determine if you have a heart condition.,
Decide if your medication puts you at risk.",How to Diagnose Orthostatic Hypotension2," Dehydration is a common cause for orthostatic hypotension. This dehydration may be caused from bleeding, diarrhea, or vomiting. Elevated blood sugar levels can also cause it.Taking medication that are diuretics can also cause dehydration.

, A risk factor for orthostatic hypotension is a preexisting condition that can cause it. There are multiple conditions that can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly when you stand up. These include:Pregnancy
Anemia
Parkinson's
Diabetes
Adrenal problems
Thyroid conditions
Any heart conditions

, Orthostatic hypotension is likely to occur after long periods of bed rest. If you have been on bed rest for any medical condition, be careful standing or rising for the first time., Drinking alcohol can increase the likelihood of orthostatic hypotension. Alcohol can cause dehydration, which also increases your risk of orthostatic hypotension. Limit how much you drink, or avoid alcohol entirely., Heat may cause you to sweat, which can cause you to become dehydrated. It can also lower your blood pressure. These can all cause orthostatic hypotension, so be careful when you are in hot environments., Heart conditions can lead to this sudden drop in blood pressure because of the irregularity of the way the heart works due to the condition. Heart attacks and heart failure may put you at risk.Irregular heart rhythms can cause this drop in blood pressure, as can valve disease.

, Different medications can cause this condition. Beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, and other blood pressure medication can lead to this condition. You are more at risk if you take these medications with a preexisting condition that puts you at risk.Anxiety and depression medications can also increase your risk.
Medications for erectile dysfunction and Parkinson’s can also cause this condition.

Visit your doctor.,
Have your blood pressure checked.,
Get blood tests.,
Undergo heart tests.,
Undergo other tests.",How to Diagnose Orthostatic Hypotension3," Orthostatic hypotension can range from mild to severe. If you have a mild case of it, you probably don’t need to go to the doctor. However, if you experience the symptoms frequently, or you are at risk, you may want to visit your doctor.Mild cases are when you feel the occasional dizziness after standing after sitting in a hot tub or sitting for a long period of time. A moderate case is when you experience it almost every time you stand up.
When you go to the doctor, try to let your doctor know what symptoms you’ve experienced, how often they occur, and how long they lasted.
They will also ask you for a medical history.

, The first thing your doctor will do is measure your blood pressure. They will take your blood pressure while you are lying down and while standing. Generally, your BP will be taken after five minutes lying down, and one minute after standing and then three minutes after standing.Your heart rate will be measured at the same time as your blood pressure.
Orthostatic hypotension will be diagnosed if your systolic blood pressure drops 20 points or your diastolic blood pressure drops 10 points within two to five minutes of standing up.

, Blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the condition. Blood tests can check for electrolyte imbalances, low blood sugar and anemia. These two conditions can lead to orthostatic hypotension.Skin tests may be done to determine if you are dehydrated., An electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram can be done to check your heart. Both of these tests are noninvasive tests. An ECG tests the rhythm of your heart. It looks for any irregularities to that or the the structure of your heart. It will also monitor the blood and oxygen supply in your heart.An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of your heart. This test produces an image of the heart. This test is used to look for structural problems or heart disease.

, If the doctor needs more evidence, you will go through other tests. A stress test monitors your heart rate while you are exercising, like walking on a treadmill. This is done sometimes in conjunction with an ECG or echocardiogram.A valsalva maneuver test is when you take deep breaths as the doctor monitors your blood pressure and heart rate.
A tilt table test is given if you faint due to the condition. This test monitors your body’s response when you are put into an upright position after lying down for awhile. You lie on a table that gradually goes from horizontal to vertical. The doctor monitors your blood pressure during this test.

Be aware of the effect of asthma.,

These sensations are not a guarantee of lung hyperinflation. They are, however, warning signs when experienced with other symptoms., Coughing is a common side-effect of certain pulmonary illnesses as well as smoking. Lung hyperinflation leads to a chronic, wheezing cough that interrupts normal daily functions.


If you have hyper-inflated lungs, you may have difficulty walking up hills and succumb to coughing easily. If you have a chronic cough that does not go away for two weeks, you should see a doctor for a diagnosis.Listen for a whistling sound when air is drawn into the lung. This can indicate reduced elasticity of the lung, a symptom of lung hyperinflation., Other changes in the body, when combined with the above symptoms, may point to lung hyperinflation. Watch for the following symptoms: Frequent bouts of sicknesses like bronchitis
Weight loss
Waking up at night
Swollen ankles
Fatigue

, Your doctor will make an initial assessment of your condition by gathering information about your past and present health history. Significant factors that can indicate lung hyperinflation are:


A family history of lung conditions, like lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Present habits, like vigorous exercise or smoking
Living environment, such as living in a polluted city or with a smoker
Active medical conditions like asthma or mental health conditions like chronic anxiety, A chest x-ray generates an image of the lungs, air passages, the heart, blood vessels, and the bones of your chest and spine. A chest x-ray can be used to gauge whether lungs are hyperinflated.


An x-ray can show fluid and air around the lungs, signifying an underlying problem like COPD or cancer. This can be the cause of lung hyperinflation and the sooner you get the disease diagnosed the better.Lung hyperinflation is present when the x-ray shows the front of the fifth or sixth rib meeting the middle of your diaphragm. More than six front ribs touching your diaphragm is consistent with hyperinflation., CT scans are an imaging method that uses x-rays to produce a three-dimensional representation of the body.The pictures generated by the machine illustrate the scope of lung damage and hyperinflation.


A CT scan can show an increase in lung size and may even show air trapped in one or both lungs. Trapped air usually appears as black on an x-ray screen.
A special dye is sometimes used in CT scans to highlight the areas x-rayed. This is usually given by mouth, by enema, or by injection but is fairly rare for a CT scan focusing on the chest. During the scan, you'll have to wear a hospital gown and remove any items, like jewelry and eyeglasses, that may interfere with the scan.During a CT scan, you'll lie on a motorized table and your body will be inserted into a donut-shaped machine. A technologist will communicate with you from another room. He or she may ask you to hold your breath at certain points during the scan. The procedure is painless and usually takes around 30 minutes., Pulmonary function tests are tests that measure breathing capacity and overall pulmonary function.To confirm a diagnosis of lung hyperinflation, two numerical values are assessed during a pulmonary function test.


FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second): This is the amount of air that can be blown out of your lungs in the first 1 second.
FVC (Forced Vital Capacity): This reflect the total amount of air that you can exhale.
The normal results of FEV1/FVC ratio should be more than 70 percent. Less than this percentage indicates lung hyperinflation, since a patient with this condition cannot blow air out as fast as a healthy person does.
During the test, a doctor will use medical instruments to measure your breath. While usually painless, you may experience some shortness of breath as it involves forced, rapid breathing. Do not smoke four to six hours before the test and do not eat a heavy meal beforehand., COPD is present when there is an obstruction in your lungs that disrupts airflow. COPD is usually treated by monitoring and controlling symptoms through a combination of medical assistance and lifestyle changes. Hyperinflation of the lungs is frequently caused by COPD. If you've previously been diagnosed with COPD, this could increase your risk for lung hyperinflation.To treat COPD, your doctor will recommend a combination of lifestyle changes and prescription medications. If you are a smoker, it's important you quit. Making symptoms of COPD worse by neglecting medication or continuing to smoke can increase your risk of lung hyperinflation., Asthma is caused by inflammation of the airways. Depending on the severity of an asthma attack, swelling can disrupt air flow to the lungs. Over time, this can result in lung hyperinflation. Treatment of asthma usually involves building an action plan with your doctor about medication, lifestyle changes, and how to manage asthma attacks when they occur. Talk to your doctor about better managing your asthma as to avoid lung hyperinflation., Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease that may affect several organs and systems in your body. It is an inherited disorder of the exocrine gland, characterized by an abnormal production of mucus that tends to be much thicker and stickier than usual, which can plug your airways. As with anything that blocks airways, cystic fibrosis can lead to lung hyperinflation. If you have cystic fibrosis, you are at an increased risk of lung hyperinflation.

It might make it a bit easier on you if your doctor broaches the subject first, but you are better off taking charge and making sure you discuss the topic when you are healthy and capable enough to determine and express your wishes.In the U.S., Medicare now reimburses doctors $86 for having a specific end of life care discussion with a patient, which adds one more stamp of legitimacy to the importance of having this talk.;
, Don’t spring the topic on your doctor right at the end of a checkup — this is a discussion that deserves a dedicated and sufficient amount of time. Call the office and specify that you’d like to make an appointment to discuss end of life care.Make the appointment and plan to have the talk before you feel you “need to.” It is easy to wait too long and find yourself having to make difficult decisions (or unable to make them) in the midst of a rapid decline in health. A sound mind and body make for the best end of life care discussions.

, Talking about your death with loved ones can be even more difficult than talking with your doctor, but it is no less essential. If you want to ensure that your care wishes are followed, you need to make sure that everyone close to you clearly understands them and is “on the same page.”You may find it easier to talk to one or a few family members first, or you may prefer to talk to everyone at once in coordination with a family gathering. But don’t spring it on them unannounced during Thanksgiving dinner. Schedule a family meeting and identify the topic beforehand.
The Conversation Project website offers a wealth of information on how to broach the subject and get the discussion going, including checklists, quizzes, and other materials that can help you define your goals and wishes., Prior to attending the meeting with your doctor, take some time to brush up on your terminal medical condition (if known to you at the time) and some of the basic terms and concepts that are likely to be discussed. For instance, be sure you understand terms like “CPR,” “intubation,” and “healthcare proxy.”The more informed you are about your condition, general prognosis, and likely treatment options, the more time you can spend during the meeting talking about your care preferences. That said, allow the doctor to do his or her job and utilize medical expertise to provide you with important information and alternatives.

, If you have already selected your spouse, child, sibling, best friend, or someone else as your “healthcare proxy” — that is, the person you want to make your care decisions when you are incapable of doing so — then strongly consider bringing this person along on the appointment. If not, still consider bringing someone you trust and with whom you can discuss sensitive issues freely. This person can take notes and help ensure that you cover the topics that you feel are most important.Inform the doctor beforehand that you want to bring someone you trust into the conversation. You may have to provide legal authorization to allow the person to discuss your health condition with the doctor. If there are parts of the meeting in which you would prefer to talk to the doctor one-on-one, let the person know beforehand so he or she can exit gracefully.
If there is no one you can or want to bring to the meeting, don’t use that as an excuse not to have the discussion. Going alone is infinitely better than not going at all.

, Before getting into your specific care preferences, start the conversation by establishing the things that are most important to you in regards to the end stage of your life. Is more time or greater quality of life more important? Do you intend to fight to the last breath, or can you be at peace with letting go as the end nears? Is it essential that you live out your last days at home? Are you determined not to be a burden, and if so, what does that mean to you? How important is your pain control?


By identifying the “big picture” priorities first, you can then work with your doctor to decide how the particulars of your condition, prognosis, estimated time remaining, and care options can be navigated in a manner consistent with your larger goals.Take some notes beforehand, or fill out a form designed to help facilitate the process of conducting an end of life discussion., Whether your terminal condition is new or has been known to you for quite a while, ask the doctor to run down (in layman’s terms) its particulars, how it will impact your body moving forward, the treatment options available and what they will do to you, and how much time (and quality time) you can expect to have left.Especially if your doctor is not entirely comfortable with having the end of life discussion, use simple, straightforward, leading questions to get the information you desire: “What can I expect from this illness?” “What types of improvement could this/that treatment offer?” “What can I expect if I refuse treatment?”
Ask for further clarifications and repeated responses as needed. Make sure you are entirely comfortable with the knowledge you have regarding your condition moving forward.

, The conversation should be a true give-and-take, and you should rely on your doctor’s knowledge, training, and experience. In the end, however, it is your life and your death. If you know what you want, and what you want is reasonable in relation to the nature of your condition, be clear and persistent and expect your doctor to accept your wishes.If you are sure that you don’t want to be put on any type of artificial life support, for instance, be clear and consistent on this point and ask your doctor to help you formulate an end of life plan that prioritizes this choice.

, If it’s perfectly fine to be sure about your end of life preferences before having the discussion with your doctor, it’s equally all right to be unsure as this initial meeting concludes. Start the process early enough so that you have all the time you need to make these important choices. If it takes multiple meetings to do so, so be it.The whole point of having an end of life discussion with your doctor is to avoid having to make snap decisions about your care preferences in the midst of a crisis — or for your family to have to do so without clear directives from you. Don’t rush what doesn’t need to be rushed. This is the last set of important decisions you will make in your life, so make it count.

, Once you have identified and clarified your care wishes with your doctor, you should make them legally binding so as to ensure that they are followed. Your doctor can help you with this process, or you can consult an attorney. Strongly consider preparing the following documents according to the laws in force where you reside:An “advance directive” appoints your healthcare proxy (the person who will make medical decisions in your stead) and spells out your living will (your wishes on medical interventions, resuscitation, feeding tubes, etc.). For U.S. residents, state-specific and legally-binding forms are available for download online.A “medical order” (sometimes referred to as a POLST) adds extra “teeth” to your advance directive and binds all medical professionals to abide by your stated wishes in all circumstances. It is attached to your electronic health record so that it is available to any medical personnel treating you. Medical orders are currently valid in most but not all U.S. states. Visit http://www.polst.org/ for more information.

, Ideally, the end of life discussion you initiate with your doctor should continue for the remainder of your life. Planning ahead is essential, but it is impossible to predict exactly what your end of life experience will entail or how it will impact your views and choices.Think of every decision you make as being “for now,” not necessarily “forever.” You have every right to change your mind about anything related to your end of life care. Keep talking with your doctor and your loved ones and keep updating your plan and your wishes as needed.

, No end of life decisions are set in stone; as your condition progresses and other circumstances change, you might change your mind about some of your choices. This is normal and good, but make sure that you express your new wishes to your doctor and family just as clearly as before.For instance, you may have been adamant about stopping any additional cancer treatments, but then find out that your granddaughter is pregnant and want to put up your best fight to be around for the birth. Or, you may decide that you need to appoint a more trustworthy healthcare proxy.
For that matter, you may even decide that you need to find a new doctor. If your physician is reluctant to discuss end of life concerns, or adamantly disagrees with your decisions, consider finding a new doctor. You deserve to have a supportive doctor by your side as you enter your life’s last phase., People tend to wait too long to talk about end of life care, and they also usually wait too long to seek out hospice care. Generally speaking, as soon as you have a prognosis of six months or fewer to live, you are eligible for hospice care. Yet most people wait until right near the end of life and miss out on the comfort and care that hospice can provide, usually in your own home.

, Acute pancreatitis, as the name suggests, comes on suddenly. It is a pain that is constantly present, and often feels like a stabbing sensation that gets worse after eating. If your pain comes on gradually, or has been present for a long time, it is likely from another cause.

, It could mean something else such as a gut infection or food poisoning.

, Excess alcohol consumption is the number one risk factor in the development of pancreatitis; therefore, it is key to be honest and upfront with your doctor about how much alcohol you drink and how frequently.Another major risk factor for acute pancreatitis is a history of gallstones.
If you have had gallstones once (or more times) in the past, it is more likely for them to return, and they can provoke an episode of acute pancreatitis.

, If you present to the Emergency Room (or to your doctor) with acute abdominal pain, one of the quickest ways to identify a pancreas-related cause is to test your pancreas function via blood tests. If you have elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in your blood, this means that your pancreas is under stress. It indicates to your doctor that you may very well be suffering from pancreatitis as opposed to another condition.Elevated serum amylase and lipase in your blood point toward pancreatitis as the underlying cause. This is the number on symptom for pancreatic problems. Amylase and lipase are the pancreatic enzymes that leak out into the blood of the pancreas when it becomes inflamed. Elevated amylase levels can can be seen in other problems with the stomach and liver, but lipase is very specific to the pancreas.
Other results that are important when testing for acute pancreatitis include elevations in C reactive protein and interleukins.

, An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a procedure in which an ultrasound probe with a camera is inserted down your esophagus, through your stomach, and down the first part of your small intestine toward the pancreas. It provides a much more detailed view of the pancreas, and it can provide your doctor with valuable information as to the specific underlying cause of your pancreatitis.An EUS also evaluates the upper GI tract (esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine) en route to getting to the pancreas.
Therefore, an EUS can help to include or rule out other upper GI causes that could be the reason for your abdominal pain.

, If you have acute abdominal pain, your doctor may order a CT scan. A CT scan provides a detailed image of the abdominal anatomy allowing doctors to recognize many different medical conditions.You will be laying down while the imaging device surrounds you (there is plenty of space so it is not claustrophobic), and the process only takes a few minutes.


Acute pancreatitis may present with gallstones on the CT scan (as this is a common cause for pancreatitis).
The CT scan will likely also show generalized pancreas inflammation.

, Because the pain of acute pancreatitis can be quite severe, and worse with eating and drinking, the hospital is the best place for you to receive care until your condition resolves enough for you to resume daily life. A few days in hospital may be sufficient, or it may take longer depending upon the severity of your pancreatitis.The mainstay treatment of acute pancreatitis is fluid replacement and pain control.

, For the first couple of days in hospital, your doctor will advise that you do not eat or drink as refraining from these things will give your pancreas a ""rest"" and allow it to recover. As your pancreas recovers, you can gradually return to eating and drinking. You will normally start by drinking clear fluids, then by adding in some bland foods and, when your condition is mostly better, you may resume your normal diet.In severe cases of pancreatitis, a feeding tube may be necessary to get you the nutrients and calories you need while your pancreas recovers.You will always be given IV fluids to stay hydrated during acute pancreatitis, and basic calories (sugars) can be given through the IV line as well., The strength of pain medication that your doctor offers you will depend upon the severity of your pain. In worse cases of acute pancreatitis, you will likely receive an opioid (narcotic) pain medication. When you are discharged from the hospital and your pain has mostly resolved, over-the-counter pain medications may be sufficient to control any residual pain, if your pain has not yet completely resolved., Once your pain has been controlled and your condition stabilized, your doctor will want to identify and then treat the cause of your acute pancreatitis.Common causes and treatments include:Gallstones — These can be removed surgically, and your gallbladder may need to be removed as well.
Bile duct obstructions — You will likely receive a procedure (called ERCP) to open or widen your bile duct, and to repair any damage that is found. Damaged or dead pancreas tissue may also need to be removed, and this may require surgery. This will be completed after the inflammation resolves and you are healed.
Alcohol dependence — Excess alcohol consumption is the number one risk factor for developing acute pancreatitis. If alcohol problems are the issue, it is key to receive treatment for this. Talk to your doctor there are rehabilitation clinics and 12 Step programs that are available if you have a serious problem with drinking.

Recognize that a person with sensory processing disorder (SPD) will have a mix of traits.,
Be aware that SPD is not limited to childhood.,
Recognize that SPD is not emotional, but physiological.,
Recognize conditions that may co-occur or be mistaken for SPD.,
Talk to an occupational therapist, or someone else who specializes in SPD.,
Recognize that SPD can be treated through a ""sensory diet"" and/or sensory integration therapy.",How to Diagnose Sensory Processing Disorder1,"

Some senses may be over-sensitive, and some may be under-sensitive.
Not all traits will apply to a person. For example, someone who is over-sensitive to touch may only fit half the bullet points listed. This is normal, and it is still worth getting an evaluation.;
, People of any age may have SPD, and children do not necessarily ""grow out of it"" (although some do)., People don't ""do it on purpose,"" and trying to control their SPD would take tremendous amount of energy. It is best for people to be understanding and accommodating to a person with different sensory needs.

Punishing a child with SPD will not magically make them sit still, eat chili without crying, stop finger flicking, et cetera—but it will cause a lot of stress and make them stop trusting you.

, Talk to a professional to consider and rule out anything that could be affecting the person.

Most autistic people have SPD. Autistic people tend to experience passionate interests, confusion in social situations, repetitive movements, and disorganization.
Sensory seeking could look similar to hyperactive type ADHD, and sensory sensitivity could look like inattentive type ADHD. (People with ADHD may also have SPD.)
Visual under-sensitivity could be mistaken for dyslexia or other disabilities that impact reading and learning.
Auditory under-sensitivity could be mistaken for being hard of hearing.

, While SPD is not an official diagnosis under the DSM 5, it can be identified and treated by a specialist.

Expect to fill out a questionnaire about sensory responses. If a child is being evaluated, a parent/guardian will be given a form to answer about the child, and the child will be given one to fill themselves if they are old enough.

, A sensory diet means incorporating sensory activities into their lifestyle, to help reduce sensory issues. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy and can help come up with a sensory diet tailored to the person's need."

Look for blood in your stool.,
Take note if you have chronic watery diarrhea.,
Pay attention to abdominal pain.,
Watch out for loss of appetite and weight loss.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Get a referral for a colonoscopy.,
Become familiar with other diagnostic tests.,
Start with anti-inflammatory drugs.,
Talk to your doctor about immune system suppressors.,
Consider surgery only as a last resort.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ulcerative Colitis," The most common symptom of UC is blood in the stool (poop).It may be in the form of fresh red blood, a mixture with mucus or a streak on the surface of a hard stool. A bloody stool indicates bleeding in the digestive system somewhere. If it's bright red in color then it signifies bleeding from the colon or rectum.


The blood may also be accompanied by pus (dead white blood cells).
Blood in the stool is also a common symptom of colon and stomach cancers.
Blood that looks like coffee grinds comes from the upper digestive system, such as the stomach or small intestine.;
, Many types of problems in the digestive system cause diarrhea, so it's not specific to UC, but the timing of it is important.Watery diarrhea after taking a meal or at nighttime is indicative of UC. This happens because the intestines rapidly push the digested fecal material past the ulcerated area to avoid aggravating the inflammation.


Although acute (short term) diarrhea usually passes quickly, chronic diarrhea for more than a few weeks is a sign of a significant digestive tract problem.
If the rectum becomes really swollen from UC, the intestines will slow down the digestive process to spare the rectum from holding feces for a prolonged period. Consequently, constipation can occur after long bouts of diarrhea.
Diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration, so keep yourself well hydrated by drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water daily.

, Along with cramping from chronic diarrhea, another sign of UC is vague lower or central abdominal pain.The pain is from the ulceration through the mucosal layers of the large intestine/bowel. There's not as many nerve endings there as other places on your skin, the pain is more vague and often described as a mild-to-moderate burning sensation.


This type of pain is very different from that caused by Crohn’s disease (another type of IBD) or appendicitis, which are usually felt in the lower right side of the abdomen.
The burning abdominal pain of UC is usually not relieved by defecation (taking a poop).

, With UC, the body's immune system is constantly activated and trying to heal the ulcers, and the chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain often causes nausea. Consequently, people with UC typically lose their appetite, eat less and start to drop a significant amount of weight.People with UC often avoid food in efforts to reduce irritating the intestinal ulcers, although it doesn't usually make the pain much better. This situation can mimic the wasting phase of cancer, called cachexia.


Eat small, healthy meals with plenty of fresh produce, whole grains and lean fish. Avoid processed and refined foods, especially spicy types, and dairy products.
By not eating, people with UC are at higher risk of developing nutritional deficiencies. As such, consider supplementing with multivitamins and minerals.
Chronic fatigue and a mild fever are other factors with UC that contribute to loss of appetite and weight loss.

, If you notice any of the above-mentioned intestinal symptoms, make an appointment with your family doctor as soon as you can. Your doctor is likely not an internal specialist, but they can take a stool sample and send you for blood tests to help confirm a diagnosis of UC.Other conditions that cause similar symptoms to UC include: Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, colon cancer, intestinal infection (bacterial, fungal, parasitic), food poisoning and appendicitis.Red blood cells and white blood cells (due to an immune response) in your stool can indicate UC. A stool sample can also help rule out other conditions, particularly intestinal infections.
Blood tests are ordered to check for anemia (common consequence of UC due to internal bleeding and loss of red blood cells and iron) and potential infections.
Low albumin or protein in blood samples is a common finding in patients with severe UC., Your doctor can refer you to a specialist (gastroenterologist) to get a colonoscopy, which is exam that allows visualization of your entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a camera on the end.The ""scope"" is definitive for diagnosing UC and determining how advanced the disease is. Continuous deep ulcers throughout the mucosal lining of the colon is indicative of UC, whereas Crohn's disease is characterized by intermittent (noncontinuous) ulcers that can occur anywhere along the GI tract.For a colonoscopy, the patient lays on a table while the doctor inserts the scope into the anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the large intestine (colon).
If the doctor suspects UC, they will take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the patient's colon/rectum with the scope and look at it under a microscope for telltale signs.

, Your family doctor/gastroenterologist can also order other diagnostic tests to rule in or rule out UC, such as sigmoidoscopy, abdominal x-rays, CT scan, MRI and/or chromoendoscopy.Check with your health insurance plan to make sure these test are covered under your plan.


A flexible sigmoidoscopy is like a mini-colonoscopy — just for the last portion of your colon called the sigmoid. If your colon is severely inflamed, your doctor may do only a sigmoidoscopy to save you the discomfort.
If your symptoms are severe, your doctor may take abdominal x-rays with a contrast material to rule out complications, such as a perforated colon.
A CT scan can distinguish between UC and other types of IBD and can also determine how much of the colon is inflamed/ulcerated.
A chromoendoscopy uses a scope and sprayed dye to highlight abnormal tissue changes in the colon, because a serious risk associated with UC is colon cancer., While no drugs can cure UC, many can reduce symptoms and improve a person's quality of life. Anti-inflammatory medications are typically the first step in the treatment of UC and other types of IBD.They most common ones to start with include: aminosalicylates and corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisone and hydrocortisone.


Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) is an aminosalicylate that's effective in combating the inflammatory symptoms of UC, but it tends to trigger a number of side effects.
Other aminosalicylates include mesalamine, balsalazide and olsalazine. All are available in oral and suppository (anal) forms.
You may need to take an enema, which involves flushing dissolved medication into your rectum using a special wash bottle.
Corticosteroids are usually only used for moderate-to-severe UC that doesn't respond well to other medical treatments. They are only given short term, but still tend to cause lots of side effects, including: puffy face, reduced immune response, night sweats, insomnia and osteoporosis., These powerful medications reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, which is helpful if the ulceration is caused by an autoimmune (hyperactive immune) response.These immunosuppressors are typically taken as tablets by mouth. Corticosteroids are also used in conjunction with immune system suppressors, which include: azathioprine, mercaptopurine, cyclosporine, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and vedolizumab.


Azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) are the most used immune system suppressors for UC and other types of IBD. However, these drugs can be hard on your liver and pancreas.
Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune) is usually reserved for cases of UC that don't respond well to other drugs. Serious side effects are relatively common with cyclosporine use.
Infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira) and golimumab (Simponi) are known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors or biologics, and recommended for moderate-to-severe UC. They work by neutralizing proteins produced by your immune system.
Vedolizumab (Entyvio) is the most recent drug approved for UC. It works by blocking inflammatory cells from getting to the site of the ulceration and making things worse.

, Surgery can often eliminate or cure UC, but it usually means removing your entire colon and rectum in a procedure called a proctocolectomy.In many cases, you can also get a procedure done (ileoanal anastomosis) that eliminates the need to wear a collection bag for your stool. However, in other cases, a bag is attached to an opening in your abdomen (ileal stoma) to collect the stool.


Full recovery from a proctocolectomy takes between 4-6 weeks.Without a colon, the ability to reabsorb water and produce vitamin B12 from friendly bacteria is severely disrupted. Immune function is usually reduced also.

Check your family history.,
Take note of your symptoms.,
Talk to your doctor.,

Call 911 if your throat starts swelling.,
Avoid taking antihistamines for unexplained symptoms.,
Choose a treatment option based on your type of angioedema.,
Make special considerations for children.,
Learn about hereditary angioedema.,
Understand that this disease is usually genetic.,
Be aware that this disease is commonly misdiagnosed.",How to Diagnose Hereditary Angiodema," This disorder is autosomal dominant. This means that is likely that one of your parents or another family member has it as well. If you are adopted and are worried about having this disorder, you may be able to get a genetic test.
, Unfortunately, the symptoms of hereditary angioedema are often confused with other, more common diseases. Thus, this disease is often misdiagnosed. Your doctor may do many tests to rule out other underlying issues.Common symptoms of hereditary angioedema include: swelling in the throat that makes it difficult to breathe and/or talk, cramping in the stomach for no obvious reason, unexplained swelling in the extremities (e.g. arms, legs, genitals, tongue, etc.), and/or an unexplained red rash on the skin that isn’t itchy.

, The only way to diagnose hereditary angioedema definitively is to have a blood test conducted by a doctor. Therefore, you’ll need to visit your doctor and discuss the matter with them. Explain to your doctor what it is that makes you think you have hereditary angioedema.


Bring along any medications you are taking. It may not be relevant, but you can’t be sure; therefore, it is best to bring your medications in their original bottles so that your doctor has all of the necessary information about your medications.
Write down any information you think could be helpful. For example, any symptoms you have had that a doctor couldn’t identify the cause of. One example of a common symptom is abdominal cramping that has no obvious cause.

, The only way to diagnose this disease is through a blood test. Blood tests only work during an exacerbation of your symptoms. Your doctor may order such a test if they suspect angioedema to be causing your symptoms. Specifically, the blood test should measure C1-inhibitor function and level, as well as levels of C4 in your blood.Ideally, such blood tests would be conducted during an episode (e.g. a time when you are experiencing symptoms such as pain and/or swelling).

, If you start having difficulty breathing or if your throat starts swelling, call 911 for immediate emergency care. This is a life threatening episode, and you will need immediate medical attention., Unfortunately, the symptoms of hereditary angioedema don’t respond to antihistamines. If you have yet to be diagnosed, many doctors will prescribe an antihistamine as a means of treatment for your symptoms.


In cases of emergency, epinephrine can be used to treat someone with hereditary angioedema. For example, if they are unable to breathe due to a swollen airway.

, As of 2016, there are five treatments for hereditary angioedema that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Some of these treatments are given intravenously (e.g. through an IV) while others are given as an injection. Most people who have hereditary angioedema are able to administer these treatments themselves, in the comfort of their home.The treatment option that will be best for you is dependent upon your specific case. If you have a non-functioning C1-inhibitor, for example, your doctor might prescribe you Cinryze, Berinert, or Ruconest, which all work to help your C1-inhibitor function.Be sure to talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of each medication. These medications come with their own negative side-effects, so you should monitor your health carefully while on any treatment medication.

, Many of the treatments available have not been approved for use in children under the age of 12 years old. Therefore, if your child has hereditary angioedema, you will need to seek different treatment options. Make sure that adults that spend time with your children outside of your presence know about your child’s condition, and what they should do in the event of an attack.


As of 2016, the only medication approved for children under the age of 12 years old is Berinert.The US hereditary angioedema association (HAEA) offers useful brochures and information that you can provide to adults that are responsible for your child (e.g. teachers, family friends, coaches, etc.). The website for this information is http://www.haea.org/living-with-hae/children-and-teens/.

, The most obvious thing that occurs in a person with hereditary angioedema is swelling underneath the skin. This swelling usually occurs in the stomach, the genitals, or the throat and mouth area. This occurs because of a C1-inhibitor that doesn’t function properly. C1-inhibitor controls a protein in the blood known as C1. Together with the immune system, C1 normally controls the inflammation response in the body. Thus, if the C1-inhibitor does not function properly, neither does the C1 protein.There are certain triggers that seem to make symptomatic episodes more common. #*For example, menstruation and pregnancy, breastfeeding, and the use of birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy in women all seem to make episodes occur more frequently.
Other triggers seem to be caused by dental procedures or use of ACE inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure., Hereditary angioedema is almost always caused by a genetic defect that is passed down from the parents to the child. A few cases of spontaneous mutation of the gene that controls the C1-inhibitor have occurred. This spontaneous mutation occurs at conception. Regardless of whether your case was caused by a genetic defect or spontaneous mutation, you have a 50% chance of passing the disease on to any children you might have.This does not mean that you should not have children. However, it is important to discuss family planning with your doctor if you have hereditary angioedema in order to understand the risks.

, Hereditary angioedema occurs in about 1 in 50,000 people, making the disease quite rare.For this reason, and because the symptoms are often mistaken for other, more common issues, many people with the disease go for many years without getting a proper diagnosis.Unfortunately, this also tends to take people with the disease on a long and frustrating road because they aren’t able to find a way to manage the disease because they don’t know they have it.


However, it is important to have the disease diagnosed as soon as possible. Knowing what the problem is and how to best treat it is important for living a normal life. Not only that, but hereditary angioedema can be life threatening if the airway swells and prevents a person from breathing.

Tell your doctor about the onset of your shortness of breath.,
Take note of the ""quality"" of your shortness of breath.,
Discuss any other symptoms that you have been experiencing.,
Get a blood test.,
Ask your doctor for a chest x-ray.,
Opt for spirometry.,
Receive an ECG (electrocardiogram).,
Get a V/Q (ventilation-perfusion) scan.,
Receive an echocardiogram.,
Have a CT scan.,
Opt for a ""stress test."",
Follow through with further investigations and treatment as needed.",How to Diagnose Pulmonary Dyspnea Causes," When it comes to diagnosing the cause of your pulmonary dyspnea (shortness of breath), it makes a big difference whether it came on suddenly, gradually over a period of time, or whether it comes episodically.Shortness of breath that comes on suddenly is more likely to be related to a sudden ""event,"" such as a heart attack, decompensated heart failure, a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung), a rapidly progressing pneumonia, a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) ""exacerbation,"" or an asthma attack.
Shortness of breath that gradually worsens with time is more likely related to a chronic (and slowly worsening) condition, such as ongoing COPD, interstitial lung disease, chronic bronchitis, or restrictive lung disease.;
, The quality of your shortness of breath is also key. In other words, is it wheezy? Does it feel like your airways are tightening? (A wheeze accompanied by the sensation of tightening airways is often suggestive of asthma.) Is it accompanied by a cough? If so, is the cough productive? (This may be indicative of COPD.)Your doctor will ask you a number of questions to better delineate the characteristics of your episodes of shortness of breath.
He or she will also ask you about what factors make it better (improve your breathing), and what factors make it worse (worsen your breathing). This can be valuable information when it comes to diagnosing the underlying cause.

,

For instance, is your shortness of breath accompanied by chest pain? Sweating? Dizziness or lightheadedness? Nausea and/or vomiting? Is it accompanied by a cough and/or a fever?The presence or absence of other symptoms is key in helping your doctor to rule in or rule out possible causes of your dyspnea.
If it is accompanied by a cough and fever, the probability that you may have an infection such as pneumonia is higher.
If it is accompanied by chest pain, sweating, dizziness and nausea, the probability that it may be heart-related is higher.
Chest pain may also be present in lung-related causes, so further diagnostic tests would be needed to differentiate between the various potential causes.
Other things to consider: does your shortness of breath come on at night? Do you need to elevate your bed at night so that you can breathe? Do you have swelling in parts of your body?

, If you have pulmonary dyspnea (which is a symptom of another condition), your doctor will likely start by ordering blood tests. These will include:A CBC (""complete blood count"") — This can provide insight as to your red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels (which may or may not show anemia), as well as your white blood cells (which, if elevated, could indicate a possible infection).
A basic metabolic panel — This can provide insight as to the success of oxygen exchange at your lungs, by measuring acid and base levels in your blood.
BNP — If your BNP is elevated, it makes the diagnosis of heart failure much more likely to be the cause of your shortness of breath.
D-dimer — A test that is very effective at ruling out a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung), that may be responsible for your shortness of breath.

, Similarly, a chest x-ray can provide information to rule in or out possible causes of your dyspnea. These include:Looking for an enlarged heart, which may be a sign of heart failure (and heart failure can cause shortness of breath).
Looking for signs of pneumonia, or other ""infiltrates"" in the lung(s) that could indicate possible interstitial lung disease, or even cancer or other growths that would show up on x-ray and could all be possible causes of your shortness of breath.

, Spirometry is a special sort of lung function test that is particularly useful at detecting obstructive lung disease, which may be responsible for your shortness of breath.Conditions that can be diagnosed with the help of spirometry include:


COPD
Asthma
Chronic bronchitis
Restrictive lung disease

, An ECG (or EKG) is used to evaluate your heart rate and rhythm; this, in turn, can reveal whether there is a cardiac (heart-related) cause to your dyspnea, and it can even point toward some lung-related causes as well.An ECG can show characteristic signs of a heart attack, a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung), and signs of stress and strain on the heart which may go hand-in-hand with conditions such as heart failure.
It can thus be useful at ruling in or ruling out various possible causes of your dyspnea.

, A V/Q scan is most frequently used in the diagnosis of blood clot(s) in your lung(s). A radioactive substance is injected into the blood that flows through your lungs, followed by x-ray type imaging, which in turn demonstrates the pattern of blood flow in your lungs.If an area of your lung(s) is missing blood flow, this could be due to a blockage such as a blood clot, or pulmonary embolism.
Having a blood clot in your lung(s) is one of the more common reasons to experience shortness of breath.
A V/Q scan can sometimes give you confusing clinical data. It is important to get a D-dimer blood test or Spiral CT scan if your doctor suspects you have a pulmonary embolism.

, If it appears that the cause of your shortness of breath is heart-related, there is a good chance that your doctor will follow up with an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound examination (using sound waves) that can take a closer look at your heart and also elucidate information about blood flow, valvular function, and how the various chambers of your heart are working.Pathology (disease) in any of these areas of the heart could decrease the function of your heart overall.
A decrease in heart function for any reason is commonly associated with shortness of breath.
An echo is a good way to get a look at the heart valves to see if there is any regurgitation, stenosis, or insufficiency which could be causing to dyspnea.

, If the cause of your shortness of breath is suspected to be lung-related, a CT scan is often the best way to further investigate this. A CT scan can provide better insight than a chest x-ray when it comes to detecting blood clots in the lung, possible cancers, and differentiating between other types of lung conditions.A CT with angiography is used to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism. If you have a shortness of breath that you believe is due to a pulmonary embolism you need to be evaluated by a doctor in the ER immediately.

, If your shortness of breath worsens with exercise, your doctor will likely recommend an exercise stress test. This is when you begin walking slowly on a treadmill, and the speed is gradually increased until stress is detected on your heart (you are hooked up to continuous ECG monitoring of your heart throughout the stress test).If your shortness of breath worsens with exertion, it may be related to heart failure and/or to angina — both of which are cardiac causes for dyspnea.
It may also be exercise-induced asthma. Although a stress test does not specifically test for asthma, asthma can be suspected based on wheezing, a feeling of chest tightening, and there is commonly the presence of reliable ""triggers.""
If you cannot exercise they will give you a pharmacological stress test. This is a diagnostic procedure in which cardiovascular stress is induced using pharmacologic agents, or drugs., Clearly, the treatment for your dyspnea will depend upon the underlying cause. The investigations detailed in this article are usually sufficient to diagnose the cause of your dyspnea, and to allow your doctor to proceed with an appropriate and effective treatment plan.You may need follow-up tests to determine how well your treatment is working, and to make adjustments as needed.
Your doctor will go over all of this with you once he or she is clear about what, specifically, is the root cause for your shortness of breath.
Don’t forget if you are having severe dyspnea to seek out medical attention immediately.

Know your family's genetic history.,
Get tested for the gene.,
Test a fetus for the gene.,
Look for the symptoms of Fanconi anemia.",How to Diagnose Fanconi Anemia1," Fanconi anemia is a genetic disease, so if someone in your family has a history of anemia, you may have the gene. Fanconi anemia is carried by a recessive gene, meaning both parents must have the gene and pass it on to their child for a person to get the condition. Because it's a recessive gene, both parents may be carriers and not have the disease.;
, If you are not sure whether you carry the gene for Fanconi anemia, there are several tests you can have done with a geneticist. If neither parent carries the gene, then their children cannot get Fanconi anemia. Even if both parents have the gene, there is still only a one in four chance the child will get Fanconi anemia.The most common test is a genetic mutation test. A geneticist will take a sample of skin, and look for mutations (abnormal changes in your genes) that are tied to Fanconi anemia.
A chromosome breakage test involves having blood drawn from the arm, and treating the cells with special chemicals. Those cells are then observed to see if they break apart. In Fanconi anemia chromosomes will break and rearrange more easily than normal people. This test is the only sure way to determine if someone has the gene for FA. It is a sophisticated test and can only be done at a few centers., There are two tests for a developing fetus: chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Both tests are done in a doctor's office or hospital.CVS is done 10 to 12 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. The doctor inserts a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. She will remove a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. A lab then tests the sample for genetic defects.
Amniocentesis is done 15 to 18 weeks after a pregnant woman's last period. The doctor will take small amount of fluid from the sac around the fetus with a needle. A technician will then test chromosomes from the sample to see whether they have the faulty genes.

, After the child is born, you will want check for certain physical defects that indicate Fanconi anemia. Some of these you will be able to see yourself, while others will require a doctor to check.FA can cause missing, oddly shaped, or three or more thumbs. Arm bones, hips, legs, hands, and toes may not form fully or normally. People who have FA may have scoliosis, or a curved spine.
The eyes, eyelids, and ears may not have a normal shape. Children who have FA also might be born deaf.
About 75% of patients with Fanconi anemia have at least one birth defect.
A child who has FA might be missing a kidney or have kidneys that aren't shaped normally.
FA can also cause congenital heart defects. The most common is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a hole or defect in the lower part of the wall that separates the heart’s left and right chambers.

Look for patches of pigmented skin.,
Look for common head and face abnormalities.,
Look for skeletal defects.,
Look for genital defects in both males and females.,
Look for additional developmental problems.,
Watch out for the classic signs of anemia.,
Identify signs of reduced white blood cells.,
Watch out for signs of reduced platelets.",How to Diagnose Fanconi Anemia2," You will want to find flat patches of light brown skin, called ""café au lait"" (French for ""coffee with milk"") spots. There may also be patches of lighter skin (hypo-pigmentation).

, These include a small or large head, small lower jaw, bird-like face, sloped, prominent forehead etc. Some patients have low hairline and webbed neck.


You may also find deformed eyes, eyelids, and ears. As a result of these defects, the FA sufferer may have problems with his hearing or sight.

, The thumb may be missing or deformed. Arms, forearms, thighs, and legs may be short, curved, or abnormally shaped. Hands and feet may have an abnormal number of bones, and some patients will have six fingers.


The spine and vertebrae are common sites for skeleton defects. These include a curved spine, known as scoliosis, abnormal ribs and vertebrae, or extra vertebra.

, Of course, since males and females have different genital systems, you will have to look for different signs.


Male genital defects can include underdevelopment of all genital organs, small penis, undescended testes, opening of urethra on the lower surface of penis, phimosis (abnormal tightness of the foreskin preventing retraction over the glans), small testes, and reduced production of sperm leading to infertility.
Female genital defects include absent, very narrow, or rudimentary vagina or uterus and shrinkage of the ovaries.

, A baby may have low birth weight due to insufficient nutrition in the mother’s womb. The child may not grow at a normal rate, and be shorter and thinner than children of same age. Any kind of anemia leads to inadequate oxygen supply to various tissues, meaning the patient will be undernourished in general. Poor brain development may mean a low IQ or learning difficulties.

, Fanconi anemia is a type of anemia, so it will share many symptoms of other forms of the disease. Suffering from these does not necessarily mean Fanconi anemia is the cause, but it is a possibility.


Fatigue is the main symptom of anemia. It occurs because the supply of oxygen, which is needed to burn nutrients in the cells and produce energy, is reduced.
Anemia also involves having reduced red blood cells (RBCs). Your skin will become pale in anemia because RBCs are responsible for the red color of the blood and thereby the pink hue of the skin.
Anemia causes increased cardiac output and thus blood supply to tissues in an attempt to compensate poor oxygenation. This may tire the heart and lead to heart failure. In this condition, the child will develop a cough with frothy mucus, shortness of breath (particularly while lying down), or swelling of the body.
Other symptoms of anemia include dizziness, headache (due to poor oxygen in the brain), and cold and clammy skin.

, White blood cells (WBCs) form the natural defense system of the body against various infections. When bone marrow fails, there will be reduced WBC production and loss of this natural defense. The child will easily develop infections from organisms that normal people can resist. These infections often last longer, and are difficult to treat.


Children who are diagnosed with cancer at an early age should be screened for Fanconi anemia.

, Platelets are needed for clotting of blood. In platelet deficiency, small cuts and wounds will bleed longer. The child also may bruise easily or have petechiae. These small red or purple spots on the skin are the result of bleeding from small vessels running under the skin.If platelets are critically reduced, there may be spontaneous bleeding from the nose, mouth or digestive tract and in the joints. This is a serious condition that needs urgent medical attention.

Talk to a doctor.,
Get tested for aplastic anemia.,
Agree to a cytometric flow test.,
Undergo bone marrow aspiration.,
Have a bone marrow biopsy.",How to Diagnose Fanconi Anemia3," These signs are only symptoms, suggesting a person may have Fanconi anemia. Only a doctor will be able to arrange for a test to actually determine if that person has the disease. Before taking any test, the doctor should know of any other conditions that might affect it. That includes family history, medication, recent blood transfusions, or other diseases.

, Fanconi anemia is a type of aplastic anemia, which means the bone marrow is damaged and not producing blood cells properly. To test, the doctor will use a need to draw blood, usually from the arm. That blood will then be analyzed under a microscope, to either do a complete blood count (CBC), or a reticulocyte count.


In a CBC, a sample of the blood will be smeared onto a slide and viewed under a microscope. A doctor will then count the number of cells, and make sure there are proper amounts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. For aplastic anemia, the doctor will be looking at the red blood cells to see if their number is greatly reduced, their size increased, and if there are many abnormally shaped cells.
In a reticulocyte count, the doctor will view the blood under a microscope and count the Reticulocytes. These are immediate precursors of RBCs. Their percentage in the blood is can suggest how well bone marrow is producing blood cells. In aplastic anemia this value will be greatly reduced, almost near zero.

, The doctor will take a few cells from the skin and artificially growing those cells in a chemical environment. If the sample has FA, the culture will stop growing at an abnormal phase, which the tester will see.

, This test draws out some of your bone marrow so it can be directly tested. After numbing the skin with a local anesthesia, the doctor will stick a thick and wide metallic needle into to a bone, usually the shin bone, the upper part of breastbone, or the hipbone.


If the subject is a child or non-cooperative, the doctor may use a general anesthesia to put them to sleep for the needle.
Even with anesthesia, the procedure is still quite painful. There many nerves inside the bone where a local anesthetic cannot be given with ordinary needles.
After inserting the needle to a certain depth, a syringe is attached to the needle and plunger is gently pulled. The yellowish liquid that comes out is bone marrow. The liquid is then tested to see if enough blood cells are being produced. The pain will usually go away soon after withdrawal of the needle.
Sometimes, the marrow may become solid and fibrous during prolonged inactivity. In that case, nothing will come out during needle aspiration, which is called a ""dry tap.""

, If the patient has a ""dry tap,"" the doctor will probably then do a bone marrow biopsy to see the exact condition of the marrow. The procedure is similar to the aspiration, this time using a wider needle, and cutting out a piece of bone marrow tissue. The tissue is then examined under microscope to test the percentage of damaged cells.

This gives you a posture that says, ""Look out world!"" When you slump over, you give off the impression the world has defeated you and you'd just much rather be in bed.


Practice getting out of a chair without rocking forward, especially if you work at a desk from 9-5. In the beginning, having good posture will be a little hard – if you're not used to it, you probably haven't developed the core strength. But with practice makes habit and eventually it'll be automatic.;
, When you’re not feeling confident, you tend to think downward about everything – and look downward, too. To project that you ‘’are’’ feeling confident, pick your head up and look out. This gives off the impression that you feel worthy to judge the world and aren’t stuck in your own head.


Try looking down for a while. How do you feel? Then try looking up and surveying your surroundings. Does your inner feeling change a bit? Sometimes our minds take cues from our bodies – when you look down, you naturally feel a little more subdued and sad. When you look up, your mood gets better and you feel more confident (in addition to looking it, too).

, When you get in your head, you tend to adopt a stupidly sad look on your face. To act is if you’re ready for the world, smile. It shows others you’re approachable and happy to see them. Others will be more likely to receive you kindly as well, creating a cycle of positivity.


You want to give others a genuine smile. Not one of those fake, easily detectable ones you plaster on your face when someone whips out a camera when you’re just not feeling it. To get around this, practice. Stand in front of your mirror with your head down. Smile and ‘’then’’ lift your head up. Whether you like that smile or not, that’s your natural smile. Not some modified version that’s more camera friendly.

, Nothing says ""I fear your appraisal"" more than someone who is unwilling to look you in the eye. Some people even find it insulting, as if you’re not paying attention to them. To show the people you’re talking to that you ‘’are’’ listening and that you are an active, valuable part of the conversation, make eye contact with them. Take breaks away when gestures are in the spotlight or when you’re thinking as necessary, but then always return to looking at them in the eye.


To practice this (it can be quite difficult), master the art of the staring contest with strangers. While smiling and blinking, of course. Try to keep looking at them until they look away first. When’s the last time you looked at someone and were not the first one to look away?

, A person who’s nervous and not feeling confident will be fidgety and tense. A person who’s confident and ready for the next challenge will be relaxed, loose, and calm. Go through your body, starting with your head, and relax each part. Think about which parts of your body are the most tense – lots of people hold tension in their backs, butt, and shoulders.


If you ever find yourself with your legs crossed, hands clasped together, and shoulders raised – or even standing, pacing, and chewing on your fingernails – make a conscious effort to loosen up. You may find that a loose body position loosens your anxiety, too.

, Research has shown that those who take up power poses – that is, spreading out and making themselves “bigger” – report feeling more confident.To give your mind that confidence boost, put your hands on your hips, widen your stance, and show the world who’s who.


Imagine talking to your boss and you have your feet up on the desk while his hands are tucked between his legs. Pretty easy to tell who’s feeling confident! So spread out, whether it's in a chair in your office with your boss, standing at a bar with your friends, or giving a speech to your classmates.
Do this even before your event. A couple minutes in the bathroom before making a presentation (whether it's a speech or just introducing yourself to a stranger) can be enough to get you in the power-zone when you need it.

, The slower the walk of a person, the more internal dialogue they’re going through, as a rule of thumb. And the faster the walk, the more confident the person is likely feeling. What’s more, you become more upright and erect you with a brisker walk – and that’s two birds with one stone.A brisk pace means you have a reason for movement, you're dedicated and motivated to get something done. A slower pace means you're not feeling ambitious and have less reason to move. The former sure sounds more confident!

, When you’re not confident and a bit nervous, your voice tends to stay in its higher register. It’s not always easy to detect, too, when it’s happening. So consciously keep your voice a bit lower, whether you notice it or not. If you know you feel uncomfortable, keep a look out for how your voice changes.


Lower the pitch of your voice, in addition to the volume if that’s an issue for you. In other words, speak up! This will tell others that you view your voice as worthy of being heard. And then they’ll be more likely to follow suit, thinking the same.

, Much like how our voices raise when we’re nervous, they tend to speed up, too. So the next time you’re in front of class giving a presentation, slow down. Slow way down. Slow down to the point where you think you’re going too slow – odds are then you’re doing it just right.


An unconfident person wants the moment to pass as quickly as possible and get over it – hence why they speed up in the first place. To fake confidence, slow down, giving off the impression that you're comfortable basking in the spotlight.

, Confident people are more likely to be assertive and use ""I"" statements.Instead of ""You make me angry,"" which is quite passive, a confident person might say, ""I am angry with you,"" which is much more direct and cutting. To feign confidence, talk about yourself. No one else is going to!


It's nice to ask questions about those around you, definitely. Everyone appreciates a good listener. But you've got to be an active part of the conversation, too, by speaking. If something comes up that you can relate to, talk about your experiences with it. The person you're talking to just saw your favorite movie? Instead of, ""Oh, what a great movie!"" you might say, ""I love that movie! It's my favorite. I just saw it for the umpteenth time last....""

, We all know that person who is constantly being negative, nagging, and spreading gossip about their group of friends and enemies. It’s pretty easy to guess that that person doesn’t like themselves, so don’t be that person! In order to appear confident, you’ve gotta convince the world that you’re feeling good. And people who feel good show it through their positive actions and words.


Try to put a positive spin on things whenever possible. Instead of, ""Oh, I hate Thai food,"" you could say, ""I prefer Italian,"" when discussing potential dinner plans. Instead of, ""Her shoes are so ugly,"" you'd say, ""She made an interesting fashion choice, didn't she?""

, Have you ever been sitting with a new acquaintance or two and just started talking to get rid of that awkward feeling in your stomach? That’s a pretty key sign that you’re feeling nervous and not feeling too confident. Instead, embrace the silence. And that feeling? Ignore it. You might be the only one feeling it anyway.


Listen more than you talk. If you hog the spotlight, instead of people thinking you’re the big cheese, you’ll probably just come off as irritating and needy. Instead, relax. Take a step back. A person who’s confident doesn’t need the spotlight or the attention all the time. Let others take the heat once in a while.

, Let’s say you’re at a bar and you see a cute guy or girl over in the corner. For about the first three seconds, you’re envisioning talking to them and getting their number. Then, doubt sets in and you’re overcome with fear. That’s when you’ve got to stop the overthinking. After those first three seconds, drop it. Just go. Go and do. Don’t let yourself get caught in your head.


Any thinking beyond that initial three seconds is just going to cause more worry. And worry is going to do you absolutely zero good. Shut that voice up in your head and go for it before it tells you not to. It has no idea what it's talking about!

, As we grow older, we start thinking that the world is constantly pointing a finger at us, ready to point out our faults at any given time. In reality, the rest of the world is too concerned with themselves to really pay us any attention and fears the exact same thing. The only person thinking about how you come off is you.


Technically, to feel unconfident, you’ve gotta be pretty vain. Everyone is looking at you and laughing at you? Thinking about what you’re saying or doing? Sure... Maybe in your world, but definitely no one else’s. This isn't sad, it's freeing. It's only your opinion that matters.

, Laughing will fill your brain (and thus your entire self) with genuine happiness. It releases tension, improves your mood, and makes it easier to smile that genuine smile. All of this makes faking confidence ten times easier, which makes it ten times more convincing.


Appearing confident can be hard, but appearing happy-go-lucky and positive is a little easier. So when someone cracks a joke, laugh. Keep a smile in your back pocket for when you need it. People like happy people, and happy is associated with confidence.

, Recall your last bad hair day. You probably felt pretty self-conscious, huh? How about the last time you dressed up to the nines and went out on the town? Probably pretty good. Sometimes are brains take a cue from the outside to decide how we feel on the inside. If you need a shot of confidence, put on an outfit you know you look good in and clean yourself up. Looking good makes it much, much easier to feel good.


What's more, people tend to assume things about people who are dressed well and look good. They assume they're more educated, smarter, have more money, and are generally more likeable. It's the human condition to judge a book by its cover. Take advantage of that by sprucing yourself up.

, Many people easily mistake enthusiasm for confidence. If you can’t muster confidence, this is a good bet to make. Your favorite song comes on the radio? Tell everyone how much you love it. Someone suggests going to a movie you’ve been wanting to see? Say how much you’ve been looking forward to it. Your energy will be contagious, uplifting, and make everyone feel like you’re full of positivity and confidence.


Make sure your body matches your words, though. Imagine someone saying, ""I can't wait to see that movie!"" in a monotone voice while they're looking down with their hands hidden in their pockets and their eyes diverted to the side. You probably won't be convinced. Now imagine a person whose eyes light up, their hands shoot up, and their voice booms, ""I can't wait to see that movie!"" Much more convincing.

, The human mind is sometimes a disconcertingly powerful thing. In fact, studies have shown that the power of expectation can even put cancer into remission. This is known as the placebo effect. In the original studies, patients thought they were taking a medication, but they really weren't, and they ‘’still’’ got better. If you tell yourself you can, it’s possible you will. And if you tell yourself you can’t, it’s probable that you won’t.


Much of life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't feel like you have a reason to be confident and you won't be. Think you won't do well and you'll probably do poorly. The right attitude can truly change everything. And the only thing that determines your attitude? You.

Monitor your behavior.,
Reward yourself.It is perfectly ok and beneficial to reward yourself occasionally for meeting your goals and practicing your willpower.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Exercise Will Power," If you practice resisting these small temptations, you will lay the foundations for greater willpower in other areas of your life. For instance:


Don’t buy an item that you want on impulse yet don’t really need, such as a coffee, CD, or new shirt. Instead, save your money.
Put snacks away in a drawer or cabinet instead of leaving them in plain sight.
Go for a brief walk instead of checking your email or social media accounts.;
, Knowing ahead of time what you will do in a situation to avoid temptation or to practice willpower can help you succeed. When faced with such situations, commit to “if-then” statements. For instance:


If you are trying to avoid junk food: “If I go to the grocery store and I can’t stop looking at unhealthy snacks, then I’ll pick up a box of whole-grain cereal instead.”
If you are trying to avoid drinking alcohol: “If someone offers me a drink, then I’ll just ask for a soda.”
If you are trying to control your temper: “If I start to feel mad, then I’ll immediately close my eyes, take a deep breath, and count to ten to calm down.”

, There are numerous ways to practice delaying gratification everyday, such as:


Taking a shower that is cold at first, and only allowing yourself warm water after a few minutes.
Waiting 5 minutes before you eat, even when you are hungry.
Fasting for a day (only attempt this if you are healthy enough, and talk with a doctor beforehand).
Only allowing yourself to make a desired purchase after a certain period of time, such as a week (this also gives you time to determine if it is something you really want).

, Research shows that periodically paying even brief attention to your posture, breathing, etc. can boost your willpower and mood.Simple exercises to accomplish this include:


Reminding yourself to sit up straight
Pausing to take a few deep breaths every so often
Getting up from your desk or couch for a 5 minute break every hour

, Getting exercise is good for your physical health as well as your sense of self-control.By taking charge of your body, you will increase your willpower in other areas of life. Focus on creating a plan for physical conditioning that suits your lifestyle and abilities. Don’t be afraid to start out small, and remember that any improvement you can make is worthwhile. The important thing is to stick to your plan. Depending on your experience, try:


Taking a 10 minute walk everyday, then increasing it to 30 minutes or more.
Creating an exercise routine, whether indoor or outdoor.
Playing a favorite sport with friends one or more times a week.
Training for a 5k, marathon, etc.
Biking to work each day instead of taking a car or public transportation.
Climbing a mountain.

, In addition to physical exercises, you can increase your willpower through mental conditioning. Most importantly, focus on banishing thoughts that bring you down. By practicing self-control in this way, you will feel more in charge of how you feel and think.


You can change negative thoughts into more positive ones. For instance, if you are tempted to think “I’ve never done this before, and don’t know what to do,” recast the situation more positively by thinking “This is an opportunity for me to learn something new.”
Avoid particular people, places, situations, media, and other elements of your life that tend to cause you to have negative thoughts.

, If you get in the habit of meditating periodically, even for 5 minutes at a time, you will practice willpower both by sticking to a goal and by deepening your sense of self. Various types of meditation include:



Chanting mantras, in which you repeat a word or phrase over and over again.

Exercising mindfulness to be happier, in which you focus on your consciousness while meditating through breathing exercises and other techniques.
Practices that combine meditation with physical activity, such as meditating on love and doing tai chi.
Certain yoga breathing exercises.
Visualization techniques.

, As part of your overall goal of utilizing your willpower, you may want to devote some attention to virtues, such as showing compassion for other beings, being a good friend, practicing patience and honesty, etc. Research suggests that willpower and virtues are related, so do things like:Practicing a random act of kindness each day, such as offering a seat on the bus to someone else, anonymously paying for a stranger’s lunch, or giving a compliment to someone in need.
Devoting at least one hour a week to helping another person in some non-required way.
Volunteering with a community organization.
Showing patience with family, friends, coworkers, etc. by resisting the urge to be judgmental.

, Knowing your reasons for wanting to change increases the chance that you will be successful at meeting your goal. If you want to practice willpower, try to determine and understand why, no matter if the cause is very specific or very general. Diverse examples include:


You want to get to work on time.
You want to stop smoking.
You want to be kinder to others.
You want to be more active.
You want to be more successful.
You want to get in touch with your spiritual side.

, However, you are more likely to succeed at practicing and improving your willpower if you focus on one goal at a time. Prioritize your goals and determine substeps to decide where to begin. For instance:


Suppose you have an overall goal of being more successful in life, and you have decided that being better at your job is the place to start.
You have been chronically late to work, and determine that getting to work on time is the first step you should take.
Focus on exercising willpower by waking up early so that you get to work on time.
Don’t move on to another goal until you have accomplished this first step successfully.

, It is important to keep track of your progress as you seek to practice willpower. That way, you can tell if you are on your way to success, and whether or not you need to make any adjustments to improve.


If you are trying to get to work on time, for instance, keep a log each day that records when you go to bed and when you wake up. Notice if you are making improvement or need to make changes. For example, if you notice you are waking up on time everyday except for Mondays, focus renewed willpower on fixing that.
There are several websites, apps, and programs that can help you monitor your progress as you seek to achieve goals. However, be careful not to over-monitor yourself or get caught up in using one of these aids, as it can become distracting and reduce your willpower.

, Give yourself a treat when you are successful—just make sure that increasing your willpower is the real goal, not the short-term reward.

, Being well-rested is very important if you want to successfully practice and improve your willpower. If you are mentally or physically exhausted, your chances of success are reduced. Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night, so set an appropriate goal.

Stop thinking about yourself.,
Carry an expectation that the world is entertaining.,
Fill the dead air.,
Take initiative to change topics if the conversation flows to another thought.,
Don't feel like you need to prove how smart you are.",How to Fake Being an Extrovert," As an introvert, you will have a tendency to sit back and absorb your surroundings into your train of thought to create new and interesting ideas, or ponder over and over again whether it would be okay to say words to other people, or replay that last conversation you had three days ago in order to find deeper meaning under the layers of the words, ""I like apples."" You must resist this urge, because it will do you no good here. The people around you will be more interested in actually discussing social and professional topics with you, with sharing their observations and hearing your opinions. Silence as a means of personal connection only works for telepaths and cats.;
, Now that you’ve stopped analyzing your surroundings and yourself, you may notice a huge gap in your thoughts, a kind of empty void in your headspace where the constant stream of doubt and snarky sarcasm used to keep you silent. Congratulations! You are now one step closer to being an extrovert. Only now, instead of finding your own personal mental entertainment, you can begin to engage with other people who are near you. This will involve conversing with people and trying understand that what they have to say might be as interesting as your own inner monologue. This may seem weird at first, but this is the kind of interpersonal connection that extroverts form every day.

, If there is a natural break in the conversation or a moment of silence, your first instinct will be to take the break for a nice relaxing ride on the thought train. You must resist this urge and fill the silence by saying something – anything – and it doesn’t have to prove you are the next Plato. Leaving huge gaps in the conversation doesn't always come across as thoughtful, intelligent, or coherent - often, it indicates to your listener that you've checked out of the conversation and no longer consider the person with whom you are conversing to be important.

, Although changing the immediate topic may seem like a bold step, sometimes, conversational flow follows an eclectic stream of consciousness. Rather than assuming that your conversational partner will be offended by your initiative, see if they'll come along on your journey of mutual discovery. If they wish to discuss the current topic further, they'll take it upon themselves to revisit it later.

, When you’re having a conversation with a stranger, light topics are actually okay. No one will automatically assume you're an idiot if you don't immediately start debating the merits of Sophocles over Aristotle. The weather, the scenery, the food you're eating, the television you're watching or the book you're reading are all merely springboards for later, deeper conversation should you prove compatible conversationalists.


The observers, whom you will be fooling with this charade, will not be paying attention to the content of what you’re saying, but how you are saying it and to whom you are talking. The more you can talk without displaying a debilitating fear of human interaction, the more of an extrovert you will appear to be. Who knows, you might even discover that people are nice!

Allowing your feelings to run their course is a necessary part of the grieving and recovery process.Remind yourself there is no right way to grieve. All emotions are acceptable to have and need to be acknowledged in order to heal.
It’s common to feel positive emotions, such as relief, along with negative ones when you learn of your abuser’s death. For example, you might feel relieved and free after the death. You might immediately feel more hopeful about your future free of abuse. This is natural, and you don’t need to feel bad about it.
You may find that you’re experiencing a jumbled mess of conflicting emotions. To gain some control over them, try to sort through them and name them. Journaling can be a great way to do this.;
, People often say that it’s wrong to speak ill of the dead. However, after your abuser’s death, addressing the ways their abuse hurt you is a necessary part of healing. If talking about your experience helps you, don’t hold back from sharing your thoughts and feelings with supportive friends and family or your therapist.Be selective about who you talk to. Some people may be less than supportive of you, especially if you’ve never come forth about the abuse before. The abuser’s family and friends may be unwilling or unable to believe that their loved one would be capable of hurting others.

, After your abuser passes away, you might feel a fresh wave of anger about what they did to you, or you might feel angry that they never apologized or answered for their wrongdoings. Find healthy ways to let your anger out, instead of letting it corrode you. Go for a long run, tear up a piece of paper, or scream into a pillow.If you’re having a hard time managing your anger or feel like you might hurt yourself, seek emergency counseling right away.

, Think about what kind of unresolved feelings you still have about your abuser. Even though you can’t make things right with them, you may be able to find other ways to give yourself a sense of peace about what happened.For example, you could write a letter to your abuser or create a collage that represents your feelings.

, If you feel up to it, you might like to attend the funeral or memorial service for your abuser. Doing so may help you to get closure, and realize that the abuse is finally over.


However, be warned that you might get upset at this service. Everyone will likely speak highly of the deceased, which may be a completely different picture of the person you knew. Bring someone along for emotional support to help you cope with the pain or resentment you might experience., Whether you’ve just gotten the news of your abuser’s passing or you’re still struggling to process it after the fact, reach out for help sooner rather than later. Having a supportive friend by your side can help you cope with all the new emotions you’re flooded with, especially if the death occurred unexpectedly.If your friend lives nearby, ask them if they can come and see you in person. Having someone by your side physically is often more comforting than just talking on the phone. Say, ""I just got a call that my father has died. I don't know what to think or how to feel. Can you come over?""

, As you recover from the emotional shock of your abuser’s death, surround yourself with friends and family who make you feel loved and respected. Social support is one of the biggest factors in how well people recover from grief and other strong emotions.Avoid falling into the common trap of seeking out people who remind you, in some way, of the person who hurt you.

, Once you have worked to process your emotions and associations with your abuse and grief, you may want to volunteer your time to help others. Making a positive difference in the world can help you feel fulfilled. Look for a volunteer position in your community that’s meaningful to you.For instance, you might find it therapeutic to help other survivors of abuse. However, you should not do this until you have processed your own abuse and taken steps to heal yourself. It can bring up your own issues, making you unavailable for the other person, and also further complicating their and your own issues.

, If you are spiritual, turn to your faith and your spiritual community for support. Talk to a member of clergy or a spiritual guide. Devote some extra time to prayer. If you are not religious, meditating regularly or spending time in nature can give you a sense of peace and connection with the world., If you’re having a hard time coming to terms with your abuser’s death, a mental health professional can help you work through your emotions. With a therapist’s help, you can learn to deal with painful memories, cope with unresolved feelings, and reach a state of acceptance. A therapist can also provide you with a safe environment to explore conflicting emotions about the abuse and loss., Negative emotions like stress, anger, and grief often cause your muscles to tense up. To relax, do deep breathing exercises or meditate regularly. Letting go of the tension in your body will help you let go of your emotional tension, too.One simple meditation exercise you can try is to sit quietly and focus on your breath. Breathe in for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then release. When your mind wanders, gently return your thoughts to the pattern of your breathing.
Meditation also helps you establish the habit of mindfulness, which can help you deal with tough emotions.

, Humor lowers your stress levels while making you feel more optimistic about life. Take your mind off your abuser’s passing by watching funny movies and comedy shows or spending time with friends who can make you laugh., The additional stress can contribute to dehydration, so help yourself feel better by drinking plenty of water and eating a balanced diet. If you have a hard time eating, try nibbling on small, healthy snacks throughout the day instead of forcing yourself to eat a large meal.Try snacking on some fresh fruit or veggies and hummus. You could also make a yogurt parfait or oatmeal for a healthy and hearty breakfast.

, Working out gives you an outlet for your emotions and forces you to focus on your body instead of your thoughts. It also boosts levels of feel-good neurotransmitters in your brain, improving your mental well-being along with your physical health. If you’re feeling unmotivated, start with a gentle workout. A daily 20-minute walk is much easier to commit to than an hour-long run, and it will still improve your health and mood.

On opening night, give yourself a pep talk.",How to Cope if You Didn't Get the Part You Wanted," Maybe you didn't get the lead, but is your part really that bad? Think about all the good things about your role in the play that none of the other parts have. Maybe you get to be in one of the best songs, or you get to have the best costume. Consider the things about this part that will make you happy in the long run.
, It can be really hurtful if you didn't get the part you deserved. Have a good cry. Talk with somebody you trust. If you get your emotions out in the open instead of suppressing them, it can be easier to move on., Even better, talk to someone who has done this play before and has gotten your exact part, if possible. Ask them how they felt. Maybe they can tell you some of the perks of having this role. All in all, this can usually make you feel a lot better., Sometimes you'll be mad at your director. Don't think that's petty or childish - that's normal. Get your anger out by punching something or writing it out. Don't stay angry or hold a grudge for very long - that will make your situation worse., Look at the songs. Highlight your lines to see how many you have. You might be surprised by your role in the end - it might not be as small as you originally thought., If you spend hours upon hours sulking about the bad aspects of your part, you will never be able to enjoy being part of the play at all. You'll never get over it, and that won't be good. Your director will definitely not want you to be in their cast ever again, and you won't be a fun cast member to practice lines with. Get some time to yourself to get your feelings out, but then put on a happy face. Smile. Eventually, your feelings on the inside will match the way you look on the outside., Don't immediately assume that it's because you're a bad singer or actor with no talent. Maybe it was because your personality matched the part you were given better than the part you tried out for. More likely, it was because there were so many talented people trying out for the best parts - including you - and it was one of the most difficult decisions the director had to make. Maybe he knew he couldn't put all the less talented people in the chorus or ensemble and wanted somebody good to help carry the voices. Don't think it was for a bad reason., Ask him why he cast you in your role. Don't sound petty, and don't sound like you're complaining. Don't get angry and say something like, ""Why didn't you give me a better part? I was the most talented person trying out and you know it!"" Stay strong. Don't cry or yell. Make sure you have a calm tone of voice. Simply ask, ""I know there were a lot of really talented people trying out for , but I thought I would get something a little bit better than the part I got. Of course I know that you couldn't put everybody as the lead, but I just wanted to know why."" Listen to him when he explains. If he asks you questions, answer them - in your same calm tone of voice. He will give you a good, fair explanations, and all your questions will be answered. Most likely, you will leave feeling better than you did before., It may be tempting, but don't make any rash decisions. Think seriously about whether or not you want to quit. Consider the fact that even if your part is small, they need somebody to play it. All parts are necessary to the play. If you quit, it's going to be really hard for everybody. The director will have to scramble to find somebody to replace you, or have to change the entire play if he can't find anybody at all. It may be hurtful to know that you got a bad part, but don't just give up. Stick with the play if you can. More than likely you will find yourself having a great time anyway, despite your role.

The only situation in which you should quit is if you find yourself beginning to hate your director. If you can't look him in the eye without wanting to cry, and you can't do your part wholeheartedly, then you should talk to him about quitting the play. But in most situations, you shouldn't have to do this.

, Give it your all. Practice your lines over and over again, just like everybody else. Sing your songs all the time. Do your absolute best in rehearsal. If you show your director that you can act even the smallest of roles with gusto and all the talent you can possibly muster, it will show him that you are a serious actor that won't succumb to setbacks. It will also show him that you aren't a sore loser - you're a team player all the way. And if you show him those things, he'll probably give you a better part next time., Run lines with them. Practice your songs with them. They can even be people to talk to and complain to about your parts - they can definitely relate because they'll be in the exact same situation as you! It'll definitely be easier than talking to the lead about your part. So try to strike up a conversation with them. You might even end up making some really close friends., Know that you should be proud of yourself for working hard like everybody else and always looking on the bright side, even though you didn't get the part you wanted. All in all, this will have been a good experience for you. Think of it as a life lesson. It will definitely help you when you do other productions in the future."

Show the man that you can be trusted and counted on when he’s dealing with emotions. Invite the man to share his emotions with you. When he does share, don’t judge or criticise what he says. If discussions escalate, take a timeout before either of you say something that might be regrettable.Validate his feelings by saying, “I can see you feel sad about that” or, “It sounds like that made you feel upset.”;
, Tears can indicate a person’s emotions, and without this cue, he might not know how to label how he feels or communicate those feelings with others.Help him identify feelings or show your understanding. Instead of assuming you know how he feels, ask questions.

For example, ask, “Does that make you feel sad?” or, “I know I would feel angry, how do you feel?”

, It is normal for people to hide their emotions and put up a façade to hide their true feelings, and this is especially true for men. One of the biggest struggles for men in any setting especially in relationships is being openly vulnerable to the other person. In many situations, men are taught to be strong, to take care of other people, and if they were to express vulnerability it is a sign of weakness. Some people feel like being in complete control of their thoughts and emotions makes them strong and resilient. Tears and crying may be perceived as being out of control or weak. The man may fear feeling rejected or made fun of by others if seen publically crying.Talk to the person about what it means to have emotions and how he relates to them. Does he have to feel in control of himself at all times, and does that affect his ability to cry?
Be open and honest with him, and express to him that withholding emotions could be a sign of ambivalence, being unavailable, or being afraid to fully commit to the relationship. Let him know that it is attractive when he is able to openly express his emotions without fear.

, Instead of putting pressure on the man to share his feelings, make it collaborative. Take turns sharing something personal or slightly vulnerable. Getting the man comfortable talking about his feelings can help him feel freer to express them. Assisting him with understanding that allowing himself to feel his emotions will help him to develop deeper more meaningful connections may help.

For example, you can buy a deck of question cards and ask each other one question each night. By increasing this trust and bonding with each other, he may eventually feel more empowered and confident with expressing his feelings towards other people. Some men have noted that by accepting and allowing themselves to fully express their emotions, they open up a whole new side of themselves that feels more meaningful, and enables them to create deeper long-term bonds with other male friends

, Men don’t have to cry to express only sadness and grief. Ask him what he connects to that brings about the feeling of tears. Perhaps it’s the memory of his child being born, a beautiful sunset, or a dramatic victory. Help him enter into the memory and the feeling of something that may make him tear up or cry.Even if he doesn’t cry, he can at least experience memories that make him feel sentimental and in touch with his emotions. This can be a good starting point.

, Talk about why he struggles to share his emotions and what might stop him from crying. Does he struggle to connect with emotions that lead to crying? Does he tend to shove emotions down and not deal with them? Does he want to cry or is he more comfortable staying away from tears? Get an idea about what stops him from crying to better understand him.

Ask him if he’s cried in the past and what that was like. Was he ashamed or made fun of by others? Was he alone or in public? Did he tell himself he would never cry again?
To start a conversation, say, “I’m really curious as to why it’s difficult for you to cry. Can we talk about it? Is there something I can do to help?”

, Crying helps release emotions that are otherwise pushed down. These repressed emotions can build up over time and develop into clinical symptoms such as high blood pressure. Crying can also be linked with higher self-esteem.Not all people are comfortable crying in front of others. If the person is hesitant to cry in front of you or other people, say that crying can help even if they do so privately.

, Seeing someone else cry can show that tears are okay and come from valid emotions. The man might be grateful that you feel comfortable enough to cry in front of him or he might realize it’s not as big of a deal to cry as he had thought. Sometimes, witnessing tears can be helpful to normalize tears., Sometimes, the most helpful thing you can do is to suggest outside help. Encourage the man to see a therapist. Emotions have many layers, and sometimes we need to peel back those layers like an onion to get to the core or root cause of why it is difficult to show certain emotions. He may be struggling with a past trauma that makes crying or tears feel bad or judged, or may have problems expressing his feelings in general. A therapist can help him work through his emotions and give him coping strategies to help him deal with stress and problems more effectively.Especially if he’s had a difficult experience in childhood or endured a tragedy, it can be difficult to reconnect with crying when it’s associated with such pain. A therapist can help him explore his emotions and cry in a way that makes him feel safe.
Individual therapy allows for a safe confidential space for him to peel back any emotional layers he may have, study them, and see how they function. Individual therapy is a safe place for him to freely experiment with his emotions that he didn’t otherwise know how to express without inhibition before.

, Based in the mind-body connection, somatic therapy can help release traumas in the body that affect physical and emotional health. Sessions may include becoming aware of sensations in the body, movement, and breathing exercises.For example, some people describe a knot in their stomach, and working with these feelings can help release the person to feel free to cry., A group can be a great place to gain support and put things in perspective. He can learn skills and practice with others to allow him to be more emotionally vulnerable.He might want to join a group that is exclusively for men who struggle to express emotions.

Group therapy is led by a therapist and typically consists of 5-15 people who are struggling with a similar issue.
Some people go to individual and group therapy while others just attend group therapy.

Remove external distractions.,

Define the task or problem clearly.,

Identify one specific step you can take, and take it, or start to.,

Choose easy or mindless tasks.,





Put music on.,

Get started on something, even if it's not the most important thing.,

Work out loud.,

Keep a to-do list.,

Keep your schedule flexible but structured.,

Create routines that put basic stuff on autopilot.,

Try working faster or slower than your normal pace.,

Reward yourself.",How to Get More Done on Days when You're Not Focused," Turn off the TV. Close or put away computers, phones, or any browser or IM windows you're not using. Turn off any music that prevents you from concentrating. If noise from another room or outside is causing your mind to wander, shut the door or window to block it out.
, If you don't know what you're working on, it's very hard to accomplish it. If you're stuck, try to articulate precisely how you are stuck. Often, clearly stating the problem will lead to possible courses of action:

Look at whatever project you're putting off. What is the part on which you are stuck? What one, specific thing can you do to make some progress? Perhaps that is calling somebody who knows what to do. Perhaps it is just getting started.

, A specific step is not ""get all of your accounts in order"" but something like ""check the account balance"" for one account that you choose.

Break down larger projects into smaller, more manageable tasks.

, Pull some weeds, do the ironing, do basic paperwork, or clean out a desk drawer. If all you do is take care of a few simple tasks, at least they will be out of the way some other day when you have more energy or focus. Sometimes, easy tasks can help build the momentum that gets you started on other, more difficult tasks. Low-hanging fruit is still fruit.

Choose tasks you enjoy doing or that are important to you. Often the motivation of doing something fun or rewarding will boost your energy and enthusiasm, and thereby your focus.

, If it's appropriate to do so, upbeat music can get you started, help drown out distracting background noise, and give you a little more energy.

Obviously, don't use music if it will distract you from your task or interfere with it. If your task is to make phone calls or to complete a language lesson, leave the music for later.

, As long as you can trust yourself to accomplish your more important tasks on days when you are more focused, go ahead and choose a less important, less taxing task.

Call it a rough draft or a first attempt. Trying to produce something, even if it's not right yet, can get you going, help you discover where you really are stuck, and help with perfectionism.

, Talk through your plans with a friend, colleague, or adviser. Or, write in a journal or separate document. Sometimes, this process of explaining to another person or to your journal can help you identify the correct course of action. It can be better than letting poorly formed thoughts chase around your head!, Sort it by context. If you're at work or school and thinking of things that really should be done when you're at home or running errands (or vice versa), jot those down on a notepad, or in a task management program for your phone or computer. Then, commit to get back to them when you have the opportunity.


Declutter unnecessary tasks from your to-do lists. If you have a lot of tasks that ""would be nice, someday"" but aren't a priority, keep a separate list (or tag and filter them if you track your tasks electronically).

, Try to keep regular hours. If you work or attend classes outside the home, part of your schedule will be decided for you. If not, create some ""office hours"" (or otherwise set aside task time) for yourself, even if that means getting up earlier or staying up later.

Build little deadlines into your time management scheme.
Leave time in your schedule for having an occasional day with less focus. This may mean working ahead a little on days when you are better focused, or simply scheduling time to yourself on weekends to relax and rest.

, Otherwise, these things become distractions. If you need your keys and purse or wallet each day, make sure they land in the same spot each evening when you come home.

Fall back on your system and routines. At least you will keep up with the basics and, if need be, keep up appearances.

, For some tasks (especially the simple, repetitive ones), try racing against yourself, as long as you can do so safely and maintain your quality. For more complex tasks, you may want to slow down and take things step by step.

Sometimes we convince ourselves that we lack the energy needed because we feel that the only way to accomplish something is to throw a lot of speed and energy at it. Take the opposite view and work at the task slowly and deliberately. This frees you up from using a lack of energy as an excuse; anything achieved slowly is something achieved.

, After you make one phone call or focus to some degree for 15 minutes, take a quick break or do something fun."

Set your goal.,
Identify the habit you want to form.,
Consider your motivation.,
Start small.,
Give yourself time.,
Expect obstacles.",How to Form a Good Habit1," Before you can begin to work on your new habit, it is worthwhile to consider your goal. Figure out exactly what you hope to accomplish. Make sure that your goal is specific, measurable, action oriented, realistic, and time bound (SMART) to increase your chances of success.Consider what you want to achieve and get as detailed as you can. Here are some questions to help.


Specific means that the goal is targeted rather than broad and/or vague. What exactly do you want to achieve and why?
Measurable means that the goal can be quantified (measured with numbers). What numbers are associated with your goal? How can it be measured using numbers?
Action Oriented means that the goal is something that you can actively work towards and control. What specific activities are required for you to meet your goal? How often must you perform these activities?
Realistic means that the goal is something you can actually achieve with the resources available to you. Is your goal something that you have the power and resources to achieve? Why or why not?
Time Bound means that the goal has a beginning and ending or a deadline that you will hold yourself to. When will you start working towards the goal? When do you need to accomplish the goal by? What will happen if you succeed? What will happen if you fail?;
, Having good habits that are in line with the goals you want to achieve can improve your chances of attaining your goals.After you have set your goal and worked out all of the specifics of achieving that goal, identify a habit that is part of achieving that goal. Consider your goal and ask yourself, what good habit would help me accomplish this goal?









For example, if your goal is to lose 10 pounds in 6 weeks, you might decide that you want to get into the habit of taking a walk every night at 7:00pm.

, Once you have identified your goal and the new habit you need to form to accomplish this goal, take some time to consider your motivation. Your motivation is the reason you want to form this new habit. Good motivation can be the difference between succeeding and failing at forming a new habit, so take your time to consider your motivation.








Ask yourself: What are the potential benefits of forming this new habit? How will the new habit improve my life?
Write down your motivation so that you can return to it whenever you need a boost.

, Even if the new habit that you want to form is something big, start by making a small change to increase your chances of success. If you make changes that are too drastic, you may not be able to keep up with them.








For example, if you want to stop eating fried, fatty, and sugary foods, you might struggle to give them up all at once. Instead, you might find it easier to start by eliminating one category at a time.

, Forming a new habit can take a long time. Some people can form a new habit in as little as a few weeks, while other people will take several months.As you work to form your new habit, just keep in mind that it may be a while before it is automatic. Try to be patient with yourself as you form your new habit.








, In the process of forming a new habit, you are bound to face some obstacles along the way. Understanding that you will face obstacles may help you to overcome them and keep working towards your new habit. It is also good to remember that even if you stumble along the way, that does not mean that you will fail.








For example, if you fail to take your daily walk one day, don’t get discouraged. Just acknowledge that you had a bad day and take your walk the following day.

"
"
Create a cue.,
Change your environment.,
Become more mindful.,
Tell people.,
Track your progress.,
Reward yourself for engaging in your good habit.",How to Form a Good Habit2," Having a cue can help remind you to perform the new behavior every day. Your best bet is to make your cue something that is already a part of your daily routine, such as taking your morning shower or making coffee. For example, if you want to develop the habit of flossing your teeth every time you brush, make brushing your teeth your cue to floss. Follow up brushing with flossing and over time this behavior should become automatic.








If you can’t think of a cue that will work with your desired new habit, try setting a daily alarm on your phone to remind you that it is time to perform the behavior.

, You can increase your chances of achieving your goals by making changes to your environment. Try to think of ways that you can alter your environment so that you will find it easier to perform your new habit. What environmental changes would help you to perform your good habit each day?








For example, if you want to form the habit of going to the gym every morning before work, you can set yourself up for success by laying out your gym clothes the night before and putting your gym bag by the door.

, Part of the reason why some people have trouble forming new good habits is because they are on autopilot and not thinking about the things they are doing. But by becoming more aware of your behavior, you may find it easier to form a new good habit. Ask yourself questions about the mindless behavior that prevents you from performing your good habit.








For example, if you want to form the habit of going to the gym every morning, think about what stops you. What is your usual morning routine? How do you spend your time when you do not go to the gym? Why do you spend your time this way? How does it make you feel?
The next time you catch yourself going into autopilot and falling back into bad habits, question your behavior and feelings to help yourself break out of the mindless cycle.

, You can help to hold yourself accountable to performing your new habit by sharing your goal with others. Consider getting a friend to help keep you on track with sticking to your new habit. Maybe one of your friends is hoping to form a good habit of their own and you can return the favor.








Make sure that the friend(s) you enlist to help you with your new habit will have some way of holding you accountable. For example, you could give your friend some money and tell them not to give it back to you until you have performed your good habit X number of times., Keeping track of your progress towards developing your habit can help you to stay motivated and strategize when things don’t go as planned. Use a journal or an app on your phone to help you keep track of how often you perform your good habit. You might even consider sharing your progress on your social media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Making your progress public can help you to stay motivated to continue working on your good habit.







, You can help yourself stay motivated to continue working on your good habit by rewarding yourself. Choose a reward to give yourself once you have hit a goal. Simple things like rewarding yourself with a new outfit after you lose 10 pounds can make a big difference in your motivation to stick with your goals.








Make sure that you choose rewards that are healthy and that you can afford to provide yourself. When you accomplish a goal, make sure that you give yourself the reward soon after.

Raise your awareness.,
Take steps to counteract the bad habit.,
Reward yourself for resisting your bad habit.",How to Form a Good Habit3," Bad habits can be hard to break because they have become ingrained and automatic. To overcome a bad habit, the first thing that you need to do is become more aware of the habit. You can raise your awareness of the bad habit by keeping a log of every time that you indulge in the bad habit.








For example, if your bad habit is snacking between meals, write a check mark on an index card every time that you notice yourself snacking between meals. Do this for a week to see how often you engage in this habit.
Being aware means just to 'watch' your actions and patterns that come out of a bad habit and not beating yourself over it. It is researched fact that you are more likely to make the same mistake or follow the same pattern again if you beat yourself over it. These patterns and bad habits will dissolve if you just become aware of them.

, Once you have become more aware of the habit, begin taking steps to counteract it. Try to distract yourself so that you do not engage in the bad habit. Make sure that you continue to record the instances of your desire to engage in the bad habit as well as the times that you resist the bad habit.








For example, if you catch yourself reaching for a snack between meals, pour yourself a cup of water or go for a short walk instead.

, It is crucial to reward yourself for resisting the urge to engage in bad habits. The reward helps to motivate you to continue to resist the bad habit. Make sure that your reward is not to engage in the bad habit, but to do something else that is pleasurable.








For example, if you manage to resist your urge to snack between meals for a full week, reward yourself with a new book or a trip to the salon.

Start by presenting an option.,
Use subtle ways to make the option enticing.,
Use non-verbal cues as well.,
Discourage or argue against the option you want.,
Push the person to make a decision.,
Figure out the personality types that best respond to reverse psychology.,
Aim for lighthearted uses of reverse psychology, especially with children.,
Consider what the other person wants.,
Think about your end goal.,
Do not overuse reverse psychology.,
Stay calm when using reverse psychology.,
Avoid using reverse psychology in serious situations.",How to Use Reverse Psychology," Get this option embedded in the other person's brain. It may be something the person would normally resist, and he or she may initially scoff at it. However, you want to make sure the person is aware of the option at hand.For example, say you're deciding between two parties to attend on a Friday night. Your friend is a film fanatic, and his group of friends are having a movie night. You're more of a board game person, and another group of friends is having a game night.
Make your friend aware of the option you want. Say something like, ""Did you hear Madison and Emily are doing that board game night? Kind of boring, if you ask me."";
, Find ways to make the option desirable. Drop subtle hints that may create a sense of desire in the other person.In the above example, you could casually mention board games that will be played at the event. You could also play a game of cards with your friends a few days before the event, allowing your friend to see how much fun games can be.
You can also make the friends sound more enticing. Bring up fun memories you had hanging out with Madison and Emily. Talk about their good qualities. For example, say something like, ""Madison always has the best selection of wine at her place.""

, For example, you could play a version of a board game on your phone in front of the person. You could invite Madison and Emily out to coffee with the other person before the party, reminding him of how much fun they are.

, Once the person is hooked, you want to be slightly argumentative. This will add the extra push you need to get the person to do what you want. He or she is already somewhat enticed by the option. If you push back on that option at this point, a naturally resistant person is likely to push for it more.Going back to the above example, wait until Friday night comes around. Say something like, ""Well, we can go to Madison and Emily's, or that movie night. What do you think? I think Madison and Emily's thing may be a tad boring.""
At this point, your friend may push to go to Madison and Emily's. However, if he or she is still ambivalent, try to be more overt. Say something like, ""We can always go to Madison and Emily's another time.""

, To close the negotiating process, you can now push the person to make a decision. The idea here is to make the person think they're making their own decision. Ask them politely what they want to do, and wait for a response. Hopefully, the person will go for the option you were vying for.In the above example, say something like, ""So, we can go to Madison and Emily's, or the movie night. What do you think? It's your decision.""
By making your friend think it's his decision, he'll think he's asserting his autonomy. You've already made Madison and Emily's party sound enticing. You've also expressed some resistance to it, which a naturally contrary person may push back against. With luck, your friend will opt for Madison and Emily's event.

, Not everyone responds well to reverse psychology. People who tend to be more compliant may respond better to direct requests. If you know someone who is resistant by nature, reverse psychology may work well on this person.Think about the interactions you've had with the person in question. Do they tend to go along with the flow of things, or do they tend to resist? If you know someone who is a more independent thinker, and likes to resist the status quo, this person may be more susceptible to reverse psychology than a person who's generally agreeable.
You should also keep this in mind if you plan on using reverse psychology on children. If you have a child that tends to be stubborn, he or she will be far more likely to respond to reverse psychology than an agreeable child.

, Reverse psychology should be lighthearted, and humorous even. This is especially true when using the technique on very young children. Try to use it as a means to make someone think they're outsmarting you.For example, say you're trying to get your son to make his bed in a timely fashion. You could ask him to wait to make his bed until you finish brushing your teeth, explaining to him he's young and really needs a lot of help. You may come in the room to find he's already started the process on his own, as he wants to prove his autonomy.
With an adult, try to use reverse psychology in the same way. Allow the person to think they're asserting their autonomy in the situation. You may be choosing between two movies: a foreign film with subtitles versus a lighthearted comedy. You really want to see the foreign film, so you may say something like, ""I'm not sure I have the attention span for subtitles."" Your friend may insist on the foreign film at this point, wanting to prove his or her superior attention span.

, Before using reverse psychology, think about what the other person is likely to want in a situation. A more complicated version of reverse psychology may be needed in some cases. If someone's want to do something outweighs their need to resist, classic reverse psychology may backfire. For example, your friend wants to attend a concert in a bad part of town alone. You may think this is a bad idea, but using simple reverse psychology could be ineffective. If you say to your friend, ""You're right. You should go. You only live once!"" your friend may wholeheartedly agree, as he really does want to see the show.Try arguing against yourself in these cases, rather than the choice at hand. Returning to the above example, you can say something to your friend like, ""I can't make you do anything you don't want to do. I'm pretty sure this part of town is dangerous, but only you can decide what's best for you.""
You're encouraging your friend to think for himself here. If your friend is naturally resistant, he may instead yield to your advice rather than thinking for himself. Your friend may very well decide not to go to the concert.

, Make sure you keep your end goal in mind. Remind yourself periodically what you want the person to do. Occasionally, things can get argumentative when you use reverse psychology. It's easy to lose track of your own wants during the duration of an argument. Try to stay on track, and remember your desired outcome.

, Reverse psychology can work great in certain situations. However, keep in mind it is a subtle form of manipulation. Using reverse psychology habitually can be incredibly damaging to relationships.Use reverse psychology in low-stakes situations. For example, you can use this tactic when you and your spouse are deciding which movie to see. Do not use it every time you see a movie, however, as you should let your partner occasionally pick your recreational activities.
These kind of small situations can build up overtime, leading to resentment in a relationship. Your partner, for example, may get tired of not getting his or her way and begin to get mad at you.

, Reverse psychology can get frustrating, especially if you're using it on children. Headstrong children, and people in general, may take awhile to come around to your way of thinking. You want to keep calm and maintain your cool.If your child has an emotional outburst while you're using reverse psychology, remain calm. Allow the child to carry on. With patience, your child should calm down and behave.

, There are certain situations where reverse psychology is likely to backfire, and the consequences can be serious. You should always refrain from using reverse psychology when someone's health and wellbeing is at stake.For example, say your friend is chronically afraid of doctors. He has a suspicious mole growing on his right shoulder and is resistant to getting it checked out.
Do not say, ""You're right. Do not go to the doctor."" Your friend's fear of doctors may greatly outweigh his need to resist, and you may reinforce a dangerous behavior.

,How to Create an Agenda1,
"
Gather your materials.,
Make a canvas for your calendar.,
Create the ""days"" for your calendar.,
Design the month nameplates.,
Lay out the current month.",How to Make Your Own Calendar1," You will need cardstock, 1/2"" thick foam board, scissors, craft adhesive or super glue, 42 one inch buttons, 42 flat-head thumb tacks, a marker, an old picture frame, fabric, felt, masking tape, and Velcro dots.Try coming up with a color scheme for your calendar. Pick 2-3 different colored buttons and find matching fabric, cardstock, and felt.;
, Cut the foam board to fit inside the picture frame. Pull the fabric taut over one side of the foam board. Wrap the fabric around to the other side of the foam board and tape it in place. Place your canvas inside the picture frame., Cut 31 circles out of cardstock just big enough to fit inside the inner part of each button. Number the circles 1-31 using the marker. Glue each of the 42 buttons (both numbered and plain) to a thumb tack.Wait for the glue between the cardstock and buttons to dry completely before gluing the buttons to the thumb tacks.
Instead of cutting out each circle, you can use a 3/4"" circle hole punch if you have one.
If your penmanship is poor or you want to make a professional-quality calendar, consider printing the labels onto cardstock instead of drawing them on.The unnumbered buttons will be used as spacer days for the first and last weeks of each month. For example, if the first day of the month was on a Thursday, you would put plain buttons on the Sunday through Wednesday spaces in the first row. Likewise, if that month ended on a Friday, you would put a plain button in the Saturday spot on the bottom row. They aren't necessary but will make your calendar look much neater.

, Cut out 12 rectangular strips of cardstock. The rectangles should be roughly one inch tall and one third as wide as the inside of the picture frame. Write down the name of each month. Use the strips as a guide to cut out felt rectangles slightly larger on all sides. Sew the cardstock nameplates on top of the felt. Glue two soft Velcro dots on the back of each nameplate. Glue two rough Velcro dots to the top center of the calendar canvas.


As with the days, you can always print out the names of the months instead of handwriting them.
Make sure the Velcro dots on each nameplate line up with the Velcro dots on the canvas.

, Make seven columns using the date pins for each day of the week, starting with Sunday on the left and ending with Saturday on the right. If you don't have a conventional calendar to help you plot out the days, just work backwards and forwards from today. Place the correct month's nameplate at the top of the canvas. Use the blank buttons as spacers or put them aside.

",How to Think Like a Genius," Geniuses are passionate about the things they do. If you want to think like a genius, find what you love and dive in headfirst.


Figure out what your learning style is and make use of it. The major types are auditory, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic and kinesthetic. Experiment with different techniques for absorbing information and stick with what works best.
Learn how to self-educate. There are lots of resources available on the internet and through local services like community colleges and libraries that can put all sorts of exciting information at your fingertips.
Be pro-active and ask questions. There are people you meet every day that know all sorts of things and have a variety of valuable skills to share. As a genius, be interested in the potential in everything.
Be over-comprehensive in your studies. Learn everything there is to know.
As you learn about different disciplines, think about how they connect to one another.

, Genius ideas have often occurred in the pursuit of something that many contemporaries thought to be downright crazy. Create opportunities for yourself to discover new things by embarking on journeys on which no one has yet embarked.

, It is on the edges of knowledge that innovation and discovery happen. Don't be afraid to question conventional wisdom, because geniuses are often the ones who rewrite current conventions.

, Try for quantity before quality. To produce exceptionally good work, do a lot of whatever you're doing. It increases your chances for success and it means you will get more practice along the way. It also takes the pressure off, knowing that while an effort may be your first, it will likely not be your last. Most geniuses in history, whatever they were doing, did a lot of many things, and not all of it was genius!


There is a theory that to become a ""master"" in any subject, you need 10,000 hours of practice. Professional orchestra players and computer programmers demonstrate this idea. (Citation: Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, 2009, but see also Creativity: Genius and other Myths, Weisberg, 1986)

, Bloom's Taxonomy is a breakdown of the six levels of thinking, from the lowest level to the highest. You can use it to help you think about thinking on a deeper level.


Knowledge is accepting and believing a fact. Knowing 2 + 2 = 4, doesn't mean you know what 2 + 2 = 4 means.
Application is knowing how to use the fact. You can determine that 2 cats plus 2 cats equals 4 cats. You don't know what 2 + 2 = 4 means, but you can apply it.
Comprehension is understanding a fact: You understand the concept of addition and how 2 + 2 = 4.
Analysis is breaking down information into its parts. 4 - 2 = 2; (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 2 + 2 = 4.
Synthesis is Creating something new. (2 + 2) + (2 + 2) = 4 + 4.
Evaluation: Discussion of the merits of 2 + 2 = 4.

, You are different. You think differently. Every kind of genius is different and individual. And every kind of opinion has something true and something you can learn from.


Remember that different ideas have not historically been accepted well, and yours may not be either. Geniuses throughout history have not let this deter them; neither should you.

Find a suitable agenda template.,
Download agenda template.,
Open in Microsoft Word.,
Customize your agenda.,
Keep it professional.,
Proofread your agenda.",How to Create an Agenda3," The first step is to find a suitable meeting agenda template, because there is little use starting from scratch, when there are so many fantastic tools on the internet. A quick search will throw up a list of sites which can help you make a start. These websites contain various different kinds of agenda format, so browse until you find one that you are happy with.

, Once you have found the perfect template, select it and click the download button, after the preview screen provided.

, locate the template, by opening the Downloads folder on your computer, and then open the template file using Microsoft Word. This is the best choice of documentary software, as it is easy to navigate and simple to use. For the fastest, most efficient agenda template, you are recommended to use up to date Microsoft Word.

, Do not forget to customize your agenda. The template that you have downloaded will be filled with example information, so that you know what to write, and where to write it. This information needs to be replaced with data about your company. This includes the header; make sure that you add your logo, copyright text, and any other important details.


once you have filled in the basic information, it is time to turn to the agenda format. You are responsible for allocating time to each agenda, and for deciding which agendas are important enough to make it onto the schedule, so take care when filling out the slots. It can be useful to use the headings, Agenda Item, Presenter and Time – just to keep everything clear and well defined.

, You are recommended to not leaving any of the agenda ‘slots’ empty. If you have more spaces than you need, delete them. You should also feel free to make aesthetic modifications. There is no reason why you can’t switch up the color, headings, and format to match the essence of the company. However, you are recommended to not use dark colors, because they will make the document harder to read. Use of light and company color scheme will make it looks professional.

, The final step is to give your completed agenda a quick read through, whilst keeping an eye out for spelling mistakes and typos. Now, you are ready to have a great meeting.

Gather your materials.,
Arrange your sticky note pads on the cardboard.,
Fill in the rest of the board with additional sticky note pads.,
Label the current month with a marker.",How to Make Your Own Calendar2," You will need sticky label pads, a marker, and a large piece of cardboard. Make sure that the cardboard is at least seven times the height of the sticky notes and six times its width.

, Start by aligning the bottom corner of the cardboard with the bottom corner of one sticky pad. Work your way across adding sticky pads until there are seven in the row, one for each day of the week. Then begin adding note pads vertically along the edge until the column is six pads tall., Trim off any excess cardboard from the sides.


Try alternating colored sticky notes for the different weeks or days of the week. Breaking up lines and columns makes them easier to read.

, Write the name of the month in large letters the top. Mark the dates on each sticky note pad. Fill in details for any important plans or holidays."
"
Gather your materials.,
Make sure your magnets are thicker than the inside of the bottle caps.,
Separate your caps into at least three different groups and paint them different colors.,
Add details to your caps.,
Apply the paint sealant.,
Attach sticky magnets to the bottle caps.,
Arrange your calendar however you want.",How to Make Your Own Calendar3," You will need at least 65 metal bottle caps, acrylic paint, fine paintbrushes, adhesive craft magnets, and paint sealant.


Be sure to have thick cardboard and a hot glue gun on hand. They may also be required.
You may also use spray paint as a first ""primer"" coat instead of slowly painting each by hand., If the magnets are too thin, they won't be able to make contact with surfaces and stick properly.


Glue squares of cardboard to the inside of the bottle caps if your magnets are too thin., Lay down a solid base coat and let it dry before adding details.


Paint at least 31 caps one color for the dates of the month.
Paint at least 7 caps a second color, one for each day of the week.
Paint at least 12 caps a third color for the names of each month.
For special occasions, you can paint the remaining caps additional colors. Or, you can reuse one of the three basic colors.

, Use a fine brush to paint on your labels. Number each of your date caps 1-31. Write abbreviations on your month and day of the week caps. Paint symbols for special events (like balloons for birthdays or a heart for Valentine's Day).

, Without the sealant, acrylic can chip away. Wait for the paint to completely dry before sealing and then wait for the sealant to dry before moving on.A spray on sealant will take less time, but a brush on sealant will work fine, too.

, Cut the magnets into appropriate-sized squares. Remove the tape to reveal the glue side. Press the sticky side of a magnet either into the inside of each bottle cap or on top of the cardboard., The best thing about this method is how easy it is to change how the tiles are laid out. You can spread your calendar over a whole freezer or carefully line it up inside a locker. It's also incredibly easy to transport. Just put the pieces in a small box or bag, and you can take them anywhere.

Question received wisdom and authority.,
Risk making mistakes.,
Pursue knowledge fearlessly.,
Look for the interconnectedness in things.,
Draw your own conclusions.",How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci1," Genuine innovation requires that you, like Leonardo Da Vinci, question the accepted answers to complicated questions and actively form your own opinions and observations about the world you inhabit. Leonardo trusted his senses and intuition over the ""wisdom"" of others, both contemporary and historical, relying upon himself and his own experience of the world to inform his worldview.


For Leonardo, curiosity meant both looking forward and looking back, looking beyond the accepted wisdom of the Christian Bible to interact with the ancients, studying Greek and Roman texts and philosophical modes of thought, the scientific method, and art.

Exercise: Examine an angle of a particular issue, concept, or topic you feel strongly about, from the opposite point of view of your own. Even if you're confident you ""understand"" what makes a painting great, or how a string quartet is put together, or you know everything there is to know about the state of the polar ice caps, make it your business to seek out dissenting opinions and alternative ideas. Make an argument for the opposite of what you believe. Play devil's advocate.;
, A creative thinker won't hide in the comfortable blanket of safe opinions, but will mercilessly seek truth, even at the risk of being completely and totally wrong. Let your curiosity and enthusiasm for topics rule your mind, not the fear of being wrong. Embrace mistakes as opportunities and think and act in such a way as to risk making them. Greatness risks failure.


Leonardo Da Vinci enthusiastically studied physiognomy, a bogus science that purported to link facial features and character. Now thoroughly debunked, it was a trendy concept in Leonardo's day, and might've contributed significantly to his innovative interest in our understanding of detailed anatomy. Though we might think of this as ""wrong"" it's perhaps better to think of it as a kind of swampy stepping stone to a greater truth.

Exercise: Find a dated, debunked, or controversial idea and learn everything you can about it. Consider what it would mean to see the world in this alternative way. Look into the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Hell's Angels, or the Harmony Society, and learn about their worldview and the historical context of their organization. Were they, or are they, ""wrong""?

, The curious thinker embraces the unknown, the mysterious, and the frightening. To learn about anatomy, Leonardo spent countless hours studying corpses in less-than-sterile conditions, compared to the modern cadaver lab. His thirst for knowledge far outweighed his squeamishness, and led to his pioneering study of the human body and his life drawings.Exercise: Research a topic that frightens you. Filled with dread about the end of the world? Research eschatology and apocalypse. Scared of vampires? Dig up the dirt on Vlad the Impaler. Nuclear war always giving you nightmares? Learn about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.

, To think curiously means to look for patterns in ideas and images, finding similarities that link disparate concepts rather than differences. Leonardo Da Vinci could never have invented the ""mechanical horse"" that became his bicycle without having linked seemingly unrelated concepts, horse-riding and simple gears. Try to find common ground in your interpersonal interactions, and look for the things you can relate to about an idea or issue, the things you can take from it, rather than looking at it as ""wrong"".



Exercise: Close your eyes and randomly draw squiggles or lines on a page, then open your eyes and finish the drawing you started. Look into the nonsense and make sense from it. Generate a list of ""off the top of your head"" words and put them all into the same poem or story, looking for a narrative in the chaos.

, The curious thinker is unsatisfied with received wisdom and accepted answers, and chooses instead to either validate those accepted answers with real-life observations and perceptions, or form new opinions based on an experience of the world.


Of course, this doesn't mean that you can't validate the existence of Australia because you haven't seen it yourself, but rather that you choose to abstain from an opinion about it until you've learned everything you can about it, and experienced that knowledge for yourself.

Exercise: Think of a time your opinion was swayed by someone or something. It could be as simple as changing your opinion about a movie you kind of liked, because all your friends felt the opposite way and you preferred to fit in. Go back and re-examine that movie with a fresh set of eyes.

"
Ask questions, particularly the question ""why?"".,
Look for selfish motives.,
Stop being a people pleaser.,
Challenge yourself.,
Do the research.,
Decide whether to speak up.,
Be humble.,
Live outside your comfort zone.,
Beware paralysis by analysis.,
Don't be afraid of being wrong.",How to Think for Yourself," Ask everyone (not just the so-called experts), and try to answer your own questions as well. When you get an answer, try to think of exceptions, and then ask yourself why those exceptions exist. Never be satisfied until you arrive at an answer that has very few exceptions.;
, Some people will become very annoyed, and perhaps even offended, that you're questioning something they accept without question. Whenever people want you to think a certain way, it's because it benefits them in some way. But that benefit is not always obvious or direct.


People want you to adopt their perspective because it makes them feel more comfortable and secure (safety in numbers).
People's beliefs make it easier for them to feel like a good person. These people don't want those beliefs challenged because it's as if you were challenging them personally - it seems to them that you are questioning their ""good-person-hood"".
People are often trying to look out for your best interest, and truly want you to be in step with their beliefs without looking into their statements any further.
People just want to be seen as authoritative and trusted, so they're personally invested in whether or not you buy into the things they say. That's why they take it personally if you don't automatically buy in.

, People who don't think for themselves are often scared of disagreeing with others, and scared of ""rocking the boat"". A freethinker, on the other hand, bases their self worth on something other than what people think of them. These people may still experience rejection, discomfort, and anguish, but they will continue to think for themselves.


In cases where someone says he ""just wants the best for you,"" you may be accused of distrust, and it could make you feel guilty. But keep in mind that anyone who truly cares for you will be willing to patiently explain their point of view and why they feel that way, and allow you to decide for yourself whether that is enough evidence for you.

, What do I want to do? Why should I do it? What would I get if I do it? What am I getting for not doing it? Ask these questions. For example, challenge: I dare myself to ask the girl in my class out.


Why? It would save me all the frustration I'm having now.
Why not? It would make me embarrassed in front of her or other people if she rejects me. Do I exactly know what they would think? ok if someone would ask a girl out in front of me, how I would I feel? probably I will feel better about that guy 'he is daring' and would I mind ? no ...may be. Even if they think that way, should I care? what would I get if cared about what they think.
What would happen if she says 'yes' to go out with me? I would feel so much better and confident. I would get a date, confidence and fun to know a new person.
If I didn't? Same life and same routine. But at least I tried to talk to her.

, Look into the statements made by others. You'll be amazed at how many times you'll find lots of evidence to contradict the statements of others. Yet, some people spout erroneous information and never question the accuracy or truth of what they're saying. Use Google or go to the library, and search for information to prove or disprove the statements made. Remember where you get the ""evidence"" from. Be aware that, just because you saw it in a book or on the internet, that alone does not make it the truth. A lot of websites commonly seen as a font of knowledge (Wikipedia is a good example of this) can in fact be edited by absolutely anyone, and inserting false information happens (it's known as ""wiki-salting"").

, Thinking for yourself is one thing; expressing your thoughts is another. If your conclusions don't line up with those of others, you can keep them to yourself, or present your own perspective. Just be aware that the latter is likely to lead to heated arguments (see above).


Once you've found evidence, one way or the other, you can speak up about it. ""Yes, you know after we talked last time, I was so interested that I looked that up. That's amazing, isn't it, hard to believe, but true!"" Or conversely, you can say, ""I know that sounds amazing, and I hate to burst the bubble because it's fun to believe that could be true, but I looked it up, and it looks like it isn't true. I feel bad to be the bearer of bad news, but I just don't think that's true. You can look at (wherever you found your disproving evidence) and see for yourself.""
If you'd rather avoid arguments and debates, employ some evasive manoeuvres. Change the subject, find a reason to step away, or just say ""I don't really want to talk about this right now.""

, When you're breaking the news that your friend is passing along a false tale, let them know in a humble and compassionate way - don't just come in crowing and congratulating yourself for debunking a myth. You may look smart to others for a minute, but to your friend, you look like a jerk.

, Not only will some people be very perturbed by your refusal to take their statements at face value, but you will also learn to question your own assumptions, and that can make you feel lost and confused, like walking into a dark room. It takes courage to face uncertainty. Be Bold.

, When you're thinking for yourself, you're taking full responsibility for your life and your actions, because you can't say you were trusting someone else's judgement. This can be very nerve-wracking, and lead to excessive self-doubt. Remember that thinking for yourself doesn't mean being sure. It means making decisions based on your own analysis, rather than someone else's. There will always be some degree of uncertainty, no matter what, that you must learn to accept and cope with.

, It's okay to be wrong. It is impossible to know everything that there is to know. When you find yourself in a situation where you have been proven wrong, accept it. Try to improve your knowledge in that field and find the answer."

Recognize the procrastinator's motto.,
Remember that you don't 'have to' do anything.,
Focus on starting, rather than finishing.,
Break a long project down into short tasks.,
Don't place too much pressure on yourself.,
Stop thinking about the way things 'should' be.,
Take some directed action.,
Make it fun!,
Rephrase your internal dialog.",How to Overcome Procrastination Using Self Talk," Consider the following thought, which surely crosses our minds many times in one form or another:“I have to finish this important task. It should already be done by now and I just need to do it.”
This small, seemingly innocent thought contains almost every mental block that encourages procrastination. We all use the Procrastinator’s Motto (or variations of it) every once in a while. If you’re a chronic procrastinator, chances are you repeat it to yourself very frequently — daily, perhaps.
But what’s so wrong about the Procrastinator’s Motto? In what ways do these words encourage procrastination so much — and what can we do about it? Let’s consider each part of this statement in turn, replacing each of them with an empowering alternative. In doing that, we’ll turn the original motto on its head and create a productive call to action: a “Producer’s Motto”, if you like.;
, ‘I have to’ is every procrastinator’s favorite expression. It’s also the most disempowering. Every time you say to yourself that you have to do something, you imply that you don’t have any choice, that you feel forced or coerced to do the task — that you don’t really want to do it. That perception, of course, elicits a strong feeling of being victimized and resistance toward doing the task. The solution to this problem is to replace ‘I have to’ with the immensely more empowering alternative ‘I choose to’ or 'I will'. Everything you do is ultimately a choice (yes, even completing tax forms). Using language that expresses choice reminds you of that and brings the feeling of power back.

, When you focus on finishing something, you direct your attention to a vague, highly idealized future. Visualizing a finished project is motivating for many people, but for someone who’s having a hard time starting a task, visualizing a hard-to-grasp future can be overwhelming — even depressing. The solution in this case, then, is not to focus on finishing, but on starting. Forget for a minute about the finish line, just concentrate on giving your first step. Bring your focus from the future to what can be done right now. We all know that if we start something enough times, we'll eventually finish the task. Starting — all by itself — is usually sufficient to build enough momentum to keep the ball rolling., Dwelling on the size and difficulty of a looming task will overwhelm us, and this will promote procrastination. Any undertaking, no matter how daunting, can be broken down into smaller steps. The trick is — with each step along the way — to focus solely on the next, achievable chunk of work. Ignore the big picture for a while and just tackle that next small task. Make sure you can easily visualize the outcome of your small task. Don’t write a book; write a page. If it is still intimidating, commit yourself to work on it for a specific period of time.
Keep the big picture in mind, of course, but don't allow it to frighten you. Use it for motivation and direction.

, “This project has to impress everyone; I really can’t blow this opportunity.” Placing such high hopes on a project only adds anxiety and fear of failure. Perfectionism fuels procrastination. Overcome this mental block by simply giving yourself permission to be human. Allow yourself to be imperfect with the next small task. You can always refine your work later. If you’re a serial perfectionist, go one step further and commit yourself to doing a sloppy job on purpose — at least at first. Instead of making every step perfect, think of them as steps toward perfection. For instance, write a page or two now, then proofread and correct them later.

, The expression 'should' invokes blame and guilt. When you say you should be doing something (instead of what you’re actually doing), you focus on comparing an ideal reality with your current, “bad” reality. You focus not on what is, but on what could have been. Misused 'shoulds' can elicit feelings of failure, depression and regret. The solution is not to focus on how you feel now, but on how good you will feel after you begin to take action.

, Even the tiniest progress is success — moving toward a goal is the best motivator. The trick is to bring that expected feeling of accomplishment into the present — and know that the real joy of progress is only a small task away. That small step is success.
Success is not the end of your task. Success is the progress that leads you to your next step.

, “I’ve got to work all weekend”. “I am trapped in this laborious project”. Long periods of isolation can bring an enormous feeling of resentment. These feelings generate a strong sense of deprivation and resistance toward the task.
Overcome this mental block by avoiding long stretches of work. Schedule frequent and brief breaks. Plan small rewards along the way. One idea is to work near a break area. Have something to look forward to — not far away and not at the end of a long stretch — but in the very near future. When rewards are small, frequent, and deserved, they work wonders. Truly commit to brief bursts of relaxation and leisure time. In fact, go ahead and make it mandatory. This “reverse-psychology” can, by itself, give you a more productive and enjoyable mindset.

, Time to check what we’ve accomplished with all the word substitutions. We started with:
“I have to finish this important task. It should already be done by now and I just need to do it.”
And ended up with:“I choose to start this task with a small, imperfect step. I’ll feel terrific and have plenty of time for fun!”
Quite a change, eh? Every time you catch yourself repeating any part of Procrastinator’s Motto to yourself, stop and rephrase it. Then check how you feel. At first, it may seem to be a simple matter of word choices. But when you try this simple way of reframing your thoughts, you’ll see how it instantly changes your attitude toward your tasks. Moreover, if you turn it into a habit, you’ll slowly reprogram your thoughts, and make a positive, permanent change in your mindset.

Maybe thinking about everything you need to do before the end of the year is driving you nuts. Whatever the nature of your commitments, select the time-frame of the priorities list you hope to create to help you start managing those priorities and translating that stress into meaningful action.Short-Term Goals will often include things from many different categories. You might have several things you need to finish for work by the end of the day, as well as the errands you need to run before heading home, and various things to do around the house when you get there. You could have a list of stress-causers, all things that need to be done in the next several hours.

Long-Term Goals might include larger ambitions that will need to be broken down into multiple steps you'll also need to prioritize. You might put ""apply to colleges"" on a long-term to-do list, which will involve many different smaller activities. The simple act of breaking it down, though, will simplify and demystify the process.

, Start breaking it down and writing down what exactly you need to do in whatever order the things occur to you. Within the time frame that's got you stressing, select all the tasks--however big or small--that will need to be accomplished and list them out. List projects that need to be accomplished, decisions that need to be made, and errands that need to be run.

, It may be helpful to break everything up into separate categories, basically creating different to-do lists for the different areas of your life. House chores might be one category, while work projects or school projects may be another. If you've got a busy social life, there might be a lot going on during the weekend that you've also got to prepare for and prioritize. Create separate lists for each.


Alternatively, if it helps you to have everything in one place, you might consider creating an over-all to-do of home chores and responsibilities, work commitments, and things necessary for your social life. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it can help to have everything juxtaposed with everything else, to let you start seeing the importance of individual tasks compared with others., Identify the most important or urgent activities on the list and rewrite the list with those at the top. It's all relative to you and the topics on your list, so you might decide that school activities trump work projects, or vice versa.


Alternatively, if everything is equally important and necessary, keep the list unordered and approach it alphabetically or randomly. As long as you're actively ticking things off the list, all that matters is that you're getting things done.

, Especially true for long-term lists, keep your list somewhere visible where you'll be able to use it as a reminder for what you need to finish, actively crossing out or checking off the items as you complete them.


If you've got an analog list on a piece of paper, hang it somewhere you'll commonly look, like the refrigerator door or a bulletin board near the front door, or your office wall.
Alternatively, you might keep a list on your desktop open while you work on other things, so you can keep it fresh in your mind and delete the items when you finish them.
Post-it notes make for great around-the-house reminders. If you put a Post-it reminding you to work on your paper on the television screen, you'll remember to do what's important instead of wasting time doing something less productive.

, What are the most important things on your list? In general, you might decide that work/school tasks will outweigh social and house-hold chores, though certain outliers may exist. You've got to eat and bathe, for example, though laundry might be able to wait another day while you finish an important work project.


Decide on a few different levels, maybe three, to rank the different tasks and criteria on your list. High, medium, and low importance tasks might be the best and simplest way to start ranking the importance of things on your list. Be judicious in deciding.

, Consider upcoming deadlines and your ability to work within those deadlines. What needs to be done the soonest? What needs to be done by the end of the day? What might you be able to buy a bit more time on?


It's important to consider the length of time it takes you to accomplish each of the tasks, maybe even assigning a set time to certain things. If you consider it a priority to exercise every day, but you've got a crazy amount of work to do, give yourself an exercise cap of 30 minutes and find somewhere to fit it in.

, It might be critical that you get something to post-office by the end of the day, but this isn't a terrifically difficult task. Rank everything on your list in terms of its difficult so you'll know how to situate it in relation to other tasks.


It might be effective to use levels like Difficult, Moderate, and Easy to rank them, rather than trying to judge them in relation to one another. Don't worry about putting them in order before you've given each item its own rating, if it's helpful to do so.

, Put at the top of the list the most important and urgent tasks that will require the least amount of effort to try to maximize your work in the time you've allotted for it.

, It's difficult to work your way through the list by cherry-picking and doing a little bit of everything. After several hours, your list will look just like it looks now: incomplete. Instead of working in little bits, do one thing until it's finished and then move to the next thing on your list after a short break. Don't work on something else on the list until you're finished with the first and most important things.


Alternatively, you can look for projects from multiple lists that might be effectively combined. While it may not be a great idea to try to review your math notes and write your history paper at the same time, you might be able to sit at the laundromat and wait for your clothes to dry while studying, saving time getting important tasks finished., If the Internet is on the fritz at your house, it may be tempting to head to the library, start reading up on wi-fi so you can diagnose the problem from scratch, but not if you've got to finish cooking dinner, grade twenty papers by the next morning, and do fifty other things. Might it be better to call the cable company instead?


It's ok to decide something just isn't worth the time, or that delegating a task at a cost outweighs the time you might spend on it. You could buy new expensive fence wire, or you could salvage your own by combing through the junkyard painstakingly, sifting through rough scrap for several hours in the hot sun, but if it only turns out to be a few bucks of savings, it might be more worth it to buy new wire.

, Breaking up the sorts of activities you do will help keep you fresh throughout your tasks and help you move through your list more quickly. Alternate a homework list with a housework list to be the most effective worker you can be. Take short breaks between them and do different tasks. You'll stay fresh and efficient.

, Depending on your temperament, it can be good for your own morale if you accomplish the thing first that you're looking forward to the least. It might not necessarily be the hardest or the most important thing, but getting it out of the way to save the less painful activities for later could be effective for some people.


Your English essay might be more important than your math homework, but if you really hate math, get it out of the way first so you can clear out all the time you need to devote solely to the essay, giving it your full, unfettered attention.

, You might have a situation in which you've only got 10 minutes to get all the way across town to the library to pick up the new disc of Game of Thrones you ordered, making it the most urgent thing on your list, but that time might be better spent doing the more-important task of getting to work on your English essay. You'll have bought yourself more time by waiting to pick up your DVD until the next day, when you might have more time for it.

, Congratulations! As you move through the list, take a glad moment to cross each thing off, deleting it from the file, or aggressively cutting it off the paper with a rusty pocketknife and ceremonially setting the scrap on fire. Take a minute to reward yourself for each little accomplishment. You're doing it!

Shut off your phone and other electronics.,
Put your music on pause.,
Find out where you work best.,
Make sure you won’t be interrupted.",How to Avoid Distractions1," Before you dive into working, cleaning, writing or whatever else you need to do, turn off or silence your cell phone and anything else that might prove to be a distraction. This includes the TV, video games, etc. Technology is arguably the biggest distraction in modern society, and being surrounded by beeping, buzzing, flashing devices can really hold you back.Unless you use your computer for work, shut it down or set it to hibernate.
Disable sound alerts for texts, emails and tweets to keep yourself from looking at your phone every time there’s activity.If you have an especially hard time keeping yourself on task, put away potential distractions somewhere that it would be a hassle to get them back out.;
, When you really need to buckle down, work in silence and give your thoughts room to stretch. Your mind naturally fixates on melodies, rhythms and lyrics. Music can uplift your spirits and make the time pass faster, but by subconsciously following along with a song playing in the background, you’ll be limiting your ability to concentrate whether you realize it or not.Save the tunes for after you’ve finished a particular project, or for times when you’re performing light, mindless tasks.

, If you work from home or are involved in creative endeavors, pick a place where you can work comfortably for long periods of time. This could be a small corner desk, a well-lit sunroom or your favorite coffee shop. The point is to surround yourself with an atmosphere that makes completing tasks easier.Be careful of surroundings that can dull your focus in other ways. People tend to associate spaces with their common uses, so trying to work in a quiet bedroom may just make you sleepy.

, As best you can, try to insulate yourself from being distracted by others when you have big projects that demand your attention. Situate yourself someplace where people are unlikely to pass by and pull you out of your zone. If you work in an office, for instance, shutting the door can relay the message that you’d prefer not to be bothered. This may not always be possible if you share a space with coworkers, customers or children, but you should at least be able to single out which interactions are necessary and which aren’t.Organizing your duties in their most efficient logical order can also keep you from having to interrupt your own work later on.
Putting on a pair of headphones, even if they’re not playing anything, will make you appear busy and discourage people from trying to start casual conversations.

Concentrate on the ""Three MITs"".,
Batch small tasks.",How to Eliminate All but the Absolute Essential Tasks," Take a few minutes to review your task and project lists, and see how much you can simplify them. Make it a challenge. See if you can cut it in half! If you’ve got 50 items, cut it down to 25. Then try to cut it even further a few days later. How do you eliminate tasks? Sometimes a task gets old and isn’t necessary anymore. Cross those out. Sometimes a task can be delegated. Do that, and cross it out.;
, How do you know what’s essential? By knowing what your main goal is, and other goals if necessary. You really should focus on one goal at a time, but if you want to do 2 or 3, that’s all right too. Just don’t do 10 goals or anything. Those goals should be your essential projects. Any smaller tasks are essential if they help you accomplish those goals, and not essential if they’re not related.

, How many projects are you committed to? How many extracurricular stuff do you do? You can’t do it all. You need to learn to say no, and to value your time. And if you’ve already said yes, it’s still possible to say no. Just be honest with people and tell them that you have a high number of urgent projects to complete and cannot commit to this any longer. Slowly, you can eliminate your commitments to a very small number — only have those commitments in your life that really give you joy and value.

, Eliminate most of your RSS feeds, cut back on the number of emails you respond to and consider not reading newspapers or watching TV other than DVDs. Simplify the inputs into your life, and you can simplify the outputs.

, Your to-do list tends to build up over the course of a week. Take a few minutes each week to eliminate, and eliminate some more. You don’t need a huge to-do list to be productive — just do the stuff that matters.

, During your weekly review, figure out the most important tasks that you’d like to accomplish over the next week. Those are your Big Rocks. Now place them on your schedule, first thing in the day, on different days of the upcoming week. Make those the most important tasks each day, and do them first — don’t let them be pushed back to the end of the day.

, Consider the case of two newspaper writers. One is super busy and writes a dozen articles a week. They’re all decent articles, but they’re pretty routine in nature. The second writer writes one article this week, but it gets the front page headline, it’s talked about all around town and blogged about on the internet, it gets him a journalism award and he becomes a big name in journalism. From this article, he lands a bigger job and a book deal. While this example is a bit extreme, it illustrates the point that some tasks really pay off in the long term, and others just keep you busy and in the long run, don’t matter at all. The first writer could have stayed home all week and slept, and it wouldn’t have changed his world much (except he wouldn’t get paid for that week). Focus on those big tasks, that will make a name for you, that will generate long-term income, that will give you lasting satisfaction and happiness. Those are your Big Rocks. Eliminate the rest.

, Here’s your planning system each day: write down your three Most Important Tasks (MITs) on a sheet of paper or in a small notebook. That’s it. Check off those tasks when you finish them. Devote your entire day, if possible, to those three tasks, or at the very least devote the first half of your day to them. Your MITs are basically the Big Rocks you planned for this week, and any other MIT that you need to do for today.

, During the course of the day, other stuff will come up that you really need to take care of or they could create problems for you later. Write those down on another small list of small tasks (for example, at the bottom of your pocket notebook page). You don’t need to do the tasks right now, most likely. Just write them down for later. Set a time (probably 30 minutes or so) to batch process these tasks sometime later in the day (perhaps 4 p.m.).


Do your MITs first.
Then do all the small tasks at the same time. These might be calls, emails, writing a short letter, doing paperwork, etc. Try to do them quickly and knock them off your list.
You might have a few tasks left at the end of the day. Better to leave the small tasks until tomorrow than the big ones.
Batch process email, too — if you do it throughout the day, it’s just a bunch of interruptions. Just do it once or twice a day.

Ask probing questions.,
Test your hypotheses with your own observations.,
See your ideas all the way through to completion.,
Build new concepts from a foundation of failures.",How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci2," Sometimes the simplest questions are the most complex. How does a bird fly? Why is the sky blue? These are the kinds of questions that drove Leonardo Da Vinci to his innovative genius and scientific study. It was insufficient for Da Vinci to hear ""Because God wills it,"" when the answer was much more complicated and much less abstract. Learn to form probing questions about the things that interest you and test them to obtain results.



Exercise: Write down at least five questions about a subject that fascinates you, and that you'd like to know more about. Instead of doing a cursory wikipedia search of the topic and then forgetting the matter completely, select a single question from that list and sit with it for at least a week. How do mushrooms grow? What is coral? What is a soul? Research it at the library. Write about it. Draw about it. Think about it.

, When you've started to form your own opinion about a particular topic or question, when you think you're getting close to a satisfactory answer, determine what criteria would be sufficient to either accept or reject that answer. What would prove you were right? What would prove you were wrong? How can you test your idea?



Exercise: Come up with a testable theory for your probing question and set up an examination, using the scientific method. Gather some substrate and grow your own mushrooms to learn more about different methods, techniques, and varieties.

, The scientific thinker interrogates ideas until all avenues of thought have been prodded at, examined, verified, or rejected. Leave no avenue of inquiry untouched. Regular thinkers often get attached to one of the first pleasing options or answers, ignoring the more interesting or complicated questions that might be more accurate. If you want to think like Leonardo Da Vinci, leave no stone unturned in your search for truth.



Exercise: Practice mind mapping. A powerful tool that can help you combine logic and imagination in your work and life, the end result of mapping should be a web-like structure of words and ideas that are somehow related in your mind, making it easier to remember all the nooks and crannies of your thoughts, failure and success alike. Mind mapping can improve memory, reading retention, and creativity.

, A scientist embraces failed experiments in the same way that a scientist embraces successful ones: an option has been eliminated from the list of possibilities, getting you one step closer to some truth. Learn from hypotheses that turn out to be wrong. If you were absolutely sure that your new way of structuring a work day, writing a story, or rebuilding your engine would be perfect, and it turned out not to be so, celebrate! You completed an experiment and learned what won't work next time.



Exercise: Think back to a particular failure. List all the things you learned from it, what you'll be able to do more effectively as a direct result of that failure.

"

Keep a detailed and illustrated journal.,
Write descriptively.,
See clearly.,
Cast a wide net.",How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci3," Much of what we now celebrate as priceless art was really just Leonardo Da Vinci's daily sketch book, which he recorded not because he was actively trying to make a masterpiece, but because the creative act was integrated to such a degree in his everyday life that it became the way he processed thoughts, writing them down with accompanying illustrations. Writing forces you to think in a different way, articulating your nebulous thoughts as specifically and concretely as possible.



Exercise: Come up with a list of topics on which you'll thoroughly journal over the course of a day. Big topics you've got opinions about, like ""television"" or ""Bob Dylan"" would be perfectly appropriate. Start addressing the issue by writing at the top of the page, ""On Dylan"" and writing, drawing, and free-associating your way through the writing. If you come to a place you're unsure about, do some research. Learn more.

, Cultivate a rich vocabulary and use accurate words in your descriptions. Use similes, metaphors, and analogies to capture abstract concepts and seek connections between your ideas, continually investigating the roil of your thoughts. Describe things in terms of tactile senses--touch, smell, taste, feel--and also in terms of their import, their symbolism as you're experiencing it, and their significance.



Exercise: Read Charles Simic's poem ""Fork"".In it, he describes the most pedestrian and everyday object both accurately and with the strangest of eyes.

, One of Leonardo's mottoes was saper vedere (knowing how to see), upon which he built his work in arts and science. While you're journaling, develop a sharp eye for seeing the world and turn it onto luminous particularities. Write down images you see throughout the day, striking things, bits of graffiti, gestures, strange shirts, strange bits of language, anything that strikes you. Record it. Become an encyclopedia of tiny moments and record those moments in words and images.



Exercise: You don't have to journal like it was the 15th century. Use your camera phone to take lots of pictures on the way to work to liven up your commute. Make yourself actively seek out 10 striking images on your way and take pictures of them. On your way home, look back through the morning pictures and think about what it was that struck you. Look for the connections in the chaos.

, Leonardo Da Vinci is the Platonic ideal of the Renaissance Man: equally notable as a scientist, artist, and inventor, Leonardo would be doubtless confused and frustrated by modern notions of a ""career."" It's hard to imagine him sullenly carting off to work at an office, putting in his hours and going home to watch ""House of Cards."" If you're interested in a subject or a project that's outside of your everyday experiences, call that an opportunity rather than a challenge. Embrace the luxury of modern life for the instantaneous access we have to information, the freedom we have to pursue experiences, and the limitlessness of it.



Exercise: Write up a bucket list of subjects and projects you want to accomplish over the next several months or years. Always wanted to get a draft of a novel together? Or learn banjo? There's no sense in waiting for it to happen. It's never too late to learn.

Be aware of when you're getting distracted.,
Resist the urge to procrastinate.,
Focus with intention.,
Get away from the source of your distractions.",How to Avoid Distractions2," The second you notice yourself reaching for your phone to check a text message or opening a webpage unrelated to work, stop and cut the distraction off at the pass. In order to combat the most common distractions, you must be able to recognize when they're stealing your attention away. Practice staying mindful of resisting distractions by repeating a phrase like ""be here now"" or ""this is not what I need to be doing"" when you catch your attention drifting. Being vigilant of your mind state can help snap you back to reality.Many distractions simply have to be ignored. The brain is well-equipped to block out smaller, less intrusive distractions, but with a little practice you can learn to build up your focus and attention like a muscle.
Most people lose so much time to extraneous activities because they fail to notice when they're getting distracted, and only become aware of their mistake once the damage has been done., Be disciplined about making yourself start working. Procrastination is a major distraction because it allows you to convince yourself that you’ll be better off performing a task when you feel more prepared. Once you realize that you’ll never get anything done unless you do it now, you won’t feel so tempted to put things off.Procrastination is a childish mentality. It can cause you to avoid responsibility in favor of feeling good right now.
Research has shown that people rarely meet with more success when they put things off until later as opposed to doing them right away.

, Sometimes you have to remind yourself to actively focus. Many people never truly learn how to stay focused and find it difficult to keep their minds from wandering when there’s work to be done. Try to shut off your own mental distractions so that you can zero in on checking items off your to-do list. It’s not enough to simply know that you need to focus; you have to apply yourself to the action you’re performing in the moment.It can help to remember that the best way to get everything done is to put all your effort toward one thing at a time. Start by seeing a specific task or project through to completion, then move onto another, then another, until you’ve met your goal for the day.

, Physically remove yourself from a certain set of distractions that's leaching your mental power. Pack the materials you need for work or a creative project and head down to the library or a quiet cafe where you can peacefully resume your labors. By isolating yourself, you'll be able to literally escape the distractions that you just can't ignore. If you're powerless before a certain distraction, sometimes you just have to cut and run.Even if you're unable to literally leave the worst of your distractions behind, there are still things you can do to rid them from your mind. Leave your phone at home, turn off your wi-fi and close every tab you have open that isn't helping you with your current task.An ideal working environment is one where there are as few distractions present as possible. This can mean persistent annoyances like cell phones, computers and social media, but it can also include anything that reminds you of what you'd rather be doing.

Set aside specific times to work.,
Do your most important work first.,
Give yourself a daily minimum of things to do.,
Take breaks judiciously.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Avoid Distractions3," Find out what time of day you do your best work and structure your to-do list around those hours. If you’re a morning person, wake up and get busy before you stall out and lose motivation. Night owls can divide their chores up between regular working hours and free time after everyone else has gone to bed. Most people are realistically only able to stay focused for a few hours a day, so be sure that you’re making the best use of that time.Develop a habit of working at the same time every day, and make yourself stick to it.
If you keep odd or irregular hours, let others know when you’re working to keep from being bothered.

, Have a clear idea in mind of what you need to get done and take care of the biggest challenges first. That way, you’ll at least be assured that the most crucial tasks have been dealt with. Be able to prioritize wisely so that any leftover work can be knocked out with minimal time and energy. After a while, the anxiety of facing a mountain of unfinished work will disappear.When you have a proposal to outline, meetings to schedule and emails to answer, it can be easy to start feeling overwhelmed. By completing the outline first, however, then using the rest of your day to get your schedule in order and follow up on correspondences, you can save yourself a lot of rush and stress., Rather than looking at everything you need to do at once, assign yourself one or two daily goals to achieve. Keep these goals small and attainable. You might find that you have a hard time motivating yourself go out and build a fence around your backyard if you can only think of how much time, effort and expense it will take. If you instead tell yourself that you only need to dig the holes for the posts one day, then plant them the next day, and so on, your responsibilities will no longer seem so daunting.Start with modest, specific daily minimums and build them up as you grow more confident. You’re much more likely to exceed your expectations if you resolve to spend ten minutes on the treadmill, rather than simply saying “I have to exercise today.”
With few exceptions, most goals will take time to accomplish. Break yourself of the habit of thinking you need to get everything done immediately or all at once. Plotting manageable short-term goals keeps you from biting off more than you can chew., Take frequent, short breaks and use them to take care of your physical needs and renew your motivation. A good guideline is to break for 12-15 minutes after every hour of work you do. Use that time to go to the bathroom, drink a glass of water, have a snack or rest your eyes. Don’t succumb to the temptation to send personal texts or see what’s on TV. The more you let your thoughts stray, the tougher it will be to return them to the task at hand.Most people can only maintain their focus for about an hour at a time or less. It can be counterproductive to force yourself to keep working beyond this point, as it becomes more likely that you’ll start making mistakes or miss important information.Go for a quick walk or do some light stretching during your breaks to keep your blood flowing. This can help you stay mentally sharp and ready to jump back into things.

, Aim to get a full night's sleep every evening. Exactly how much sleep you may need will vary, but most people require at least six hours a night to function at their best. When you’re rested, your ability to think and perform goes way up. Sleeping puts your mind at ease after obsessing over productivity all day, and gives you a much needed break from thinking about what all you have to do tomorrow.Turn off all electronic devices at least an hour before bed—these can keep you wired.If you’re extremely busy, supplement the amount of sleep you get with short naps throughout the day.

Use wait time efficiently.,
Work at a pace you can sustain.",How to Multitask," The old saying, ""If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there"" is just as true even if you are following multiple tasks.;
, In your honest assessment, is multitasking necessary? Is it going to help you get more done? Or is it only going to result in your doing multiple things slowly or badly?


If your manager or someone else is asking you to multitask and you feel it is counter-productive or unsafe, try explaining your concerns.

, Let it be known that you prefer to have time to yourself for an hour or two each day, and use that time for intense tasks that require your full concentration.

, Do not expect to have the full focus required to learn a new activity or perform a difficult or complex task.

, You can't schedule every interruption, or predict how many times the phone will ring in an afternoon, but you may be able to select your tasks and have in mind a general sequence of events to complete them but avoid needless repetition or redundancy.


Start longer or more involved tasks first. Fill in the gaps with shorter, well-defined, or self-contained tasks.
Think about whether there are resources to manage and distribute, other than your time and attention. If you are baking multiple dishes, each one will need time in the oven. Can you put them all in together, or must they go in some sequence?

, If you know there will be a big rush in the afternoon, start early to set up and prepare. If you've ever seen restaurant staff wrapping flatware in napkins at 3pm, you've seen a good example of working ahead in action.

, If you anticipate frequent interruptions, factor that in when you plan for how long you expect everything else to take.

, Jugglers may have many objects in the air, but they usually manipulate only one at a time.


In terms of tasks, alternating rapidly may mean figuring out ways to switch between tasks cleanly. Perhaps that means identifying or even building in times when a task does not need your direct attention (such as when laundry is in the washing machine or a casserole is in the oven). That may also mean setting a timer or alarm, or making a mental or written note to remind yourself to pay attention to a task again when the time comes.

, If you're multitasking to be more efficient, don't spend time doing extra things. The exception is a background activity to help pass the time if a primary task is dull, mechanical, or routine. For instance, if listening to the radio or an audio book helps with the tedium of painting a wall, go for it.

, Especially if they're routine tasks, try to perform them only in as much detail as they require. This doesn't mean you should turn out sub-standard work. Instead, look for inefficiencies and improve what you can.

, For instance, you may find that reading and listening to speech both use the same type of focus. Instead, try pairing a physical task, such as ironing clothes, with a mental task, such as listening to the radio.

, Especially if the multitasking consists of dealing with frequent interruptions (such as a ringing telephone), choose tasks that can be easily paused to do concurrently.


When you do pause, pause consciously and do what you need to, to remind yourself to resume.
When possible, pause at natural pause points. This may be the end of a page, or the beginning of a waiting cycle.

, That is, do the larger project as a priority, but do basic, filler tasks any time you find yourself waiting for information or inspiration on a larger project.

, Have something with you to do, especially in places you anticipate waiting (the airport, post office, or dentist's office). Reading is an easy, portable task. Carrying note cards or a notebook to jot ideas is also a good idea.

, Take breaks when you need them, especially to balance rushes. Multitasking may require intense focus, and may not be an activity you can sustain indefinitely.

Find reasons to stay active.,
Celebrate success and milestones.,
Don't beat yourself up.,
Encourage accountability.",How to Not Be Lazy1," A major reason for laziness is a lack of motivation. You can be discouraged by a daunting pile of tasks, or a feeling that the challenges of your day simply aren't worth motivating yourself for.Think of the big picture. It can be easy to get lost in the day-to-day tasks of life and not realize what you're working toward. Take some time out of each day to remind yourself how the task at hand is contributing to larger goals for your life. These can be financial, fitness, or education goals that will help your career and personal life. Make a list of reasons why you want to accomplish tasks before you.;
, You may feel less motivation to do something if it feels insignificant. Stay optimistic and when you complete a task, give yourself a pat on the back. This will also help keep you from being lazy because you are seeing the fruits of your labor.


Whether its exercise, school, or work, make sure you have objective, achievable goals along the way. Write them out and check them off when you accomplish them.

, Laziness can be a self-perpetuating cycle. It can be a type of self-loathing. When you are lazy and fail to complete a task, you can sink into a depression that makes you less likely to keep pushing.If you keep telling yourself that you are lazy, you'll always be lazy. From now on, stop that kind of internal conversation. Tell yourself repeatedly that you are a man of action. Visualize yourself as a hardworking person finishing all the necessary tasks at hand. Do this every day for 30 days until it becomes a habit.
Make time for relaxation. There is a tendency to always associate inactivity with laziness. This produces guilt and can perpetuate more laziness. Rather than beat yourself up, allow yourself time to relax with no guilt., Rather than go at everything alone, put yourself in a situation where peers and family can help motivate you. Group accountability is great motivator for staying fit, staying on task, and moving toward goals.

If you're trying to get in better shape, find a gym buddy or an exercise class. It will feel like you are letting others down if you skip and you are more likely to keep at it. If it is a school goal, find a friend in the class that can help you study and stay on track with achieving grades you want.

Focus on the goals of your different projects.,
Make a list of tasks.,
Organize your workspace.,
Mix your tasks appropriately.,
Know your abilities and the nature of a project.",How to Multitask More Effectively1," Before you get started, make sure to put a little thought into the goal of each project. Also spend time differentiating your projects and developing an organizational system that will help keep you focused.


Spend a few minutes thinking about each separate project, your goals, aims, and your approach to completing it before you start multitasking.
Create an organizational system in which you’ll keep all material for a specific project. Mixing up your different projects will make you a lot less effective.;
, You should create a list to make sure you’re organized and on task. If you have a list, you’ll be able to see exactly what you should be doing. Ultimately, without a list, you’ll be unable to multitask effectively.


First, check and see if it's imperative that you do all of these tasks personally, or if they can be delegated or outsourced to someone else. For example, could your spouse help you with a household chore? Or, could a coworker tackle part of the project you are working on?
Write down all of your tasks and rank them based on priority. Think about how many of these tasks you can reasonably get done today, and assign the remaining tasks to other days.
Tack your to-do list up somewhere you can see it.
Consider carrying a copy of your list around with you. You never know when you’ll have the opportunity to get some multitasking done., Another important way you can multitask effectively is by organizing your workspace. Without an organized workspace, you’ll spend more time searching for items and digging around in a mess than actually working. As a result, spend some time to make sure your workspace is tidy and organized.


Spend a little time at the beginning of your work day sorting files, folders, and other materials that may have gotten mixed up.
Use filing cabinets or a data storage system to organize projects on a long-term basis. Having all of your information neatly put away will help you to be more effective.
Don’t introduce non-work related material, information, or more to your work environment. It will create a mess and might distract you., Another way of improving your effectiveness at multitasking is to mix your tasks in a way that improves your productivity. By mixing different sorts of tasks, you’ll be able to give your brain a rest when you’ve burned yourself out on more demanding work.


If you’re working on a task that demands a lot of concentrating, mix it with a task that is relatively easy to complete with little attention. By doing this, you’ll be able to take a break from the more demanding task by working on the less demanding task.
Depending on your work style, consider working on projects that are relatively similar – in approach – at the same time. This is important since your brain might take more time switching to different types of work if you move between different types of projects a lot., Before even engaging in multitasking, you should spend a little time reflecting your projects and your abilities. This is important, as you or a specific task might be more suited to unitasking than multitasking.


Remember that multitasking is not always better than unitasking.
Carefully consider how you work best. Does it take you a lot of time to get focused on particular projects, or can you jump into new projects easily?
Think about the nature of projects before you start them. For instance, some projects -- like reassembling a transmission -- are more suited to unitasking. At the same time, projects like writing a number of articles or reports may be more suited to multitasking.
Before starting a task, consider if you will save more time and energy by focusing on it until completion or whether it is the type of project that you can start and stop without losing much efficiency."

Get clear on why it is a bad thing to multi-task.,
Start avoiding multi-tasking.,
Set up separate to-do lists for different contexts.,
Use a capture tool.,
Have a physical and e-mail inbox.,
Plan your day in blocks.,
First thing in the morning, work on your Most Important Task.,
When you are working on a task in a time block, turn off all other distractions.,
If you feel the urge to check your email or switch to another task, stop yourself.,
Every now and then, when you’ve completed the task at hand, process your notes and in-box.,
Take deep breaths, stretch, and take breaks now and then.",How to Avoid Multi Tasking,"


Multi-tasking is less efficient, due to the need to switch gears for each new task, and then switch back again.
Multi-tasking is more complicated, and thus more prone to stress and errors.
Multi-tasking can be crazy, and in this already chaotic world, we need to rein in the terror and find a little oasis of sanity and calm.;
, The remaining steps demonstrate how to stop multi-tasking and start approaching your tasks in a zen-like manner that will provide a much calmer work method.

, This means having to-do lists related to such things as calls, computer, errands, home, waiting-for, etc., depending on your situation.

, A capture tool, such as a notebook, can be used for instant notes on what needs to be done.

, Make sure to have as few in-boxes as possible, so that all incoming stuff is gathered together in one place. Basically, have one in-box for paper stuff, and one for digital.

, Have open blocks in between for urgent stuff that comes up. You might try one-hour blocks, or half-hour blocks, depending on what works for you. Or try this: 40 minute blocks, with 20 minutes in between them for miscellaneous tasks.

, Don’t do anything else until this is done. Give yourself a short break, and then start on your next Most Important Task. If you can get 2-3 of these done in the morning, the rest of the day is gravy.

, Shut off e-mail, and the internet if possible. Shut off your cell phone. Try not to answer your phone if possible. Focus on that one task, and try to get it done without worrying about other stuff.

, Breathe deeply. Re-focus yourself. Get back to the task at hand. If other things come in while you’re working, put them in the in-box, or take a note of them in your capture system. Get back to the task at hand.

, Add the tasks to your to-do lists and re-figure your schedule if necessary. Process your e-mail and other in-boxes at regular and pre-determined intervals.

, Enjoy life. Go outside, and appreciate nature. Keep yourself sane.

Chances are there are items lurking in the corners of your garage you don't even know are there. Categorize items based on what to keep, what to donate and what to throw away. Clearing out clutter is incredibly satisfying and odds are you won't really miss that broken toaster you've been meaning to fix for 5 years or that piece of fencing you took from your neighbor just because it was free.
, Projects have a tendency of getting messy and if you also store your project car in the garage they don’t waste time with marking their territory. Concrete is porous so cleaning oil spots, paint drips or other spills is difficult. Don't skimp here - invest in a good quality do-it-yourself garage floor coating system. It only takes 2-3 days to apply, its glossy finish reflects more light into the room and is a breeze to clean., Stationary shelving will have a hard time keeping pace with your growing collection of tools and supplies. On top of that, the items you need for your car project will always be vying for space with other home essentials like painting and caulking supplies, light bulbs, spare outlets and more. Upgrading to a wall-mounted, adjustable shelving system allows you to add on in the future and customize the configuration as your needs change., If you have open rafters in your garage, use it to your advantage. Lay down boards across the joists and stack items there you don't need to access much. Alternatively, you can hang ceiling storage units and even a bike lift to get seldom used, bulky items off the floor., If you need to allow room to park a car, use a pegboard system at the car level and then put cabinets or shelves high up along the walls starting above the peg board and car., Use the top drawers for supplies or hand tools you use less frequently. It may be difficult to see into the top drawers but it's a small inconvenience in comparison to the floor space you'll gain by going up instead of wide., Mobile work areas are a must in a small garage. Put wheels on as many stationary items as you can like floor cabinets, tool chests and work benches. Furniture dollies work great for rolling around big parts bins and even transmissions! Items on wheels can be moved away from the walls to create temporary work areas or even rolled outside for an afternoon and then easily rolled back into place when you're done., Even in a small garage, power is never where you need it. Run extra outlets on every wall near the tools or areas you'll be working most. You can never have too much power! As for the fancy stuff, air hose reels and drop-down work lights are a bonus to have, but in a typical one-car garage, a 25' air hose can reach every area and takes up no space at all. For working outside, running a copper air line to the garage door for a quick-connect comes in handy and eliminates the need for buying (and storing) a really long air hose., Despite your best organizational efforts, small parts have a tendency of accumulating all over your garage. You can never have enough storage for small parts but with a bit of strategy you can keep them from starting a revolution in your garage., Alternatively, baby food jars are great for storing small parts because they are clear, stackable and you can even attach their metal lids to the underside of a shelf and then have the jars hang for easy access - just twist on and twist off., Attachments or bits that are used less frequently often wander off from the parent power tool. Fishing tackle boxes are ideal for keeping your small power tools and their accessories and bits together and organized., Get a set of transparent leafs and organize sandpaper by different grits., Ponytail holders with the plastic balls at the end keep your wrapped cords and wires from turning into a spaghetti mess. They're easier to use and last longer than rubber bands or twist ties., Opt for smaller wall-mounted or in-ceiling speakers to stream Pandora or your favorite mp3’s from a pocket-sized player. To access the Internet, downsize to a tablet that you can Velcro to the wall or even hook up to a wall-mounted, flat-screen TV to browse the net."

Recognize that you're procrastinating.,
Schedule your day.,
Do fewer things well.,
Make it a habit to do anything simple as soon as you see it.",How to Not Be Lazy2," Sometimes part of procrastinating is filling our day up with so many side tasks that we have difficulty seeing what we are really doing. Look for useful indicators that your procrastinating that include:Sitting down to do something important and then deciding to get coffee or a snack.
Filling up your day with low priority tasks.
Re-reading memos or e-mails many times before deciding what to do with them.

, Many people are inclined to make to-do-lists. However, these can make your day seem daunting and without being tangibly incorporated into your day are little more than wishful aspirations. You need to consider how much time you have and how long each task will take in order to effectively get moving and avoid a day of laziness.Make sure you actually account for how long tasks will take you. This reduces the chance you will procrastinate because you are working along a tangible schedule. Also, realize that things may come up that alter your schedule. This is okay. All you need to do is add this to the schedule and adjust your day.
Set boundaries. People who are prone to procrastination should avoid blending life/work boundaries. Assuming you will end each work day at 5:30 P.M. forces you to be productive within a certain timespan.

, You may procrastinate when you feel like there are too many things to do and you shouldn't bother even starting. Most people believe that they are working harder than they actually are. This is because people feel so overwhelmed and fragmented by endless tasks. We live in a world of constant stimulation and information. Simplify your life and you'll be less likely to be overwhelmed into inactivity.Try media fasting for a week. Not all the information that we consume everyday from all kind of media is useful. Unless it's required for you to consume certain information for your work, stop everything else for a week. No TV, no newspaper, no social websites, no leisure Internet surfing, no watching videos on the Internet. You might want to create your own rule for this tip.

, For example, if you see a stack of papers need to be dumped, dump into the bin it straight away. It is not important but sooner or later you have to do it. Make it a habit to do it now and you'll stop having an endless list of tasks to do later.


This will be hard at first, but it will help you to build a good habit. The tendency to put things off until later can snowball procrastination and laziness.

Start your day right.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Start your day out on the move.",How to Not Be Lazy3," Don't hit the snooze on your alarm or go back to sleep but get right out of bed to start your day on the move. You are more likely to get and stay energized by starting your day out active.This can take practice to make it a habit. Try placing your alarm clock out of arm's reach.

, Exercise first thing in the morning. This will help your energy level remain high and take advantage of peak hormone times. Exercise is also proven to help concentration and focus for the rest of the day.Don't skip breakfast. Breakfast has physiological benefits, but also mental and mood improving effects. Eating a healthy breakfast will help your energy level stay up, your brain function peak, and even improves memory and concentration."

Eliminate unnecessary distractions.,
Make sure you have all of the equipment and supplies you might need.,
Build a comfortable work area that you can move around in.",How to Multitask More Effectively2," While the point of multitasking is doing a number of activities at one time, you should eliminate all distractions that are unnecessary. By eliminating distractions, you’ll help create an environment in which you can multitask better.


Turn off the radio or TV.
Let others know you are working and cannot be disturbed.
Shut off social media and close your email – unless these are part of your working/multitask mixture., In order to multitask effectively, you need to be prepared to perform all of the tasks you’re trying to complete. Without the appropriate equipment and supplies, you won’t be efficient and you won’t be effective.


Gather all of the hardware you’ll need. Depending on what you’re working on, you might need special hardware to improve your productivity. Consider a second monitor, a special keyboard, or even a second computer.
Make sure you have any paperwork or information you might need.
Have plenty of stationary, pens, pencils, and other office supplies.
Consider using a tablet or smartphone to help you multitask. They will allow you to multitask just about anywhere.Having water and snacks on hand may also help to keep you from abandoning your task if you become hungry or thirsty. Try to anticipate meals if you're going to be working a long time. Have them already figured out so you can prepare your food and then get right back to work after you eat.

, Without a comfortable and well-designed work area, you’ll have a difficult time multitasking effectively.


Consider incorporating informal elements – like a couch or beanbag chair – into your work space.
Make sure your chair is very comfortable and promotes good posture.
Position file cabinets and other organization aids close to your work space.
Make sure your chair can swivel and slide on the floor easily. Swiveling will help you work on multiple surfaces or view many screens without getting up. Sliding will help you move around in your work area."

Take breaks and don’t work too long.,
Work at a time in which you are most productive.,
Create a schedule.,
Time the addition of new projects.",How to Multitask More Effectively3," Studies have shown that people who work too long become less effective. As a result, working for the right amount of time and taking planned breaks is an important element of making sure you can multitask effectively.


Try working for 45 to 50 minutes at a time.
Take breaks of 10 to 15 minutes every hour.
If you can, break your work day up into several hour increments. Depending on how you work, it might be most effective for you to work in 3 or 4 hour shifts, take an extended break, and then get back to work for another 3 or 4 hour shift., If you have the ability to choose when you work, try to work at times you are most productive. This is important, as different people are more awake, alert, or productive at different times.


If you’re a morning person, make sure you block off that entire time of the day to work.
If you find you are not very effective in doing complicated or involved tasks in the morning, instead use that time to organize and do less-involved work.Consider keeping a journal for a week or two to track when you are able to focus easily and when you struggle to stay focused.

, You should also create a schedule so you can plan when you’ll work on certain tasks. Without a schedule, your multitasking with be chaotic and you may find it hard to focus. To prevent this, make sure to block out your time for specific tasks or groups of tasks.


Allocate blocks of time to specific tasks. Before you start on anything, make sure you know how long you expect a task to take. If copyediting an article will take an hour, have that planned before you begin.
Be sure to also allocate time for breaks as well. Recharging will be important before your next block of multitasking.
Plan out your multitasking time over the course of your work week. If you plan to multitask for two hours a day, make sure you reserve space in your schedule for that., Another thing to consider is whether you will complete a whole group of projects/tasks at one time or will you add new projects as you finish individual ones. This is important, as you'll have to carefully manage your schedule and organizational system.


Think about how many projects you can do at one time. Reflect on if there is a max number of projects you want to be working on at any given time. You may determine that 6 projects is the max number you want to work on over the course of a given period of time.
Determine if there is a deadline for any specific projects. If there is no deadline (or it is far off), you may benefit from stretching projects out over time and working on more at the same time.
If you think you'd rather finish a whole group of tasks before moving on to new projects, that's okay.
If you are the type of person who can add new projects to your in-progress list as you finish individual projects, then do so.

Keep yourself from looking at the clock.",How to Make the Day Go by Faster," Everyone loves to sleep in in the mornings from time to time. If for whatever reason you're trying to make a day disappear faster, you can shave off some time from it by hitting the snooze button and sleeping in a bit. Sleeping is by and far the most effective way of making time speed up. If you're already in bed and want the morning to disappear, sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all., A shower is one of the most physically pleasant stages of your day. Most people try to get in an out of the shower in record time, but if you have some time to kill, taking things more slowly can be great. Let the water rush over you; appreciate the warmth and temporary peace.

, Sitting down with a cup of coffee and enjoying yourself at the kitchen table sounds sort of like a cliche at a point where everyone seems to rush from place to place, but slowing down to enjoy yourself strangely makes time feel that much faster.

, There is probably a regular time you like to leave to go to work, school, or wherever else you typically need to be. If this is the case, consider leaving ten or fifteen minutes earlier than usual. Your brain tends to chunk memories into chapters, and leaving early will streamline that particular stage of your day. Unless you're leaving early, you may actually enjoy the extra time you have to prepare at the start of your day., Do something you've been putting off, whether it's an unfinished project or responding to emails. Your goals are already laid out for you, and you'll feel less stressed after you attend to them.


Being busy is your greatest potential ally when it comes to speeding up time. With that in mind, you should be doing everything you can to immerse yourself in the tasks at hand.
Work may not be fun per se, but keeping yourself focused will make the day go by faster.

, New projects are always on the go, and the slowest periods of work are perfect to latch onto something new. New projects can actually be a lot of fun at first to organize. Look around yourself at work; there's got to be something that could be done to improve your work environment.


Teaming up with someone can add a pleasant social aspect to the experience, if you're extroverted and enjoy interacting with co-workers.
If you can't start something on your own accord, ask your superior for something new to do. Being kept busy will make the hours fly past, and you'll also be thought of as a hard worker who shows initiative without being asked.

, Listening to music will keep you at least slightly entertained while you work, saving you from total boredom while you work.

, If work is painfully slow and you're having a really hard time making the time pass, going for frequent breaks will give you ample time to relax and let your perception of time regulate itself. Go have a coffee. Go to the bathroom and relieve yourself. While these activities are unproductive and relying on them too heavily will have the opposite effect you're looking for.


Frequent breaks make a distraction from work, but when it comes to passing time, the biggest benefit will be the relaxation it brings you. Of course, this won't have such a great effect if you're worried about falling behind in work.

, People willingly lose hours of their life checking up on the lives of others, and most of the time, they're not even trying to burn time. Social media is a great tool to speed up time while you're at work. You don't want to make an overly frequent habit of it however, as it may compromise your work situation.


As a rule, relying too heavily on distractions at work can make the day feel slower. Ultimately, the best way to get through work as seemingly fast as possible is to immerse yourself in tasks.

, Naps are good ways to kill some time if you're bored and could use the shuteye. If you really have nothing better to do, sleep will give your body some precious time to heal itself and patch up. Going to sleep in the middle of the day may be harder than at night or if you're already in bed in the morning, but it is the fastest way you can go about speeding up time if your body will allow you.


Not to mention, when you wake up, you may feel more motivated to be productive and let the day come to you as it will.

, Getting lost in leisurely activities is a brilliant way to speed up time, as we're never really considering how long we've been doing something when we're having a lot of fun. Reading one of your favourite books will take your mind off the passage of time, possibly even to the point where you'll wish there had been more hours in the day to fit in more reading.


The choice of book is very important in this case. A boring or poorly written book will actually have the opposite effect you're looking for.

, So-called 'binge watching' takes up an exorbitant amount of time, and shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad are all too eager to eat up whatever time you'll allot to them. If you have a spare day you want to see over quickly, put on a show and let yourself relax. If it's a show you really like, you'll probably lose track of how much time has really gone by.

, If you've got expertise in something, you may be a candidate to write a wikiHow article! Writing a step-by-step guide on a subject you're fascinated by can be a lot of fun, and like any writing project, you'll find the time slips away like nothing once you get into the thick of planning and realizing your article.If you're not the writing type, you could find a how-to article on any random subject that interests you and learn a new skill. Learning is a great way to pass time, as your mind will become too occupied to worry about what time it is.

, There's nothing like curling up to watch a movie at the end of an overly long day. Unless a movie is dreadfully boring or their bladders are tempting them elsewhere, people aren't usually thinking of the time while they're watching a movie. Instead, they're immersed in what's on the screen. Watching one of your favourite movies during or after dinner can be an incredibly rewarding experience.


Curling up somewhere comfortable like a bed or sofa is a must in this case. If your body's relaxed, you'll have an easier time letting the time slip you by.

, When you're learning something new, time seems to speed up. This is because the mind is too occupied with the fresh tasks to be as concerned with the passage of time. Your stomach will thank you for the new experience, and if you like the recipe enough, you can use it again on future occasions.


On the other hand, some studies have actually found that time speeds up when you're doing things that you're already very familiar with. This would include recipes. The bottom line is that you want to be engaging with something., Sleep is the best way to accelerate time. No one is keeping track of the passage of time when they're dozing away. Getting a head start on your sleep will give you a big boost for the coming day, which may be a good thing if your current day hasn't been great.

, People who are looking to make their days go by faster typically fall into one of two categories. The first group wants time to go by in anticipation of some upcoming event. The second are merely bored and cannot decide on how to effectively use their time. If you're trying to speed up the day due to a legitimate stressor, it is understandable and possibly worth doing. If you're bored, you're probably wanting time to speed up only because you're not engaged by anything at the moment.


If you end up finding something that interests you (possibly even from the suggestions in this article!) you'll probably stop caring about wanting the day to speed up.

, In contrast, if you're trying to do something you're very familiar with will have the opposite effect. Routine is your friend. Your mind will speed up time and run on autopilot if you're regaling yourself with the familiar.

, Speeding up your perception of time can only be approached indirectly.It ultimately doesn't matter whether you're doing something new or familiar, or even who you're doing it with; the passage of time ultimately depends on how busy you are. If you are occupied with something, no matter how trivial it may seem, you won't be thinking of the time.

, To combat this, just make sure you're relaxed and feeling relatively decent. This will make it easier to focus on activities as well.


This includes seeing to things like solving headaches or migraines. A migraine can make even an enjoyable experience feel like a test of endurance.

, Ultimately, the way you can speed up the impression of time in your head is to ignore the passage of time. Looking at a clock will remind you exactly how much time has passed, making you more aware of it generally. If you are dead set on speeding up your day as much as possible, you should make a point of avoiding any clocks. Don't even think about how much time has passed.

Prevent yourself from easily disabling apps like these.",How to Use Apps to Help You Stop Procrastinating1," People tend to do a lot of procrastinating online. If you've found yourself accidentally wasting significant amounts of time on your favorite websites, you're not the only one. The Freedom app can help prevent this by disabling specific websites from use on your device.The amount of time a website or group of websites is blocked it up to you. Use Freedom to schedule a productive work session by blocking all of the websites you visit for fun. The basic version of Freedom is free, and is compatible with Apple products, PCs, and Android phones.
A similar app called BlockSite is useful for Google Chrome users. Block websites for specified periods, with an automatic redirect to a site you should be visiting instead.
SelfControl is another app of this variety, which works on Apple products and will keep working even if you delete the app.;
, AppDetox is a free Android app that enables you to set up specific blockage rules for the apps you tend to use when procrastinating. For instance, set AppDetox up to only allow you to open certain other apps on your phone a limited number of times per day.You can also set specific time periods during which an app cannot be opened.
When you do try to open an app you shouldn’t, AppDetox gives you a friendly prompt to get back on track by saying something like “Facebook? Not now.”
The Android app FocusON is very similar, and requires you to answer for your procrastination by typing out scripted confessions when it catches you trying to open unproductive apps or websites., Another major culprit in leading to procrastination is checking your phone. You’ll likely be surprised by how much time you’re wasting by doing so. Checky can give you a rude awakening by tracking how many times you check your phone per day.Checky is free for iOS and Android phones.

, RescueTime is a simple app that lists the specific apps you use and websites you visit, and how much time you spend on each. You can categorize findings to see a broad snapshot of your habits. For instance, you may spend 87 minutes a day playing games, with 80 of those minutes being spent on Pokemon Go.Use this information to identify things you’re spending too much time on. You will likely be surprised by what Rescuetime reports, including habits that may be contributing to procrastination.
RescueTime is free, and can be used on your computer or your phone. It’s compatible with Mac, PC, and Android products.
Another similar, free app for Chrome is called Trackr. This app is designed to track only the amount of time you spend on websites, not other apps as well.

, Some apps can be disabled by entering a password. Take steps to prevent yourself from doing so. For instance, choose an extremely long password and write it down on paper instead of storing it on your computer. The hassle of entering 50 different numbers and letters will likely keep you from disabling these apps too readily."

Break your days into blocks.,
Give yourself time off.",How to Organize Your Schedule," Visit your local bookstore or go online to purchase a planner. You can purchase a paper planner that spans one or more years. Pick an attractive planner, so that looking at your schedule is a pleasure. Pick a small or flat planner that will fit in your bag, so you can carry it with you.


If you would rather not carry a planner with you, consider a desk planner that will sit comfortably on a table.
Make sure your planner has enough space in it for you to write down your daily activities.
If you have a variable schedule with lots of small parts, get a planner with large spaces per day.
If you have many ongoing projects with flexible deadlines, pick a planner with small spaces per day but plenty of extra blank page space per week, so you can keep a to-do list.
A to-do list that is part of your planner is useful to most people, so consider a planner with facing blank pages for every week.;
, If you coordinate your schedule with others, or if you do most things on your phone and computer, it might make more sense for you to pick an application, a website, or an extension of your email services to organize your schedule. You can look up free mobile and web applications that suit your needs. If you plan on sharing information from your online planner with friends, family, or colleagues, ask them what service they use and plan accordingly.

, Most computers come with a calendar application. You can coordinate this application with your email and other websites you use. Search your computer for ""calendar,"" or scroll through your applications folder.

, You can find printable templates online, or you can design your own planner by hand or on your computer. Purchase a case for your planner, such as a three ring binder or a book cover. If you are printing templates and putting them in a binder, use a hole punch on your templates and put them in your binder.


If you are binding your own book, try taking the pages out of an old hardcover book. Lay the cover flat and measure it.
Find paper that is slightly smaller than the length and width of your flat cover, or cut paper to size.
Fold each individual page in half to make two pages of your book.
Using a ruler and pen, colored pencil, marker, or paintbrush, draw lines on each page according to the organizer design you prefer. Look at templates online for ideas.
Stack your pages. Make sure they fit in your cover. You may need to create three distinct stacks for your book to lie flat.
With your pages now in order, put in dates. Don't forget holidays!
Bind your book. Take an awl or large needle. Punch one or two holes in the cover in the same place. Use a sturdy thread to sew together.

, Avoid keeping a long list of tasks that keeps getting longer. Instead, integrate your to-do list into your daily schedule. When you learn of a new task, break it into parts and write each part down under the date that you will do it. Make sure you note its deadline, in case you don't get to it on time.You might want to keep a schedule of daily tasks and a to-do list of running projects, but consider keeping a weekly to-do and a monthly to-do instead of one long list.
Keeping a list of unscheduled tasks leads will cause you to burn out on your projects before you even do them.

, Start your day by tackling the most important item on your agenda. Schedule the first order of business to be the one thing you absolutely must accomplish that day. That way, if you are interrupted later, you will have at least done the most important thing. Anything that is due or is especially important is a good candidate for a first task., Schedule every part of each task, including emails you have to send, planning you have to do, and items you need to get. Otherwise you might waste time sitting down to accomplish something only to realize you are missing essential ingredients., Before you start each task, spend a few minutes thinking about what you want your end result to be. This will help you be more directed and focused. Write your goals for each day or each task down in your planner, or simply sit and think. If you are working with someone, state your goals aloud., Devote each block to one task. Multitasking is less efficient as a rule. Focus on one project, even if that project has diverse parts, during each block., Scheduling time off sounds counterintuitive, but it will help. Do not plan on overworking yourself. Working through exhaustion and bodily needs should only happen in emergencies. Schedule short breaks every 45 minutes to an hour, as this is as long as most people can focus.


Take time away from your desk or computer.
Schedule time with loved ones, time to prepare meals, and time to be alone.
If you are prone to anxiety, try scheduling ""worry time."" That way, if you find yourself spinning into worry while you are trying to work, you can put it aside for later.Schedule downtime and leave your distractions to that time. Instead of constantly checking your phone, your email, and social media, do it during scheduled blocks.

Avoid the rush.,
Use GPS to optimize your commute.,
Switch up your route.,
Get through traffic jams faster with the right lane-switching strategy.",How to Make Time Spent Commuting by Car Efficient1," The best way to speed up your commute is to shift your work schedule so that you can avoid peak traffic hours. For instance, if the commute is worst at 7-9am and 4-6pm, you could leave around 6am and come home at 3pm, or leave at 9am and come home after 6pm to miss rush hour., The map function on your phone can suggest alternate routes and show you approximate driving times, taking into account traffic volume and accidents. Checking your route each morning and evening before you set out will allow you to find ways around the worst traffic., Continue changing up your path to work until you hit upon the one that gets you there fastest at the time you commute. Even if the route you choose that day is slower, experiencing new scenery can make your drive more enjoyable., We’ve all been there: you change into a faster moving lane only for it to immediately grind to a halt. Or you stay in your lane and watch car after car pass you in the next lane over. So what should you do? Luckily, scientists have taken away some of the guess work by modeling ideal lane changing strategy.Don’t just stay in your lane. Not only you, but the jam overall will move more quickly if drivers change lanes.
Wait to merge as long as possible. If a road sign warns of lanes merging ahead, don’t get over right away. You’ll speed your commute and actually reduce overall congestion if you wait until the actual merge point to get over.
If the car before you is stopped and there is a space open in the adjacent lane, change lanes. This strategy is optimal for reducing your time in the jam.
Don’t do “fast” lane changes. If a car in the lane next to you is accelerating so that you can squeeze into the gap behind it, you may be tempted to do so. Don’t. Modeling shows that ""fast"" lane changes will actually increase your time in the traffic jam.

Avoid aiming for popularity.,
Manage your school work in a folder.,
Set reminders for yourself.,
Set aside specific time for work and studying.,
Use your time wisely in class.,
Stay calm.,
Keep clear of distractions.,
Keep healthy.,
Turn in completed work as soon as possible.",How to Stop Procrastinating Over School Assignments," Being ""cool"" with your friends by skipping classes or hanging out at the mall when you could be at home doing school work is not worth it. In exchange for pulling average grades, aiming for popularity won't help you in the long run. Remember that popularity is seemingly nonexistent once you graduate high school, while an education is important in almost every field of work.
, To keep track of things that are assigned to you by your teacher(s), try organizing them all in a school work folder. It's important to figure out an organization system that works for you. For example, you might organize it with sections for new assignments, in-progress projects, and completed work, or organize it by subject.

Make it colorful so it catches your eye and you'll be less likely to forget it.
If you use a backpack, don't keep it in there when you get home. Try sticking it out of your bag so it reminds you of your homework/assignments.
If you use something else (like a locker) don't keep it in there. Take it home so your papers aren't sitting at school overnight.

, It doesn't matter if you prefer to use technology like your iPhone or simply a sticky note on your bedroom desk, but reminders are key.

Have multiple reminders set up so you don't forget. You could have both a mixture of cell phone reminders and sticky notes posted in places you'll see them.

, Life gets busy, particularly if you participate in a lot of after-school activities as well as your classes. In order to make sure you devote enough time to studying and working on assignments, write them into your schedule. Don't just assume you'll find free time at the end of the day to tackle your work; make time for it., Not all assignments are all ""homework"", but if you don't use your in-class time well, even in-class assignments can accidentally become homework. Don't put off for later what you can do now, instead. Use your time well, particularly if you have unstructured class time to collaborate with classmates or work on group projects. Don't slack off but get it done now, rather than later., Procrastination can occur when you have too many things going on at once. You might use procrastination to avoid certain responsibilities. Try staying calm about your school work by keeping on top of in-class tasks and keeping an open channel of communication between you and your school teachers.

Learning how to meditate can help you focus and stay relaxed when you have stressful school work to do.

Take deep breaths. Breathing slows down the heart rate and re-calibrates racing thoughts to be much more calm.
Don't think of school work as a pile of stress; think of it as a learning opportunity.

, Try setting up your study area to exclude all forms of social media where a notification could vie for your attention.

If you're like most people, you might find yourself checking your phone pretty often. Try putting your phone away in another room or up on a distant shelf or in a drawer.
Switch your ringer to silent when studying to avoid its tempting ""pings"" and ""dings"".
Pets can also be a distraction. Try keeping your furry friends out of the room; you'll see them later.
Keep your focus on what's most important, your learning.

, Studies prove that healthy eating and regular exercise can improve one's managing of stress.Keep your health habits in sight as you navigate your high-school journey.

Try saying positive things to yourself throughout the day like ""I'm capable"" or ""I am an achiever"".
Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.
Eat a healthy breakfast.
Go to bed at a reasonable time.

, It might not be that you're procrastinating from doing your work; you might be forgetting to turn it in. Hand in work when you've done it or store it in your school work folder under ""completed"".

If work is online, turn it in immediately after you proof-read it.
Have your homework folder by your side when doing assignments so you don't forget to turn it in the next time you have that class.
Put your folder in your backpack before bed so you will be ready to turn it it the next day (or whenever you have to).

Prepare a list of to-do activities.,
Write down the tasks to finish, as they occur to you.,
Prioritize the tasks and label them with 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C (high, medium, low priority):


Tasks to be completed within a day or two would be high priority tasks.,
Once you have completed all the above steps, all you need to do now is get to work and start checking off items when you finish.

,
Any task that you do not finish on that day get carried forward to the next day and so on.",How to Use Time Management in the Workplace1," This applies to you and anyone else you may work with. Even your boss.;
, Get a sheet of paper and sit down somewhere quiet. Take a deep breath and think about everything that needs to be done.

, First of all, draw a table with three columns- tasks, due date and priority. Make the column for the tasks the biggest.

, Include the respective due date.

, More time should be assigned to these tasks and they should be dealt with first.
Tasks to be finished within a 7- 10 days would be of medium priority.
Tasks that have two or more weeks to finish would be low priority.

Indeed, many great novelists, including Dostoevsky, Dumas, Dickens, and Tolstoy dictated their works, so you’ll be in good company. Most smart phones come with a built in voice-to-text function, but for more accurate transcriptions, consider these apps:Google Keyboard – Android; free; speech recognition so it learns with every use; can be used without a network with the right voice data packages.

Dragon Dictation – Android / iPhone; free; requires a network.

Evernote – Android; free; records both voice and transcription; requires a network.

Voice Assistant – iPhone; $2.99; speech recognition so it learns with every use; autocorrect for grammar and spelling; requires a network.

, Whether you are working on ideas for your job, hatching your own business plan, or outlining a novel, your car commute offers you a great opportunity to talk your way through ideas. You can purchase a voice recorder or use your smart phone. Better yet, use a speech-to-text program like Dragon, so you won’t have to transcribe your recording later.

, You don’t need your hands to talk. Try scheduling your commute so that you can make business calls that don’t require you to consult your computer or texts. Be sure to use hands-free equipment. It is the law in 19 of the 50 states of the U.S., and it is always a safer option.

Try RescueTime.,
Explore other time-management apps.",How to Stop Procrastinating on the Internet1," This software is compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, providing three options that will either cut you off completely from the Internet or filter distracting websites while allowing you to continue to browse. You can download it from their website and install it following its instructions. To use this software, you can set a time limit. This limit can be as short as one minute and as long as 24 hours, depending on how long you want to be disconnected.


This software also allows you to disconnect your computer completely from the Internet. That means you can't use email or browse social media. You can also choose a blacklist of specific websites, so you can still use the Internet to find more important stuff.
This app also allows you to write down a work goal or time limit, which you can customize.;
, This app is compatible with Windows and Macs, locking you away from the Internet by blocking all internet activity on your computer. You can download it from the website and install following its instructions.


Mac Freedom gives one option to block all Internet access on your computer for a particular amount of time. To use the application, you pick an amount of time you want to be locked out of the internet for, from 15 minutes up to eight hours.
You also have the option to choose local or normal mode. Click local mode if you still require access to your local network. Then, click okay.
Freedom also has a scheduler so you can block time for a week in advanced when you want the Internet to be blocked., This app is compatible with Windows and Macs, allowing you to disconnect from distracting websites, set goals, and send an alarm when you have spent too much time on a distracting website.


This app allows you to become aware of your own bad habits by changing your computer use and reducing inefficiencies. If you ever wondered where all that time went, RescueTime will tell you that you have just spent two hours on Facebook, or YouTube, or other offenders.
Set goals that you want to achieve for the day. You can view in a report generated later whether you achieved them.

Turn off your Wi-Fi port.,
Separate yourself physically from your computer and phone.,
Work in public.,
Get rid of the Internet at your house.,
Cancel your social networking.",How to Stop Procrastinating on the Internet2," If you don't want to use software or an app, do it yourself. Shut off your Internet access for a while. Switch off the Wi-Fi port on your computer, so your Internet access will be cut off until you turn it back on. If you plug in directly, unplug your computer so you won't have access to the Internet. Plug it back in when you need it for something important.

, If you need to study and you don't need the Internet, don't use your computer or mobile device at all. It's so easy to flip over to Facebook or check your e-mail and end up wasting 15 minutes, or even longer, when you didn't even intend to.


To reduce the possibility that you'll be able to make a procrastination mistake, put your phone in a drawer, or turn it off.
Keep your computer in your bag, or switched off. If you need the Internet, switch it on only for what you need to do, then switch it back off.
Better yet, make a note of what you need to look up and look it up later.

, For some people, working in public is an excellent way of avoiding procrastination. In some places, public Wi-Fi is hard to come by. This means you might be able to find a spot and work without the ability to even use the Internet. Likewise, sometimes the Wi-Fi is too slow to do much but work. Find a place you can't YouTube.


For some people, it's important to look busy in public. The thought of being caught shopping online or watching a goofy video can be embarrassing. If that sounds like you, try posting up in a public place like a coffee shop or library to work. Keep yourself honest.

, If you find the lure of the Internet too tempting, you might find it worthwhile to cancel your service entirely. Go to the library to work online when you need to. Find other ways to entertain yourself in your free time.


Wi-Fi access is widely available nowadays. It's easier than ever to avoid the Internet at your own house. Pop out for a quick cup of coffee if you want to check your e-mail and mess around online.
Instead of streaming video, get DVDs and other media at the library. It's free and widely available. Take advantage of it.

, Another big step that won't be appropriate for everyone is canceling Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts that prove too time-consuming and all-encompassing. If you think social media is keeping you from doing your work, give yourself a break. See if you can do without it.


By design, most social media is pretty easy to re-start. Give it a week and see how you like it, and whether or not staying off Facebook makes you more productive. You can always go back if need be.

Write up a to-do list.,
Set hard deadlines for yourself.,
Allow yourself short breaks more regularly.,
Only open one window at a time.,
Do one thing at a time.,
Try study music.,
Reward yourself.,
Try the WOOP method of focusing.",How to Stop Procrastinating on the Internet3," If ""Writing a term paper"" sounds like it's going to take forever, that's because it will. But coming up with five possible topics? Writing out a single thesis statement? Coming up with some possible main ideas? That sounds a lot more doable. If you tend to procrastinate, try making shorter to-do lists that will make your job easier.


Break up larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks to make your work sound a lot easier, even though you're doing the same thing. Break it up by how difficult the tasks are, or how much time you think you'll need to spend on each.

Prioritize the most important things first, or the most timely tasks. You've got to come up with a topic before you start doing research. So come up with your topics and try for a thesis statement before you start poking around online doing research.

, Some recent studies show that we often procrastinate because we use up all the time we have allotted to complete something.In other words, if you've got three months to write a paper, most people will take three months to write that paper, even if that means writing it all in the last five hours before it is due.


Give yourself a specific page count, word count, or other deadline for the next hour or two. If you're working on the Internet, make yourself finish before your app kicks it and turns it off for an hour.
You can use Freedom or Stop Procrastinating to set productivity goals for yourself, as well as managing your deadlines on your own.

, Productivity studies regularly reveal that taking short breaks every hour or so helps long-term productivity more than taking a single long break. Don't work for longer than an hour at a time. If you want, take five minutes to cue up a short YouTube video or mess around on Facebook. Take a break no longer than 5-7 minutes, each hour.


Supposedly, working 52 minutes is the ideal amount of time for you to work before taking a break.Give yourself a break to rest your mind and be at your best.
Schedule breaks to help remind yourself. Set a phone alarm, or use your web blocker setting to go off every 52 minutes to give yourself some time. When the net cuts back out, get back to work., Tab browsing and high speed Internet can quickly become overwhelming. If your browser window involves shopping, researching, writing, chatting, and designing a .gif at the same time, then narrow your focus. Make it your goal to only have one window and one tab open at a time. Finish what you're doing before you open something else.


Tab browsing can cut into your attention span and the length of time you stay on an individual page.If you need to be researching on the Internet, slow down and look through your resources more thoroughly instead of tabbing out.

, Don't try to carry on a conversation with your friend in a G-Chat while you're also trying to write an e-mail. Don't try to read up on the topic for your history paper while you're live-tweeting the Academy Awards. Do one thing at a time when you're on the Internet, and the quality of what you're doing will be higher., Some studies show that instrumental music can improve productivity, specifically on repetitive tasks.That means that it might not be great for writing, or doing other Internet-related activities, but if you're doing something repetitive online, it can be a great booster to your attention span and ability to work.


Keep the volume low and the mood relatively subdued. Listening to really fast-paced math rock probably isn't the best way to work.

, Support yourself as you work. Give yourself little rewards for periods of productivity. Use rewards that will keep you productive, instead of making you procrastinate. For example, instead of pulling up a YouTube video, get outside and go for a quick walk. Instead of goofing on Facebook, make a cup of green tea, which has brain-boosting properties that will help you stay focused., WOOP stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan. Set a goal, visualising the obstacles, then chart the way ahead. Research suggests that this method is very effective in working past potential obstacles. Help yourself deal with procrastination. Plan some time before you start a task that'll be online. Plot out the potential for you to procrastinate and make mistakes. Visualize doing the task properly and correctly. See yourself not pulling up that Podcast and wasting time. Do it the right way.
There's also a customizable WOOP app that can be downloaded onto your smartphone to help you make the anti-procrastination plans."

Identify your high priority tasks and projects.,
Block out time for specific tasks.,
Use a visual tool to block time.,
Schedule breaks.,
Limit activities that interfere with your time blocking goals.,
Find quiet work spots.",How to Time Block," Time blocking is especially effective for tasks requiring greater concentration. Determine which tasks need to be completed first and prioritize them by order of deadline and importance. For example, if a report is due in a week and you have an important meeting tomorrow, prioritize your meeting preparation ahead of conducting research for your report.;
, Break tasks down into chunks that can be completed in smaller time increments. For example, if you are designing a flier, allot a separate block of time for completing each page.


Set a goal to finish the task within the time allotted. Decide on start and finish times for the particular task and adhere to the schedule.
Block time by yourself to complete tasks that require greater thought and concentration. Scheduling time alone will help you focus on challenging tasks.

, Your visual aide may be a calendar, a piece of paper or an Excel spreadsheet. Mark the blocks of time to show clear start and stop times.


Draw blocks of time on a piece of paper. Write a short description of each task in each time block. Draw a line through the task once completed.
Use an online or mobile device calendar. Type in each task and utilize the repeat feature for recurring tasks. Choose an alert option to notify you of start and stop times, if the feature is available.
Code blocks of time on an Excel spreadsheet. Create a grid with start and end times. Fill in higher priority tasks with darker colors. Create a color key to denote the priority levels of tasks.

, Regular breaks are conducive to greater productivity and concentration. When time blocking, schedule regular breaks in between activities. For example, focus intensely for 2 hours on a specific task, take a 10- or 15-minute break and work for another 2-hour block of time.

,


Eliminate unproductive, time-consuming activities. During the block of time allotted to working, avoid unnecessary forum browsing, television watching or Internet surfing. Devote your full attention to the high priority task at hand.
Avoid checking email, answering the phone or texting. Focus your attention only on the task that you blocked off the time to complete. Let your calls go to voice mail, turn off your phone and sign out of your email account.
Notify others that you will be unavailable. If working at home, explain your time blocking strategy to family members so that they will refrain from interrupting you. In an office setting, limit interruptions from co-workers by suggesting that they join you in time blocking activities.

, A coffee shop, a library or a quiet corner of your office building are possible places to spend uninterrupted blocks of time focused on specific tasks.

Use a monthly schedule.,
Plan with your household.,
Set your priorities.,
Monitor potential problems.,
Allow some time for your family and friends.,
Use a weekly schedule.,
Keep a slot free.,
Plan your shopping.,
Divide the house work equally.,
Cook during the weekend.,
Use a daily schedule.,
Focus on your task.,
Leave time for breaks.,
Sleep at least seven hours per night.",How to Organize Your Time," A monthly sheet is used to monitor important deadlines. Visualizing the whole month at once will help you realize how much time you have left for a task. Think about what's essential. Do I have a deadline? Is there an important appointment with the doctor? Is my child due for vaccination?


You don’t need a complex organizer to do this. A simple calendar in the kitchen should be enough.;
, It is important to take into account your family or household when making monthly plans. Cross-compare your schedules and take note of activities for which you might be needed. Do the children need you at the football match? Does your partner require you to drive her at the hospital?


Use a color code on your calendar. Assigning one color per family member is an excellent way to visualize quickly who needs to do what during the month.
Try to put yourself in other's shoes. We all have stressful lives but having empathetic family members is such a plus!
Your monthly plan should be accessible to the household. Don’t expect others to always remember your deadlines.

, It is far easier to plan when your priorities are set straight. Some tasks are urgent, others are not. It might not be as important to go to the football match as changing the tires of the car. Consider some of the following questions when planning with your household:


Is this task essential? Can I push it back to next month?
Do I have enough time to fulfill this task?
Do I require help to do this? If yes, have I already asked for assistance?

, A train strike or a simple road work can derail your plans. Keep your monthly schedule updated and try to think about alternatives if you foresee a problem.


Read the local press. It's an excellent source of information.
Always check online for opening hours and train times. We all waste hours going to a closed shop or museum and we have all missed a train based on outdated information.

, Being efficient is all about balance. You need to think about yourself and avoid a burnout. Think of it as a long-term strategy. If you are unwell or depressed for weeks, you will not be able to work at your best and make the most of your time.If you are in relationship, think about your partner. Seeing each other regularly is important and healthy. If you want to be pragmatic, think that a break-up or a divorce might consume a lot of time and energy!

, A weekly sheet has a different role to play than a monthly schedule. it is more specific and will allow you to decide in advance how to balance your days.Start to fill the weekly schedule with your essential activities, such as work, appointments, emergencies, etc. and work your way toward non-essential tasks and hobbies.
Always aim for a good balance.

, Life is full of emergencies and last-minute tasks to do. If you keep a free hour or two in your busy week, you will be able to face any urgent and unexpected surprise. If no emergency turns up, take the opportunity to use this free slot to relax or fulfill another urgent task.


If there is a last-minute emergency that neither you or your partner can take care of, ask a friend. They probably won't mind helping you and it will make your friendship deeper. Of course, they might also need you another time!

, Most people waste a lot of time doing their weekly shopping during the wrong part of the day. Beat the queues by going on a Saturday at nine in the morning or order online if available in your region.


If you have room for storage, buy a lot at the same time. Having cans of tomatoes, tuna, beans, rice, pasta, etc. will allow you to cook a healthy meal if you didn't have time to shop., Giving weekly tasks, like cleaning the kitchen, to each member of the family is an excellent way to make sure that the work division is fair and timed. It’s also harder to find an excuse not to do it if it has been agreed in advance.


Be rational. If you come later from work, let your partner cook. You'll put the children to bed.
Think about preferences. Your partner doesn't like cooking but you do? Your husband hates filling the dishwasher? Listen to them and try to accommodate everybody. If nobody likes a task, alternate each week.

, Cooking every day can be difficult or rushed. Plan, cook and freeze at least a few meals during the weekend. It will make your life much easier when you come home from work.


It is also far more healthy to cook and freeze your own food rather than buying ready-meals., Using a daily sheet to monitor your activities is the best way to visualise quickly if you are going to spend too much time on a task. It’s important to be both honest and realistic about the time needed to fulfill an activity when writing a schedule.


If you have a smartphone, you can use the integrated organizer. It’s an easy way to remember your next task or enter a new one on the go.
Alternatively, a to-do list is better to visualize what's really important but it is less effective at managing your time.

, Many people waste a least an hour at work. It is far more effective to focus entirely on what you have planned to do than being distracted. Turn off your phone and avoid social media at work. These are the biggest distractions.
Make it a habit of answering your personal emails and texts at determined times. You will become a better texter and a better worker.

, It’s important to stop once in a while. Your brain needs to rest, if only for a few minutes, to refocus. Research demonstrates that even a distraction is likely to improve your work dramatically.Going to the toilets or having a cup of tea will already help considerably. If possible, go outside for a five minutes walk.

, Sleep deprivation can lead to several psychological and physical problems.It's not always about doing more, it's also about doing better!

Make time where you can.,
Accept not doing things perfectly.,
Schedule in your free time.,
Learn what you're making time for.,
Change up your routine.,
Put down the electronics.",How to Make Time for Yourself1," It can seem like everything is important, especially when it comes to work and tasks around the house. Delegate some of your responsibility, or cut out what isn't absolutely necessary to your day to clear your schedule.Ask for help from your family. This can be asking a child to do chores or your spouse to run to the grocery store. Delegating tasks like this can free up twenty minutes to spend on yourself.
Find jobs to outsource. This may hurt your budget a little, but find a service to mow your lawn or a cleaning service to help around the house.
Learn to say no. Don't keep taking on endless tasks. Understand that you have a limit and learn to say no to things without feeling guilty.
If you're bogged down at work, find help. This can be someone under you at work, a co-worker, or even asking a boss to help lessen your load.;
, Often people are bogged down the need to get every task just right. This can mean you stay after work, answer work e-mails on the weekend, or simply can't go to sleep until all of the dishes are done. Accept that you can't get everything done. At a certain point every night, put everything down and focus on doing something you want.Realize that most things can wait and you'll have another opportunity to do tasks. Also, taking time away from important tasks can actually improve your performance.

, We are so good at scheduling in tasks for everyone else, it's important to do this for yourself. Put in a slot each day, or at least a few times a week, that are as solid as a work or family commitment. Block off an hour in the evening that you can't break unless its an emergency.This doesn't need to be time alone, just time spent doing things you enjoy. This can be watching a movie with a friend, or even going out to dinner. Making time for yourself can come in many forms.

, Finding specific activities that you're looking forward to. This will not only give you a more clear picture of what you want to do, but a concrete goal of why you're making time for yourself to start with.Find things you enjoy but don't typically do. This can be read a book, exercise, or even watch T.V. Find things that you truly enjoy and you are more likely to take time from your schedule to really do them.

, It may not always be possible to squeeze in time during the day for yourself but you can make a point to make time before or after work. Instead of getting up at 6:30 to rush off for work, get up a half hour earlier. Spend this time doing something you like before your day starts. You might be a little more tired throughout the day, but this is a great way to jumpstart the work day!Do this even if it's for a short time. Spending 5-10 minutes charging up for the day can be a great exercise to keep at.

, It's easy to be sucked into a social media app or television show for hours. You may enjoy these activities but they can also consume all of your free time, many times without even seeming like it. For an hour each day, put down your phone, computer, and even your T.V. Get the most of your time by experiencing it radically present, not mindlessly wrapped up in an app.Spend some time being alone. Get your spouse to go out with their friends. You could also tell them to stay home with you, since there are no kids running around. If you're a teen, just shut your door or go to the bathroom and lock the door.

Let go of perfectionism.",How to Use Your Time Productively," One of the very first things you’ll want to do each morning is to spend 30 minutes planning out your day. Commit to not starting your day until you have planned it out., Nothing is more important in improving productivity than creating a plan for how you will utilize your time each day. Planning helps reduce stress, build confidence and improve your ability to plan for the unexpected. A day planner is an excellent tool to assist you in increasing productivity by strategically determining how much time to spend on various activities. effectively managing your time each day.


Choose a planner that best meets your needs and preferences. You might prefer to use an online daily planner or download a daily planner app. You can also purchase a paper based daily planner that you can physically carry around with you in your purse or pocket.

, In any given day, you’ll already have a certain number of hours that are automatically committed to various tasks and activities, such as sleeping and driving to and from work and school. This is your obligatory time. Using your day planner, write down all of times and places of where you need to be. The time remaining will be your discretionary time, or ‘real time” that you can actually manage and control., There are so many things that you have in your mind that you would like to accomplish. Instead of trying to remember it all, take time to write them all down in a to-do list. You can write a simple bulleted list of all the activities, conversations, meetings and errands that you would like to complete.

, Now that you’ve completed a to-do list, you need to prioritize each item on the list. Prioritizing is crucial in ensuring that you are tending to the most import and urgent matter first. An example would be setting priorities during tests and examination times. No point in spending hours cleaning up the apartment when the same time can be used to prepare yourself adequately for the tests, interview etc.


To create your priority list, go back to your to-do list. Next to each item, put an “A” next to things that must be done today, a “B” for things that should be done, and “C” beside things that could be done. You would then focus your attention on completing everything that must be done and completing as many of things that should be done. The ""could be done"" items are simply optional.
It might be helpful to create some high priority items based on your short-term goals. Many of your short-term goals will most likely be your top main objectives at the moment.

, You haven’t truly committed to completing high priority activities until you’ve committed to a specific time to get it done. You need to allocate time to any activity that you’ve determined must be completed in your day., Social media can be a major distraction in achieving a productive day. As a result, make sure you establish clear time restrictions for accessing social media websites. Consider using a timer to assist you in honoring the time limits you have set for social media interaction. In addition, limit the number of social media accounts that you have to further reduce excessive use of social media., Cell phone usage is also a major distraction in maintaining a focused and productive day. The various audible alerts and notifications can pull you away from completing the important tasks and priorities of the day. Eliminate this distraction by simply muting your cell phone when you need to be working productively.

, It might seem like juggling multiple tasks makes your more productive, but it actually causes many people to feel overwhelmed and burned out. In addition, your productivity is reduced because you are never being fully engaged in completing any one activity.Focus on completing one thing at a time to improve your chances of successfully completing each individual task.


Try and set a specific amount of time to work on each separate tasks. You can reduce the temptation to work on other things by removing from your workspace any material and items not related to the task at hand.

, Sometimes it’s hard to honor the time commitments you’ve made to complete various priorities. There are probably a lot more things you would rather do with your time than fulfilling obligations. However, honor completing your high priority items by setting strict time limits and sticking to them.


Set an alarm or alert to help you keep track of time. You can also simply write the times down and post it where easily visible.

, An important part of maximizing your daily productivity is monitoring and evaluating your effectiveness. Throughout your day, actively take time to think about the objectives you’ve set for the day. Consider writing a short list to remind yourself of your goals and your progress in completing them.You might need to consider changing a goal if you find that you’re continually veering away from the goal. Allowing for flexibility in goal setting is necessary in achieving optimal success.There are a number of questions that you can ask yourself to assist you in monitoring and evaluating your progress. Ask yourself: What am I doing well? What can I improve? What is hindering my success?

, It’s important to give yourself a pat on the back as you successfully complete items on your to list. This will help keep you motivated. As you complete task throughout your day, take time to sit back and feel proud of all the check marks you have added to your ever decreasing to do list.

, Your brain needs time to process and rejuvenate after engaging in tasks that require your energy, focus and attention. Avoid working on important tasks for longer than two hours at a time without taking a break. You can keep the breaks short, even as short as five minutes. Reward yourself during breaks. Grab a quick snack during your short five-minute break, and do something enjoyable during your longer break. You’ve earned it.


Incorporate a couple of recreational hours into your weekly schedule to celebrate the completion of a productive week. Spend those hours doing something you really enjoy like going to the movies, hanging out with your friends during happy hour, or treating yourself to a good meal.

, Delegation is oftentimes an underutilized strategy in using time productively. When you delegate task to others, it allows you to focus your energy on where it is most required and is most useful. For example, you can have your children do the prep work for dinner, such as washing and cutting up vegetables, and that will allow you to finish your cooking sooner once you get home.

, Emulation is the sincerest form of flattery. Look at the lifestyles and mannerisms of successful role models. Adopt and try to learn from their successful behaviors.


Try and schedule a time to sit down with a role model to discuss how they’ve been successful in prioritizing and achieving their goals on a regular basis.

, While it’s important to take pride in your work, it’s important to recognize that you don’t have to complete everything perfectly. In fact, attempting to complete everything in your day to perfection may actually lead to procrastination; you might procrastinate as a way of not facing the fear you have of not completing the task perfectly.One way to manage your fear of not completing a task perfectly is to assess the risk of the task. Ask yourself, “What will I gain or lose if I spend more time completing this task perfectly?” If you determine that the gain isn’t worth the extra time and effort, then move on to your next action item.

Get exercising.,
Start doing things you've put off.,
Find time for friends and family.,
Find time to be alone.",How to Make Time for Yourself2," This is a great way to relieve stress and get healthy at the same time. Physical exercise is important for both your mental and physical health. When you do this regularly it will become part of a routine and something that you consistently make time for.If you hate the gym or jogging, get outside to be active. This is a great way to disconnect from the stresses of home and work to immerse yourself in nature.

, Don't get on facebook, but decorate pictures. Do something that you kept promising yourself or others that you would do. This can be a craft project, or reorganizing your kitchen. Make sure it's something that you look forward to and will enjoy because you'll be more likely to keep making time for it.Do one of your hobbies you have trouble finding time for. Draw, sew, knit, make jewelry, just do something that you like to do.

, Part of finding time for yourself is reminding yourself that your job is not everything. This does not necessarily mean you have to spend your time alone. In order to be a successful person you must prioritize your relationships with friends and family as well as your work. They can also help keep you accountable.

Stay off the Internet.,
Keep your email inbox closed.,
Do all of your work on one device.,
Write out a schedule.,
Go slower.,
Stick to the task at hand.,
Give yourself a stop time.",How to Stop Wasting Time1," With the Internet rarely more than a click or tap away, it’s no wonder that we constantly battle the urge to check our various bookmarked sites. When you know you need to stop wasting time and work on something, avoiding the Internet is an easy way to avoid procrastinating.If your willpower alone can’t keep you off the Internet—or worse if the work you need to get done involves using the Internet anyway—you can install site-blocking tools for various browsers. Simply turn on the application when you need to keep focused and let the program be your willpower for you.;
, A survey of Microsoft employees showed that they spend an average of ten minutes responding to an email, and then a subsequent fifteen minutes refocusing on the tasks at hand.If you really need to focus on a specific task, set an auto reply on your email and refrain from checking it until you’ve finished the work.


The same basic principle works for text messages, instant messages, push notifications, mobile alerts, etc.These distractions help us procrastinate because they often feel more productive than other time wasters, but they rarely are. Turn off your phone completely when you can if the separation anxiety from the connection won’t serve as its own distraction.

, Switching between a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, your phone to check an email, and a tablet to pull up a presentation is a recipe for disaster. Each time you move between devices, you likely succumb to a distraction or two, and then have to refocus yourself. As often as possible, try to collect everything you’ll need on one device during a prep period before you get started, so you can work from one device as you go., Most people hate the idea of keeping a complete calendar, but not all scheduling has to be this complete. When you set out to complete a specific task, take five minutes to make a list, outline, or applicable timetable for the task.By giving yourself a manageable timeframe, you’re also more likely to hold yourself to the work at hand.Using “time boxing,” or fixed time segments for specific tasks also breaks them down into more manageable pieces, making the wide open workday feel easier to engage with.This practice can work with everything from homework assignments to office jobs to home repairs.

, Sounds utterly counterproductive to time management, but trying to work too quickly or multitask on anything more than menial tasks can end up wasting time. Studies have shown that only 2% of people can multitask in truly effective, time saving ways.Going slower also gives you the opportunity to ensure that you complete each task fully and clearly, making it less likely that you have to go back and clarify or fix mistakes, which can end up taking more time., It’s no secret that many college students have sparkling apartments in the week before finals. We often procrastinate by taking on other important (albeit non-time sensitive) tasks instead of the most important task we need to complete. Spending time on less important activities is still a step backward and a time waster when you have other deadlines or due dates looming.Recognize when the task you’re working on isn’t the one that should be at the top of your list.

, Working without a stop time in mind is a sure way to burn yourself out and get frustrated. Whether your stop time is the end of the workday, when you have a dinner scheduled, or something entirely different, having a finish time in mind will help stop you from overworking yourself, which will only lead to a decline in the quality of the work regardless.Even if you’re in crunch mode with a term paper due the next day, schedule breaks that give you enough time to collect before getting back to it.

Remember that the saying goes ""Honesty is the Best Policy"".,
Preparation is the key.,
Allow yourself to breathe.,
Hand it over.,
Become a leader.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Work smart, not hard.",How to Successfully Complete Projects," You have to be honest all the time in dealing with your customers. Tell them if their project is not feasible or if you don’t acquire all of the resource, cash and time involved to carry it successfully from the start. Set their anticipations by saying to them what you will carry and by when. And if it eventuates that you can’t render on your promises, then state to them about it directly. By having an “open book” policy, you’ll have your client's confidence. And if you involve them early enough, they will be a lot supportive to your cause.;
, You don't expect a successful presentation when you gone over it only twice. You have to prepare very well and make proper research.

, Always try to sit back and relax even when on a tight schedule. This will do you some good.

, Managers oftentimes fall into the trap of believing that they can manage things much efficiently than staff. Of course in a lot of cases they may be right, but the problem is that they don’t have the time to perform everything themselves. So a bright manager always tries to delegate as much as possible to staff. It presents them the time needed to supervise the project and support their team. It’s a delicate task, but even if you recognize you can do a job more expeditiously than others, delegate it anyway.

, When you economize time by delegating your jobs, you have more time for leading and motivating your group. Make this by regularly communicating the project to your team, honoring them for progress and accrediting their accomplishments. Have their respect by showing them you care. Build Up team liveliness by bringing them to lunch on a daily basis and uttering about what they accomplished unitedly. Remember, there is no “i” in “team”.

, Always expect matters to change and be ready for it when it comes. People have ideas, your client may require changes, and the industry and technology change over time as well. It’s not the change that’s significant, it’s how you react to the transformation that weighs. Always handle change, but be suspicious of it. Question it, double-question it and only when you’re positive it’s for the greatest, apply it.

, Attempt not to begin from scratch. Give yourself a head-start wheresoever feasible by using tools like project management guides. These templates encourage the quality of your delivery, while keeping you time and effort.

Create a form to manage your time for the day.,
Stop what you’re doing at the top of each hour.,
Consider how you spent the hour.,
Ask yourself if you’d repeat the hour.,
Summarize the hour and write down your evaluation in the righthand column.,
Acknowledge the parts of your day over which you have control.",How to Stop Wasting Time2," Now that you have a collection of steps to help you stay focused from Method 1, the repeat test is a great way to test how effectively you use them. Start by creating a spreadsheet or even simply drawing a form on a piece of paper or a whiteboard. Make one column with the hours in your day listed, and then make a wider column leaving space to the right of each hour., This test requires you to take a minute or two at the top of each hour to evaluate how you used the preceding hour.Set a timer if you need to ensure that you stop long enough to fill in the form.

, During your evaluation period, consider what you completed over the previous hour. This can be anything from an exercise routine to studying for a test to spending the hour in front of the television. Be honest with yourself regarding how you spent the hour.

, This is the step from which the test draws its name. Once you’ve taken stock of the hour, simply ask yourself if you’d repeat it.The question essentially seeks to make you ask yourself if you believe you spent the hour in a productive manner. You’re less likely to repeat the hour if the answer is no.

, Keeping a written record of the day to see how many hours you would repeat and how many you wouldn’t is also an effective motivational tool. Write a few words about what you did with the hour in the righthand column and as well as your repeatability evaluation., One of the drawbacks to the repeat test is that you can quickly fall into the habit of judging every hour by its overall utility. A class where the instructor doesn’t cover new material, an unproductive work meeting, and other parts of your day can start feeling like frustrating time wasters in themselves.Try to remember that you don’t have complete control over every hour of your day sometimes and that meeting an obligation—such as being present for the unproductive meeting—can still count as a necessary portion of your day.

Check the corners of your room for piles.
Check your desk and any chairs for piles.
Check the floor for piles.
Check the tops of cupboards, wardrobes, shelving, etc., for piles.
Check that closet. It's a hiding spot for random piles.

, Sort them into non-random piles to begin with, placing like with like. Put the clothes together, the stationery together, the books together, and so forth. Once you have these piles, it'll be easier to discard items, then put the rest back where they should be., As you restore the items to their proper places, such as drawers, hangers, boxes, pencil holders, and so forth, be sure to discard the items that you no longer want or that are just rubbish. Donate items that are still in good condition, so that someone else may benefit from them., If you don't have standard places to return some of the items to, this is likely to be the cause behind the random piles. If this is the case, make new storage areas for the items that don't yet have a standard home in the room. You can purchase baskets, boxes, file holders, and similar items, to hold your items neatly. It can also be helpful to use containers that have labels, making it easy for you to find things quickly.

Put the items without a place into the new storage items. Place the storage item somewhere neat in the room.

, This will take a conscious effort on your behalf but it's worth it to save you from having a big cleaning-out exercise every now and then. Also, it's much easier to find your things when you know where to look."

An in basket can be used to collect small items and clutter as well as paper, so plan accordingly and choose a basket that is deep enough to hold everything. Baskets can be made of wicker or natural materials, fabric, leather or paper. Look around your home first to see if you have something you can use. A cheap, shallow in basket can be made from a box lid, covered with gift wrap or other decorative paper.;
, Put items into the basket. They don't need to be processed or worked on at this point, just throw them in the basket. However, if you know some items are trash they can be thrown away to save time later.

, Depending on how much stuff you have to process, this could be daily, weekly or biweekly. Be sure to allow enough time to process everything. The goal of the in basket is to move things out of it, not use it for permanent storage.

, Your goals are to not touch papers too often and not spend a lot of time going through the basket. If it can be processed quickly, do so. If items in the basket are part of a larger project or something that is going to take some time, schedule a time to work on them.

, You may need to create files or a household binder to hold papers that need to be kept permanently or will not be used in the short term.

, It should be near a recycling bin so that trash can quickly be moved out.

, Show children and other family members the basket and tell them what its purpose is. Show them how to put mail, school papers, and other clutter in the basket. Go through the steps until it becomes routine.

, If items in the in basket require work from others, make sure it gets done and doesn't just get lost in another pile of clutter.

Don’t get too comfortable.,

Repay your sleep debt afterwards.",How to Stay Awake at Least 24 Hours Straight," If you are staying awake longer than normal, you’ll have to resist the temptation to sleep. Stay out of bed, don’t wear pajamas, and avoid anything else that is part of your sleep routine.Keep the temperature warm enough or cool enough that you are slightly uncomfortable, and more likely to stay awake.;
, Your body’s basic sleep cycle is tied to light during the day and dark at night. This means that dim lights can make you sleepy, especially if you are staying up beyond your usual bed time. Bright lights, however, can increase alertness.Keep lamps and other sources of light on when you are trying to stay awake.

, Talking, studying, listening to music, and taking breaks with others can be stimulating and help the time pass by.

, An alarm clock can be a good back-up when you are trying to stay awake, especially if you have to do it alone. Try setting an alarm (or several) for regular intervals, such as every half-hour. That way, if you accidentally fall asleep, it won’t be for very long.

, If you are staying awake while getting work or chores done, try switching tasks every now and then.The change will provide some mental stimulation, especially if you move locations (from room to room, or from indoors to outdoors, for instance).

, Certain foods, like protein-rich snacks and vegetables, can be great choices when you are trying to stay awake.Stay away from sugary snacks and candies, however. While these may give you a brief burst of energy, they can be followed by a “crash” that will make you tired. Better choices include proteins and complex carbohydrates that are digested slowly, giving you a steady energy release.Good choices include:


Peanut butter on crackers or celery
Yogurt
Nuts
Fresh fruit
Celery and carrot sticks
Whole grains

, If you are dehydrated, it can make you feel fatigued.Make sure to drink plenty of water before and during times when you know you will have to stay awake.

, Drinks that contain caffeine (such as coffee, tea, and some sodas) can give you energy and alertness in the short run, so when you are feeling tired, these can be good options to get re-energized.However, caffeine’s effects may last only a few hours, and leave you feeling even more tired afterwards.


A safe amount of caffeine for adults is 400 mg per day (about four cups of brewed coffee); for children and adolescents, 100 mg per day (about one cup of brewed coffee). When trying to stay awake, have no more than this so that you don't become jittery and suffer from a severe ""crash.""
Wait until you really need it to have some caffeine, and avoid it during the day beforehand.This will help to maximize its effects and minimize the “crash.”
Green tea may be a better option than coffee, as it has less caffeine, and is high in antioxidants that are good for your overall health., Alcohol is a depressant and will make you sleepy.It can also impair your ability to make judgements. When you're trying to stay awake, just avoid all alcohol so that you will remain as alert as possible.

, When you know that you will need to stay awake for a long period, try some vigorous physical activity ahead of the time when you think you will start to feel tired.


You can also try brief exercises while staying awake.A few jumping jacks or pushups every now and then, for instance, can help reinvigorate you.

, A short walk increases your oxygen intake to your brain and muscles, giving you energy and helping you stay awake.The effects of walking can last for several hours, so try taking a 10 minute walk every two hours when you want to stay awake.


You can reap these benefits whether you walk indoors or outdoors.

, Getting plenty of oxygen contributes to physical energy and mental alertness. If you are trying to stay awake, periodically try one of these breathing exercises for a boost:Sit up straight. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly raise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise ten times.
Quickly inhale and exhale through your nose (about three breaths a second), keeping your mouth closed. Then breathe normally. Repeat this process for fifteen seconds or more.

, If you know you will need to stay awake for a long period, make sure to get plenty of rest beforehand.The best plan is to sleep very well the night before, but even a short nap before having to stay awake can help.

, If you are staying up so that you can work at a computer or other in another situation where you concentrate on something for long periods, make sure to give your eyes a break.Every twenty minutes or so, set aside a minute to look away from the screen to rest your eyes. This helps you retain your focus and resist fatigue.

, A brief nap can actually increase your energy and alertness when you are trying to stay awake. However, you should only nap for 5-25 minutes, and you should not take more than one nap a day.Make sure to set an alarm clock—or several—so that you will wake up from your nap.
You may also feel groggy when you first wake up from your nap, so give yourself some time to get back to normal.
If you can’t fall asleep, even closing your eyes and resting for 10 minutes can reinvigorate you.

, Even if you plan well ahead of time, staying awake for 24 hours or more will leave you feeling very fatigued. However, some research shows that you can make up for a lack of sleep by sleeping more afterwards.The day or night after you stay awake for a long period, give yourself the opportunity to sleep longer than usual.Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep a night."

Most people don't have anything to do on Sunday nights, unless you have other activities. If so, maybe Saturday night will work. You need to get to know your routinely schedule, or else things will get complicated.;
, The goals should be S.M.A.R.T. Each letter stands for a word, as stated below:


Specific: Say exactly what you need to get done. Be precise! For example, imagine that your goal was to get fit. You could plan to exercise everyday for a limited amount of time. However, rather than saying ""Exercise,"" you should jog
Measurable. You should have a certain way to measure your aim. For example, jogging can be improved by jogging for twenty minutes or so.
Achievable. You need to set goals that you can do. Do not cram too much in at once. For example, do not jog for one hour if you are not fit enough. Instead, jog for fifteen minutes and increase your time as the days go on.
Realistic. Be realistic with your goals, this is not fantasy. Do not jog for twenty minutes on four days, even if it is likely that bad weather will stop this from happening. Instead, say ""Weather permitting, jog for twenty minutes on four days.""
Time-Based. Finally, add a time for your aim to be completed by. For example, 'Weather permitting, jog for twenty minutes on four days,' could be further improved by adding 'this week' to the end.

, Each day, do all of your goals, starting with the most important, then working to the less important goals. Keep an actual to-do list if it will help you track all your goals; you can even maintain multiple lists, like a short-term one for daily tasks and assignments, and a long-term list for goals that you want to accomplish throughout the semester or year.

, Being organized starts with knowing where things should go - this comes in handy during clean-up and helps you maintain order along the way, so that big clean-ups actually become less necessary.

,


Pick at least 10 items off the floor each day (If there are that many to pick up).
Aim to remove the biggest problems in the room first.

, This is the time when you will put everything left on the floor back to its place. A thorough room cleaning is a must every now and then, even if you work to keep things clean on a regular basis.

, Don't just think you can do it later.

, Stay on top of your studies, and try hard to succeed.

, It only adds to the pyramid of stress with school, friends, and alone time.

, If necessary, make lists of what you'll need for given classes and activities so you can make sure you don't forget anything.

, If you are absent for just 5% of days, you lose 9 days of school time. This is approximately 45 hours of learning lost (presuming you have 5 hours of lessons each school day, not including break times).

, If teachers are unsure which grade to give you, they will often check how often you are late to school. Therefore, being late, even if only late by a few seconds, will result in lower grades.

, Use a calendar. Carry a personal planner around so you can mark down any important notifications. Keep track of academic, extracurricular, and social/family obligations so that you can be sure you don't miss anything important.

, Sticking to the same general approach to self care each morning can help you stay organized.


Take a shower every day or at least every second day. It makes you smell fresh.
Make sure to take care of other daily needs, like brushing your teeth, keeping your hair clean and tidy, and wearing clean clothes. While not everyone is focused on beauty, staying generally neat and clean makes for a good first impression throughout your life.

, While it may be easier to rely on your parents to keep your clothes clean most of the time, it's even better to learn early on how to take care of these chores. That way, if you need a particular outfit clean at a certain time when the regular family laundry hasn't been done, you can take care of it yourself, and maintain your neat and clean appearance.

Don't procrastinate or put things on hold.,
Begin early by breaking tasks into small pieces.,
Give yourself a schedule.,
Do not overwhelm yourself.,
Make goals for yourself.,
Get outdoors every day.,
Know what you stand for.,
Accept your identity—don't fight it.,
Believe in yourself.",How to Stay on Top of Yourself," Once you start delaying things is when your life starts getting backed up. You'll then have way too much to do all at once and it may not all be finished on time either. Then you'll just start to stress yourself out because then you'll start to feel like you're slowing down while life is only moving forward, leaving you for dust. Everything will just start to overwhelm you to a point to where you almost can't even take it anymore.;
, If you need to read a 400-page book for class, it can feel overwhelming, and you may want to stop. Force yourself to start. Promise yourself that you'll read one chapter every day. When the task becomes less monumental, it is easier to begin.

, Procrastination is easier when you have a large chunk of time and aren't sure how to spend it. Break your time into pieces, so you are never overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do. If you successfully follow the schedule, give yourself a reward—a favorite activity, calling a loved one, a special meal, or whatever motivates you.

, It's nice to be well rounded and to do some extra curricular activities or socialize after work but only do what you know you can handle. Do not pack work on top of work onto yourself, just because it ""looks nice"". Sure, with success comes hard work but it is never okay when you're hurting yourself. Find a balance.


Give yourself time to work on hobbies, be with friends, or do therapeutic activities.
Remember that performance should never come at the expense of physical or emotional health. Perfection is not a realistic goal.

, It is always good to keep making goals for yourselves because it gives yourself something new to work towards and keeps yourself going in life. With new goals comes new decisions and actions being taken which will be a stepping stone to the next step in life. Just make sure you think wisely before you decide on doing anything and know that it is what's best for yourself. Sometimes our goals change, and that's okay. We all change. Everyday matter of fact. You just have to adjust and adapt.

, Sunlight and exercise are known to boost mood. Sometimes, when you feel overwhelmed, your body needs a quick break. Taking a five- or ten-minute walk will refresh you, improving your mood and ability to focus.

, You should always keep your morals and beliefs close to you. Even if some people disagree or think you're weird for them, stand by them! They're what YOU believe in, don't let anyone make you feel bad for any of it. That's one way to go wrong. Let your morals and beliefs be known. If you feel like something around you is morally wrong, say something. Don't be ashamed. Your morals and beliefs are a part of you, it's like being ashamed of yourself. That's never good.

, There are some things we cannot change about ourselves: race, past, sexual orientation, disability, et cetera. Don't feel the need to assimilate or hide who you are. Your identity is fundamentally okay.

, The last, yet most important part, believing in yourself. As long as you believe in yourself that will be your drive to keep going regardless of the standards. You'll know you have the power to keep going without the need of encouragement from others. Believing in yourself is one of the most powerful things you could do for yourself. It brings on determination, optimism, and other characteristics that will only help lead you to success. So be your own cheerleader in life when you need it. Learn how to work hard; without the need of an applause.

Make a to-do list of things you need to do around the house.,
Prioritize your goals.,
Start with household chores.,
Take care of outside chores.,
Gather supplies for bigger tasks.,
Recruit friends and family to help out.,
Hire a contractor if you need professional help.,
Finish one project before starting another.",How to Spend the Weekend Doing Something Productive1," If you want to get to work on your house or yard, start out by writing down all the chores and projects you’ve been meaning to do. These can be small things, like taking out the trash or dusting the bookcases, or big projects, like painting the kitchen or cleaning out the garage.


Remember that you’re not trying to do all of the listed items in one weekend. You’re starting out by just listing all the things you eventually want to get done around the house. Afterwards, you can break up the items into manageable chunks and place them in order.
Be as specific as possible. For example, don’t just write “Clean the house”. Instead, write “Wash the kitchen and living room floors”, “Clean the toilet and sink”, and “Pull weeds in the back yard”.;
, Once you’ve got a master list of chores and projects you’d like to do, arrange them in descending order from most to least important. You’ll do the top one or two projects this weekend, and then tackle the other ones on following weekends.


Take environmental and other factors into consideration when prioritizing. For example, if you have yard work on your list and it’s already late autumn, you should get these tasks done before temperatures fall too low or the first snow falls.
Don’t forget budgetary considerations as well. For example, you might be longing to resurface your driveway or refinish your basement, but not in a place financially to take care of these large-scale projects. Keep these items on your list, but know that you’re tabling them until you’ve saved enough money.

, Attending to menial cleaning and maintenance tasks might not seem as rewarding or productive as tackling your bigger renovation projects. In fact, though, having a visibly tidied home environment can make you feel more organized, capable, and energized to keep cleaning or take on bigger, upcoming projects.Starting with the easiest chores, such as taking out the trash, doing the dishes, and changing lightbulbs around the house, means that you can cross off several items from your list in short order. This quick payoff can help keep you motivated and build momentum.

, After cleaning up inside your home, get started on outdoor chores, such as cleaning the gutters, washing the car, or sweeping the driveway. These tasks can be more labour-intensive than indoor ones, though, so only do one or two per day in order to avoid exhaustion.


If you live in an apartment, your outdoor to-do list will probably be minimal. Double-check to make sure there aren’t little things you can do to help out, such as vacuuming the foyer or picking up litter from the courtyard, but don’t get distracted or procrastinate by doing unnecessary tasks.

, Once you’ve taken care of all the chores on your list, think about what you’ll need to begin your larger home improvement tasks. If you’re planning to paint, put up curtains, or put in new carpet, for example, you’ll need to visit a home improvement store and purchase things like paint, tarp, tape, rollers, nails, curtain rods, and caulk.


Don’t underestimate the time required for these kinds of preparatory errands. In order to allot yourself plenty of time and avoid falling behind on your to-do list, you might want to schedule supply-gathering errands and projects on different days.

, You may be able to do big home improvement projects on your own, but most people could use a little help. And, even if you’re capable of going solo, having friends and family come over to assist can be a good way to socialize and have fun while being productive at the same time.


Make sure that you have all the necessary supplies for you and your helpers. For example, if you’ve invited friends over to do some painting, make sure you have enough painting smocks, brushes, and rollers for everyone.
Proper etiquette recommends that you purchase lunch and beverages for your helpers in order to show gratitude for their time and energy. You can order pizza, make sandwiches, or take them out to your favorite neighborhood joint. Also be sure to have plenty of cold water, sports drinks, or lemonade on hand for when your friendly helpers work up a thirst., If you're considering a major project involving lots of construction or complex work, consider working with a contractor to reach your goals. A professional will not only have experience doing the kind of renovation you're attempting, as well as useful contacts for purchasing the required materials and finding additional resources or workers when necessary.


Just be sure to do your research first by consulting consumer review sites, interviewing different candidates, and asking for references from friends and family., You might get bored with painting after awhile and want to start on your kitchen cabinets, but try to focus on one task before switching to another. Studies have shown that you work more efficiently when you work on one task continuously rather than jumping between multiple tasks."
"
Prioritize to focus on the most important tasks.,
Delegate tasks to other employees.,
Batch similar tasks together.,
Have a consistent leaving time.,
Avoid unproductive meetings and conversations.",How to Save Time1," Accomplishing the big items on the top of your to-do list at the start of the day can keep you from scurrying to finish them later. You’ll feel a sense of accomplishment, and you won’t have the weight of the big project looming as you handle smaller tasks later in the day, allowing you to work more effectively and save even more time.


The most important tasks are not always the same as the most pressing tasks. If a routine document is due on your boss’s desk by noon, it may not be worth having it done by 11:00 if it means providing worse service to a client. Learn to differentiate between what’s urgent and what’s important.;
, In order to properly delegate you need to understand your strengths and those of your coworkers. Some people are great with numbers, others can write well, by identifying who has the specialized skills to complete a task you can save time and improve the quality of the work being done.


Be authoritative, but not demanding when delegating tasks. Make the person you’re asking for help feel like an expert and praise their knowledge in the area.Remember, if you delegate tasks, you should be willing to take on a task from someone else’s workload from time to time as well.

, Most people’s work day consists of ongoing small tasks that end up spread throughout the larger projects of the day. By grouping these together and handling them in bunches you can save a lot of time and do the work more efficiently.


Instead of responding to emails every twenty minutes, set aside two larger chunks of time and handle all your emails in those periods. You’ll be more focused on your work without worrying about them
Make all your phone calls in one go and get paperwork done in one sitting.

, Almost everyone arrives at work at the same time each day, but when people get busy they often stay late at the office to keep working. By the time they get home the day is almost over. Make a point of leaving work at a normal, not too late time. When staying late isn’t an option you’ll make the most of your productivity in the time you’re at work.Make it known throughout the office that you won’t be sticking around past a certain time by dropping subtle hints. Tell people about plans for the evening or warn them to get materials to you earlier because you need to be out on time.

, Sometimes people at work just aren’t as efficient as you’d like them to be. Don’t let their problems become your problems. Be firm, and inform long-winded coworkers that you need to get back to work once they’ve made their point.


Learn to say no. If you’re invited to a meeting and you don’t anticipate it’ll be beneficial, say you’re too busy, or you have other priorities that interfere with attendance.
Suggest “dropping in” on a meeting to only catch the parts that apply to you or that you need to present. Your coworkers may not enjoy hearing “no” but they’ll respect your work ethic.
If you must attend, set a fixed time for the meeting, maybe 20 minutes. Or, have the meeting in your office, where you’ll have a position of authority to call it quits when it needs to end."

If you are, then you should contact your lawyer. They will know what you need to do if you haven’t completed your community service before the deadline.
Generally, you can be arrested for failing to complete community service. You then will have to attend another hearing.;
, You should have a solid reason for not completing your community service on time. For example, you might have entered a drug treatment program to dry out. Find documentation explaining where you have been.

, In some courts, you get at least one automatic extension for completing your community service.However, each court is different, and you won’t know what you should do unless you call the court or the District Attorney’s Office.


You can find the court clerk’s number by looking in your phone book or searching online.
Some District Attorneys have a Community Service Program Office.You can find the phone number by looking on the DA’s website.
Explain your situation and ask what the process is for rescheduling.

, You might have been assigned a probation officer. You should have this person’s name and contact information. Call the officer up and ask what you should do about rescheduling your community service.

, Look through your papers to see if you can find the phone number for the community service organization. If you can’t find anything, then do a quick Internet search. Type in the name of the community service organization and its location.

, As soon as you know that you can’t make your scheduled shift, you should call the organization and try to reschedule. Generally, you should try to give at least 24 hours’ notice., Community service organizations might have strict requirements about not canceling. In this situation, you should explain as best as you can why you missed your scheduled community service.


The organization might terminate your community service for failure to show up on the scheduled date.In this situation, you should contact the court to see how you can get another placement.

, You generally need to make a request for an extension before the deadline for completing your community service has passed.For this reason, you shouldn’t delay if you see the deadline fast approaching.

, If you have completed some but not all of your required community service, then you should get a progress report from the community service organization.This document should state how many hours you have currently completed.

, Some courts might have forms that you can fill out in order to request the extension.You can check with the court clerk or with the Community Service Office at the District Attorney’s Office.


There might not be a form. Instead, you may need to draft a motion and submit it to the court. Ask the court clerk.
Also check if there is a case manager you can call. In some courts, you can get an extension from a case manager instead of filing with the court., Each form is different. However, you generally need to provide the same information, which can help the judge decide whether or not to grant an extension. For example, you will probably be asked for the following:your name
your case number
the name of the judge assigned to your case
how many hours of community service the judge ordered
how many hours you have already completed
your reason for requesting an extension
how much longer you need to complete your community service
your signature

, Look in the form to find the address you should submit it to. If you don’t see an address, then go to the court clerk and ask where to file. Always keep a copy for your records.

, The judge probably can order you to pay a fine for failing to complete community service in time.The judge might also penalize you by increasing the amount of community service you must complete.

Sort through your mail.,
Discard any junk mail.,
Prioritize and pay your bills.,
Add social and official notifications to your to-do list.,
Update your planner.,
Organize your desk.",How to Spend the Weekend Doing Something Productive2," Many people don’t have time to go through all their mail during the week, resulting in a rapidly growing stack of envelopes and cards waiting for your attention. Not only can this looming pile of paperwork make you feel anxious, but it can make you miss bills, government notices, and social invitations. You can start tackling this monster of a mail pile by sifting through the articles and organizing them.


Divide your mail into separate stacks: one for bills, one for promotional offers and junk mail, one for social correspondence, and one for official notifications.

, Often, the bulk of the mail dominating your desktop comes from companies hawking their products, sales, and services. While some of this mail—for example, coupons or catalogs—can be useful, you’ll probably want to chuck most of it. Just be sure to open each piece of mail to make sure it’s something you don’t need.


When you're sure you don't need a piece of mail, shred or rip up any paper that has your name, address, or other personal information printed on it. This preventative measure is fairly easy and can help you avoid the serious consequences of identity theft in the future.If you’re getting tons of credit card offers from the same company, take a look at the small print at the bottom of the offer. Many times there will be information listed as to how to opt out of further unsolicited mail in the future.Be sure to recycle any paper or cardboard rather than throwing it in the bin with the rest of your garbage.

, Bills aren’t the most fun part of adult life, but unfortunately it’s necessary to stay on top of them if you want to maintain or build good credit. After setting aside all your bills, go through them carefully and add them to your budget. Write down the amount owed, the deadline to pay, as well as any other pertinent information about the payment.


If you pay most of your bills online anyway, consider going paperless. Log into your online account where you usually make online payments and find a menu option or box that allows you to opt out of hard copies of bills and other notices in the future. You'll be reducing paper consumption for the environment as well as diminishing clutter in your personal home., Though it can seem like one does almost all official and social business online these days, there are still many important notices which are sent via snail mail. For example, governmental bulletins such as vehicle maintenance checks, parking sticker renewals, voting reminders and registration, and tax bills and information are all likely to show up in your mailbox rather than your inbox. Open these up and add them to your to-do list to make sure you don’t miss any important deadlines or registrations.


Many formal personal announcements, such as wedding invitations and graduation announcements, also come by mail, so make sure you don’t miss out on any fun just because you didn’t open your mail in time!

, Once you’ve gotten your mail under control, scan through your daily calendar. Add any items or notifications received in the mail, such as weddings, local elections, tax deadlines, or charity events, and make a note of any bills you’ve paid or other correspondence you’ve taken care of.


Keep your planner game on point by making entries as detailed as possible. For example, don’t just write, “Interview with Jacobs Company 10:00” under the appropriate date. Write down where exactly the interview is, how to get there, what person you should ask for, what to bring with you, and any other pertinent information you’ve been provided.
If your paper planner is packed and you're having trouble keeping up, consider using a digital calendar such as Google Calendar or Outlook. Not only do these electronic options present information and scheduled appointments in a clearer fashion, but they allow you to share events with other parties, add attachments, and sync your calendar with your email., Depending on what kind of a person you are, your desk might be a perfectly organized and spotless space, or a pit of despair where important and unimportant papers alike go to die. If you belong to the former group, desktop organization can seem like a mighty and daunting task. Actually, though, sorting through your unattended mail and documents was probably the hardest part. Now you just need to get rid of unnecessary clutter, file away important but non-pressing documents, and stack relevant forms and work in tidy, accessible areas.


If your desk doesn’t have much drawer space or you’ve already used up all available real estate, order a file organizer online or buy one from a local office supply store. These useful contraptions not only give you a place to store your files, but also allow you to divide them up into different categories and slots.

Write down all the things you usually do after work.,
Take care of any non-grocery shopping.,
Deposit checks and withdraw cash for the week.,
Plan out your meals.,
Buy all ingredients for your week’s meals.",How to Spend the Weekend Doing Something Productive3," From grocery shopping to picking up dry cleaning to getting the car washed, chances are that you run a lot of errands during the work week. Make a list of all these customary after-work assignments, as well as those specific to the current week, such as shopping for a birthday gift or purchasing window treatments for the living room. Then, make a note of where you need to go to complete each errand and how much time it will take.


Keeping distance from your home and between each errand in mind, group together as many errands as you think you can do in a day. If there’s more than a day’s worth, split up the errands into Saturday and Sunday to-do lists.

, Before you run to the grocery store, take care of any other purchases at specialty stores or general merchandise retailers. That way you won’t have refrigerated goods in your car while you’re trying to run into Target or pick up some special ingredients for your stir fry.

, Instead of running to the bank every lunch time or after work, take care of all your banking needs at once. Calculate how much cash you’ll need through Friday and withdraw it all at once, and gather together all checks which you need to deposit so you can do it at the same time. This will save you cash withdrawal fees and precious minutes from your day, as well as help you stay on top of your spending and budget.


Many banks offer mobile apps you can download onto your smartphone. You can’t withdraw cash from them, but you can deposit checks, check your balance, transfer money, and pay bills, saving you some valuable time at the end of the week., In order to get grocery shopping done for the whole week, you’ll need to make a detailed plan of what you’re going to eat each day. Write down the meal as well as any ingredients you need to purchase, and all ingredients you already have.


There are many free or low-cost meal planning mobile apps, such as Yummly, Anylist, and Pepperplate, so take advantage of these resources if you’re feeling overwhelmed with thinking about your meals ahead of time.In order to make your shopping trip more efficient, cluster your ingredients into helpful categories, such as produce, meat, spices, and dairy. You can even use a grocery list mobile app, such as Anylist or Paprika, if you don't want to make your own., Purchasing a week’s worth of groceries rather than stopping into the market on an ad hoc basis can save you valuable time during the work week. It can even help you stick to a healthy and balanced diet. So, once you’ve got your meals and required ingredients listed, purchase them at your local shop or superstore and stock them in your cupboards and refrigerator.


Buying in bulk can make your shopping trip easier as well as more affordable, so consider visiting a warehouse club for items such as toilet paper, rice, cereal, and oats.This can be a more difficult task if you don’t own a car, but it’s not necessarily impossible! If you live within walking distance to a market, buy a folding wheeled cart that you can use to haul your groceries home from the store. If you need to take some form of transport to the store, consider taking the bus there and then getting a taxi or ride-sharing service on the way home.

Wake up early.,
Take up a new hobby.,
Register for a language, computer, or continuing education class.,
Find a volunteer position.,
Relax!",How to Spend the Weekend Doing Something Productive4," No matter how you end up making your weekends more productive, getting up early will give you more hours to dedicate to your chosen activity or chore set. Start by setting your alarm for a manageable morning hour, such as 9:30 or 10 am, then move this alarm up at half-hour increments. After a while, you’ll find that getting up earlier on a consistent basis will make you more proactive, energetic, and quick-witted throughout the rest of your work week.If you’re used to sleeping in on your weekends, start your new morning regimen slowly. Give yourself one weekend day a week to sleep in to your heart’s content rather than trying to rise early on both weekend days.

, Studies have shown that developing a new skill or participating in a new activity can make you a more well-rounded, creative, and decisive person. Once you get into the swing of your new hobby, it can also provide incentive for getting through the rest of the work week and even turn into a new career path or create a new social circle in your life.Knitting, painting, writing, and cooking classes are all great, creative hobbies that can enrich your life, while yoga and dance classes or club sports teams can fun ways to improve your physical fitness.


If you already have a hobby but don’t know where, how, or with whom to practice it, check out social websites designed to acquaint people with similar interests and purposes. For example, meetup.com organizes local groups for anything from Scrabble playing to mountain climbing.

, Broadening your horizons intellectually is one of the most rewarding ways to spend your free time and weekends. If you’re interested in advancing your career, ask your supervisor if your job offers supplementary education courses. If you want to do something different, consider signing up for adult education courses at the local college or community center.


Learning a new language has been shown to improve one’s quality of life in particular. Not only does it provide insight into another linguistic system and culture, but it can also enhance mental function, creativity, and critical thinking in all aspects of life., It may seem counterintuitive, but one of the best ways to improve your own self-esteem is through dedicating time and energy to helping others. Volunteering has even been shown to have physical health benefits as well as lower incidence rates of depression.Whether you choose to help out at the local animal shelter, the soup kitchen, or a community library or farmer’s market, you’ll add dimension and depth to your life while cultivating valuable personal qualities, such as empathy, confidence, and work ethic.


The GiveGab mobile app and websites, like Volunteermatch.org and LinkedIn’s volunteer listing site, can help you find volunteer opportunities in your area., Just because you’re spending your weekend sleeping and lounging, doesn’t necessarily mean you’re wasting your time! Studies have shown that proper rest and relaxation are essential to a healthy lifestyle, so make sure you’re taking the time to recharge your batteries before you take on any extra weekend tasks and commitments.This is especially important if your day-to-day job demands a lot of overtime or physical labour. Instead of running yourself ragged on the weekend, do restful activities that are still thought-provoking and productive, such as reading, writing, or watching documentaries.

Organize your email inbox.,
Use keyboard shortcuts.,
Limit your time on social media.,
Watch less television.",How to Save Time2," Modern email services offer a myriad of ways to maintain a clean and organized inbox. Utilizing your email provider’s filtering tools can limit the amount of time you spend scouring for a message and keep you from scrolling through a sea of spam. Gmail, Outlook, Mail.app and just about any other email service will have similar filters to help you save time.


Keep spam email and chain messages from reaching your inbox by having your email provider instantly identify and delete them.
Have your work related emails automatically sent to their own folder.
Set up groups for any category you want, like friends and family, or social media updates. This way, you can find exactly what you’re looking for in no time!, They may not seem like much, but once you get the hang of them, or even just a few of them, the time saved will add up fast. Whether you use a Windows operating system or prefer a Macintosh computer, knowing the basic keyboard shortcuts and finding a few specific to your job will help you save time at work.


Some of the most frequently used shortcuts for windows include: Ctrl+C (copy selected item), Ctrl+V (paste selected item), and Ctrl+Z (undo an action).For Mac users trying to perform the same shortcuts, replace the Ctrl key with the command key., It’s easy to get trapped in a social media tailspin, where one profile leads to another and another. There’s a lot on the web to take your attention away from the important things in life. Don’t let yourself be distracted. Set a daily limit to your social media use. Try to stick with only an hour, or 30 minutes a day. Set aside a block of time each evening, or a little bit during the work day as a break.


Consider following fewer people on Twitter, Instagram, and other social media forums. That way there’s less to consume.
Take small steps to avoid social media. Don’t use it while you’re eating, or while you’re in bed.
Encourage your friends to limit their usage, too. You’d be surprised how quickly you find other ways to stay in touch., Sitting on the couch staring at the television can be relaxing after a long day, but it’s not a productive use of time. Eliminating your TV exposure will help you save time and make the most of the time you have. On the extreme end, you can cut your cable subscription. This will save you money and free up a lot of time. Or, take smaller steps, like only watching your top one or two favorite programs each week.


Take advantage of recording technology and save time by skipping commercials during the shows you can’t live without.
Multitask as you watch. Sometimes a show doesn’t demand your full attention. Try tidying up or exercising as you take in some television."

Cook more efficiently.,
Save time when cleaning your house.,
Handle your finances all at once.,
Start your day with an efficient morning routine.",How to Save Time3," People spend much more time than necessary preparing meals, so how you go about cooking can make an enormous difference in the amount of time you save each day. The first thing to consider is to grocery shop with a plan. Make a list of all the items you need, and stick to it. Try to shop when it’s not peak hours, and have a plan for all of your meals through the week, including lunch and dinner. This way you won’t have to spend time picking up individual items for certain meals later on.Make large portions of your favorite meals and save them. You can enjoy your favorites as leftovers later in the week without spending any time cooking again. Pasta dishes, soups, chili, and stew usually have recipes that call for big batches.Keep a bowl on the counter when you’re cooking to use as a temporary trash can. You can save a lot of time cutting out the constant trips to the garbage by tossing it all at once at the end, and it speeds up cleaning!

, Cleaning can seem like an endless task, as new messes are constantly made and dust continually builds up. Tackle the task effectively, though, and you can save time and have a tidy house. One great way to go about this is cleaning in short bursts. Spend no more than ten minutes picking up clothes, dishes, old newspapers, etc. and put them in their place. Do this everyday and you’ll avoid having to spend a large chunk of time doing deep cleans. Remember, a place for everything and everything in its place. Follow the saying to stay organized and you’ll save time by never having to search for your keys amidst a mess.


Work from high to low when performing more detailed cleanings. As you clean from high places dust will settle on the ground. Do the vacuuming last.
Clean as you go. Whether it’s waking up and making the bed or wiping up spilled spices as you cook, staying on top of cleaning on the fly will save you time down the road. This is especially useful in the kitchen and bathroom, where getting to spilled products or ingredients before they dry and harden can make cleaning much quicker and easier., Paying bills and making banking transactions can be complicated and time consuming if not done right. By sitting down and taking care of all your bills and finances in one go, you can avoid confusion and keep yourself from spending time fixing mistakes later.


Consolidate your bills as best you can. Contact your utilities providers and see if they have any options for bundling payments. This is common with cable, phone, and Internet providers.
Sign up for automatic bill payments. Many institutions have this option and it can free up a lot of time and eliminate stressing over missed deadlines.
Find out if your employer offers direct deposit and sign up if they do. One less trip to the bank!

, Don’t make the mistake of missing sleep by having a disorganized morning. Take simple steps to get your day going by planning your outfit and making lunch before bed. Consider taking a quicker shower and making a less complicated breakfast. A quick granola bar doesn’t take anytime at all.


Take advantage of an automated timer on your coffee maker to skip the hassle of setting it up in the morning.
Ignore technology while you get ready. Don’t check emails until you get to the office, they will only distract you. And don’t use a snooze feature on your alarm clock.
Open the blinds and bask in the natural light. It’s good for your brain and your circadian rhythm to expose yourself to sunlight as part of waking up."

Keep track of daily activities.,
Log all of your activities in a notebook.,
Assess how your time is spent.,
Consider adjustments.,
If you spend 3 hours a day sending work-related emails, it is unlikely you will be able to reduce the amount of time spent on this activity.,
Change your habits and norms.",How to Organize Your Time Wisely1," Monitor what you do on a daily basis and make a note of how much time you spend doing it. You might be surprised by how much time you actually waste throughout the day when compared to the actual amount of work you get done.Remember to also keep track of mundane tasks, like making breakfast, cleaning the house, showering, etc.;
, Once you have figured out what you do each day and how much time you spend doing it, write it into a notebook. Putting all of this information into one place and seeing it on one page will allow you to identify patterns and, potentially, areas where you may be wasting your time.Be comprehensive and clear when making entries into this notebook. Don't conflate separate events into one entry, don't overlook minor tasks, and be sure to write out exact times when assessing how your day breaks down.
It can be helpful to categorize certain types of activities. For example, write household chores in blue, work activities in red and leisure activities in black. This will help you visualize how your time is being spent.

, An hour a day spent zoning out? 2 hours to decide where to eat? 8 hours surfing the internet? Look for patterns in how you spend your time and determine what is necessary and what it is not.Do you waste time because you lack self-control? Do you procrastinate too often? Do you take on too much responsibility? These are all questions you need to ask yourself while assessing how you spend your time.You may find that you break up activities throughout your day in ways that don't make sense. For example, it is probably not wise to work for a half hour, then spend 10 minutes dealing with trivial matters, just to come back to work for another half hour. You will be more focused and productive if you just work for an hour and deal with trivial matters at a later time.
It is best to attack your tasks by ""chunking"". Chunking is a method in which you dedicate a predetermined amount of time to a single task without distractions.

, Now that you know exactly where and to what your time goes, start making active adjustments to your schedule. Make sure you identify areas that can’t or shouldn’t be reduced simply for time concerns. Just because something takes a long time doesn’t mean it is time wasted., However, if you are sending four or five personal emails between the work emails, you can definitely reduce the amount of time you dedicate to emails.

, Whatever your time management problem may be, there is a solution. Once you have decided where you waste time or how you should be spending your time, you will need to make a concerted effort to change your time management habits.If you are spending too much time cleaning your house or cooking your meals, considering hiring domestic help like a maid or a cook. For some people, their time is more valuable than their money.
Maybe you spend a good chunk of your day surfing the internet aimlessly. You can restrict your access to the certain internet sites or social networking accounts when you are supposed to be working on something else.

Determine the cause of your lack of organization.,
Consider what needs to be organized.,
Fill out a calendar.,
Get a good planner.,
Create a to-do list.,
Stop procrastinating.,
Start your day out right.,
Write everything down.,
Don’t overwhelm yourself.,
Don’t be a perfectionist.",How to Organize Your Life1," Why do you feel cluttered? For some people, busy schedules get in the way, making organization difficult. For others, simply lack of motivation or know-how is the culprit. To start organizing your life, you need to acknowledge the cause and make a decision to change it.;
, Although it’s easy to say “everything,” chances are there are specific areas in your life that have more clutter than others. Where are you the most disorganized? Consider your skills in making plans, cleaning house, or running errands. Which of these is the most stressful for you to accomplish? Remember to consider your work life, friendships, and general thought processes as well.


If you do think that everything in your life needs to be organized choose one thing to focus on. Than move on to another thing.

, If you have a busy schedule (or even if you don’t!) purchase or make a solid calendar and place it somewhere you will see it on a regular basis. This could be near your keys, on the fridge or in your home office. Take a few minutes to fill out the entire calendar with important dates and events coming up.


Avoid filling out common activities that will clutter your calendar, but things that you have firm plans to actually do. This could include classes, your work schedule, doctors appointments, and major events such as weddings and funerals.
Review your filled-out calendar and look at your typical weekly schedule. When are your breaks? Do you have short periods of time between events that you can use to your benefit? When are you busiest?

, The step up from the calendar is the handheld planner; an ultra organised list of daily activities. Although the thought of a planner may seem silly, it is consistently used by organised people. Whenever you create plans for an event, are assigned a project for work or school, or need to keep track of tasks and errands, mark them in your planner.


Try color-coding your planner to organize it even further. Use a single color to mark like events (such as homework or trips to the store) and some colors to mark important events (like using red to show something that must be done on time).
Carry your planner with you everywhere. It does you no good to have a planner but then leave it at home or laying under a pile of things. In order to stay organised, keep it in your purse, your car, on your desk, somewhere that you will remember to grab it.

, Sure, a to-do list sounds oddly similar to using a planner to schedule your days. However, think of your to-do list as breaking down your day into even smaller, more manageable pieces. Don’t list major, vague projects (such as clean the house or workout more). Give yourself some clear direction with short, easy tasks (like clean the kitchen, scrub the toilets, and run one mile).


Add little check boxes next to each task, even if it seems silly. Ticking off the boxes as you work through your day will give you a visual reminder of your hard work, and leave you feeling fulfilled and proud of your work.
Keep your to-do list someplace you will see it often, to remind you of the tasks you have to accomplish. You may even consider keeping it in your planner.
Finish the biggest projects on your to do list before getting to smaller ones. For example, finish “scrub the fridge” before “sort the mail” to give you momentum and make yourself more productive.

, Possibly the toughest item on the list, procrastinating is a major detriment to organizing your life. Instead of putting things off, get them done immediately. Force yourself to get things done without waiting to finish them. If it can be done in two minutes or less, always do it right away while breaking down larger tasks into smaller pieces to make them manageable.


Set a timer for fifteen minutes and work like crazy during that time. Don’t get distracted, take any breaks, or stop for any reason but an emergency during the time your timer is going. Then, allow yourself to stop working on your tasks when the timer goes off. Likely though, you will continue working because you finally managed to make headway on a project you've been avoiding.
Remove your distractions, whatever they are. Often it is the internet, your phone, sleep, or even a good book. No matter what distracts you, set a period of time where you work on projects without them.

, When you wake up, eat a good breakfast, shower or wash your face, get dressed, and put on your shoes. Do all the things you would do, every single day, as if you were going in to work at the office. This will change your mental perspective; by getting ready and making yourself presentable to the world, you have set yourself up for success. You’ll have more confidence because you’ll know that you are prepared for anything, and you will therefore be more direct about getting work accomplished and being organised about it., Whenever you have an important thought, remember something you don’t want to forget, or are reminded of something to do, write it down. This can be done in your planner or in another generalized notebook that you keep with you. Writing down your errant thoughts will not only remove them from your mind (and thus declutter your conscience), but also place them in a place that you can return back to later without forgetting.

, If you find that your time is short and schedule is full, consider dropping less important things from your daily plans. Is that coffee date with your friend really necessary today? How about your plans to work on your work assignment outside of your work hours? If you are doing too many things at once, you will feel unorganized and anxiety-prone. Cancel plans when necessary to give your head a little more thinking space.


Learn to delegate projects to others. If you know you have to go grocery shopping but are much too busy to consider the idea, ask a family member or close friend to run the errand for you. As long as you aren't putting off major tasks or giving things that are important for you personally to do to others, delegating can be healthy.
Don’t agree to everything you are asked to do if you know you don’t have time for it. Your friends won’t hate you, your boss won’t think you slack, and your significant other will understand if you need your free time to get some personal work and organisation done., If you only feel that you've completed a task when it is “perfect,” you will be leaving a lot of tasks unfinished to clutter up your life. On a similar note, if you wait to start tasks until you’re in the “perfect” decluttering mindset, you will be waiting a very long time.


Don’t put off projects any longer, and know when a project is adequately finished and can be left alone. When you reach a point where it is “good enough,” settle for less and move on to your next item.
If you have certain projects that you can’t seem to perfect, try taking a break from them and come back after you've finished a few other smaller tasks. You will accomplish more in the same amount of time, rather than getting bored and wasting time on a single unperfected task.

Identify distractions in your life.,
Avoid long phone conversations.,
Don’t surf the web excessively.,
Employ a “Do Not Disturb” sign.,
Make time for unavoidable distractions.",How to Organize Your Time Wisely2," The biggest threats to spending your time wisely are consistent distractions. You will want to figure out what types activities or which individuals tend to end up wasting your time. Whether it is a friend who just doesn’t stop talking or a guilty pleasure that draws you away from work, you can find ways to avoid these time wasters.If you spend a large chunk of your time on something that produces no desirable outcomes for you, it is likely just a distraction in your life that should be avoided.
Working in an office setting, you are likely to see many of your co-workers as distractions. Be sure to avoid small talk or worthless chit chat when you are on the clock. However, keep in mind that your attitude in the office is as important to your career advancement as time management skills, so don't be rude.

, If you find you are spending a good amount of your time locked into long phone conversations, then you need to adjust your phone habits. Often times, you can achieve more in face to face meetings than you can on the phone- so cut out the long phone conversations.Many phone discussions, especially at the beginning or the end of the conversation, include superfluous and unnecessary conversations. People tend to lose focus and wander while on the phone, so be cognizant of that. Holding meetings in person provides more of an imperative to deal exclusively with work-related issues. This is because neither party is surrounded by distractions when a face-to-face meeting takes place.

, Many people use the internet as critical tool to accomplish the tasks they need to get done. However, just as many people are guilty of drifting over to useless news articles, sports highlights, and pictures of celebrities, kittens or puppies. Stay focused when you are on the internet. There are programs available that will block certain applications, websites and domains that can help reduce internet-related distractions.Avoid Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites when you are supposed to be focused on something else.
Googling various topics is also a dangerous time-waster. You may think you are just going to look up one quick thing and before you know it, you have been searching the vast depths of the internet for over 3 hours.

, You are probably familiar with the sign you hang on your hotel room door. This sign can be equally effective in an office or workplace as well. You can get a sign like this by taking it from the next hotel you stay at, or you can print your own and attach it to the door of your work space when needed. This will eliminate the small talk that distracts you from your work.If you work from home, it is critical to have a dedicated work space of your own. Don't work in the common areas of your house, as the T.V., phone, or video game machine can easily distract you away from your work., There are some distractions some people just can’t avoid. Sometimes it is your boss who wants to take time out of your day for a social chat or maybe an elderly family member that consistently needs help with simple tasks. Whatever these unavoidable distractions may be, if you plan for them in advance, they will not take critical time away from other projects and activities that need to get done."

Reward yourself.",How to Organize Your Time Wisely3," Don’t rely on your memory to get you through the tasks you need to get done. Write everything you need to do down in one spot and be prepared to reference this list often in order to achieve all of your goals.Even if a task seems minor or mundane, write it down. Your daily planner should be filled with small comments like ""Call Steve,"" ""Look up profit margins"" or ""Email boss.""
Make sure you carry a notepad with you at all times and write down tasks as they come up. You think you will remember to write them down later, but you may not.

, The simple addition of a daily calendar or planner to your set of organizational tools will help you organize time efficiently. Write down every new deadline, assignment or meeting that gets added to your schedule. Take time each morning to review your calendar for the day so you know what's ahead of you., Organize your schedule by avoiding overbooking yourself or committing yourself to too many projects or events at once. Check your calendar before agreeing to anything to verify that the time needed is free. This will keep your time organized and keep you in touch with your regular schedule.

, Organize your time productively by removing elements that could be distractions or cause you to get off track and behind schedule. Keep the television and video game system out of the area where you study or do the bills so you will focus on the tasks that need to be done first and save the fun stuff for later., Manage your time wisely by planning to accomplish the most important or time-sensitive tasks first. Note these in your schedule with a special color highlighter or a small sticker. Schedule these top-priority tasks first to give yourself enough time to complete them, then work on less time-sensitive things around the prioritized ones.Be ready to change your priorities from time to time. Things do come up last minute and will require your immediate attention. You will have to stop what you are doing and refocus your energy and time on this last minute objective from time to time. Just be sure it does not occur too often.
If you find yourself consistently rearranging your priorities throughout the day, something is wrong. While minor adjustments to one's schedule can be expected, having to make consistent adjustments probably means you are not prioritizing properly in the first place.

, Allow yourself a realistic amount of time to complete each task. If you think something will take between a half hour and an hour to complete, give yourself the full hour. Being realistic about how long something will take will prevent you from getting overwhelmed or behind schedule.It is always safer to err on the side of caution and give yourself more time than you will need. If you finish your task early, you will be free to move on to the next task- which ultimately should not impact your productivity.

, Remember to include times for the everyday basics, like eating and showering, in your schedule. These might seem like second nature, but it's important to allow time for them among your other scheduled tasks to ensure that you don't skip them and that they don't put you behind schedule.

, Use simple reminders in addition to your daily planner to help remember important tasks or deadlines. Use sticky notes or voice or text alerts on your cell phone at certain times to remind yourself to do something or that you have something scheduled. This backup system will help keep you from forgetting things.Avoid relying on other people to remind you about something. They are just as likely to forget it as you are.
If something is extremely important, arrange multiple reminders for yourself. You can overlook a single sticky note or phone alert.

, Ask someone else for help and delegate smaller tasks if needed. It will benefit your schedule overall if you swallow your pride and ask someone to pitch in with a few small chores around the house or with taking care of dinner on a busy weeknight. Make sure you delegate responsibilities to qualified people. Someone getting the work done is not enough. You want them to get the work done well.
Don't make a habit of pawning off your work others. It does not reflect good time management skills. It just makes you look lazy and unmotivated.

, From time to time, it is necessary to take a step back and analyze what you accomplished, how well you performed, and how much time it took. Taking stock of these aspects of your work and life can help you make changes to your schedule and daily pattern of operation, producing surprisingly effective results.

, Working too hard or too often can lead to a burnout, making it difficult to focus on even the simplest tasks. So, take some time to celebrate what you have accomplished from time to time and reward yourself with something you truly enjoy.Make sure your down time is dedicated to enjoying yourself. Turn off your work phone and avoid answering emails. If you are mixing work with your leisure time, you really aren't rewarding yourself or avoiding burn out.
If you work Monday to Friday, take the weekend off. If you have been working for three months straight on one project, take a brief vacation when you are finished with it.

Find a place for everything.,
Declutter space by space.,
Get rid of things you don’t need.,
Don’t bring in more unnecessary items.,
Put things back right away.,
Divvy up your chores.,
Label everything.",How to Organize Your Life2," If your house is unorganized, you probably don’t have designated places for all your things. Instead of resigning items to a certain room or area, keep track of a very specific location for everything in your home.


Don’t simply leave something on your nightstand, create a space specifically for that item. Do the same for everything in your home so that things aren’t left lying around without a place to live.
Keep something like a basket or small stand near the front door where you can place things you need to deal with when you have more time. This might include your mail, items from the store, or things from school and work.

, Choose a day during the week on which you have most (or all) of your time free. Then, choose a single area in your life that is unorganized and needs to be cleaned up. This could be rooms in your house, your car, or your office at work. Then work only on throwing out unnecessary items that are taking up space in that section of your life.


Get organizational storage containers, folders, and boxes to help your place stay organised. You can buy items designated for organized storage from many department and furniture stores, or you can make your own using things like cups, shoe boxes, and dishes. Make these organizational pieces a bit more attractive with a coat of paint or a covering of fabric.
Consider the last time you used the items you are sorting through. If it has been many months or years since you last needed it, consider throwing it out.

, Although you might assume that you “need” everything you own, an disorganized house is probably likely to have some items you don’t. Sort through the things that constantly give you clutter and determine how useful it is to you. If you haven’t used it in a long time, don’t use it frequently, don’t like it anymore, or don’t need it, get rid of it.


Keep your emotions separate from the items you are sorting. Sure, your great aunt may have given you that porcelain knickknack, but do you truly want or need it? Make steps to throw these things out, and don’t feel like a bad person for doing so.
Separate things you get rid of into piles such as trash, donations, and things to sell. Then, process each pile accordingly.
Hold a garage or yard sale to make some money on the things you are throwing out. Large items, such as furniture or electronics, can be listed on online selling sites like eBay or Craigslist so that you don’t have to host a large event in order to make your money., Don’t defeat the process of organising your life by bringing in new things that you don’t need. One major reason you might do this is bargain shopping. Avoid big sales or bargains, as these will lead to you buy things that you don’t really need or want simply because you don’t want to pass up the good deal.


When you’re shopping, ask yourself where in your home that piece will go. Do you have a specific location for it, where it can stay permanently?
When you go to the store, keep a list of the things you are looking for. Then, as you search for items do not stray from your list. You will come back with only what you need, rather than what you thought you needed.
Consider the money you save by avoiding that sale. Although you may be making a bargain purchase, you are still spending money on something you might not need.

, Everyone does it - takes out a pen from the drawer, writes a note, and then leaves it on the counter. Instead of placing things where it’s most convenient, take an extra moment to return them to their correct places.


If the task you are considering takes less than two minutes, just do it right away. Getting it done will leave your house organised and give you less to do later.
If there are several things laying around in the same area, take a few minutes to put them all back. This will keep the unruly pile from growing larger and more difficult to deal with.

, How many times has your house become unorganised because you put off cleaning it up? Although this is tied to procrastination, you can make your list of things to clean and organise more manageable by presenting yourself with smaller tasks. Choose a single item - such as dusting - and give yourself a specific time and day to do it. If you do this with all your chores, your space will always be clean without you having to spend several consecutive hours working on it., Do you have boxes or drawers full of mystery items, long lost from your memory? Well get out your handy label maker (or use a classic marker) and label everything you have. Keep like things in the same place, in order to make the labeling process go a bit smoother.

After all, you carry it with you most of the day, so it must be storing the important items. That being said, most people have a way of stuffing items in there and gradually accumulating junk. So start by emptying the bag out, completely. Dump everything out on the floor, bed or table and go through all the items one by one. Throw out the trash, put away anything that can be stored at home instead of your bag, and make a pile of only what you really need.;
, Being organized and being clean go hand in hand; you probably don't want to stick your hand in your bag and end up covered with sticky old juice or crumbs or something similar. Clean your bag, and wipe down the items you're storing in it, if anything's become dirty over time.

, Chances are you have some main, big, important items to store in your bag: your notebooks or textbooks, a computer, or your wallet. Make sure that gets its ""home"" first.

, If you've got secondary pockets for other items, that's even better. Slot pens in where they fit, put personal items in their own small pocket, store any valuables somewhere they're not easily found if someone comes across your bag, and so on. If you've got anything that might leak (water bottles, soda bottles, lip gloss, moisturizer, etc), try to store it by itself in its own pocket so that nothing else gets damaged.

, Once you've got a system going, try to stick to it. Don't jam trash in there even when you're busy; throw it out, instead. Clean out your bag every week or so to make sure it stays organized and clean.

Organize.,
Stick small pieces of tape on most used.",How to Organize Your Important Papers," These can be bought at most of your convenience stores. You want ones with several different pockets in different sizes and shapes for all your important papers. Some come with buttons and some come with straps, which one you prefer is up to you.;
, You don't want to hear a bunch of chatter while you organize your important papers. Windows often provide extra noise from outside so it's best to avoid them, unless you want to have a supply of fresh air. Be sure to have enough space to have all of your papers spread out though.

, Hunt around a couple times and look in all the places you think you might have laid them down, and places you wouldn't. Put them all in a stack on the clean desk.

, Whether alphabetic or most used, make sure you think about all of your papers, not just one section. Even is it takes looking through it again make sure you have them in the right order.

, Put all of your important papers in the corresponding places. Make it look neat too. Flatten all the corners, Bend back all the creases. Those things.

, This will help you find your paper with ease and not have to dig around in your organizer all day to find that one tax return paper.

Open and file your bills right away.,
Use folders or trays.,
Consider going paperless.",How to Organize Your Bills1," Put all your bills in the same place once you receive and open them. For mailed bills, this could be a desk or mail center in your home. For electronic bills, this could be a special folder in your email inbox.


Try opening a bill you get by mail quickly when you receive it, then writing the due date on the outside of the envelope before you put it back inside, so you can quickly see it later.If you get a bill by email, open it and then flag it, move it to a folder for bills, or designate it in another way that will get your attention later.;
, Get several folders or a system of trays or pockets to keep on a desk, on the wall, or in a filing cabinet. Designate files and trays by bill type and paid/unpaid.


Try creating a folder for each bill category, such as home, utilities, credit cards, auto, insurance, health, etc. Then place one copy of those folders into a larger hanging folder or tray labeled “Unpaid” and one copy in another labeled “Paid.”
You can also try a binder to keep bills, calendars, checks, envelopes, and stamps all in the same place and save on filing space.At the end of each year, go through your files and throw away or shred bills (if they contain sensitive information) that are from the year previous, i.e. a year or two old. This can help you reduce clutter and filing space while still holding onto recent bills you may need to refer back to., Convert any paper bills to electronic bills if you can; just give the company a call to inquire about how to make the switch, or visit their website. You can also scan in mailed bills to reduce the paper you have to file.


Choose to scan in your paper bills right away when you receive them, or after they are paid. Either way, make sure you designate a folder on your computer for bills, then make folders within it for each type of bill.
You can also set up auto-pay services within the companies you pay bills to. This allows them to withdraw funds from your bank account automatically, eliminating the need to remember to pay them.

Learn what a curfew is.,
Decide that you will follow curfew.,
Learn how to say goodbye to that special someone.,
Arrive home before curfew.",How to Obey Curfew with a Girlfriend," Are you a young responsible adult, and confused by the definition of curfew? Webster's defines curfew as ""a regulation requiring people to remain indoors between specified hours, typically at night."" In short, it means being at home, at the designated time, with no member of the opposite sex present.
, The average young male requires at least 8 hours of sleep per night. Curfew will aid you in your quest to be healthy and achieve your goals., When that time rolls around, it can be hard to leave the person you love, not knowing whether or not you'll see them later. Some ways to say goodbye include:

Goodnight!
Sleep Well!
I have to go home, but I had a lot of fun!
Thanks for the swell time tonight, it sure was neat but I must leave!

, Give yourself a few minutes' leeway in case something holds you up at the last moment."

Organize files by student.,
Keep billing information organized.,
Organize contacts for tutoring.,
File tax-related items.,
Organize curriculum.,
Organize contracts, certifications, etc.",How to Organize a Tutor's Filing Cabinet," It's often important to have a dedicated file for every single student. This helps you see at a glance where each student is, what has been done and a range of other key details.;
, As a tutor, you may use third-party billing. Or, you may use templates and print invoices. Whatever the system is, having a streamlined, accessible billing system can save you a lot of time.

, Having an organized Rolodex can eliminate trouble for tutors who need to do routine communications during a student's set of tutoring sessions, or when it becomes necessary to make some calls looking for new business.


Keep contacts for tutoring services. You may frequently have to call your third-party employing services about policies, payment and more. Having those phone numbers on hand can be critical.
Keep parents' phone numbers on file. In a variety of situations, including for scheduling changes, you may need to contact parents of younger students. Having both home phone and cell phone data close by can help.

, Having a good part of the filing cabinet dedicated to tax filing will help when it's time to file annually.


Keep receipts for deducted expenses. As a tutor, you can often deduct a range of costs from federal and state tax returns. However, proof is needed for an audit or other observation.
Keep any other tax-related items. Tracking earnings over the year is handy for making estimated quarterly payments.

, The actual books and tutoring materials that a professional uses also need to be well-organized. This works best when there is sufficient space and folders, dividers, etc. to collate materials well.


Keep materials accessible. Having books and handouts separated by age, subject and skill level often helps.
Label audio and video tools, etc. These larger items may only go out to tutoring venues periodically but it's important for you to track them and know where they are.

, All other applicable documents including qualifications and ongoing contracts also need to be a part of a well-stocked filing cabinet when tutoring.

Plan.,
Follow through on your plan.,
Balance.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Communicate.",How to Manage Your Time in International Baccalaureate (IB)," Planning is a simple yet crucial step on the road to success, but there is a right way to do it. Make sure your schedule or organizational tactics are realistic. Several small, specific goals that can be achieved in short amounts of time (such as ""emailing the teacher by Wednesday"" or ""finishing half of your project a week before it's due"") will help you organize your time and give you the positive feeling of having met your goals. Setting lofty goals that may take the whole year to complete (such as ""getting a high A in math"" or ""studying better"") won't keep you on track every day and may discourage you when they're not easy to reach. It's the difference between setting the goal of ""studying Biology for thirty more minutes each day for a week"" and ""getting an A on the next Biology test""; choosing the first goal will lead to the second, and it is more specific so it is easier to achieve. Prioritizing and planning go hand in hand; sometimes certain projects are just more important than others.;
, You will accomplish nothing if you do not follow through on what you have planned, so actually do what you said you were going to. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't finish every single assignment perfectly. Be quick and efficient in performing your planned tasks. Even though some of us believe in perfecting our assignments over and over until the last minute, it is most advisable to sit down, write it up, proofread and simply submit it. Remember, getting the assignment in on time is more important than writing the greatest report of your life.

, Include time in your plans for fun things to do, such as going to movies, spending time out at the beach, or playing video games. Rewarding yourself with activities you enjoy (because heaven knows homework isn't one of them) will help you unwind and stay fresh for the next round of work, and will help you maintain a healthy social life. Because who know how long it is before the IB apocalypse turns you into one of them zombies, functioning on caffeine and modafinil.

, Procrastinating is what happens when you know what your next step is, but put it off in favor of doing something less important. It's different from prioritizing, which is putting something off in favor of doing something MORE important. Obviously, you will waste a lot of time if you procrastinate. As painful as it sometimes is, stick to your schedule and don't let yourself slack off. If you don't have discipline, consider asking someone else to help you. For example, if you know you're going to ignore the alarm you set for yourself, ask a parent to burst in and hassle you until you get the important things done.

, Don't isolate yourself on an raft of sleep deprivation in a sea of stress-induced tears. Staying connected with your friends and classmates will help you stay afloat when you have too many things to do and not enough time. Talk to them about homework, due dates, and anything else that you might have questions about. They can remind you about deadlines and give you time saving tips of their own. Occasionally talking with your parents about schoolwork can keep them off your back so you don't have added pressure from your parents (since you have more than enough pressure from school).

Look through what's there, and clean it up.,
Keep only the things you need for your work on the desk itself.,
Keep some basic office supplies within arm's reach.,
Organize with efficiency in mind.,
Create a filing system, if you need it.,
Organize your draws by what's in them.",How to Organize Your Belongings2," Any good organization system starts with a clean-up. Go through everything in your desk. If it's trash, throw it out. If you don't need it anymore and it can be donated or given away, do that. If you need it, great! Give it a wipe down if it's dusty or dirty, and then it'll be time to organize what's left.

, Putting distracting items there won't help you buckle down and focus on work, and keeping a ton of outdated files and papers in your workspace just adds to your clutter. Put everything away in its place, and only keep out what you need for your current work.

, You may need a pen or pencil and scrap paper at a moment's notice, to take down some notes or a memo. That way, if an idea comes to you, you can jot it down right away, before you lose it.

, Keep the things you frequently where you can find them quickly and easily (top drawers, shelves within arm's reach, etc), and move away the things you don't use regularly. It will help you to be more efficient.

, Whether it's part of your desk or in a filing cabinet nearby, if you have a lot of papers, start a filing cabinet. Organize school papers by subject/grade, or organize important documents like bills, legal/financial papers, contracts and so on by topic area or company.

, You might have a drawer for writing utensils and other office supplies, a draw for blank paper and notebooks, a draw for important papers (in addition to a full filing system, if you need one), etc. Only you can devise what system works for you, but once you have it, stick to it. Keep everything in its place, putting it back after you've used it.

Sort out your clutter.,
Use your drawers, wardrobes, and built-in closets religiously.,
Do laundry regularly.,
Organize your trinkets and ornaments.,
Consider having a ""junk"" drawer or box.",How to Organize Your Belongings3," Get rid of useless clothes, old papers, and broken things that you're not planning to fix. Donate any items that might still be usable to someone else, and throw out or recycle the rest.


When you're going through your clothes, actually try them on. It'll take a while but it's the only way to remember whether older clothes are worth keeping. Yes, you might have loved that shirt from five years ago, but if it doesn't fit and doesn't have extreme sentimental value, there's no reason to keep it anymore. Even if it does fit you, consider whether you've worn it in the last year. If not and if you're not about to wear it tomorrow, find it a new home through donation, and let someone else love it from here on out.

, In simpler terms: put everything away when you're not using it. If every bit of clothing or other personal item has a ""home"", staying organized is easy. It's a lot of work to set up, but once you know which drawer houses your socks, which part of the closet is for shirts, and where your trousers go, it's easy to stick to it.

, Once of the biggest sources of mess in people's rooms is dirty clothes. Get a big hamper or basket for dirty clothes, and every time you take something off that you don't plan on wearing again before you wash it, throw it right in there, rather than on the floor. Once the hamper is full (or even before), do a load of laundry. When the laundry is done, put the clothes away right away. Skipping the steps where dirty clothes clutter up the floor or clean clothes are sitting around waiting to be put away will help everything feel much more organized.

, Some people love having a lot of sentimental mementos in their rooms. It's not exactly minimalist, but it's okay, as long as you keep them somewhat tidy and clean. Clean them every now and then so that they don't accumulate a lot of fluff and dust, and they'll only enhance your room.

, Ok, everyone accumulates a fair share of junk that doesn't ""fit"" with other supplies. Designate one drawer or box/shelf in your closet for these items that don't ""go"" with anything else. Every few months, look through it and throw out what you don't need. Junk has a way of accumulating!

Don't use your car for storage.,
Clean the inside of your car.,
Put items back in their logical place.,
Consider a storage system, especially if you have kids.,
Keep it clean.",How to Organize Your Belongings4," If you've got a ton of belongings in your car, you're doing it wrong. Start by cleaning out all that clutter. If it's trash, throw it out. If it's items that need to be stored at home or delivered to someone else, take care of it. Your car is a means of transport, not storage, and if you want to really stay organized there, you need to bust the clutter and stick to that plan. Pull everything out to start with, get rid of everything you don't need, and make a pile of items that you do (insurance papers, a few coins for the meter, a first aid kit, car maintenance and emergency supplies, maybe an umbrella and a jacket, etc; think ""car essentials,"" not ""life essentials"").

, If your car was in dire need of organization, it's probably also in need of a clean. Start there, vacuuming out the inside and wiping down any dusty, sticky, or smudged surfaces and windows. You can even clean the outside while you're at it, if you're eager.

, When organizing your car, consider that if you really are in any kind of automotive emergency, you might not be conscious when someone goes to look for items like identifying registration/insurance information or emergency supplies. Or, you might lend your car to a friend who ends up with a flat tire. Try to put things in their logical place for this turn of events: most people keep important car documents in the glove compartment, and emergency/car maintenance supplies (jumper cables, emergency warning triangles, etc) in the trunk or perhaps back seat. It's unlikely someone else will need to find them without you, but if they do, those are the first places they'll look.


More personal items like an umbrella, jacket, etc can go where you want them, most likely either in the trunk or the back seat.

, Some cars accumulate more clutter than others; for example, if you've got kids, you've probably got a back seat full of car seats, toys, trinkets, food, and bottles. Some of this is unavoidable, especially with young kids, but try to keep it as contained as possible.


Try getting a seat-back organizer or a big box or tupperware bin to store some of the clutter in; with infant/toddler seats, a bin or box should fit nicely under their feet and can be used for toys, snack containers, etc. Just make sure to hand them anything they need before you start driving so you avoid the temptation to try to find something while you're behind the wheel.

, Like any organization system, car organization requires maintenance. Clean out your car once a week to throw out any trash and wipe down any spills. If you do it regularly, it should only take a minute or two, and it's much more pleasant than letting the clutter accumulate to the point where you feel disorganized again.

Make a bill spreadsheet.,
Put bills in order by due date.,
Try an online service.",How to Organize Your Bills2," Open up a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets and create a document just for your bills. Make rows and columns for the types of bills and their due dates and other necessary information. You can also make a handwritten document if you prefer to.


Make these essential column categories for each bill: bill name, due date, balance, minimum payment, date received, and date paid. You can also keep track of what the interest rate or late fees are if you don’t pay the full balance on an account.
If you have auto-pay set up for an account, make note of this in your spreadsheet, along with what day funds are automatically taken out of your account.
Add a column for a confirmation number or check number, which you can enter after you pay a bill. This allows you to easily reference the payment if you encounter any problems.

, Organize the bills in your spreadsheet and the physical bills in your files according to due date, with the first due first or on top. This will help ensure that when you sit down to make payments, you’ll be addressing the bills that need to be paid soonest.


In a spreadsheet, you can select all of your cells, then use the “sort” feature to select your “due date” column and how you wish to sort it (lowest to highest, numerically).
Provide a “cushion” for the due date of your bills, and record the day you will actually make a payment. Pay electronic bills as soon as they’re posted or a few days before the due date so you don’t forget. If you’re mailing in a bill, subtract 7 days from the due date provided to account for the time it takes to ship and be processed., Use a free application or paid software to organize and pay your bills if you have trouble doing so on your own. Bill pay software can be set up through your bank, company, or applications you download yourself.


Use a free app or service like Finovera.com, Check.me, or MoneyStream.com.Or try paid software like Quicken or Pear Budget for more robust bill organizing capabilities.

Set aside time to deal with bills every week.,
Integrate your spreadsheet with your calendar.,
Set alarms or reminders.",How to Organize Your Bills3," Make time in your schedule that’s specifically dedicated to paying and organizing bills every week. Either pay bills during that time or focus on filing them in such a way that you will remember to pay them before the due date.


A weekly schedule for this works best, as it’s easier to make a habit of it and ensures that you address bills that arrive and come due at different times of the month.If you have very few bills, you may set aside a time for paying bills only once or twice a month instead.

, Put your due dates or payment dates into a calendar or planner. This can be any paper or electronic one you use for all of your scheduling, or one designated specifically for bills.


Many electronic calendars like Google Docs or the local calendar application on your computer operating system can also sync up to your mail platform and detect dates within your emails, making it easy for you to simply click on it to create a new calendar entry.
In an electronic calendar, try including in the notes or details of an entry the website URL and login information for all bills that you pay online.

, Set an alarm or reminder notification on your phone or computer that will pop up on the day of or day before you need to pay a bill. Use this method particularly if you have trouble setting time aside to pay bills or look at your calendar without prompting.


Many electronic calendar applications allow you to set an alarm for any event, making it easy to schedule and remind yourself in one step.
You can also set a regular clock alarm or timer to go off when you want to set aside some time in a day to address all your bills.

Use consistent past times to develop an estimate.,
Use varying past times to develop an estimate.,
Use the experiences of others to estimate the time needed.,
Draw on both types of estimations.,
Offer an optimistic estimate.,
Offer a pessimistic estimate.,
Offer the median as your estimate.",How to More Accurately Estimate the Time Needed for Tasks1," If you’re completing a task that you’ve done before, you can draw on your own experience to develop a ballpark estimate of the time needed. If the task takes the same amount of time for each attempt, you will probably be able to accomplish the task in the same amount of time you did every previous time.For instance, if you make sandwiches for lunch and it always takes eight minutes, you can estimate with a high degree of accuracy that your current sandwich will also take eight minutes to make.;
, If the task you’re interested in developing an estimate for took a slightly different amount of time every time you did it, you can average the previous times it took you to complete the task in order to arrive at an estimate. Perhaps the tools you had on hand were different each time, or perhaps the first time you did the task, you didn’t know quite what you were doing. Whatever the cause, you can total the time spent on the task and divide by the number of instances to achieve an estimate.For instance, if you’re changing tires and have changed your tires three times before with completion times of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes, your total time is 60 minutes. Divided by three instances, you end up with an estimated time of 20 minutes to change your tires.

, In addition to drawing on your own experience to estimate how long it will take to complete a task, you can use the experience of others to arrive at a reasonable estimate. For instance, if you plan on swapping out your phone’s battery for a new one, you could ask friends who have the same phone how long it took them. You can average these time estimates or identify the median time to arrive at a reasonable estimate.After identifying the task you wish to acquire an estimated time to completion for, ask a knowledgeable person how long they believe it will take to complete.
If you do not know someone capable of providing such an estimate, consult web-based sources for an idea of how long it might take. Depending on the task you’re interested in completing, you might be able to find a reasonable estimate in books at your local library. Home repair tasks, arts and crafts projects, and recipes, for instance often list estimated times to completion based on the experience of the individual who authored the task directions.

, If possible, use both your own past experiences and the experiences of others to arrive at the most accurate estimate of time needed for tasks. This will allow you to draw on the largest possible set of background data and thus estimate most accurately the time necessary for a given task.Weighing both secondhand and personal experiences will allow you to avoid (or, at least, minimize the odds of) overestimating your own ability to accomplish a task quickly or within a given amount of time.

, An optimistic estimate is the minimum amount of time you expect a task will take. It’s based on the shortest time you previously accomplished a given task in. For instance, if you are trying to develop an estimate for the time you’ll need to clean your living room and the previous times required to clean your living room were 30 minutes, 24 minutes, and 31 minutes, your optimistic minimum estimate would be about 24 minutes, since it is the lowest number in the data set.Avoid citing the minimum as an estimate, since it is based on only a single data point and will not be very accurate.

, The most pessimistic estimate is based on the maximum amount of time you’ve ever spent on a single instance of a task. For instance, if you’ve cooked pancakes in 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 15 minutes, you would choose 20 minutes as your pessimistic estimate, since it’s the longest time you’ve ever spent cooking pancakes. Like the minimum, it’s based on a single data point and therefore not very reliable.Citing the maximum as your estimate will give a very conservative estimate.

, The median is the middle number in a data set. For instance, if baking a cake takes 20 minutes one time, 22 minutes another time, and 23 minutes another time, the number in the set that is in the middle of the other numbers in the data set (22, in this case) is the median."

Identify the steps needed to complete the task.,
Ask for help when defining steps needed to complete the task.,
Order your activities.,
Consult with your team.,
Stick to your plan.,
Use phased implementation.,
Track how much time you’re spending on a given task.,
Find ways to streamline your time-tracking.",How to More Accurately Estimate the Time Needed for Tasks2," Most tasks have several parts to them. Before you can accurately estimate the time needed for tasks, you must identify each component or step of the task, then calculate how long it will take to accomplish it.For instance, in a business setting, you’ll need to agree on what the deliverables will be. You’ll then need to know long it will take to complete each step on the way to finalizing each deliverable. For instance, if you know you need to create a presentation, a report, and a prototype product, you can draw up three independent estimates then add them to arrive at your most accurate estimate.

, In business or other organizational settings, you often have tasks and substeps assigned by superiors. In these cases, you should already have a clear sense of what you need to accomplish, and consult your client or superior for more information regarding what each step requires., On large projects, you often have many steps. You might be able to complete these steps in any order, or you might need to order your activities in a logical way. For instance, if you’re building a house, you’ll need to order your activities based on the order in which they are possible. You will have to add the time it takes to lay the foundation, the time it takes to assemble the frame, and so on.In other cases – for instance, developing a new product – you and/or your team can work on multiple aspects of the product concurrently. For example, you might be able to develop ads and marketing for the product while another team develops a plan to showcase the product at relevant industry events. The estimated time to completion in this case is simply the longer of the two time estimates.

, Some tasks require the input and assistance of others for completion. For instance, when writing a comic book, someone needs to write the script, then someone needs to draw the book, and someone else needs to ink the book. In these cases, get input from the other individuals involved in order to get the most accurate estimate needed to complete the task. Otherwise, you might end up estimating how long each step of the process will take with a low degree of accuracy.Remember, if some people are working part-time on the task, they might not provide an accurate estimate if they switch roles.
When you draft final time estimates, ask others on your team for input about whether or not the timeline in which you will complete the task seems valid.
Assume that your team will only be productive 80% of the time. Be sure to factor in time for sick days, accidents, meetings, and other unforeseen problems.

, Assuming the task you’re trying to develop a more accurate estimate for began with a plan, follow the plan step-by-step until completion. Deviating from your plan will cause your estimate to become less accurate.Sometimes it becomes inevitable that you have to abandon the initial plan in favor of a new one. If this occurs, revisit your initial estimate to determine how to compensate for the newly-revised plan.

, Phased implementation involves completing a task over a long period of time in which the discrete substeps or different parts of a task are completed in a linear way. Each stage of the task, once completed, enables forward motion toward the next stage of the task. This is especially useful in situations in which you’ll be producing or installing an identical system or product over and over again.For instance, suppose your task is to install a new operating system on all ten computers in your office. After each installation, you’ll have another data point you can use to develop a more accurate estimate of how long it will take until the entire office has the new operating system.

, To more accurately estimate the time needed for a given task, you must practice it repeatedly and track exactly how much time you’re actually doing it. The best way to track the time needed for tasks is to split them up into substeps, then accurately track each substep. With an ongoing data collection system, you’ll be able to develop ever-more accurate estimates for time needed to complete tasks.Keep the data for tasks you expect to need an accurate estimate for again in the future., Depending on the task you’re trying to develop a time estimate for, you could use apps to track the time needed to complete it. There are apps available to track time, though you might be content to simply use a spreadsheet or pen and paper to track your time on a given task.For instance, if you’re trying to track how long it takes you to run two miles and bike two miles, you could use a FitBit or similar fitness tracker, or an app like MobileTrack. Work-related time-tracking apps include Eon, Slips, Clockwork, and Punch.
If you’re doing a more manual task, you could bust out a pen and pad of paper. Write each task you’re trying to get a more accurate estimate for in one column and the time it took to complete the task next to it.
For instance, if you’re trying to get a more accurate estimate for how long it takes you to get out of the house each day, you might write a list that reads, “Get dressed – 4 minutes; Brush teeth – 3 minutes; Eat breakfast – 10 minutes,” and so on. Repeat daily, and average the task totals at the end of each day.

"
"
Acknowledge negative outcomes.,
Attend to special conditions.,
Assign an accuracy rating to your estimate.",How to More Accurately Estimate the Time Needed for Tasks3," When drawing on your own experience (or even that of others), it is important not to exclude occasions when a particular task took an excessive or embarrassing length of time. If you had several negative outcomes (for instance, you previously accomplished a similar or identical task over a period greater than that which you wish to accomplish your present task), factor it into your estimation process. Never discount prior results simply because you are dissatisfied with them. This could cause you to underestimate or overestimate the time needed for tasks., If there are mitigating factors that could impinge on your ability to estimate the time needed for tasks, include them in your estimation process. For instance, if you know that you are a procrastinator, or if you have multiple tasks ahead of the new task you’re developing an estimate for, include those factors in your estimation process. Doing so will help you yield a more accurate final estimate for a given task., Developing a more accurate estimate of the time needed for a given task does not require that your estimate be completely accurate. Use your familiarity with the task at hand as well as all relevant mitigating factors to assign the estimate an accuracy rating.For instance, you might say, “I am 75% certain I can complete this in a week.”If you wish, you could follow up with a more pessimistic estimate by saying something like “I am 100% certain I could finish this in two weeks.”
Communicating your level of confidence in your estimate is especially important if you are developing a task completion estimate for someone else.

Choose a medium.,
Invest in a nice pen.,
Start a new notebook.,
Find a place to write.,
Meditate before you begin.,
List your thoughts.,
Freewrite whatever is on your mind.,
Write about your fears.,
Try writing responses to your thoughts.,
Allow yourself to get emotional.,
Make writing a daily practice.,
Log your tension and anxiety.,
Learn from your writing.",How to Write for Relaxation," Whether you're new to writing or have been doing it for years, you'll need to choose a medium to work with. This largely boils down to a matter of taste and comfort. Some people prefer working with a computer, while others prefer the tactile experience of writing on a notebook page.;
, If you've chosen to write with a pen and paper, you may want to equip yourself with quality materials. While you don't need a fancy writing instrument to write, having a nice pen that you like may help you stay motivated and enjoy the writing process. There are many places to purchase a pen. You can start at your local art supply store, or search online for quality writing instruments.


Choose a fine-point pen if you have small, compact handwriting, or a medium- to broad-point pen if your handwriting tends to be bigger and made with quicker strokes.Consider the price when purchasing a nice pen. Some fountain pens can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, while cheaper alternatives can usually be found online or in other stores., If you're trying to begin a practice of writing for relaxation and you're intent on using a pen and paper, you may want to start with a clean, unused notebook. This gives you greater freedom over what you write, how you write, and where you write it.


A portable pocket notebook can make it easy to write on the go. However, if you carry a purse or backpack with you most places, any size notebook should fit in there.
Consider investing in a high-quality notebook. Much like a nice pen, a good notebook can help cement writing as a regular ritual.

, You can write from home if you're comfortable doing so. However, many writers find themselves feeling trapped or uninspired at home. For this reason, you may want to consider finding a regular writing location, whether it's inside your home or out around town.


If you feel comfortable and productive writing at home, then you may prefer staying in (many writers do). Find what makes you comfortable and productive, then make it part of your routine.Libraries and coffee shops are common places for writers to work. Libraries offer inspiration, while coffee shops keep you caffeinated and engaged.A location with a view may be inspiring, although windows that look out onto a street may end up being a distraction.

, You probably didn't meditate in school before a writing assignment, but meditation and art go hand-in-hand. Meditating before you begin to write can help you calm your mind, clarify your thoughts, and focus your attention on the task at hand.Sit in your chair with your arms on your legs, palms up. Close your eyes and focus on your breath.
Identify the place or places where you carry your tension. These sites are often plagued by pain, stiffness, or ""knots"" in the muscle.
Visualize the tension leaving your body, either melting off your skin or being ejected with your exhaled breath.
Do this for as long as you need before you get started. If you're short on time, limit your meditation to just a few moments.

, An easy way to get started at writing for relaxation is to make a simple list. If you're experiencing anxiety or a panic attack, you may have a jumble of thoughts bouncing around inside your head. Listing those thoughts on paper can help you make sense of what you're feeling and may help assuage some of your anxiety.Start with whatever thought is most clear in your mind. Then continue listing thoughts as they arise and become clear to you.
If you're too anxious or upset to have clear, coherent thoughts, you can simply list whatever emotions you're feeling. If those are also unclear, try listing things in your immediate environment until you're able to process your feelings or thoughts.

, Freewriting is a common strategy in writing, usually used by writers to get ideas flowing. However, another great way to utilize freewriting is to write continuously about anything that happens to be on your mind. This can help you gain some clarity on what you're feeling and why you feel that way.Start by writing a topic at the top of your page. For example, if you're feeling anxious, you might write ""Why I'm feeling anxious right now"" at the top of the page.
Set a timer for a set amount of time. If you're new to freewriting it may be easier to start with 5 minutes, but if you're comfortable with the process aim for 10 or 15 minutes.
Write continuously until the timer goes off. Do not stop to collect your thoughts, rephrase, or revise anything - your pen (or your fingers on the keyboard) should be moving nonstop.
Try to keep your writing focused on the topic you gave yourself (for example, feeling anxious). However, if you run out of things to say and the timer hasn't gone off, write whatever words come to mind until you get back on track.
Don't censor anything you write and don't criticize your work. The goal is to simply write nonstop without evaluating anything you produce.

, If freewriting is too unstructured for you, you might have better luck writing within a specific framework. One structured way to write for relaxation is to write about your specific fears, concerns, and sources of stress.Start by identifying the absolute worst-case scenario you can imagine your fears or problems leading to.
Write in great detail about the problem as you're currently encountering it, then work your way to graphically describing the worst possible outcome(s) you identified earlier.
Make sure your writing is vivid and full of imagery. This will help bring your writing to life.
Spend about 30 minutes writing about your fears, then try to choose a natural ending point (perhaps the end result of your fears coming true).
As you continue your practice, try to move past simply writing about the stress/fear you're experiencing. Dig deeper and try to find some clarity on your fear and anxiety by analyzing your thoughts and feelings on the page.

, Another method of writing for relaxation involves a call-and-response style of composition. In this method, you will write out whatever is on your mind that's causing you stress or anxiety, then collect your thoughts and write a positive, supportive response to yourself.Write out the thoughts or feelings that are most vividly on your mind. These may be fears, concerns, things happening in your environment, or your impression of yourself at a given moment.
Try to be as specific and clear as possible in your writing. For example, instead of writing ""I'm a loser and a failure,"" narrow it down to something like, ""I feel like a failure when I don't meet my weekly goals at work.""
Set your notebook aside and meditate for a few moments. You may even want to set your notebook aside for a longer period of time if you're having a hard time disengaging from your anxiety.
When you're ready, write a response to your previous entry or entries, challenging yourself to say something positive about yourself or your situation.
For example, if you wrote about not meeting your weekly goals at work, a good response might be, ""I'm trying hard and the workload has been increasing. I may struggle to meet my goals, but I know I'm trying my best and doing as well as my coworkers.""

, There's a chance that you won't experience any uncomfortable emotions while you write. However, you may end up feeling some degree of anxiety or discomfort while writing. This is normal, and ultimately it will pass. The point is to confront your fears by unraveling the worst possible scenarios that are causing your tension and/or anxiety.It's normal to feel an emotional reaction while writing about something that upsets you. Keep going and know that you're on the right track.

, Writing for relaxation can be done as a one-time event. However, you'll get more out of the practice and make greater progress working through your doubts and anxieties if you're able to practice every day.Aim to spend about 30 minutes each day for two weeks writing about your fears and anxiety. You should begin to see a reduction in your anxiety and stress levels.
Review your writing on a regular basis. You can do this every day before you begin, or on a weekly basis.
Look for patterns in your writing, your situation, your environment, and your thoughts/feelings.

, The benefit of writing every day is that you have a greater collection of logged emotions and experiences to review. This can help you track your stress, fear, or anxiety over time. It can also help you see how effective your writing practice has been.Record the date and time that you begin each writing session.
Next to the time, rate your level of stress, tension, or anxiety on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being completely carefree and 10 being the most anxious you've ever been.
When you're finished, be sure you complete the log by marking the time you ended your writing session and your level of stress/tension/anxiety at that time.

, Over time, you will begin to gain some clarity and insight on your fears and anxieties. This may come from an individual breakthrough while writing, or it may be the result of revisiting your writing over a period of weeks or months. If you think you're approaching some type of breakthrough on your problems, keep at it and try to dig even deeper.Don't be afraid to write with greater detail and focus on the thing or things that cause you the most trouble.
If possible, try to confront the things that upset you. This doesn't necessarily mean confronting people, but just exposing yourself in small increments to the places or things that cause you stress.
Conversely, depending on your personality and your feelings, you may want to avoid those stressors altogether. Understanding what triggers your anxiety can help you avoid those places or situations in the future.

Only understanding can wake you up from “reality”; only deep insight into this 3D dream can wake you up from it.,
Be as a witness, be the witness of all phenomena and sensation.,
Don’t take it too seriously.,
Master attention.,
Stay as I am.,
You are not what you see.,
Nothing to do.","How to Wake up from ""Reality"""," If you gather knowledge as information you will not receive the understanding. Without learning and collecting of information, understanding easily comes. For direct experience wisdom and understanding are paths not information gathering. When you are trying to tell something from the past with effort you probably talk from collected information, and if you talk effortlessly this is usually wisdom talking. Stop trying to impress someone with your knowledge, wake up them from your understanding and insight.


For recognition “reality” as another high quality dream few deep insights will give you unbreakable sense. It isn’t important to read about this insight it is important to sense them. Understanding will lead you to that.;
, Thoughts and emotions are not you there are happening in your presence and you can be the witness of them. Thoughts come in many different shapes with constant try to influence and you have the possibility to be a witness of this thought influence and not under it. Emotions are based on thoughts and also can be witnessed by you. Emotions can come in any form and you always have the possibility to be aware of them. There are many ideas and concepts consist of thoughts with constant influence but you can be witness in these situations also. You can be aware of all phenomena and you can be free of all influence. You can easily be what you already are. You already have the power to overcome all phenomena and sensation of this world, of this dream.


Overcoming thoughts are usually a few year's process. It is good to understand the suggestive power of thoughts and if you don’t react with thinkers thought this illusive power will disappear. The thought process is possible only if you have thought the reaction to the suggestive initial thought. When you don’t react with attention and thinking thought process is stopped.
For the realization that emotions are believes projection understanding is what you need. When you realize that emotions are not your emotions, and if you don’t think about them, emotions will vanish. When you conquer fear all other emotions will be conquered very soon. The only way is not to react in fear and to continue to work whatever you work. Emotions like thoughts have only suggestive power, and if you don’t give attention on it, they lose power.

, This is just a dream, just a game. When you invest too much in a dream you surely think it is important. In reality it is nothing, nothing important, because all will be soon over. In your childhood days games were for playing only and you don’t take winning or losing too seriously. If you win it is ok, if you lose it is ok too, and when the game is boring you change it. When you bodily and psychologically grow up life become important to you as you think that all is too real. Everything is same, only adult games are different than child games. Everyone who what to play must know the rules, but like when you are a child you can choose a game or make your own.


When you are beyond worldly games you are beyond “dream reality” also. If you give attention to dream he will grow, and when you don’t put your interest and attention in dream he will lose power over you.
Sometimes you think that something is, but this is assumption and in reality nothing is. There is nothing to really worry about, there is nothing important. If you do your best, if you do what you can this is good. Almost all our assumption is false and there is nothing to worry about. Life is very simple, only thought complicate it. When you overcome the thought everything is simple and easy, nothing is too serious.

, Attention is one of very important tools you have and you can master using of this tool. First of all you are not attention; you are only user of attention. You can be witness of attention moving and when you are witnessing all your power come back to you. You need to reclaim your power over attention and also to be a witness of this process. In temporary consciousness you are reclaiming power over attention, and in larger consciousness this is just a witnessed phenomenon.


When you sense attention moving stay in a witnessing position and don’t add your interest to this phenomenon. When you sense any process in consciousness like harmony or disturbance don’t react with attention on them, just let it happen. Put all of your attention in your present state, in your feeling that you exist.
You can sense body, you can sense that you are and stay with it. If your attention is distracted don’t worry about it, there is something deeper in you aware of that phenomena. All distraction is witnessed things, you can only keep your attention on I am feeling. When attention is on your natural sense of being, deep understandings come.

, Put your attention on the present sense of existence. Just feel that you are alive and try to be aware of that state. In beginning stay in this I am feeling for 5-10.minutes and after few days try to do it a few times in a day. Always keep your attention on this natural feeling and whatever you sense not to give it attention. If you for example sense a thought do not think about it just let it pass. If you sense strong emotion don’t give it power with your attention and soon all emotion will pass. Stay only as I am. You can sense consciousness also; you can sense consciousness of other known or unknown people but do not interpret it.


Whatever comes to you can be overpowered, if you stay as I am only and don’t give attention. All phenomena of this and all other worlds can be overpowered by this.

, Whatever you witnessed is not you. Maybe you forget what you are but you can slowly or quickly witness what you are not. When you witness thoughts or thought concepts you are not what is witnessed. When you witness something in the world or all worlds at once you are not a world. In the position of witness world is witnessed, the dream is witnessed.


The power of question can help you after this realization. Ask yourself who am I, Who is a witness or who can witness the witness? Do not rush to accept the answers given by mind, you can be witness of these answers like you witnessed your thoughts. When thought has conquered the world loose power over you the dream is just a dream and dreamer can’t be found.
When you see the “I” thought do not give it any attention and after a while this most potent thought will lose all power over you. Remember dream can exist only with dreamer, but without a dreamer's dream will vanish.

, When you try to wake up from a dream, there are you in this process. There is a doer with goal and when you don’t try to do anything everything easily comes. This is natural process like you wake up from ordinary dream; there is a time of dream and a time to wake up. If don’t take it too seriously and don’t give attention on trying anything, process will spontaneously happen.


Process of wake up will happen and you will not be in it. Awareness and part of awareness will be one. If you disappear and fear appears you, don’t give too much attention on this phenomenon. Act without acting and do without doing, think without thinking and continue without a sense of continuing.

However, it can also be an effective treatment for many other problems. You may benefit from DBT if you have any of the following symptoms:Emotional instability including bursts of anger, anxiety, depression, or hostility
Suicidal thoughts and behaviors such as self-injury
Risky or impulsive behaviors such as overspending, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, or legal troubles
A sense of worthlessness and insecurity, or an acute sensitivity to rejection
Social isolation and/or impaired social relationships;
, DBT programs are often intensive and take many weeks or months to complete the whole program. They are designed to give you the skills and support so that recurring feelings of mood swings, suicidal thoughts, and impulsive tendencies are reduced. Think about the following as you decide to undergo DBT:


Your commitment. DBT is intensive therapy that could be one or more weekly sessions with a therapist or skills group.
Your schedule. Find programs that are available when you are. Many of them take place in the evenings after school or work.
Your budget. Identify programs that may be in your health insurance network. Find out if there are other programs out there for reduced fees.
Connect with mental health support groups via the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Find support through your local NAMI Chapter: https://www.nami.org/Find-Support. You can also contact the NAMI Helpline at 800-950-NAMI.

, Undergoing dialectical behavior therapy is done under the supervision and guidance of a trained mental health professional. To determine if you may benefit from this therapy, get in touch with a local behavioral health center or counselor.Even if the first counseling center you contact does not offer DBT, they can likely point you in the right direction. They may also know of the best outpatient and inpatient programs that can best serve your needs.
If you’re a student, reach out to your counseling center through college, or your high school counselor.
If you’re working and have health insurance, consider finding a counselor that takes your insurance. Your health care provider will likely have a list of mental health professionals in their network. They may be able to assist you, or can make a referral to another appropriate resource.
If you are planning to do private pay, there may be sliding scale fee options available to make counseling more affordable. Search online for mental health service providers in your area for next steps about low-cost options available.

, One-on-one therapy can help you to focus on your specific needs and concerns. The therapeutic process is one of self-discovery. In conjunction with a trained therapist, you can focus on your strengths and how to navigate your emotions.If you are in a DBT program, you may meet once or twice a week for individual therapy. In some cases, intensive inpatient programs may have daily therapy sessions.
The focus of the therapy session is to delve into your personal goals and challenges.
If you are already seeing a therapist before starting DBT, you could consider continuing with your current therapist, while participating in a separate DBT skills group.

, In a group setting, you have an opportunity to learn from others’ experiences as well as develop further interpersonal skills. The skills group can operate in some ways like a class or seminar, in which new coping skills and topics are introduced over the course of the program and homework is assigned.You need to make a commitment that you’ll attend the group over a three or four-month period, or about 12 to 16 weeks.
Groups are about 90 minutes long and are held usually once or twice a week. The groups are often available at various times of the day, particularly in the evenings to accommodate school or work schedules.
The groups are small, usually about 5-8 group members, to foster stronger connections among group members.
The skills you'll learn include things like interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and mindfulness.

, One aspect of DBT therapy is the opportunity to stay connected to your therapist and treatment team outside of the individual and group therapy sessions. This is to help you during difficult or stressful times when you’re away from your group or therapist.See this is an added support, but understand that your therapist or treatment team is not expected to be available 24/7 as part of the program usually.
Calls can help to alleviate stress or anxiety between sessions if you are concerned about something that needs to be addressed before the next therapy meeting.
For example, maybe you are having thoughts of self-harm, but have not made an attempt. Reach out to your treatment team for support and call them. Or perhaps you had a big fight with your parents or your partner, and feel like you can't handle it alone. Reach out to your treatment team by phone.

, Like being a student, homework helps to solidify the skills and knowledge you’re gaining from your individual and group therapy sessions. Over the course of a DBT program, you may have assignments that include the following:Journal writing. This could include a daily log of your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
Writing assignments. These could vary from responding to a person in a stressful situation to effectively naming emotions.
Behavior assignments. These could include exercises like observing your breath or using mindful distractions to manage urges.

, By being able to recognize and label your emotions, this therapy program helps you to reduce outbursts of anger and heightened anxiety. It focuses on adjusting those emotions through self-awareness and self-acceptance.DBT helps to take the focus away from emotions as being good or bad. Instead, they simply exist. It is less helpful to judge them.
Therapy helps to teach you that when a strong emotion comes, you don’t have to act on those feelings. You can simply recognize and feel it.
You might be having difficulties with classmates at school or with co-workers about a team project. You may feel upset and anxious to the point that you want to yell. By acknowledging and recognizing these feelings, you can feel more in control of your emotions rather than overwhelmed and upset with yourself.

, Learning distress tolerance means you can better handle and redirect emotions that feel overwhelming or unbearable. If you feel easily upset or anxious about a situation or person, you may have low tolerance for distress. This therapeutic approach helps to build the following skills:Self-soothing. For example, let's say that you are stressed about a recent upsetting conversation with your family. You could engage in self-soothing by listening to music or drawing.
Distracting
Improving the moment
Focusing on both the pros and the cons. Maybe you feel anxious about going to a party with some friends. Maybe there are some other guests who you're worried about seeing. Think about the pros and cons of going or not going.

, There are many different approaches and exercises that can help with mindfulness both as part of DBT and with other therapeutic approaches. Mindfulness is about slowing down and paying attention to the small things that often go unnoticed or unappreciated. Here are a few examples of exercises used in DBT programs:Engage in deep breathing or meditation. Instead of focusing on your thoughts, you are paying close attention to your breath. You slowly inhale and exhale for several minutes. You notice the tension in your shoulders, arms, and back, and learn to slowly release that tension. Your racing or overwhelming thoughts are instead focused inside on your mind and breath.
Do a mindful eating exercise. This helps you to eat intentionally and focus on each bite. Your focused attention helps to cultivate satisfaction in the smallest things. You could use a piece of fruit that’s been cut up into pieces such as an orange or apple for example.
Observe a leaf. Pick up a leaf from a tree for example. Notice the textures, colors, and shapes. Instead of judging the leaf as good or bad, beautiful or ugly, you are simply observing and accepting the leaf for what it is. Do this for several minutes.

Keep a time log.,
Organize for efficiency.,
Figure out if you’re a multitasker or unitasker.,
Plan ahead.,
Post schedules and assignments.",How to Manage Your Time As a Parent1," You can’t create more time out of thin air, so you need to find ways to maximize the use of the time you do have. Taking a week or so to jot down how you currently spend your time offers a good starting point for making changes. You may be surprised at the amount of time you spend on less important things, or immediately notice ways to improve your time management.Use a notebook and pencil or the electronic device of your choice to keep tabs on how much time you spend each day on things like job-related activities, housework, food prep/eating/cleanup, playing with the kids, and so on. Keep track for a week or more so that you can spot trends and establish averages.
Use this data as a baseline for how you utilize your time now, and to begin brainstorming ways in which you can reshuffle your daily time management to best suit your role as a parent.;
, You may have heard the old saying, “A place for everything, and everything in its place.” Having kids means constantly battling against messes and disorganization. However, by keeping maximum efficiency in mind when determining where things ought to go, you can reduce the time it takes both to put things back in place and to use those things as needed.Create a “ready to go” station near the door you use most often. Keep your keys, wallet, work items, and other such items you take with you often close by. If you have small children, keep the diaper bag stocked and ready to go.
Set up an area for the kids’ school and play things as well. Try to give each child a distinctive space, like a shelf or cubby, that can perhaps be labeled or personalized.
Organizing and filing paperwork efficiently is also very helpful, especially if your kids are in school. Create a filing system for bills, other mail, school papers, and so forth that is quick and easy for you to use. Ten seconds filing a permission slip now may save you ten minutes later.

, Many people assume that parenting means multitasking — helping with homework while preparing dinner, going through work emails, and throwing out ideas for you kid’s birthday party, for instance. Sometimes multitasking is unavoidable as a parent, but some people are more naturally adept at it than others. For those others, focusing on a single task at a time whenever possible will increase efficiency and probably reduce stress.Check out Multitask More Effectively for guidance on setting goals, juggling different tasks, and managing your time while doing so.
Whether you’re a natural multitasker or unitasker, though, try to focus just on your kid(s) when spending time with them. Don’t read a book to them while checking your phone, for instance. It’s good for their development, and good for your mental health, to put everything aside and just play every so often., Maybe you scoff at the notion of your ever becoming the “supermom” (or “dad”) type who devises and shops for the family menu a week in advance, or who has the next six weeks’ worth of school activities, family gatherings, and all the rest plotted out like some sort of battle plan. But even if planning ahead isn’t your strong suit, making the effort to plan for recurring activities and responsibilities can become a time-saving habit.The weekly menu planning really can save time, if it means you only have to go to the grocery store once and don’t have to spend time each day thinking about “OK, what do we have, and what can I make out of it?” Be realistic of course — you don’t have to be planning out gourmet meals each night. A slow cooker can be a parent’s best friend, and take-out menus (offering relatively healthy options) need not be a source of shame. And who says you can’t set aside a “breakfast for dinner” night each week?, Visual reminders tend to work better for kids, and they can help you out as well. Create an “information station” in a conspicuous, high-traffic area of your home. Post a calendar, a list of chores/assignments/activities, a progress sheet that lets your kids see what they’ve done (and what they still need to do), and so on.Especially if you have multiple kids, use color-coding or different stickers to identify each kid’s responsibilities, activities, and progress. For instance, a “chore chart” that uses stickers to identify progress toward a small weekly reward can foster your child’s sense of ownership of their responsibilities, pride in their accomplishments, and some healthy competition with their sibling(s).
While you many not decide to use stickers or colorful markers, post your calendar, assignments, and progress as well. When you’re a harried parent, little reminders are good, but big reminders are even better.

Always make sure that you leave any online activities out of your list until you have completed your IRL (in real life) activities.;
, Create a list of the top 5 sites you visit on a regular basis. You can also make a list of the most important websites, for example email, any social networking, etc. that you go to. Are message boards more important than Facebook? Ask yourself these kinds of questions.

, Think about what you need to do on each site. Needs should come before wants, or else you may find yourself on one site longer than you think.

Set Goals you can Achieve.,
Prioritise your Goals.,
Be productive but not busy.,
Handle any time wasters.,
Rewards System.",How to Manage Time and Prioritise Work," You need to be able to break the day’s tasks into achievable targets that give you a clear sense of purpose. Keep the bigger picture in mind, i.e. what are you working to achieve? Have this goal as a clear vision, and use it to keep you focused on the work at hand.;
, Decide early on what the most valuable use of your time is. Evaluate how important each task is to you by weighing up their urgency against their value. If there any deadlines looming then be sure to focus on these first. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to complete each task so you don’t feel pressured or rushed when carrying them out. This means completing work with deadlines well in advance, so you have plenty of time to check over the task and make sure everything’s up to standard.

, Deciding on what’s most important to do should reduce the amount of time you are spending juggling tasks that keep you busy, and streamline your productivity. There’s nothing worse than having a day where you are so busy that nothing gets done properly, if at all. Ranking the tasks and completing them in order of importance should reduce this panicky feeling of being busy all the time, and instead allow you to be as productive as possible within the given time-frame.

, There’s nothing worse than trying to complete work and being distracted by something, especially if it’s someone else that’s distracting you. If your working environment is too loud, then try moving to a calmer more productive space, or if that’s not possible, try putting in earphones. Other people’s interruptions shouldn't be an excuse for you not completing your tasks. Let the people around you know what you need to do, and how you intend to do it, so that they won’t bother you until you’re done.

, Telling someone to stop bothering you is easy when compared to stopping yourself from getting distracted by your own bad habits. This is where your will power really comes in to play. It’s healthy to take a break from your work every few hours, but constantly checking social networks or making yourself a drink every half hour can be destructive to your work flow. Recognise what is useful to you and what’s nonconstructive; if you don’t need the internet for your task at hand then there’s no need for you to use it.

Give everyone a job.,
Don’t overdo kids’ activities.,
Use mornings or nights to your advantage.,
Use your personal days and vacation time.,
Look into work flexibility.",How to Manage Your Time As a Parent2," As a working parent, you may think you ought to be able to come home from a day at the office and still manage to prepare dinner, fold the laundry, help with homework, clean up a bit, have a bit of fun with the kids, get everyone off to bed in time, and look over a few work emails for tomorrow. Remember, however, that while you can be a super parent, you aren’t superhuman. Don’t expect or try to pull the entire weight of work and parenting alone.Assign defined chores and tasks to your kids. Let them set the table, take out the trash, tidy up their own rooms, and so on. Encourage a healthy amount of independence in your kids, and reward quality efforts while not expecting miracles.If you have a spouse or significant other who you feel isn’t shouldering a sufficient load, broach the subject tactfully but clearly: “I know you work really hard and I appreciate the things you do around here, but I’m really struggling to keep up with the house and kids. I’d like to set up a more organized system to help us all get things done more efficiently.”

, Shuttling one or more kids to multiple school-related and extracurricular activities can drain a lot of time and energy, especially after a long workday. You want to support your kids’ interests and encourage them to be active and involved, but you also need to accept the reality that there is only so much time in each day.Prioritize and place limits upon your kids’ after-school activities. Encourage them to focus on their true passions, and say “I’m sorry, but you have to choose one or the other” when necessary. Factor in their interest level and practical concerns like event schedules and travel times.
You might feel bad saying “no,” but remember that teaching your kids to prioritize their time and energy is a valuable life lesson.

, You are probably either a “morning person” or a “night owl” naturally, although as a parent you may need to be both. While it is essential that you take time to relax a little and get enough sleep, use times of relative household tranquility to also get work done with limited distractions.Unless you truly are a creature of the night who catches a second (or third) wind after a day on the job and an evening with the kids, your best bet is probably to go to bed a bit earlier at night and wake up earlier in the morning. Use the half or full hour you can scrape together to prepare for the day ahead and catch up on things left over from yesterday.

, When you’re a busy working parent, fight the urge to stockpile a large supply of time off “just in case.” Might you wish you had that time eventually? Maybe. Do you need a little breather here and there when managing a job and a family? Definitely.There is nothing wrong with using some of your time off to catch up on housework, of course. However, use as much of your time off as you can to relax a little and enjoy some time with your kids. When you’re on vacation, actually go on vacation.
Don’t feel guilty about taking a little vacation from parenting, either. Have you parents or a trusted friend watch the kids for a weekend.

, Priorities change when you become a parent, and so does the time you have available each day. Some people take that to mean that you have to choose between “work” or “family” as a working parent, while others believe there are ways to maintain an effective balance. Only you can determine what works best in your situation, but look into options for greater workplace flexibility as one possibility.A lot depends upon your field of employment, but many employers have become more amenable to alternatives to the “nine to five” arrangement. Talk to your employer about possibly working from home a day or two per week, or creating a more flexible weekly schedule.
If it is feasible for you and you determine that it is in your family’s best interest, consider reducing your hours or even seeking different employment. This can be a worrisome prospect, but taking risks and making compromises are also parts of parenting.

Accept help.,
Do some “outsourcing.” Sure, maybe you’ve heard the story about how your great-grandmother raised six kids in a little shack, gathered eggs and made bread every morning, put a hearty meal on the table each evening, and so on.,
Let things go.,
Set aside “you” time.",How to Manage Your Time As a Parent3," Even if you had a “supermom” as a parent, she didn’t do it all alone, all the time. (The same holds true for the “super dad's ” out there, of course.) Every parent needs some help, and there is no shame in accepting it when offered, or requesting it when needed.If your parents or in-laws, sibling, or reliable cousin or friend wants to watch the kids for an afternoon, accept graciously. You’re not abdicating your responsibility; you’re being a smart parent — and probably making them happy.
Alternatively, if someone close to you offers to help with tasks around the house, shopping, etc. while you focus on the kids, say “yes” as well. People like helping others, and people who know what it’s like to raise kids are likely to be particularly willing to lend a hand.

, But was she working sixty hours a week in a cubicle? Whatever work you do, in or out of the home, you shouldn’t feel inadequate about selectively paying others to help out with certain tasks.Pay someone to come and clean the house every other week, or take care of the yard, so you can focus on other tasks. Or pay for a babysitter or extended daycare once or twice a week, if your budget allows., In the best case scenario, you’ll take care of household chores and other work bit by bit — for instance, doing smaller amounts of laundry multiple times per week — so you can stay “ahead of the game.” However, there will inevitably come times when the dirty clothes or dishes will pile up, the grass will grow a bit long, or the toys will remain strewn across the living room. It’s OK; it happens. Leave it for tomorrow when you just need a little break.Yes, giant messes left for days cost more time (and sanity) to take care of than smaller messes you keep up with daily. At the same time, though, remember that your home doesn’t need to look like it’s ready for a magazine shoot every morning.

, Becoming a parent changes who you are, but it doesn’t negate your individual identity or needs. If you consistently ignore your own needs and interests, you’ll become more stressed, more unhappy, and less effective as a parent. Pencil in some time to engage in hobbies or activities that interest you, or just to relax and clear your head.If you’re in a relationship, schedule regular date nights with your partner.And, while it may not seem so romantic to schedule late-night physical encounters, don’t let the hustle and bustle of having kids completely dry up your sex life. Just take the proper precautions if you want to avoid having any more kids!

Do your research.,
Create a timeline of your life.,
Look for themes in your life story.,
Plot out your life story.,
Polish the draft.",How to Tell Your Life Story1," To tell your life story effectively, start by doing your research so you can get the details of the story right. You may interview family members, friends, and other people who were present during certain periods of your life. You can also visit your old childhood home or your former schools as part of your research. Take notes as you do research so you can refer to them when you write your life story.You should also do research at your local library and online. You may look at articles and books to help you with your research.;
, You may start with your birth and work your way up to the present, noting important events or moments as you go. You may draw a straight line on a piece of paper and fill in the timeline that way. Or you may create a graph on a computer to create the timeline.Try to be detailed when you write the timeline. Note each age of your life as well as significant events or moments that happened during that time. For example, you may write, “Age 4, Mom and Dad divorced, I was obsessed with Mickey Mouse and watched a lot of television on our living room floor.”

, Another way to make your life story feel meaningful and impactful for a reader is to identify key themes in your life story. You may notice that a specific theme keeps appearing over and over again in key moments in your life. Or you may realize that you worked your way to a certain theme as you got older or aged. You can use the theme to help organize and structure your life story, giving it a deeper meaning.For example, you may have the theme “perseverance” in your life story. You may then write about key events or moments in your life that reflect the theme of perseverance.
Or you may realize that it took you several years to embrace the theme of “hard work.” You may then chart how you learned to embrace this theme through different moments in your life.

, To give your life story structure, create a plot outline. Having a plot outline can help you stay organized as you write your life story and make your life story engaging for a reader.


You can create a plot outline based on a more traditional plot structure, with exposition, an inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.
You can also use the snowflake method to create a plot outline, with a one sentence summary, a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.

, Once you have a draft of your life story, in whatever form it takes, you should polish and edit it until it is at its best. You may show your written life story to others for feedback, such as friends, family, or colleagues. You can also read your life story draft out loud to hear how it sounds on the page.


If you created a performance based life story, you may perform a rough version for friends, family or colleagues and ask them for feedback. You should revise your draft and improve it until you feel it is ready to share with the larger world.

Put together an autobiography.,
Write a memoir.,
Create a long form poem about your life.,
Write a personal essay.,
Hire a ghostwriter.",How to Tell Your Life Story2," Perhaps the most popular way of telling a life story is to write your autobiography. An autobiography is a genre of writing where you chronicle your life story. You may start your autobiography from your birth and work your way chronologically through your life story.


Many autobiographies are written in first person present tense or first person past tense. They usually cover the entire span of a life.
You can read examples of autobiographies to get a better sense of the genre. For example, you may check to see if your favorite celebrity has an autobiography out or search for an autobiography of a famous historical figure.

, You can also write a memoir as a way to tell your life story. Memoirs are different than autobiographies in that it focuses on particular moments in a life, rather than the entire span of a life. Often, memoirs cover a particular span of a person’s life, such as a dramatic event or a dramatic period.


You can write the memoir in first person or third person. They are usually written in past tense so you can reflect on a certain time period or event.
You can read examples of memoir to gain a better understanding of the genre, such as Running with Scissors by Augusten Burroughs, In the Wilderness by Kim Barnes, The Boys of My Youth by Jo Ann Beard, and Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt.

, If you would prefer to write poetry over prose, go for a long form poem that explores your life story. You can write an epic poem, which often spans many pages. Or you may write a series of shorter poems to chronicle your life story. You may use the same poetic form for the poems or play with different poems in each poem.


Try using the poetic form to reflect a certain period or event in your life story. For example, you may write in a more playful form, such as the limerick, for poems about your childhood. You may then write in the sonnet form to write about a great love of your life.

, Personal essay is another great way for you to write about your life story. With this form, you can focus on one specific moment, event, or theme that appears in your life story. The personal essay can be a good form to use if you enjoy writing non fiction or a more structured piece on your life story.


The personal essay contains an introductory section, a body section and a concluding section. You can then play with the form as you see fit and do not need to adhere to a five paragraph essay form.
You can read examples of the personal essay, such as “Shipping Out” by David Foster Wallace, “The White Album” by Joan Didion, and “We Do Abortions Here” by Sallie Tisdale.

, Ghostwriters are often hired to help someone write their story, such as their life story. Having a ghostwriter can be a good way to dive into your life story and have someone assist you in shaping your story. The ghostwriter can also help you choose a form for your life story so it is written in a way that is engaging and unique.

Make a spoken word performance.,
Create a play out of your life story.,
Adapt your life story into a screenplay.,
Share your life story in casual conversation.",How to Tell Your Life Story3," If you would prefer to share your life story in a life, storytelling format, write a spoken word poem. You may create spoken word poems about different periods of your life and then prepare them as a performance for an audience. Or you may create a long spoken word piece that covers key events or moments in your life.


You can watch spoken word performances online to help get a better sense of the genre, such as “If I should have a daughter…” by Sarah Kay, “My First Period” by Staceyann Chin, and “Can we auto-correct humanity?” by Prince Ea., Another way you can perform your life story for an audience is to create a play based on your life. Perhaps you write a one person show that focuses on stories from your life, which you can then perform on your own. Or maybe you create a play that explores your life with characters from your childhood or adulthood.


You could then arrange for the play to be performed at your local community center or film yourself performing it and then post it online.

, You can also share your life story by writing a screenplay based on your life. You may use a key event or moment in your life as inspiration for the screenplay, using characters from your life as the basis for the characters in your screenplay.


You could then use the screenplay to make a film based on your life. You may rent camera gear, located actors, and shoot the film yourself. Or you may hire a filmmaker to create the film based on your screenplay.

, If you are meeting someone new at a social gathering, you may want to share your life story in conversation with them. You should try to make your life story interesting, entertaining, and brief. This way, you can get the details of your life across and keep the conversation going. You may include a few funny details from your life story so the person is engaged in what you have to say.


For example, you may say, ""I was born in Miami, Florida in the 80s, and grew up right by the beach. It was a nice childhood except for that time I got stung by a jellyfish.""

Brainstorm some goals.,
Create attainable (SMART) goals.,
Determine the ways to attain your goals.,
Write down your goals.",How to Work Towards Your Perfect Life1," Setting goals can help you achieve more and improve your life.Try to think of a goal that will challenge you, but is still attainable. Think about things that make you happy, then create goals around those things.Think about short-term and long-term goals, and make them measurable.


Create goals for different areas of your life: career, romantic relationship, family, travel, fun, personal growth.
Goals can include traveling, going to college/grad school, making dietary changes such as going vegan, or learning an extreme sport, such as paragliding. Be creative! Think about the things that immediately put a smile on your face.
If you’ve always wanted to visit the Amazon jungle, set that goal! It doesn’t matter how “far off” the goal appears.;
, Make sure the goals you set can actually come true for you and are not so unrealistic that you can never reach them. Use the S.M.A.R.T. system to set goals that are attainable and motivating. If your goals are too out there (like ""I want to be the first human to live on Pluto""), you can actually experience a decrease in motivation and desire for improvement. To get the most out of your goals, they should fit these criteria :



Specific: Goals should be clear and as specific as possible, and answer these questions: who is involved, what do I want to accomplish, where must this be done, when should it be performed? So, instead of ""Get fit,"" your goal might be ""Lose 15 lbs. before my vacation to Hawaii.""

Measurable: You must be able to measure or quantify your goal with concrete criteria. This way you will be able to see your progress and you will know when you've met your goal. With the weight-loss goal of 15 lbs., you can track your progress pound by pound and, once you've lost those 15 lbs., you know you have achieved your goal.

Achievable/Attainable: Use your common sense to decide whether or not you can realistically meet this goal. It should require you to stretch yourself and make changes, but shouldn't be something wildly out of reach. Think about the skills and knowledge you have now and what you might need to learn in order to achieve your goal. Think about your past and whether the goal is simply a stretch or if it is unrealistic.

Relevant: Ask yourself why you want to achieve this goal, and if it will be fulfilling for you. Getting a law degree at Harvard might be achievable for you, but is this really what you want? If your passion lies with the culinary arts, maybe a better goal is to move to France for a year and learn to cook. Consider the other things going on in your life and whether they align with your goals.

Time bound: You must set an end point for your goal. It shouldn't be vague (like ""by this summer"") but a point that can be found on a calendar (""by June 15th""). Having a specific timeframe can give you a sense of urgency and motivate you to keep on track.

, Sometimes it’s not enough to just think about your goals. For each goal, write the steps you need to take in order to attain the goal. Think about ways to break down each goal into smaller, measurable parts.You want to set yourself up for success so you don’t find yourself discouraged that none of your goals are coming to fruition.


If your goal is to visit the Amazon jungle, your steps may include setting 5% of each paycheck aside to save up for the trip for 14 weeks, saving up vacation days, choosing the dates to go, and booking the flights and trip.
If your goal is to become a vegetarian, think about what steps you need to get there. You may create steps such as talking to other people who are vegetarians, looking at health/environment information, buying some cookbooks, cutting out red meat, and then cutting out all meat.

, Once you’ve thought through your goals and the steps you need to attain them, write them down! You want to make your goals memorable and meaningful so that you can realistically work toward them. You can write them on a piece of paper, or you can get creative and create a vision board. Make it interactive and get engaged with your goals. Make it colorful, and put some effort into it. You want to create something that excites you and motivates you.


Use magazine clippings or paint your goals. Use resources from the internet to help you create your board.

Avoid perfectionism.,
Realize that your version of a “perfect life” will continue to change.",How to Work Towards Your Perfect Life3," If you’re living within your comfort zone, know that there’s a lot of life you’re missing. Some indicators of living only within your comfort zone include feeling bored, restless, tired, dissatisfied, and lacking enthusiasm for life.The good news is that it doesn’t have to stay this way! Find ways to do things that feel uncomfortable. Do the things you’ve never done but always wanted to do. Think about what scares you, then go tackle it. Remember that you’ve already tackled many fears in your life, and that you are capable of tackling whatever is in front of you. Don’t let fear hold you back.


It’s hard to get over the fear of stepping out of what feels comfortable. Take some baby steps, start small and celebrate your successes. Get inspired by other people who have stepped out of their comfort zone and thrived, then know that you can do it, too!
Staying within your comfort zone in fear of embarrassment limits and deprives your life of the fun you can experience. Step out of it with courage and boldness; who cares what others think of you? Be yourself, and do what you want.
Check out How to Step Out of Your Comfort Zone for more tips.

, Mindfulness practices encourage being in the present moment and benefit your physical and mental health.Being mindful means engaging your senses and observing your thoughts without judgment. Feel the ground beneath you when you walk, listen to the sounds around you, taste each bite of food you eat, engage your sense of smell, and observe your surroundings with your eyes. Use your senses to the fullest instead of letting them run on autopilot. Then, practice mindfulness on your thoughts and emotions, consciously observing each without judgment.When you taste food, devote your thought processes to the food. Take a moment to smell the food, and notice how your body reacts to the smell. Then, put the food in your mouth, but don't chew yet. Observe the texture and the flavors. As you begin to chew, notice how it feels between your teeth and on your tongue.
Notice when you become distracted, and bring yourself back to the moment with your senses. Let your thoughts take a break and engage with your environment.

, It’s time for you to move the Thanksgiving turkey aside and get into the practice of giving thanks daily. Grateful people exhibit health and happiness benefits, such as sleeping better, having increased empathy and decreased aggression, improved self-esteem, and improved physical and psychological health.Begin and end each day by observing three things for which you are grateful. Connect with the feeling of gratitude, don’t list things you have. The less material your focus, the better. Be grateful for your friends, for the ability to walk to the market, and the feeling of the sun on your shoulders.

, Always look on the positive side of all situations, no matter what! Even if the situation seems entirely negative, there has got to be some positive in it, big or small. A good attitude will help you get through many of life’s difficulties. Having a positive outlook is associated with health and psychological benefits, such as lower rates of depression and distress and having a longer lifespan.When you notice negative thoughts, observe them, then choose to think of something positive. For instance, combat thoughts like, “I’ll mess this up; I’ve never done it before!” with “I am so proud of myself for giving myself the opportunity to try something new.”
If you’ve really embarrassed yourself and feel like your life is over, tell yourself, “Everything will pass and eventually blow over. Britney Spears shaved her head and had a public meltdown, and nobody seems to care about that anymore, so nothing will follow me forever.”

, Remember that what feels perfect lasts only moments. Don’t cheat yourself out of a happy life by trying to make it ""perfect,"" because an entirely perfect life is unattainable (and probably unenjoyable). Perfectionism can create unhappiness and an inability to celebrate your successes as not being “good enough.” Perfectionists can fall in a trap of having a fear of failure or a fear of taking risks.For example, if you’re trying to learn a new language, the best way to jump in is by speaking. It can be terrifying to speak a foreign language, but accept that you will make mistakes and learn from them. Improvement often requires risk, and it’s okay to make mistakes!
Recognize that even things that look like mistakes or failures can be learning experiences for growth. If you encounter setbacks, don't give up: tell yourself, ""Now I'm more aware of what doesn't work,"" and try something different.

, And that’s ok! When you are 30, your version of a perfect life may be living in a different country and learning a different culture; at 32 it may change and your perfect life may include adopting a baby. Don’t get too attached to what you thought your perfect life was, but be flexible and adaptable to it changing. Changes are part of the adventure.

Understand mental conditioning.,
Dissolve the ego.,
Surrender.",How to Surrender to the Present Moment1," The automatic mental resistance to situations or people or internal state(thoughts and emotions), is the greatest reason for human suffering and pain. It's the conditioned mind that resists what is and inflicts torture and suffering on yourself. Plus human mind is human mind, its very nature is to relay mostly pointless, repetitive thoughts as per the conditioning.


You may have this delusion that resisting to thoughts, reactions, undesirable situations and emotions, can neutralize or dissolve them. Otherwise who would offer futile resistance to life. In fact, resistance that mind creates is more disturbing than the original cause it's trying to dissolve. Resistance not only re-energizes the reactions and patterns but also keeps the undesirable situation in place. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more insight.
""Whenever you are unhappy, there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness “buys” you what you want. If ""you""- the mind- did not believe that unhappiness works, why would you create it?"" A Course in Miracles.
“The greatest difficulty is the mental resistance to things that arise, and the underlying assumption is that they should not” (Eckhart Tolle).;
, Ego is humanity's current state of consciousness. A conceptualized lens through which we see the world. It's the identification with thoughts (voice in your head) and emotions. Ego was a necessary stage in the evolution of consciousness but now to advance into the next stage, we must dissolve the ego. Its cause as per the current state of humanity, there is a sense of urgency i.e 'evolve or die'.Its cause sanity and insanity are rising at the same time. It is highly recommended that you read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more insight.

, Presence, the universal intelligence, can come into being only through enthusiasm, enjoyment and surrender. There are many 'negative', by conventional terms, things that happen in life and of course you cannot enjoy or be enthusiastic about them. It's precisely at these moments surrender needs to be practiced. So surrendering, or yielding internally to what is, is a simple but profound wisdom. Its because when you truly surrender to the present moment then a greater intelligence is in charge and only through surrender you have access to it.


Don't misinterpret 'surrender' as giving in. Surrender is purely an internal phenomenon.It means to offer no 'inner resistance' to the flow of life within you, without any judgments or reservations.
What's the flow of life within you? The thoughts and emotions that arise in response to anything at this moment. Allow them, let them be and let them go. This doesn't mean you can't take action. Surrender is perfectly compatible with action.In fact, surrendered action is infinitely more powerful as its in alignment with universal intelligence.
Surrender happens naturally when you truly see that your thoughts and emotions are automatic and resistance is futile. You just need to surrender to the tiny segment called the 'now' and not the situation. As past and future are no more than thoughts that arise in the now.
Use the suffering, at this moment, as an opportunity to surrender. Then you will see how this suffering transmutes into presence, like alchemy. We are not talking about presence in abstract terms. If you truly surrender, you will feel an aliveness, a transcendence within yourself. This aliveness is always present in us, but heavily disguisedby mental noise and emotions. Only through surrender you can transmute and transcend this resisting static.
If you can't surrender then bring surrender to your non-surrender. Accept that you cannot accept. ""The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your non-peace transforms into peace. Anything you accept fully will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender"" (Eckhart Tolle).

Make present moment your best friend.,
Become one with life.,
Observe that ego is very clever and short-sighted.,
Go deeper into your pain.,
Just watch the 'why'.",How to Surrender to the Present Moment2," On the surface, each day of your life appears to consist of thousands of moments where different things happen.Yet if you look more deeply, is there not only one moment, ever? Is life ever not this moment? This one moment, now, is the only thing you can never escape from. The one constant factor in your life. No matter what happens. No matter how much your life changes. One thing is certain. Its always now. Since there is no escape from the now, why not welcome it, become friendly with it.


Regardless of the form of the present; doesn't matter how bad it looks, like some illness, disastrous life situation, torturous job etc. What is the problem with this moment? You are reading 'this' now. Your problems are no more than psychological burden of past and future. Read Know Your True Self to learn more.

, When you are one with life then everything around you becomes friendly because you are in alignment with it; so become one with the greater whole by allowing the flow of life within and with-out. That's when creative and intelligent action in response to your problems arise, from deep with in you.This action is in alignment with the totality of the universe. For example, if you have a torturous job, you might find yourself walking out of there or you might find yourself in a state of acceptance. Either way you would be at peace. Read Know Your True Self for more depth.

, The deeper you go into the now, the more and more thoughts and emotions will come as if they must be dealt with immediately. As for ego, present moment is the greatest enemy because it gets most of its food from past and future. As it thinks dwelling on past and future will somehow dissolve the pain, which is delusional and short-sighted. Plus, to ego mental noise is 'familiar', despite how dysfunctional it is. That's why it is often seen people stuck in dysfunctional relationships with no apparent intention of getting out. Its cause doesn't matter how dysfunctional it is, at least its familiar. This is one of the reasons ego dislikes or ignores the present moment because it adheres to the known, and unknown(the now), to ego, is dangerous.


The moment you missed the present moment, thoughts will take you over. So an intense alertness is needed. Use these thoughts as a cue to go deeper into the now. For example, when you catch yourself lost in thinking, become more aware of the present moment 'anchors' like your inner body, breathing, sense perceptions, etc.
Alternatively, you can be there as a witnessing presence in the background by letting the automatic thoughts(hypnotic voice in your head) and emotions come and go.Awareness also helps to gather evidence to see that most of our thinking is repetitive and futile. Read Stay Rooted in Being and Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more insight.
It's very efficient to keep a balance or combination of above practices, depending upon the degree of awareness in you at that moment. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

, Instead of escaping from the pain, go deeper into it and feel it fully. Its like when you take attention away from your emotions and thoughts, they continue to guide your behavior like hypnotic spells. Its cause there is no escape; the only way is through. So keep putting your attention on your deep negative emotions(pain body). Don't let it rise up and turn into thinking. Being aware of your breath at the same time helps a lot. Also, be aware that 'going deeper into your pain' doesn't become a mental concept. It is highly recommended to read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth., ""Why am I getting these thoughts or emotions?"", ""Why am I not doing this?"", ""Why did I do that?"". Futile conditioned reactions to reactions and so on. It's a dreadful dysfunction that most of humanity is suffering to a varying degrees. Plus, its so common that we think that its normal.

Just like you cannot fight the darkness, you cannot fight unconsciousness. So invite the light of presence to become aware of these unconscious or unobserved thoughts, patterns and emotions within you. Watching is enough. As when you are watching, naturally, a different dimension of consciousness emerges through you. Far more intelligent than human mind.
Surrender comes when you don't ask 'why is this happening to me'? Because you live in the totality of the universe where all events and forms are interconnected.Here's a pointer: ""I am never upset for the reason I think"" Course of miracles.

Practice Inner acceptance.,
Start with little things.,
Give.,
Stay Rooted in Being.,
Recognize the interconnection between mind, emotions and body.,
Experiment.,
See the suchness of this moment.,
Smile and laugh at it.,
When you are stillness, what can you resist?,
Force your mind to surrender.,
Enter 'now' from there.,
Free yourself from all concepts.",How to Surrender to the Present Moment3," This means relinquish the inner resistance you have been offering to the undesirable circumstances, thoughts and other stimuli. Say an 'inner' yes to the present, doesn't matter what you say or do externally but there should be an 'inner Yes' or an inner alignment to what is. What does it mean to say 'inner Yes'?


It means say 'yes' to the thoughts and emotions that arise in your consciousness by allowing, accepting or giving them full attention, etc. However, you don't have to follow them. As thoughts create a lot of problems too. When there is an inner acceptance then you have a choice to follow a thought or refuse to follow it, externally. In the same way you would have a choice to follow circumstances or people or refuse to follow them. There will be time when you would have to say 'No', externally, but that would be a deeper 'No'. Not from ego but from deep within you. Do experiments to learn, like refuse to follow some thoughts and then see the result. However there should always be an inner yes, an inner acceptance.

, Give your full and unconditional attention to anything you are doing. Like brushing your teeth, cooking, washing your hands, walking etc. Most people are lost in thoughts while doing these chores, but these simple chores can be great opportunities to practice surrender.""Everybody's life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego. The paradox is that the foundation for greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness"" (Eckhart Tolle).

, On a Universal level, 'Giving' is the same as 'Receiving'. The more you give, the more you will receive. If you feel like you are lacking something in life then ask yourself, ""What can I give in this situation?"" Try this for a couple of weeks and see how it changes your reality: Whatever you think people are withholding from you- praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on – give it to them. You don't have it?Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you don't give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you won't even know that you have it. This includes abundance.

, Be aware of your breath, inner body or sense perceptions, as much as you can. Our inner body is a bridge between form and formless(Universal intelligence). So keeping some attention with in while doing anything, not only keeps you connected to present moment, but also make your actions high quality.Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

, If you are aware enough you would have noticed physical reactions to your thoughts in body and vice versa.Like tautness in face or brain muscles and muscles around your heart in response to a thought.


Similarly, have you noticed emotional reactions to your fearful thoughts in body? like anxiety, fear, anger etc?
If you could single out the moment, you will observe that physical pain and emotions are simply intense pressure or uneasiness or energy you feel somewhere in the body. For the most part, that doesn't make you unhappy. Its the reactive thoughts in response to these that make you unhappy.
As mentioned before - feel this pain or negative emotions and don't let it rise up and turn into thinking.Instead go deeper into them and feel them fully.

, Mental labeling happens automatically on the basis of conditioning your mind had. Have you noticed when you see some person or experience something, there is a small pause and then mind kicks in with the automatic mental labeling?Try it now: Look away from the screen and watch your inner self with high alertness. Did you notice a pause of no thought and then the 'heavy mind machinery' started, causing a taut feeling in your body and brain muscles? Did it feel as if resisting or judging what is?


Many people are not even aware of this automatic mental labeling or painful impulse because of the mental noise or because they consider it ""normal"".
Similarly, we automatically judge or label people or a group of people. This is the biggest reason why it becomes easier to vilify people, because we have already vilified them in our mind by labeling or conceptualizing them. ""To reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence"" (Eckhart Tolle).

, 'She didn't have the decency to return my call', 'He gave me a bad review, I could lose my job', 'the soup is so damn cold, I am never coming to this place again', 'I have been feeling fatigued for a while now, do I have cancer?'.

How simple life would be without these mental stories. 'She did not call', 'He gave me a poor review', 'the soup is cold', 'There's a tautness in my body'.""There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."" William Shakespeare.

, When you notice yourself being taken over by mind or any egoic pattern, then smile, laugh and have fun with it.. For example make fun of yourself like 'I am in nut-mode','I have been possessed by ego' etc. Or replace mental noise with constructive content or actions. Its like channeling the reactions(negative energy) in a creative and constructive way to transmute them. It is highly recommended to read Stay Rooted in Beingfor more depth.


Thoughts and emotions is energy that arises in your consciousness. Since energy can only be transmuted, so practices like verbalizing, inner body awareness, breath meditation, etc. help transmute negative low frequency emotions to high frequency. Another reason why resistance is futile. Read Stay Rooted in Being for pragmatic practices.
Allow, remain non-reactive and smile, even if it makes you do or say things you don't want to say or do. Learn from the past but don't feel guilty about it because then it becomes psychological pain.

, Most of us don't know who we truly are. Trapped in this dream of life, seeing reality through limited view of sense perceptions and ruled by thoughts; without even knowing it's not us.That's the reality of the majority of people, i.e completely identified with mind and form. They are not even there. Feeling uncertain or thinking it's nonsense?

, Have you ever noticed that before you start running or any other challenging task, mind activity is high? For example thoughts like ""this is going to be tough"", ""I don't wanna run"", ""this is a mistake"" etc, will start arising in your space of consciousness. However, when you push through that initial static of thoughts and emotions by running for some time, then the thoughts from in the beginning change or disappear. If you had believed your mind in the first place, would you have run? The initial thoughts we get are what we are conditioned to think. This is why instead of fighting the conditioned thoughts, which on the contrary makes them stronger, channel reactive energy of thoughts to something constructive like replacing these thoughts with present moment anchors, making it fun and silly, constructive action, thoughts or content etc. As that's what reconditions your mind. Read Stay Rooted in Being and Become Mentally Flexible for more depth.


One of the reasons for high thought activity is because of the unreleased surplus energy in us. Cause mind acts out this surplus energy via thoughts. So some form of thorough physical workout helps a lot to release this surplus energy as physical exertion drastically reduces mind activity and forces it to surrender. So try different experiments and activities to force your mind to surrender.

, The time is always now.Feeling regret or guilty about something you did or didn't do, enter now from there.
Feeling sad because of some loss, enter now from there.
Feeling resentment, enter now from there.
Too excited or anxious, enter now from there.
Feeling unforgivable or self pity, enter now from there.Again, even if you are going through a bad situation or stuck in past or future etc., what's stopping you to become present now? You have power only in the now. Suppose you forgot to be aware of your breath or inner body, can you become aware of it now? Instead of feeling guilty about it. Just forgive yourself and enter now from there.

, Your mind might ask questions like 'So how can I allow thoughts and emotions?','What does it mean to watch your inner-self?', ""What's 'enter now from there'?"" etc and come up with mental answers to the questions on the basis of its conditioning. For example your mental answer could be: 'Watching means to just be silent and observe'(another concept). This might trigger another question 'So how can I observe?' and this might lead to another mental interpretation, until mind conceptualizes it with a notion that it will free you of the ego. Which is short sighted and doesn't work.


It's ok to have these concepts in the beginning(or use them from time to time) but realize that the words and concepts are no more than stepping stones to be left as quickly as possible.Finger (concept or thoughts) pointing to the moon (consciousness) is not the moon.
You know who you are? You are the awareness(subject) that sees these thoughts, concepts and reactive thoughts (voice in head or objects)that uses the words like 'I' or 'you' and pretends to be you.

Identify your triggers for living vicariously.,
Cut back on your technology and social media consumption.,
Avoid entertainment that distracts you from your own life.,
Avoid comparing yourself with others.,
Look at what you spend the most time doing.,
Get inspired.,
Make a list of goals.,
Take stock of your life as it is right now.,
Choose one or two goals to work on.,
Break your goals into steps.,
Set a time-frame.,
Commit to making progress every day.,
Track your progress.",How to Stop Living Vicariously," Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are common triggers for vicarious living. So are celebrity news, movies, video games, and books. Think about the kind of content you consume and whether it’s adding to your life – or simply replacing your life.


If you spend a lot of time thinking about a particular friend, character, or celebrity, chances are good that you’re trying to live through them. For example, if you basically live to meet up with this one friend who shares stories about his adventures overseas, you could be living life vicariously through him.Try to find other ways you are living life through someone else. Do you persistently scan your social media pages looking for certain people's updates? Are you distracted from work because you're chatting with your best friend about her crazy nights out, when you always stay in? Pay attention to what you spend the most time doing. Many of these activities will be your triggers.;
, If you spend a lot of time on your computer or phone, commit to reducing your screen time or you may even consider deleting social media apps on your smartphone and/or tablet. Another option is to delete your social media profiles entirely. If you don’t want to delete your accounts, then give yourself just a few minutes per day to check your accounts and browse the internet.


Most parents know to limit screen time for their kids. But, the truth is, adults receive a great deal of unhealthy influence from social media, too. Do a digital detox and significantly reduce or completely remove your access to media for several days to help you stop living vicariously.
Also, avoid checking social media first thing in the morning. This may end up setting a negative tone for your whole day.

, TV and movies are fun, but when you spend more time thinking about made-up characters’ lives than your own, there’s a problem. If you’ve been neglecting your own life to immerse yourself in fictional stories, cut down on your entertainment consumption, or go cold turkey., Everyone’s path in life is unique, so there’s no point in comparing your own life to the lives of celebrities or even your friends. Too much comparison can make you feel inferior, increasing your desire to live vicariously through others. Instead, focus on your own potential to transform your life.Keep in mind that people’s social media profiles are carefully controlled by them to portray themselves the way they want people to see them. This means that they probably don’t provide a realistic portrayal of their lives.

, If you can spot common themes, this can tell you how you really want to be spending your days. Figuring out how you actually want to start living your life can be jump started by looking at your vices. The things you do in your leisure time are typically the kinds of things you love, and possibly the kinds of things you can start doing.


If you spend a lot of time watching a specific show or following someone on social media, then see if you can identify and rank the priorities of these other people or characters to see what you like about their lives. Family? Career? Travel? Fitness? Self-care?
What kind of media or entertainment are you most likely to get lost in? Do you love action movies, or can you spend hours looking at travel pictures? The things you admire can give you clues for what direction to go in your own life., Think back to the people and things you lived vicariously through. How can you shape your own life to resemble these people’s or characters’ lives? Use your admiration as fuel when you set your goals. For instance, if you love reading blogs by entrepreneurs, you could channel that interest into becoming an entrepreneur yourself.Now, instead of wasting your time simply observing these people's lives, why don't you start using them to fuel your own dreams. Locate images of inspiring people, places, and phrases. Create a vision board with all these images attached. View it daily as motivation to accomplish your dreams. Remember that your life does not have to exactly replicate that of other people to be excellent. Use them as inspiration, but do not feel like a failure if your success looks different than theirs.

, Now that you know what inspires you, set some goals you’d like to achieve in your own life. Sit down when you’ve got a quiet moment and spend some time writing about what you’d like to accomplish.For instance, if travel inspires you, you could set a goal to visit Machu Picchu and hike in the Andes. If you want to get fit, a good goal might be to run a six-minute mile.
Write down every goal you think of. You can always revise your list later.

, Evaluating where you are right now can help you figure out how to get to your goal. Be honest with yourself about your current habits, skills, and limitations.Don’t be discouraged if you’re a long way from where you want to be. The people you admire had to work hard to create their lives, too.
You may consider seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you to determine if you have any mental or emotional obstacles interfering with your goals

, Sit down with your list of goals and think about which ones are most important to you. Start with just one or two, and leave the rest for later. If you try to accomplish every goal on your list at once, you’ll get overwhelmed. Consider choosing an initial goal that will positively impact multiple areas of your life. For instance, you might choose to improve your health first, because achieving everything else will be easier when you’re in good shape.

, Your goal may seem overwhelmingly large, but every big task is made up of smaller action steps that are within your grasp. Imagine your main goal as a series of sub-goals, and make a list of the specific tasks you need to complete.For instance, if you want to become a blogger, you could break your goal down into the steps of creating your website, establishing a posting schedule, and promoting your blog.
If you are having a hard time breaking down your goals, then you might consider seeing a life coach. A life coach can help you make your goals more attainable, keep you accountable, and track your progress.
You might also try announcing your goals, such as on social media. Announcing to others that you are pursuing goals is a good way of ensuring that you follow-through.

, A time-bound goal is more compelling than one without a set end date. Give yourself a deadline for each step of your plan.Make sure your time-frame is realistic. For instance, it’s not possible to learn a new language in thirty days, but you might be able to reach a conversational level in six months.

, The key to achieving a goal is taking consistent small steps in the right direction. Set a realistic daily target and stick to it.For example, if you’re writing a novel, your daily target might be to write 1000 words every day.
Avoid trying to do too much at once. If you try to rush through your goal, you may just end up overwhelmed and frustrated.

, Use a journal, spreadsheet, or app to keep track of the work you do and the progress you make. Seeing how far you’ve come will boost your motivation levels when you get discouraged."

Volunteer your time.",How to Stop Being Self Centered," Do you need to be taken down a notch? Learning to lose gracefully is an important step in being less self-centered. The world won't come to an end, and that's a lesson you need to learn.


When self-centered people lose, they go into disaster mode. Let yourself lose some contest, the smaller, the better. Then act like an adult afterwards.
Congratulate the winner, even if they're being big-headed. Shake their hand and look them in the eye. Say, ""Good game."";
, If you have trouble feeling gratitude, fake it until you feel it. Make yourself say ""thank you"" when someone helps you out. If you train yourself to say ""thank you"" when you recognize someone making the effort to help, you'll make yourself less self-centered, practically by accident.


When you ride the bus, say thank you to the bus driver. When the server at a restaurant fills your water glass, make eye contact and say thank you. When your mother drops you off at school, say thank you. Look for excuses to give thanks.
Even if you think you deserve more, or that the efforts of others come up short, thank them anyway.

, However you're feeling, an easy way to demonstrate respect is to make good eye contact. Even if you don't like what someone is saying, even if you think you don't need to listen to it, be respectful and make eye contact.


Practice basic listening skills along with eye contact. Nod your head to show that you're listening. Summarize what someone has said after they say it, before you respond. Show that you're listening.

, If you're looking around the room and eavesdropping on other conversations while your friend is talking, you'll bored, and self-centered. When you're with someone, give them your attention. Focus. Listen to what other people say, and put the focus more on them in your conversations.


Ask questions and demonstrate an interest in what someone is saying. Follow up on something that they've said, like ""How did that make you feel?"" or even ""What happened next?""

, A recent study found that people who enjoy reading fiction can more easily empathize with others. Reading a good book can help you to understand and recognize the emotions of others, so it's an easy way to work on yourself if you're feeling self-centered. All you need is a library card.


Of course, reading one book won't automatically make you a more selfless person. But learning to invest in the lives of others can help you get started.

, Self-centered people often struggle to admit when they're wrong, and admit that they need help. Don't just blunder into things on your own. Recognize when your skills and talents aren't enough, and ask for help from someone who can help you.


Asking for help means that you're able to recognize there are other capable people in the world. People who might be better than you at some task or skill. That's a good thing.

, Do you always feel like you need to make your voice heard? Instead, take the back seat for a change. Let someone else be in charge when you're in a group, instead of taking the lead.


When you're out with your friends, does it really matter where you go for dinner? If you're with five people, there could be five different opinions. Just let someone else pick and have fun instead.
Standing up for yourself is important, too, but only if your voice is regularly buried in the mix, and only if you have a constructive solution to add. You don't have to be a doormat to be more selfless.

, Lots of things that people say can seem self-centered, even if they really aren't. If you sometimes try to guess what someone else wants, you might be trying too hard. Instead of guessing, ask, so you can make yourself clear.


Don't look for hidden motivations in people's actions and words. If your mom asks if you'd like a salad, it's probably not a subtle jab at your weight. While it might be, assuming can make you look pretty self-involved.
Some people interpret shyness as self-centeredness, or ego. Don't expect for anyone to read your mind. You have to be willing to speak up if you need help, or you have something to say. Don't expect that everyone's going to ask.

, Self-centered people always find a way to talk about themselves. If you tend to treat conversations as a battleground, or a way to show-off, stop it. Stop waiting for your turn to speak and start listening and responding during conversation, not formulating your next great statement.


Don't ""one-up"" people, even if you get the chance. If someone just told a story about how happy they were to get a used bicycle for their birthday, it's probably not the time to launch into the story about how your dad got you a new car.

, If your world is the size of your skull, it's no wonder you're feeling self-centered. Get out there and experience things that frighten you, things that shake up your day. The more you learn, the easier it will be to humble yourself.


Even if you think you've got your politics figured out, try to keep an open mind about things. Let doubt creep in every now and then to keep yourself sharp. Ask big questions and seek out the answers for yourself.
Try to experience other cultures, if you can. You don't have to go on an expensive vacation to do it: meet people very different than yourself in your own town by volunteering.

, For some people, it can be a humbling experience to find out that you're not alone. Whatever your ""thing"" is, there are other people who share your interest. Even if it's obscure 78 rpm shellac records or Italian horror movies. Find a community to which you belong, and join it.



Join a church and start attending if you're a believer. This can be an excellent way to ground people who are feeling self-centered.
Join a social club in your town. Hang out at the game shop, if you're a gamer. Hang out at the gym if you're a jock.

, If you've got a small circle that you feel comfortable around, try to shake it up sometimes. Meet new people and learn new things about them, and about yourself. They don't need to know about your self-centered past.


Spend time with people very different than yourself. Strike up a conversation with a brick layer sometime, if you work in an office, or chat up a well-dressed white collar worker if you make minimum wage. Hang out at the bowling alley. Meet strangers and get to know about their world.

, Learning to be tactful and kind to someone who gets on your nerves is a true sign of selflessness. If you're feeling too self-centered, make a point of befriending someone you don't particularly like, and make yourself figure out a way to like them.


try to guess why someone is the way they are. If your little sister copies everything you do, try to give her a break. It's probably because she looks up to you. Give her a chance.

, When you give something without seeking anything in return, you're acting selflessly. Joining a volunteer organization, or finding a non-profit that supports a cause you believe in can be an excellent way to work on self-centeredness. Consider signing up for any of the following common volunteer opportunities:


Habitat for Humanity
Humane Society
Homeless Shelters
Big Brother
Suicide Prevention

Depending on your home, these chores may vary. For example, if you have pets of livestock, you'll need to include these in your chore list! Some common chores include:Cleaning the bathroom
Dusting
Making beds
Sweeping
Tidying bedrooms
Vacuuming
Washing dishes

Putting away dishes


Washing laundry

Folding laundry

;
, Take note of the schedules of those who will be doing the chore list. For example, if you're making a chore chart for your roommate who is generally busy in the morning but free in the evening, you chart his chore-work for evening hours.


Chore charts can be as general or specific as you like. For those who have difficulty finding time to do chores, you may want a very specific chore chart and schedule.
Some people find it easier to assign chores to a day, or even week. In this case, the person who has to do the chore will have an entire day or week to check off the chore from the chart., Not only will splitting up the chores you have make less work for everyone, it will also give a sense of solidarity to all involved. Even if you're a parent who doesn't need a chore chart, listing your many chores next to the responsibilities of your kids might gain you more appreciation for all the work you do.


This is a great technique for children who are resistant to chores. Once they see how much work you do next to their few around-the-house tasks, they'll likely be less difficult.
Allow some flexibility with chore assignments. If someone particularly hates a specific chore, maybe a less hated one can be exchanged for it., There are many different ways you can make a chore chart. You could even turn your chore chart into a personalized craft for your kids. Simply allow them to draw out their own chart on several pages in a notebook and decorate it with drawings, favorite characters, and stickers.Some other supplies you might find helpful include:Binder ring (optional)
Card stock (optional)
Dry erase board
Dry erase markers
Hole punch
Notebook (optional)
Paper (optional)
Pen (optional)
Stickers (optional)

, Depending on the style of chore chart you're making, these may vary, but having all your supplies on hand will help speed you through your chore chart creation. For the purposes of offering a guided example, the following chore chart uses a dry erase board and markers.

, The first column will be where you write down chore names, so you'll need it to be wider than the rest. The seven columns to the right will be where the chore-doer marks whether the chore has been finished or not. These seven columns can be much smaller than your first.


If you have five chores, you should have at least six rows. The topmost row will be for days of the week, so you'll need one more row than your number of chores., Do so from the upper left of the box to its lower right corner. In the bottom left triangle, write ""Chores"" to indicate the left column is for chores. In the upper right triangle, write ""Days"" to indicate the top row is for days. This way there won't be any confusion, and your chart will look tidy and complete.

, Skipping the upper left hand box, write out the chores in the leftmost column of your chart. You might also want to include special information here. For example, for bi-weekly chores you might put ""Bi-weekly"" in parentheses below the listed chore. In the topmost row, skipping again the upper leftmost box, write the days of the week.


If you don't have enough room in your top row to write out the entire name of each day of the week, use simple abbreviations, like: M, T, W, TH, F, S, SU, This can be as simple as marking a chore complete with a check mark in the appropriate column when it's done. However, if you want to do the marking yourself to keep the chore doer honest, you can use the same procedure when you are informed the chore is complete.


For example, when the chore doer's bed is made, you'll put a check mark in the box to the right of ""Make Bed"" in the corresponding column for the day of the week.
For children especially resistant to chores, you may want to do a brief inspecting of the work before you hand out a check mark.

, Even a small prize can be great motivation for a young child, but incentives work well for adults, too. If you have a roommate who's particularly messy, you can offer to buy him a pizza if he manages to stay on top of his chores for the month. Kids can be given small rewards, like stickers or small toys., Take your marker and write a color code at the top of the chart. For example, orange might be for Billy and green for Susan. Then, when each child completes a chore, you can write a check mark in the appropriate color.


For chores that alternate doers per day, week, or a similar situation, you might want to use initials to mark the chore complete and keep track of order.
For example, if Billy takes out the trash Tuesday but Susan is expected to on Thursday, initials would clearly indicate both whose turn it is and chore completion.

, Some kids, and even some adults, don't like their things to get mixed with others. This may be due to the greater clarity of having one's own chart, but regardless, you can satisfy picky chore doers by giving each person their own chart., By making a daily chart, the chore doers will know that sometime during the day, all chores on the list will be done. This way, it doesn't matter which day of the week it is, all that matters is whether or not the chore was finished. Simply replace the days of the week with the names of the chore doers. When a chore is complete, it should be marked on the chart.

, If you are trying to teach your kids responsibility, you might not want to do their chores for them. However, by lending a helping hand or offering encouragement and advice, you can turn chores into a bonding experience.


Play the word chain game while you work. Choose a category, and take turns while doing chores chaining together the last letter of a word in that category with the first letter of the next word. For example:Category: Sports
baseball → luge → eight ball → limbo ...

, Rewards will be unique to each situation. Younger children can be persuaded to work diligently with small prizes, like stickers or dollar store toys. Older chore doers might enjoy a free pizza or a night at the movies. Whatever the case, a little motivation goes a long way., You can award more or less points depending on the difficulty of the task, but be sure you are consistent with your scoring. Unfairness can lead to stubborn chore doers becoming more resistant to your efforts due to a perceived lack of fairness.

, You might notice that the chore doers consistently forget to clean something completely, or that certain aspects of the chore are avoided. In this case, you can improve accountability and squash excuses by writing out chore ""recipe"" cards. Simply:


Write down all parts involved in doing the chore on card stock and punch a hole in its upper left hand corner.
Put a binder ring in the punched corner.
Leave the card in the room where the chore will be done.
Attach the binder ring somewhere obvious, but out of the way. Maybe on the arm of a lamp, or onto a rung of a chair that sits off in the corner.
For rooms that have multiple chores, you can collect several cards on the same binder ring.

"
Decide on 7 (arbitrary number) things you wish to do each and every day.,
Create a chart (An index card works perfectly) nine by nine.,
Set a personal goal for the number of times in a week that you plan to accomplish each of the 7 items and put that number next to the name in the first column.,
At the end of each week total the Rows across to see how you did.,
Carry the card/list with you ALL the TIME.",How to Make an Effective Task List," Have more than seven? No problem, as you can change this plan each week to suit your needs. Next week you can have a different list if need be. Don't put more than 7 on your list though. If you set your sights too high and fail, the tendency is to stop trying. Rather set your goals within reach and increase them as you succeed. Many small wins equates to good feelings and ongoing effort. A good goal is to spend a minimum of 15 to 30 minutes each on action item.;
, That is, nine columns across and nine rows down. If you prefer it can be created on a computer using excel or many other programs. At the top of each column put a day and/or date representing one week, leaving the first block blank. IE: Left to right - Blank/ Mon 11-2/ Tue 11-3/ Wed 11-4/ Thur 11-5/ Fri 11-6/ Sat 11-7/ Sun 11-8/ Total. At the front of each row (far left) list your seven planned 'to do' items, leaving the top (first) block empty. IE: Top to bottom - Blank/ Read/ WebSite/ Planning/ Vacuum/ Write/ Basement/ Calls/ Totals. Just in case this is not coming across clearly you may view and/or download the PDF file here: http://www.studentofwinning.com/chart.pdf .

, As you do any of these things place a check mark in the corresponding box for that date. Example: If you vacuumed on Wednesday, look down the list to Vacuum then follow the line across to the Wed column and place a check mark there.

, If the goal is to vacuum two times a week, then hopefully in that Total box at the far right of the vacuum row the total will meet or exceed that. Simple, right? The Chart example provided has a Goal Total of 28. If your goal for each item is seven times a week then when you add the Total column you are looking for a 49. Some weeks you may hit lower, so next week work to beat the previous Total.

, Shirt pocket, in your planner, wherever you will see it several times a day. If you tuck it away where it does not JUMP out at you - you are wasting your time. Notice that one of listed 7 things was planning? It is very important to actually spend some time each day planning what you will do the next. Experience as taught successful people this. When we don't plan, we don't do. That's it, period. You could be different, but likely not. Do not use this as a flail, or even a burr under the saddle. This should be part of the reward system. On the reverse side if the list write one or two small thoughts reminding you of the benefit from meeting the goal. We do things because we want to. We do not do things we don't want to. If this process makes you uncomfortable you will not do it for very long and for this to work you must. That is, in order for these little things to add up to meeting the big goals we have, there must be prolonged effort. Keep it simple, create a habit, remind yourself of the reasons and the rewards and you will change your life.

Figure out your priorities.,
Find your ""element."",
Imagine your “best possible self.” This exercise can help you decide how to define success in your own life and will help you when you formulate goals to get you there.Identifying your “best possible self” is a two-step process: first you visualize yourself in the future, and then you consider what characteristics will help you get to that visualized self.,

Take care of yourself.",How to Succeed," Being successful means not just having some vague aspirations that you'd like to accomplish. Sort out your priorities and decide what is most important to you. Knowing what your priorities are will help you set out goals to achieve the things that will make you feel happy and successful.Research has shown that you’re more likely to work toward something if it’s very meaningful to you.You need to decide which are the most important things you want to accomplish: are you looking to have a family by a certain time? Do you want to be a published author? Do you want to be a leading expert in a medical field?
Make a list of the most important things you want to accomplish, with the most important at the top. As you make plans with the aim of accomplishing these goals, you'll keep revisiting this list, making revisions as things change and crossing things off as you accomplish goals.
Remember, just because these are your priorities now doesn't mean they won't change. That's okay. Life often takes you down roads you don't expect, but if you at least have an idea what you're trying to work towards, you'll be better able to accomplish what you want and to change that desire if you need to.;
, This is the thing that drives you, that you love to do. You may employ this element in your work, or you may enjoy it as a hobby. The important thing is that it is meaningful to how you define “success.”This can be anything: writing, drawing, dancing, computer science, cooking, archaeology. The point is that cultivating this ""element"" in yourself will lead to you feeling more fulfilled and happier.
Remember, you may use this skill in an unexpected way, as long as you remain open to the possibility of using it. For example: you might train to be a classical dancer, but instead of performing on stage, you use that skill to teach low-income kids how to dance. You're using that ""element"" but in a way you might never have imagined. That's success.
Practice that skill. Even if you are good at writing, you're never going to be great unless you read and write constantly. If you don't write for work, carve out some time before or after (before tends to be better, because you aren't as exhausted) to write. The same goes for any other skill.

,


To begin, imagine a time in your future when you are your best, most successful version of yourself. This can look like anything. Focus on what is most important and meaningful to you, rather than defining success by someone else’s standards.
Imagine the details of your best future self. Think and define yourself positively. What does your life look like? How do you feel and behave? For example, if your best possible self is a musician, imagine what your life is like. Are you a mega star? A successful indie artist? Are you always on the road or do you play mostly in your community?
Write down the details of your visualization. Imagine the characteristics that you used to attain your “best possible self.” For example, if you are a successful musician, you are very skilled at your instrument. You probably also know how to network with people, promote yourself, persist despite challenges, and express yourself creatively. Write down as many skills, traits, and characteristics as you can think of.
Now, consider which of these things you already have. Be honest and compassionate with yourself. What do you already know? Then, consider which characteristics you can learn or develop. What can you learn, and how?
Identify ways to build the characteristics you need. For example, if you’re shy, you might consider social skills or assertiveness training to help you become comfortable promoting yourself to others. If you want to be a musician but aren’t skilled at an instrument, you might take lessons.

, No matter how self-made someone seems, they have always had lots of different kinds of help: for example, perhaps their teachers gave them access to knowledge, their relatives helped cultivate their interests, and their family helped them go to college.


Reach out to people, especially people who can help further your goals. This doesn't necessarily have to be self-serving. For example: if you're looking to become an archeologist, you could help out for free at your local museum, which can give you good references and help them.
Be certain that you, too, help others when the opportunity arises. The more you cultivate an atmosphere of giving, the more help will come your way.

, To succeed you can't just sit back and wait for life to hand you the tools you need to do so. You have to make clear, attainable plans for what you need to do to achieve success.


Research shows that setting goals for yourself can make you feel more confident and optimistic, even when you haven’t achieved them yet., Once you've decided what your priorities are going to be, you're going to need to come up with long term and short term plans for achieving them, so they become more than a nice dream. Try to focus on only one or two at a time. Trying to work on all areas at once can leave you feeling overwhelmed.Try splitting your priorities into tiers. For example, you may have first, second, and third tier priorities. First-tier priorities need to be done as soon as possible. They’re the ones that are most meaningful or important to you. Second and third tiers are still important, but they may be less crucial than first-tier priorities, or they may be more specific.
For example, your first-tier priority might be “be happier with work,” while a second-tier priority may be “exercise more.” A third-tier priority might be “keep my house cleaner.”

, A goal is specific, measurable, attainable, and trackable. It is usually concrete, while a priority is more abstract.Start by deciding something that’s concrete enough to pursue.


For example, if you've decided that your priority is to express yourself more creatively, you might decide that you want to act.
This is still fairly big, so it’s a good idea to narrow it down further. For example, do you want to act in community theatre? Pursue a career in stage or screen acting?

, Objectives are specific actions that you take to help you achieve your goal. They’re like the rungs of a ladder that get you to the top. Make these as concrete possible.For example, “become an Egyptologist” could be a goal. Objectives would be the components of the plan to get you to that goal.
Thus, if you were looking to study Egyptology, you would need to go to college and study ancient Egypt. You'd need to learn to read hieroglyphs (and Greek and Latin to see what those folks were saying about the Egyptians; depending on your period). You would need to specify your interest (say Middle Kingdom burial practices) and go to graduate school.

, Some goals can be achieved fairly quickly. Others will take more time. Still others will have to be achieved based on others’ deadlines. Do some research to determine what a reasonable, attainable timeline would be.For example, if you want to become an actor, some of your objectives, such as “act in community theatre plays” and “study screenwriting,” could be accomplished fairly quickly. On the other hand, “obtain a role in a major movie” could take a very long time.
As another example, if you want to become an Egyptologist, you will also need to consider external timelines such as admissions deadlines and college curricula.You must also remember that some of your objectives must be accomplished before others. For example, in the Egyptologist example, you must study Egyptian history and language before you can apply to graduate school. You must go to graduate school before you can become a working Egyptologist. Make sure you understand the process of accomplishing your goals so that you are not disappointed.

, Remember that you can only control your actions, not their outcomes or others’ actions. Frame your goals in terms of what you can accomplish through your own work.For example, “Become a movie star” is a goal that relies on the outcome of others’ actions. You can’t control others, and thus, this goal is not the best way to phrase this. However, “audition for major movies” is a goal that you can control.

, Learn to adapt to the things that life throws at you. Remember, your plans can change, but you should always be working forward. Studies show that people who are able to adapt and remain flexible are more likely to succeed in their goals.Don't become too rigid in how you achieve your goals. It may be that the initial objectives you set don't work out or cannot be accomplished. Learning to look for alternative ways of achieving the same goal will increase your likelihood of success., You should never stop learning. Being a lifelong learner can help keep you from getting diseases like Alzheimer's, but it's also a good way to keep yourself invested and interested in life around you. Continuing to learn ensures that you do not allow yourself to stagnate or become too comfortable with the status quo.Learning can be anything from reading a bunch of history books about your specific area, so you can talk knowledgeably about different historical sites in your area, to learning to quilt.
Don't get complacent in your learning. Challenging yourself keeps your mind sharp. So, if you're interested in history, branch out and look into mathematics, or learning a language.
Learning challenging tasks within social settings can help your mind stay sharper. Consider trying some classes or taking a college course in a subject that interests you., Succeeding is impossible without hard work. You have to practice the skills that you already have to hone them. So much of the work you'll do won't be seen by other people, which is why it's important that you're serving your priorities. Otherwise you will get drained by the constant demand for your energy on things you don't enjoy.Stay focused on your priorities. Even if you're working a job that isn't necessarily in line with your priorities, look for ways to change that. Try to bring a spark of creativity or good humor into things like food service, customer service jobs, or a dull office job. For example, if you're an artist, try enhancing that work presentation with some of your artwork, just enough to make it a little more interesting and enjoyable.
While a lot of success seems to come from luck, most of the people who got that luck got it because they had worked hard to be in that right place at that right time. You don't tend to see all the background work that people did to get somewhere (unless they have connections, but most people don't).

, One key difference between people who are successful and people who aren't is how they respond to the roadblocks, the things that don't work out. No matter how hard you work and no matter how talented you are, you will experience obstacles and setbacks. The difference is in whether you see obstacles as failures or as learning experiences.Instead of looking at the obstacles as a reflection on you, ask yourself what you learned from it. What would you do differently next time? If you had had all the resources in the world in your grasp, how would you have approached the problem? How have other people approached or dealt with problems like this one?
Remind yourself that you're better equipped the next time you are confronted with something like this. Dwelling on it and beating yourself up over it will make it harder to face the next problem, because you'll already be in the mindset that you will “fail.”
Studies show that people who succeed generally don’t have any more or fewer obstacles than people who do not succeed. How people choose to interpret and respond to these obstacles determines success more than anything else., You cannot succeed without taking some risks. Studies have shown that people who remain holed up in their comfort zones never break out into the realm of bigger things, which is where true success lies.You’ll actually work harder if you’re in a slightly unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation. The key is not to push yourself too far, too fast.For example: if talking to people makes you anxious, try for at least one conversation a week with someone you don't know. This can be as simple as asking for the time and discussing the lateness of the bus. It can be asking a shop person for help finding something. The more you do it, the easier it will get. And talking to people is a hugely important part of being able to succeed (since you will need to ask for people and network with people).
Push yourself to do things you might not otherwise do. Take a free yoga class, or go to a free lecture at your local library and ask questions. Try your hand at a cooking class.
The more you get out there, the easier it will be to deal with life when it throws you for a loop, because you'll have experience problem-solving when you're outside your comfort zone.

, It's truly amazing how much power your brain has to make you successful or unsuccessful simply based on how you think about things. If you focus on the negative, your life is going to feel like a failure no matter how much you accomplish and you'll find obstacles more difficult.Go back to your priorities and visualize yourself achieving success in all of them. Imagine yourself with a happy family, or imagine yourself the star of your local theater troupe, or giving esteemed lectures on Egyptology.
The more specific and detailed these visualizations are, the more successful they are in building up positive reinforcement. Imagine the sounds of people shifting interestedly in their seat, imagine them leaning forward, feel the heat from the stage lights, hear the sounds of your potential children laughing.

, Philanthropy and helping other people is incredibly important to continued success, because you're creating a chain of community and fostering a system of aid. This will help you, too, in the long run. Not only does philanthropy contribute greatly to your own life, by bolstering your health and your self-esteem, but it makes your community a healthier place as well.Even if you are poor, you can help others. You could give $5 to a local project that you support. You can give your time and your skill for local enterprises and nonprofits that need help.You can simply do helpful and nice things for the people in your own life. You can buy the coffee of the person behind you in line. You can offer to babysit your sister's kids for free. You could give your parents a hand cleaning the house each week. The effects of your generosity will ripple out into your community.

, Building connections is incredibly important to succeed in life. This means not only networking with people who can help further your goals. It also means connecting with people like friends and family who help make our lives more bearable and ease potential loneliness.Of course, you should try to network with people who can help you further your goals. There is nothing wrong with this. It can be something as simply as asking for advice from a person in your field that you admire, or it could be requesting a letter of recommendation, or even a job.
Networking means talking to people. So do things like go up to the lecturer after the lecture and tell them how much you enjoyed it and introduce yourself and your interests in a polite way.
Build community whenever you can. Participate in your own community. Go to events, help out with philanthropic projects, talk to the people around you and show them that they are important (this can mean something as simple as asking how someone is and really listening when they talk). Strong communities help individuals succeed, because they back them and they pick them up when they fall.
Don't burn bridges. Of course you should get rid of toxic people from your life, but dumping people instead of keeping them, even at arm's length, can have negative effects for you. People talk to one another and the world is much smaller than you realize. You can tell someone when they have hurt you in a manner that doesn't mean there is no possibility for future dialogue. This also means owning up to your own mistakes., You won't be able to succeed in life if you're so focused on your goals that you forget to have a life and to take care of yourself. Your health will suffer and your quality of life will suffer. People are often so focused on staying alive and ""succeeding"" that they forget to actually live. Success is when you feel happy, content, and enjoy life. It isn't about money or fame or attracting the ""right"" partner.


Exercise is a great way to help regulate your system and keep you healthy. It releases chemicals like endorphins that help your mental health and getting the blood pumping helps your heart and the rest of your body. Try for 30 minutes of exercise each day, like yoga, a brisk walk, going for a run, dancing.Eat right. This doesn't mean you give up all your favorite foods. It simply means that you do your best to get lots of fruits and veggies, that you try for the good carbohydrates (like brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat, oats) and that you eat more proteins like salmon, nuts, and beans which help support the immune system and better regulate your blood sugar.
Get enough sleep. Sleep is something that is particularly problematic in the Western world. Sleep helps regulate stress levels, helps make health problems better, and allows us to be alert and energetic. Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night. Shut off all electronics 30 minutes before bedtime and try to go to sleep before midnight.
Drink lots of water. Your body is made up of a huge percentage of water. When you get dehydrated you don't function as well, you feel foggy and fatigued, and it can lead to serious health problems. Go for at least 8 glasses of water a day and try to avoid dehydrators like coffee.

, In the end, figuring out your priorities and making goals and setting up schedules and networking isn't going to make you succeed in your life unless you're happy. To do that you need to make sure that you aren't burning yourself out.


Learn to say ""no."" Only you can set your own boundaries. Philanthropy is great and giving time is great, but only if you first make sure that you are giving time to yourself, as well. If you don't want to go to that party, if you need time to recuperate and can't help with that fundraiser, then say politely say ""no.""
Do something fun. Do something that pampers you. Take a long, hot bubble bath and read a book. Go to the beach for a weekend by yourself and revel in having no one's needs to care for but your own. You know what makes you happy. Remember to take time to have those moments for yourself.

Make it your goal to get as much done as possible at school. Use planners and schedulers to plan time to get projects, readings, and other assignments finished. Try not to procrastinate. It's something everyone is guilty of, but by doing a little work day by day it will ultimately be easier.

, This might not seem important, but really it is. You'll have more energy and feel better. Try to avoid take out foods, especially if you work in a restaurant! I'm sure everyone realizes by now that coffee, snack cakes and McDonald's meals really do add up and hit your wallet.

, Honestly, most people hate their jobs. There will always be someone who you don't like. A task that you hate to do. So on your way to work, try listening to your favorite songs. Listen to songs that make you feel good or remind you of good times. Make sure you get to work on time and are ready for the job. Getting yelled at when you walk in the door first thing is never a good way to start the shift. Remember that's it's only a few hours of your day and you are making money. And as hard as it, try to be pleasant to your coworkers. Starting drama will not help anyone or solve any problems.

, Some money is better than no money. Make sure your bills are paid. If you're young, you probably have few bills to pay. It helps to make a list of things you want and need. Put the things you really need at the top. Maybe your jeans are getting a little too thin to be considered nice, or your shoes are a bit worn out. Think of things you really need. Those should be the things you purchase first. Then later come the wants. Before you go splurge on one item, also think of future wants. Will you want to get your hair done in a few weeks? Will you want to go to that concert later this summer? Do you want to redo your room? All of this things are wants and ultimately cost money as well ; think long term.

, It could be very easy to plop down in front of the computer and waste 2 hours on Facebook or staring at the TV screen for the night. Try to avoid this because before you know it, it'll be 1 AM and you still haven't moved since you got home. Make sure you make time to spend with your loved ones and find ways to relieve your stress. Don't spend all your free time sleeping. That may actually make you feel even more run down in the long run. Go to bed at a reasonable time. It's impossible for me to tell you to get 8 hours of sleep ; it's easier said then done for most of us.

, Make sure you have gas in your car. Don't put off stopping just because you're tired. If you ran out of gas in the middle of the road one day, you know you'd be pissed. Make sure you get your laundry done. There's nothing worse then doing a smell check to see what's clean and what's not. Make sure you don't carry around more than you need. And do everyone a favor by not constantly complaining about your life. Everyone goes through hard times and no one can really do anything to fix your problems.

, It's something you have to do and will most likely have to do for a very long time. Do your job and do it well, and then leave the stress there as you walk out the door. Don't let school, work, and other stresses take over your life. Remember it's just apart of your day. You are an actually person!

Read more physical texts.,
Read books aloud.,
Work on your vocabulary skills.,
Talk more and text less.",How to Stop Relying on Technology and Prevent Your Mind Getting Dull1," Technology has led to e-readers, online newspapers, and blogs that you can read on your phone, tablet, or laptop. However, reading online or with immediate access to the internet can lead to distraction and less recall. Consider reading a physical book, newspaper, or magazine instead of a digital version.Sometimes, quickly skimming a newspaper article and clicking on the next link can lead to a lot of short bursts of information that you don’t focus on long enough to commit to memory or form thoughts.
Reading short bursts of information found on the internet can also lead to a shorter attention span. It may also affect your ability to read things in-depth.;
, Audiobooks are a great result of technology, but you can easily zone out or stop listening to an audiobook. Instead of listening to a book, try reading it out loud. You still engage your auditory senses, but engage an additional part of your brain by reading, listening, and speaking a book.Make it a family or social activity. Read a book to a child, or make your way through your novels with a friend or partner by reading them to each other.

, Instead of learning definitions, people just look them up on their phones. They also use phones to help spell. Instead of looking up a word and forgetting it immediately, look it up and commit it to memory.Learn how to spell the word, all various definitions, and any synonyms. You may keep a list of words you are learning, or make flashcards to help you review them and commit them to memory.

, Many people have exchanged talking for texting. They don't call people, and they don't visit. Instead, they text and talk on social media. This can lead to a decrease in social and verbal communication skills. Start making a point to talk to people using your voice and words instead of technology.


For example, you can call someone instead of texting them, especially if you want to have a conversation.
Consider going to dinner or getting together with people in person. Make sure you put away your cell phone and talk instead of staying on your phone.

Create a to-do list.,
Create a running list that you add to constantly.,
Take notes when you are taking to people.,
Use a planner.,
De-clutter your brain.",How to Improve Organizational Skills1," Write down everything you have to do today, and cross off each thing as you complete them. By writing down daily tasks, you do not have to stress about remembering to do them. Crossing things off your list will likely make you feel productive. Put things on your list you have already done just to cross them off.


Order your to-do list by high priority to low priority. Assess the urgency and importance of each to help you prioritize. Think to yourself, “if I could only do one thing today, what would it be?”. That is your number one thing on the to do list. If possible, make a to-do list for the next day and refer to it before you go to sleep. By doing so, you will wake up with an action plan in mind.;
, If there is a book you want to read or a restaurant you want to try, make a running list that you have on you at all times. If you want to see a movie, you don’t necessarily need to see it today, and therefore don’t want it on your daily to-do list. Having a running list will help remind you of your “extra” to-dos. You can make a running list in a notebook you always carry or online using programs like Dropbox so it is accessible at all times.

, Take notes on the conversations you have with people. This is especially important in business conversations, but also important during interactions with friends and family. Taking notes will remind you of an important thing someone said, a task to complete that you had not anticipated, or just serve as a friendly reminder of fun times with your loved ones. You do not have to keep a notebook on you at all times and meticulously write down each word someone says. Just try to set aside a time to jot down one or two important things from each conversation that you have.

, An annual planner can be immensely helpful in getting your thoughts together. Use it to write down appointments, travel, and other important things. Refer to it daily and write down things that will happen in the long term. For example, if you schedule a conference call for 6 months from now, write it in your planner now so you won’t forget.

, Just as you get rid of unused or unimportant things in your office and at home, you must also remove unnecessary thoughts from your brain. Try meditating to remove negative thoughts like worry and stress from your mind. "

Do math in your head.,
Calculate a tip in your head.,
Wear a watch.,
Download an app.",How to Stop Relying on Technology and Prevent Your Mind Getting Dull2," People are losing the basic skills of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Instead of using what they learned in school, they’re just pulling out their cell phones or calculator. If your math skills have gotten dull, start doing math in your head.If you need to use pen and paper to work out the problems, that’s okay.

, Cell phones have made leaving a tip so much easier because you can use a tip calculator app instead of doing math. Instead of using your phone, calculate the tip yourself on a napkin.


If calculating 15 or 18% is too difficult at first, start with 20%. That is an easier percentage to calculate by hand.

, Many people don't wear watches anymore because they use their cell phones to tell time. Try wearing an analog watch where you have to read the time based on the hands instead of just easily reading the numbers.

, In some cases, using your phone or tablet may be unavoidable, but you can still keep your mind sharp. Many apps can help you improve your math skills by giving you problems to solve. There are even apps, such as Maths Alarm Clock or FreakyAlarm, that will force you to answer a math problem before turning off your morning alarm. These can help you keep yourself alert and focused, even as you use technology."

Go somewhere without GPS.,
Use a map.,
Interact with different people.,
Go tech-free once a week.",How to Stop Relying on Technology and Prevent Your Mind Getting Dull3," People rely on GPS to get them everywhere. This eliminates the need to make your own mental map, learn shortcuts, or rely on your instincts or sense of space. People also will believe a GPS instead of road signs or direction markers. Try getting around town or a new city without GPS. Even if you get lost, your brain starts making a map of the area.Try taking a new route somewhere. See if you can find a shortcut, or go down a road you haven’t driven down before. Changing the path you drive somewhere engages your brain in a way that mindlessly following GPS doesn’t.
You can also do this when walking, hiking, cycling, running, or taking public transit.

, Reading a map is a skill. However, many people can’t read a map because they only rely on GPS. Next time you are planning a road trip somewhere or are walking around a city, pull out a map instead of your phone.By doing this, you not only work on your map reading skills, but engage your sense of direction and work on memorization.

, One thing people believe technology is doing is separating people from each other. They spend more time on their phones or talking to people via text or social media than interacting with people in person. Meeting new people, learning new things, and listening to new ideas and viewpoints helps stretch and stimulate your mind.Try to find people to interact with in your life. This may be through work, school, friends, or family.
Consider going places where you will interact with those different than you. This may include an organization meeting, a volunteer opportunity, book club, public talk, or even a social meetup.

, Choose one day a week to completely disengage yourself from all technology and electronic programs. This includes smartphones, computers, video games, and TV. Leave your phone at home, and try to explore the world without any form of electronic communication.

Be sure to let family, friends, and coworkers know which day of the week you are planning on doing this so that they do not become worried if they can't get in touch with you.

Try something new.,
Get a hobby.,
Exercise.,
Explore nature.",How to Stop Relying on Technology and Prevent Your Mind Getting Dull4," Sometimes, people who rely too much on technology get stuck in a rut where they just stay on their tablets or phones, spend too much time on the internet, or watch television. Put away the technology and try new things. Engaging in new experiences helps stimulate your brain.You can start with things you are comfortable with. Try a new restaurant or type of ethnic cuisine. Travel somewhere new, even if it is close by.
You can also try something completely different than what you usually do. If you aren’t active, sign up for a dance class or tennis lesson. If you spend a lot of time being active, try a painting or cooking class.

, Another way you can help keep your mind stimulated and get away from technology is to take up a hobby. Hobbies where you use your hands are especially good for your brain. These kinds of hobbies help focus the mind, boost your mood, and stimulate your brain cells.Good hobbies for your brain include creating music, drawing and painting, reading, any kind of arts or crafts, and home repair or building projects. You can also try dancing, martial arts, geocaching, writing, learning new languages, playing challenging board games, hiking and camping, or gardening.

, Many studies have found that exercise boosts concentration, learning, and brain health. Exercise also helps in the formation of new brain cells. Many people are so attached to technology that they don’t get out and exercise. Put away your phones, laptops, and televisions and get active.Aerobic exercise has brain boosting effects. Try walking, jogging, running, swimming, dancing, cycling, or a cardio class at the gym.
Low impact exercise can also be beneficial. Yoga and tai chi can help improve your mental functioning.

, Many people find nature to be calming and relaxing. It can provide a much-needed boost to your mental well-being. Find a local park, trail, mountain, forest, or beach, and spend some time outside. Use this time to hike, write in a journal, or meditate.

Some places may not have a strong phone signal. Do not worry, but do let someone know where you are going ahead of time. Get a trail map if available, and heed all posted warnings.

Throw away unnecessary items.,
Create binders for important items in your life.,
Put hooks and shelves on the walls.,
Invest in storage bins.",How to Improve Organizational Skills2," De-cluttering is essential first step in organizing your home. Dump out drawers and remove unnecessary items, throw away expired food, throw out or donate clothes and shoes you haven’t worn in over a year, properly dispose of expired medications, throw out or consolidate empty or half-empty toiletries, and any other items you don’t absolutely need. , Create labeled binders for “Auto Insurance”, “Vacation”, “Receipts”, “Budget”, and any other important item or even in your life.


Try color coding your binders. Blue for Receipts (gas, grocery, clothes), Red for Insurance (auto, home, life), etc.
Keep the binders on an organized shelf.

, Use the often underutilized vertical space in your home. Purchase hooks to hang up bikes in your garage and stand alone (floating) shelves to make efficient and decorative organization spaces.

, Like organizing your office, purchase bins and baskets to put all of your things into. Put similar objects into the same bin and have a system to store your bins. Buy bins and baskets of all sizes to organize everything in your home including utensils, make-up, stuffed animals, food, shoes, and trinkets.

"
"
Purchase organization bins.,
Purchase a labelling machine.,
File your information by “how you will use it”.,
Create an outline or “Table of Contents” of your organized office.,
Create “to do” and “done” spaces on your desk.,
Throw away things you do not need.,
Organize your computer.",How to Improve Organizational Skills3," Visit a store that sells organizing bins (The Container Store, Walmart, Target, The Home Depot, Lowes, IKEA, dollar stores, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc.) and pick up at least ten. Buy bins of all different sizes to fit pens, papers, and larger items. Buy bins, baskets, file drawers, and any other object that can contain your things.

, What is the point of having all of your things in nice storage bins if you do not know what is in each bin? Use a labelling machine to label each bin appropriately. For example, have one bin labeled “Writing Supplies” where you keep pens, pencils, and highlighters, and another bin labeled “Tools” that has scissors, staplers, staple removers, and hole punchers. Label absolutely everything including your files, drawers, and cabinets.

, Instead of putting an item in a file based on where you got it, file it based on how you will use it in the future. For example, if you have documentation for the hotel you will be staying at in New York on your business trip, file that in your “New York” file, instead of your “Hotel” file. Create sub files. Have a “Hotel” file, but then have multiple “city” files for the places you travel to often.

, You might have everything organized, but you might not remember where every item was placed. Type up a list of each box or bin you created and what is inside of it for quick, future reference.


This list will also help you put things back where they belong after you remove them.

, Have two specific areas on your desk for things that need to be done (papers to sign, reports to read, etc…) and a pile for things you have completed. By making separate areas, you will not confuse yourself on what you have or have not done.

, As you are putting your things into the boxes and bins you have acquired, throw away items you do not need. Dispose of things you have not touched or opened in a year, all broken items, and return extra supplies. You can shred old papers and ask you coworkers if they are interested in any of the things you are disposing.
If you are struggling to throw something away, try donating it instead.

, You can organize tangible objects around you, but having a disorganized computer will limit productivity and make you feel disorganized still. Create new folders and subfolders to put files into, organize your desktop so you can easily find specific items, remove duplicate files, name documents with detailed titles, and delete unnecessary apps and documents. "
"
Spend ten minutes a day doing a quick pick-up.,
If you are adding a new item to your life, dispose of an old item.,
Keep a “Donate” box out at all times.,
When you see an open drawer, close it.,
Harness technology to help you stay organized.",How to Improve Organizational Skills4," You have spent your time organizing and putting everything in its rightful place, so keep it that way. Each night, set an alarm that signals a ten-minute period where you put away out of place objects, and ensure you bins and baskets are still organized. , Before you buy a new book, go through your book shelf and remove one that you have not or will not read. Donate or throw it away so hat your new item can take its place. Go a step further and get rid of two or three items for every new item.

, Have a box where you can throw items into to donate on hand at all times. As you notice an item you don’t want any more, immediately take it to the donate box.


When you have an unwanted item that cannot be donated, take it to the trash right away.

, Don’t wait for your ten-minute tidy-up time to stay organized. If you see something out of place, put it back right away. If you pass by a full trash can, empty it. When you see out of place papers, put them away. Make organization a habit to make it most effective.


Don’t spend too many precious minutes of your day doing small tidy jobs. Don’t go out out your way to close an open drawer. If you are getting up to go to a meeting, and the open drawer is on your way, then close it. If you interrupt your workflow to close a drawer, you will reduce your overall productivity by 25%! , There are literally thousands of apps you can use to keep yourself organized. There are many to do list apps, such as Evernote, reminder apps such as Beep Me, travel organizers such as TripIT, and apps to help organize the importance of your tasks, such as Last Time. Look for apps that will sync across your devices so they are accessible no matter where you are.

Try new things.,
Practice daily.,
Prepare for chaos.,
Fearlessly face failure.,
Watch and listen closely.,
Give special attention to the little details.,
Trust yourself.,
Say ""yes"" to nearly everything.,
Contribute.,
Commit with confidence.",How to Improvise," Life rarely runs according to plan, yet people have a tendency to cling to their to-do lists with stubborn determination. This can blind you to new opportunities, though, since you might be too fixated on your own plans to look beyond them at something even better.Additionally, it's also easy to spend your life making plans instead of actually getting things done.
If you tend to be an excessive planner, ease yourself out of your planning mode by tearing up your to-do list at least one day each week. Once you feel comfortable with one day, live spontaneously for two days each week. Continue in this manner until you've completely set aside the practice of planning everything beyond appointments and other scheduling essentials.;
, There is no one set path toward the future. You can look to others for examples of how life might work out, but ultimately, you need to step off the trail before you and create your own.


Understanding how the world works doesn't hurt, of course. Time-tested wisdom has its place, and general advice you receive on making progress personally and professionally often helps. The key is applying this general wisdom while planning your own steps instead of trying to exactly mimic the steps of others.

, Even though you shouldn't plan things out step-by-step, you still need to have a destination in mind. Otherwise, your life will become directionless instead of simply being improvised.Stay true to your hopes, dreams, and other primary goals. Instead of letting those things go in response to the actions and feelings of others, cling to your own wants while adjusting the path you take to reach them in response to others.

, It isn't enough to talk about getting things done. You need to actually get moving, which means taking action as soon as the desire strikes you.


Do not wait for the perfect starting point. The longer you wait, the greater your expectations will be, and the more difficult it will be for you to actually take those first few steps. Say or do the first thing that comes to mind and work from there.

, Even though you should start moving immediately, you also need to fall into a pace that feels comfortable and right to you.Don't expect to find your dream job as soon as enter the workforce. Aside from being unrealistic, fixating on the ideal job you have in your thoughts shuts the door on other opportunities lying directly in front of you.
This also means you'll need to quit looking around at your peers. It doesn't matter if the friends you had in school are financially more stable or settled into domestic tranquility. Their lives aren't yours and your life isn't theirs, so it stands to reason that your life will run at a separate pace.

, Put yourself into unfamiliar situations to build your confidence and open yourself to new possibilities. Start small, then work your way up to bigger and better adventures.


For instance, a small risk might be trying a new food or learning a new hobby. Once you become comfortable with small risks like these, you can move onto bigger ones, like traveling to a foreign country or investing money in a new business venture.

, You likely improvise in your daily life without even realizing it. Passive improvising will only help to a certain point, however. If you really want to get good at it, you need to intentionally improvise a little each day.


Throughout the day, look for opportunities to confront the unknown and the unexpected. Talk to a stranger. Engage in a conversation covering an unfamiliar topic. Take a different route on your way home from work.
Simply changing one small aspect of your daily routine will force you to improvise in a small way, making it easier for you to grow comfortable with the practice of improvising in general.

, Life is chaotic, whether you're actively improvising your way through it or not. When you commit to improvising, though, you also commit to accepting the inevitable and unpredictable change life introduces to you.


It's okay to feel insecure at times, but once you grow to expect the unexpected, it should gradually seem less intimidating overall. As such, the insecurity you feel now may lessen later on.

, Failure is inevitable. If you live your life being afraid to fail, you won't move forward and you won't be able to make the most of each mistake you're confronted with.


Each mistake doubles as an opportunity, so think of failure as an essential part of growing stronger and smarter. When you fail, reflect on what happened and figure out how to avoid the same sort of difficulty in the future.
As you let go of fear, you'll also become more confident and more skilled at adapting to the unexpected.

, Before you can react to something, you will need to have a good understanding of what you're reacting to. When considering someone's words and actions, though, you need to look at the deeper meaning as well as the surface meaning.Resist the temptation to multitask. The vast majority of people don't actually multitask well, so focusing on one task at a time will keep you more focused and improve your understanding.
Maintain eye contact when talking with people to let them know that you're actively engaged in conversation. Eye contact also allows you to read nonverbal communication more effectively.
Try to empathize with the people you're around in any situation. Put yourself in their shoes so that you can understand their needs and wants, and react accordingly.

, While it's true that grand gestures can leave lasting impressions, remembering and using the little details of everyday life can actually impress people more.


Little details, like the names of a coworker's children or beloved pet, are easy to miss when you're fixated on big plans. Most people tend to ignore them completely unless they really care about someone. By taking the time to acknowledge these details, you show others that you care about them and leave a more favorable impression with those people.
Leaving good impressions with the people around you can help propel you forward and open up the door to new opportunities you couldn't find on your own.

, Your past and current experiences have informed you and shaped you into the person you are today. It can be easy to doubt yourself, especially in the midst of other experienced individuals, but you need to trust your intuition, thoughts, and feelings.


Public speaking is a good way to practice this principle. Instead of writing out exact notes the next time you need to make a speech, write questions that you need to address during that speech. As a result, it should be easier to weave details into the presentation as you go along, making the whole thing appear more natural.

, You don't have to accept every proposed solution, but you do need to accept every set of circumstances life throws at you.In other words, you need to remain positive. Instead of fixating on how unpleasant a given situation feels, acknowledge the situation and focus on making the most of it.
Keep an open mind, too. Instead of immediately discrediting an idea, take the time to look at things from the other person's perspective, even when you ultimately disagree with that perspective. Make saying “no” to someone or something your last option, only to be used after thoroughly reviewing all of the evidence before you.

, Instead of merely saying ""yes"" to things, you should be saying, ""yes, and..."" Add your own value to each set of circumstances or ideas to guide things toward your ultimate goal.


For instance, when you're given a project to work on with a group of your peers, don't be afraid to voice your thoughts. Do so even when the others in your group are more experienced than you. You may not have the final answer, but your thoughts could still help move the project along in the right direction.

, Have confidence in the things you say and do, and stand behind your conclusions instead of questioning them under pressure.


Indecision is the enemy of both improvising and progress in general. Don't apologize for your thoughts and don't be shy about sharing them. Instead, simply make an informed choice and see it through, worrying about the results only as they actually happen.
As soon as you commit to something, you need to sharpen your focus on that thought, idea, or action. Second-guessing yourself will weaken your ability to react to all aspects of the situation, and it may cause you to prematurely abandon a plan that was actually quite decent.

Be patient.",How to Get Into the Habit of Using a Day Planner," There are many different kinds of day planner, suited to different tasks and personalities.Some day planners are very simple lined notebooks; other day planners have different sections for different kinds of tasks. Take a few moments to think about why it is you want to use a day planner and what you would use it for. It is very important to consider these questions because you will be more likely to use your day planner if it becomes your sole planning tool: keeping more than one day planner at a time will be confusing and will defeat the purpose. Ask yourself:


Will I need a section for phone numbers?
Will I use it primarily for remembering appointments?
Do I want a day planner that lasts for more than one year?
Do I want my day planner to replace another organizing tool (such as my to-do lists)?
Do I want a simple, plain notebook, or one with lots of different features and sections?
Would I rather have a day planner that is small enough to fit in a pocket or one that is large enough to handle notes from my meetings?Do I want a day planner that provides more space for weekdays, or will I need my day planner primarily for weekend activities?;
, Day planners can be purchased at a variety of stores, such as office supply shops, stationery stores, calendar stores, and online. They can cost anywhere from just a few dollars to over $50.While the aesthetics of your day planner are important, pay attention first and foremost to the layout and sections of the day planner. Make sure that the day planner you purchase is organized in a way that you find pleasing and that makes sense given your lifestyle and responsibilities.

, Even though function is the most important thing, you will be more likely to get in the habit of using a day planner that you find attractive and pleasing to the eye.Some day planners are very simple, with just a plain black leather cover. Others are bright and whimsical, with lots of designs and elaborate patterns. Any aesthetic is fine as long as it accords with professional decorum in your workplace.


Pay attention to the aesthetics of the inside of the planner as well as the outside. Some people prefer unlined pages to lined pages, for example. Some people like symmetry; others might like more dynamic layouts. You might also prefer certain typefaces to others. Make sure that you find your day planner pleasant to look at--inside and out--in order to further incentivize your daily use of it., Your day planner won't do you much good if you can't write anything down in it. Be sure to keep lots of sharpened pencils and working pens in places you are most likely to use your day planner. These include:


Your briefcase or work bag
Your purse
Your work desk
Your desk at home
Close to your landline phones
If you are someone who consistently loses pens and pencils, consider storing an emergency pencil inside your day planner itself. Some day planners even have a little bit of storage space you could use for a spare pencil.

, People who make a solid commitment are more likely to be able to keep those commitments. Habits are very difficult to change, but telling yourself that you are resolved to do one small thing differently will help you develop a new habit.Remember that good habits are more likely to form when you are concentrating on just one at a time, so do not overload yourself with new time management habits. For now, focus solely on keeping your day planner., People are more likely to stick to new habits when their communities are aware of their resolution and can support them.Talk to a friend or coworker about your new resolution. Perhaps your friend will also want to begin this new and useful habit. You can remind each other to update it when necessary.

, Use your day planner as your only calendar: if you use two day planners simultaneously, you will quickly lose track of your responsibilities. However, this can be tricky because you will need to enter items into your day planner at work and at home. To make sure that you always have your day planner with you, designate one storage place for work and one storage place for home.Never place your day planner anywhere else: consistency is key to developing this habit.


Great places to store your day planner at home include a table next to your landline, your work bag or briefcase, or next to your cell phone and car keys.
Great places to store your day planner at work include on top of your desk, the central drawer of your desk, next to your work phone, or in your briefcase.

, When you are first getting used to using your day planner, you will likely forget to bring it with you to work or home. To prevent this from happening, write yourself reminder notes in prominent places at work and at home. Studies show that a post-it reminder is one of the most effective ways to encourage a particular behavior.Use this method on yourself by leaving post-its asking ""Have you remembered your day planner?"" in places you are sure to see. These include:


Your laptop
On top of your desk
Next to your phone
On your door
On your kitchen table
On the bathroom mirror
You can remove these notes after you have developed the habit of bringing your day planner with you to work and back home.

, When you first purchase a planner, you will have to enter in a great deal of information. You will likely have previously scheduled appointments, ongoing work tasks, and random bits of information floating around. Take an hour or two to consolidate all this scattered information into your day planner. This will allow you to practice entering information in the correct way. It will also allow you to plan your time more effectively moving forward. Things to enter into your planner include:


Important contact information for your family, friends, colleagues, and clients
Work meetings
Your class schedule
Deadlines for work or school projects
Shift changes (if you work a job without a consistent schedule)
Medical and dental appointments
The birthdays of your loved ones
Special work events
Special personal events
Key dates for your hobbies or extracurricular activities (e.g. the dates of your play rehearsal or your zumba class)

, Before you head in to work each morning, examine your day planner for upcoming appointments, meetings, and responsibilities.Take a minute to consider whether there are any tasks you need to add to your schedule or any tasks you might cross off or reschedule. Use this time to plan your day so that you can manage your time wisely once you arrive at work., Before you leave work for the day, consult your day planner again. Make sure that you have accomplished everything you have set out to do for the day.Consider whether any new items should be entered into your day planner for the coming week. Always update your day planner before you leave work to ensure that you are keeping track of your work responsibilities., Think of your day planner as a positive item in your life, not as a drag or a bore. Use your planner as a means of rewarding yourself for accomplishing tasks.Soon you will aim to finish tasks simply for the pleasure of crossing an item off of your to-do-list. In order to keep yourself positively reinforced, you should:


Cross off all accomplishments and appointments as you finish them. When you are feeling low, take a look at everything you have crossed off and feel proud of everything you've done.Give yourself a reward for accomplishing a certain number of tasks. Allow yourself a small treat for every 5 items you cross off your day planner. For example, treat yourself to a coffee or a short walk once you have hit your desired goal. This will motivate you to use your day planner properly as well as to accomplish your tasks.
Do something pleasant when you consult your day planner. Try not to think of your time consulting your day planner as a chore. Instead, look at it as a key productivity tool. In order to associate your day planner with positive feelings instead of negative ones, do something pleasant every morning and afternoon when you look at your planner. Drink a cup of delicious coffee, have a chocolate, or listen to your favorite song. Your brain will soon associate your planner with positive feelings.
Give yourself a special treat for every week you use your day planner properly. While you are still in the early stages of keeping your day planner, you might need to give yourself some extra motivation to bring your day planner with you and update it each day. For every week where you remember to bring along and update your day planner, do something extra nice for yourself: buy an ice cream, go to a movie, or have a drink with friends. In a few weeks, you will be in the habit of remembering your day planner at all times.
Write positive things in your day planner as well as your more serious responsibilities. By using your day planner to remind you of your favorite activities (having lunch with a friend) as well as your not-so-favorite activities (seeing the dentist), you will be more likely to stick to your new habit., During your morning and evening check-ins, you should enter all of your new to-do lists, appointments, meetings, and deadlines.You can also update your day planner as new tasks arise. Keeping your day planner updated will help you manage your time more effectively and will prevent you from feeling too overwhelmed. By writing a task down, you no longer have to keep it in your head, which helps to prevent those terrible feelings of nagging and doubt.


If you find yourself getting overloaded, shift some items into a separate ""backlog"" category that you can work your way through at an easy pace. Don't demotivate yourself by staring at tasks that can never be accomplished in a normal workday., New habits can sometimes take two or more months to become fully automatic. Until the habit is ingrained, you might experience some forgetful times when you leave your day planner at home or forget to enter an appointment. Be patient and forgiving with yourself. Remember that habits take time to form, and that the occasional slip-up will not affect your ability to form a new habit.It might be useful to have a back-up plan in place for those times when you've forgotten your day planner at home. For example, you might enter new work appointments on post-it notes and bring those home with you to enter. For extremely important events and deadlines, you can also use an online task manager to send you timely reminders: that way, you will not forget a key date even if you forget your planner.

Try taking some time to examine what matters to you and what you want to achieve over the course of your life. Some questions you might ask yourself include:What makes me happy?
What are my natural skills and abilities?
What do I want out of my life?
What do people say I am good at?
What might I regret if I go my whole life without trying?
What do I have strong beliefs about?
What do I value most in my life?;
, Consider the things in your life that keep you so busy. Think about which of these things are the most important and which could be cleared out of your life as excess clutter.Try writing down all the things you do in one day to give yourself some perspective on what is making your life so busy.
For example, if you get coffee on your way to work every day, this might be a thing that just adds to your sense of busyness in your life. Consider making coffee at home every day so that you can feel like you have a little more down time.

, When you have a busy life, it is important to fill what little free time you have with things that make you happy. One of the best ways to do this is to spend time with people who are important to you.Try to make the most of your time together by dedicating yourself to the quality time. Don’t try to answer emails while you spend time with your family or friends. Do that later. Be present in the moment.
Even though it might be hard to carve out the time, try to prioritize this.
Try scheduling a fun activity that everyone will enjoy. Make dinner plans with your parents or take your kids to the park. Go to a movie with your friends or schedule a night out with your favorite colleagues.

, Incorporate things you are passionate about into your life. If you have to lead a busy life, it should be filled with things you are passionate about whenever possible. Go after a job you love or engage in hobbies that make you happy.Being passionate about what you do will make your busy life seem much more fulfilling.
A good way to do this is to choose something you are passionate about that you have to practice daily. If you love playing golf, incorporate that into your life as your relaxation activity. If you love reading, join a book club or become a teacher. That way, you might be busy reading, but it’ll be doing something you love.

, When your life is busy, you always feel like you have a million things to do. In order to love your busy life, you need to figure out how to prioritize the things that matter the most so that you always complete the most essential tasks.This is especially important when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Focus on one task at a time, starting with the most important. Then just work your way down the list.
If you feel like you have too many things to accomplish on a daily basis, you should write down your “to do” list with the most important things at the top. For example, you could list unavoidable work commitments first, followed by family functions and social obligations, and list everything else after. This will help you put your to do list into perspective so you can see where certain things might be able to be cut out.

, Many people fill their lives with things – cars, homes, furniture, clothes, etc. – because they think it will make them happy. But usually these things just end up being empty possessions. If your life is busy because you are working too much so that you can afford more things, consider simplifying your life so that you can focus more on things that truly make you happy – like spending time with people you love or going on new adventures.Instead of buying a new car, spend that money on a vacation with your family. Creating memories with people you love is a better way to enjoy your busy life than spending money on something you don’t necessarily need.
Try to minimize your desire for possessions and downsize the possessions you already have. If you have a closet full of clothes you rarely wear, donate some of them to charity. Sell or donate all your kids toys or clothes they’ve outgrown.

, If you are having trouble enjoying your life because it has gotten so busy and hectic, then you might need to schedule in some time for yourself to just relax. Try to treat relaxation and self-care as necessary things that you need to fit into your everyday life. Some things that you can do to relax and take care of yourself include:


Practicing a relaxation technique such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation for 15 minutes every day.
Making plenty of time for self-care, such as taking a bath, getting your hair done, giving yourself a manicure, or preparing a healthy meal for yourself.
Doing things that you enjoy such as knitting, watching a favorite TV show, reading a book, or playing with your pet.

, While being so busy with our work, we often forget to enjoy our beautiful lives. It isn't that hard to embrace the life you have. Just live in the moment, live for today, and focus on the small things (at least some of the time) like laughing at the jokes you hear while doing your work. These things will help you to enjoy every bit of your life, even when you have a busy one.
This means not holding on to grudges or staying upset about something that happened yesterday. Forget about how mad you are at your mother and move forward. Call her and smooth things over.
Appreciate things as they happen to you. Recognize when good things happen and be grateful instead of taking them for granted.

, This can also be called ""me time."" Take a few quiet minutes with yourself away from your busy schedule. Contemplate the things that make your life so busy and whether or not they are really necessary. Reflect on what’s really important and consider whether or not you can cut out some of the things that make you so busy.Being busy means that your life is full of things and people you have chosen. So, even though your busy life can often be stressful, it is also a blessing.

, Spending dedicated time with your friends and family will definitely keep you happy and make you appreciate your life even if it is a busy one. Besides, this way, it won't bother you to have a busy life because you’ll be enjoying it with people you love when you’re able to.If you have to get some work done while you’re away with your family, dedicate a specific window of time to this task rather than just working constantly off and on all day.

, When our lives get busy, it’s easy to focus on what we don’t have because we feel like we are working so hard. You might find yourself thinking things like, ""Oh! I don't have this"" or ""Oh! I don't have that."" Stop complaining about what you may not have or haven't done yet. This kind of negative attitude won’t help you enjoy your life more.Take a breath and be contented with what you have, or with what you have done so far. Remember that you might complain about your busy life while others might be so jealous of the life you lead. Keeping this kind of perspective will make help you be more satisfied with yourself, as well as your life.

, Besides ""me time,"" make a habit of reminding yourself to be grateful at least three times a day. When you wake up, be thankful for being able to live for another day. When you notice yourself thinking negatively, pause for a moment to take stock of your life and think about what you have to be grateful for. Consider all the things you take for granted on a daily basis.During your lunch break, be grateful for having a job while others are in need of one. At night, be thankful for each of the tasks you completed. This will bring a huge change in life.

, Having a busy life probably means that you are busy working towards a goal of some sort. Whether your goal is planning for retirement, getting your kids through college, or working toward the life of your dreams, it’s important to keep the end goal in mind so that you can stay focused and on the right track. This will help you love your busy life.Set realistic, positive goals for yourself and plan out how to achieve them. This is a step-by-step process that takes time. But working toward your goals will lead to more satisfaction with your busy life."

Reward yourself for a job well done.",How to Get Things Done," It'll be easier to get a task done if you have all the supplies on hand to do it. Avoid wasting time looking for tools or documents by having them all accessible and organized from the beginning.;
, Even though you may just want to do this in your head, actually writing it down has a huge impact.


Try to be specific and reasonable. For example, don't write 'continue novel' or 'clean house.' Instead, write things such as 'write 500 words' or 'tidy the living room floor.' Small, achievable tasks are best. If you have a big goal in mind, try breaking it down into smaller steps on your list.






Don't get too distracted by the list. If list-making is taking more time than just getting down to work, put it aside and start being productive.






If tasks have a deadline, mark them on. This will help you in prioritizing.







Prioritize the tasks. A simple numbering system works well - you can decide to either prioritize the tasks that need to get done first, or get particularly hard/long tasks out of the way first. Alternative, you might even opt to start with a few shorter/easier tasks so that you can knock a few off the list quickly.







,


Shed light on the situation. If it is day, open the curtains. If it is night, turn on the brightest lights. This will have a psychological impact on you.






List all the advantages of completing the goal you have. Come up with as many things as you can. For example, if your goal is to make friends with a colleague, don't just say 'I will have a new friend.' Instead, advantages can include: I can meet people from their social circles; Our work can be more enjoyable; We can learn from each other; They may encourage me on days when I feel demotivated etc.






Tell people when you will be finished by. This is a very powerful tool for getting things done as it increases the pressure on you. Tell as many people as you can and emphasize how good your finished thing shall be.






Set rewards for yourself.






Open the windows if you can to let in fresh air.







, Some people prefer to work in silence; others like to have music on. Also, find what type of music is best. While most find relaxing, gentle music best for homework, college assignments, etc; others don't. Most people find that the type of music varies from task to task (e.g. fast music for cleaning or relaxing music for paperwork).


Remember that you may not be able to play music for the task. For example, you may not be allowed to play music at work/school.






Try not to play music that you will be tempted to sing along with.







, Distractions can include phones, emails, social media, family etc. Whatever is deterring you from working needs to be removed. If you are being distracted every 15 minutes, you will get little work done because it is impossible to get immediately back to work after a distraction. For most people this takes 5 - 10 minutes.


Consider letting your family members, coworkers/classmates, or housemates know that you're buckling down to work on something important, so that they won't distract you.







, Many people believe that multitasking increases productivity, but the truth is tackling things one at a time will allow you to complete more in less time.


Break tasks into smaller chunks if needed. One huge job can seem overwhelming, but if you break it down into sections, it becomes more manageable. For example, ""write an essay"" seems big, but if you start with ""brainstorm ideas"" and ""write a topic sentence,"" each part becomes a much smaller and more achievable goal.
As you do each task, check it off your to-do list. This feels great, and can motivate you to keep going down the list.







, The breaks should be no longer then 8-10 minutes. During this time you should stretch and exercise a bit. This will help you come back to the task with more focus, and keep at it for a longer period of time overall.

, In particular, drink lots of water. Your brain and body can only work properly if you are hydrated. While drinks and snacks can be distracting, they also help keep your energy up. If you're thirst or hungry, don't ignore these feelings - take care of them, and get back to work.

, This may seem tedious, but a tidy space means a tidy mind.

, This shouldn't be a problem if you've already removed the main distractions before beginning work, but if you hear your phone ring, or get a Facebook alert, ask yourself: is it worth breaking my work flow? If there's something urgent you need to take care of, do, but if it's something you can take care of later, wait for your break.

, If you lose site of why you're working so hard, look back at your to-do list and try to refocus on your motivation. If needed, taking a few moments to re-adjust your mindset like this will help you stay on task.

, Give yourself the rewards you had promised yourself. Be honest with yourself - if you do not complete the task, do not reward yourself.

De-program your mindset.,
Start listing what you really think about things.,
Make a decision to dispose of the things that don't fit with who you really are and what you really think.,
Now and then, the old ""faked"" self way of thinking will bleed through.,
Stand up for yourself.",How to Stop Being Fake," It has probably taken months and even years to program yourself to think like the ""populars"", the ""cool set"", the ""hipsters"", or whatever other allegiance you've allied yourself to. And that thinking isn't going to go away overnight. For a time, you will still see things through the lenses of the group think you adopted, so you need to be patient, persistent, and consistent with overturning this thinking.;
,


What are your values? How do these differ from those of the group you were formerly a part of?
What are your thoughts about major political, social, economic, and cultural issues?
What are your preferred fashion do's and don'ts? Do you even like the trends of the group you were part of?
Has there been a side of yourself you have been repressing just to get along with the old group? List the things about yourself that you think haven't been properly expressed in a long time.

, If you are still struggling to define what it is that you value and think, then you'll need to spend some more time on this step until things firm up more for you. You can test yourself by reading popular culture in the papers, magazines, and online and asking yourself questions all the time about what you think of the issues as presented. You'll start to form your ideas more clearly as you do so.

, Don't get upset or frustrated. Quietly acknowledge that this is happening and choose to abandon this line of thinking. Restore the balance by thinking the way you want to do so now. Remind yourself through questions:


Instead of saying ""What should I think?"" or ""What would he/she think?"" say ""What do I think?""
Ask yourself how you truly feel about absolutely everything. Even down to the food you eat, the clothes you wear, and the route you travel home each day.

, The hardest part about undoing a faked personality is learning to stand up for the person you really are. You will need to be very gentle on yourself because this part is going to be hard to begin with but it gets easier with practice. Your initial knee-jerk reaction may be to respond as you would have done within the group but stop yourself, breathe deeply, and clearly voice your opinion.


If you disagree with someone, then don't be afraid to do so. Just be polite although firm, and say that your thoughts on the matter differ from theirs.
Respect yourself and the other person through use of polite language, manners, and by articulating yourself clearly.
If someone becomes difficult or pushy with their opinions, simply let them know that you respect them but that you will be agreeing to disagree. Take a break from them if it gets too hard to deal with.

Note the physical signs of emotion.,
Breathe deeply.,
Don’t butt in.,
Get a rain check.,
Use other strategies to manage your stress.",How to Stop Being Confrontational1," Most often anger, frustration, or some other strong emotion is behind our tendency to lash out at others. Emotion puts you in a fight-or-flight mode, which means that your body will show physical signs of increased tension. Learn to recognize these signs – it will help you nip your reaction in the bud and lessen the chance of confrontation.Pay attention to how you feel. Are you tense, anxious, or frustrated? Do you feel your heart starting to race? Your emotions are rising.
Note your body language, too. Our emotional state often translates into the body language we take, and you may be showing an aggressive posture. Are you frowning or sneering? Have you clenched your fists into balls? Do you have something to say? You may also have a strong urge in a confrontational mood to interrupt.;
, You’re more likely to be combative and less likely to process information and listen when your body is in a fight-or-flight mode. To calm yourself, try to breathe slowly and with measured breaths. This should help to relax your central nervous system.Breathe deliberately. Inhale and exhale slowly, counting to five both ways, and take a long and deep breath before saying anything.
Don’t talk too fast! Slow down if your thoughts and speech are racing and remember to breathe.

, When you’re feeling confrontational, you want to dispute and challenge other people. Interrupting to quibble about a point or a criticism is a dead give-away that you’re being difficult and is not helpful behavior – it makes you seem aggressive and insecure. It also means that your emotions are still out of control.Make yourself count to ten every time that you have the urge to interrupt. It’s likely that the conversation will have passed to something else after ten seconds and your point won’t matter. Try going all the way to twenty if you’re still tempted.
Make an effort to stop when you butt in, too. Catch yourself, stop talking, and apologize to the other person for rudely interrupting.

, You might find that your emotions are too high to have a calm discussion. In that case, ask the other person if you can continue the conversation later and politely excuse yourself. No one will benefit from a talk if you’re being overly confrontational.


Put off the conversation, but don’t avoid it. Ask for a rain check, i.e. “Bill, can we have this talk a bit later? Now’s not a good time for me. How are you later this afternoon?”
Express the importance of the conversation to the other person as you excuse yourself, too, i.e. “I realize that this subject is important for you, Tasha, and I want to discuss it calmly with you. But I’m sort of worked up at the moment. Let’s try later.”

, Emotion and confrontation breed stress. Try to find strategies so that you can better manage your stress, relax, and release the tension that is behind your tendency to be combative. Less stress will also improve your physical wellbeing.Experiment with techniques that slow your breathing, focus your mind, and relax your body. Learn to meditate, for example, or try yoga or tai chi.
Other forms of exercise also have a relaxing effect. You’ll feel more at ease and calm after walking, running, team sports, swimming, or other kinds of workouts.

Visualize accomplishing your goals.,
Focus on your successes.,
View setbacks as learning opportunities.,
Set realistic goals.,
Document your progress.",How to Stop Getting Discouraged1," Envision how happy you'll be when you earn that promotion at work or meet your weight loss goal. Focus on the positive outcome of accomplishing your goals, rather than becoming discouraged about how far away that goal might seem.For example, if you want to save up for a vacation, decide how much money you'll need for the trip and brainstorm how you can reach your goal. Don't get overwhelmed if it feels daunting at first. Maybe you'll skip your morning latte or get rid of cable for a year to save up. Envision how happy you'll be as you progress toward having enough money to take your vacation.;
, Avoid focusing on past failures or struggles, which can be very discouraging.Instead, focus on your successes and the actions you can take moving forward to achieve your goals.


If you've been trying to lose weight and you have a bad weekend where you overeat and forget to workout, don't beat yourself up over it. Instead, focus on what you did right, such as getting right back on track on Monday morning or giving your body and mind a break for the week. Focusing on what you did right instead of focusing on your mistakes helps keep you encouraged and in a happier mindset.

, Everyone has failed at something at some point. Remember that just because you experience a setback does not mean that you are a failure. Setbacks are just opportunities to learn what did and didn't work for next time.


If you experience a setback, try not to dwell on the negative. Dwelling on your setbacks is discouraging and unproductive, so try to look for the opportunities in the setback instead.
For example, losing a job could be an opportunity to find a more fulfilling one or to go back to school. The end of a relationship might be a chance to focus more on loving yourself and cultivating your friendships., Unrealistic goals set you up for discouragement, so be sure that the goals you hope to accomplish are realistic and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. Remember that progress takes time, and for most personal goals, results will not happen overnight.


Be sure to break up large goals into smaller steps so you feel better able to conquer them. For example, instead of making a goal of running a marathon this year, work your way up to that goal by making your first goal to complete a 5K run.

, Seeing physical proof of your accomplishments is important. Having visual proof of your progress will make you feel better and keep you encouraged to keep working toward your goals.For example, you might chart weight loss in a journal, jot down when you pay off a credit card, or keep a tally of your growing savings account. Every little bit counts, and documenting your progress will help you see how far you've come.

Rehearse beforehand.,
Use “I” statements.,
Avoid counter-criticism.,
Don’t take things personally.",How to Stop Being Confrontational2," There is a big difference between being confrontational and expressing yourself honestly and assertively. One is aggressive, the other is calm but firm. If you have problems with being confrontational, give yourself the best chance to stay calm by practicing. Know what you want to say beforehand.Think of the points that you want to get across to others. Say them out loud or write them down so that they are imprinted in your memory.
Practice until you have your points planned out like a script. This way, you can check yourself if you get derailed and come back to the script.

, Another good way to be assertive but not confrontational is to use “I” statements. “I” statements let you speak for yourself – that is, they express your thoughts and opinions without coming off as accusatory or putting words into someone else’s mouth. Favor these sentences rather than those starting with “you.”For instance, say something like “I’m not inclined to agree” rather than “You’re wrong.” Or, “I feel under pressure right now” rather than “You’re always attacking me.”
“I” statements are also useful in expressing your wants or desires, i.e. “I’d like some help around the house” instead of “You never help me with housework.” Or, “I would appreciate more support from you” rather than “You only look out for yourself.”

, To become less confrontational, you will need to develop the ability to take and give feedback respectfully. This can take self-control and openness. More than anything, avoid the temptation to lash out and to criticize when a friend, loved one, or co-worker is trying to give you feedback.Resist the urge to criticize a person who is giving you feedback or an opinion, i.e. “You’re just being a jerk, Tim” or “I can’t believe that you, of all people, would say that to me.”
Also try to avoid deflecting criticism back onto a person, i.e. “What are you talking about, Jim, you do the same thing all the time!”

, Avoiding confrontation will require you to be more patient and less reactive. Don’t immediately read criticism as an attack and try to give your friends, peers, and loved ones the benefit of the doubt. They are most likely not trying to provoke you.


Ask yourself why you feel under attack. Is it because you feel offended? Do you feel ganged up on? Are you lashing out because of frustration?Think a bit about who is giving you feedback. Family members and loved ones will probably not attack you but are trying to help out of love.

"

Give others a fair hearing.,
Suspend your judgement.,
Paraphrase.,
Affirm what you’ve heard.",How to Stop Being Confrontational3," To be less confrontational, try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes and understand how he or she feels. This is called empathy and it begins with listening. Hear others out, learn to listen effectively, and learn to listen actively.Try to focus on what the other person is expressing. Listen – you don’t have to say anything at all to start. Just let him speak his mind.
Resist the urge to interrupt. You will have a chance to express your side of the story. Meanwhile, try to convey that you’re paying attention by giving cues like nodding your head or by saying “Yes” or “I understand.” Try to do this without butting in.

, Ignore your own opinions and feelings for the time being, until your peer has said his or her piece. This will be challenging, but keep in mind that your goal is not to interpolate your viewpoint but to understand the other person’s. Focus on this other experience.All that you are doing is to suspend your judgement and opinions. It doesn’t mean you will have to accept the other person’s perspective, just to temporarily let go.
For starters, don’t disregard the other person’s views out of hand. It is rude and confrontational to tell someone that they should just “Get over it” or “Deal with it.”

, One way that you can listen more intently to another person and take in what they are saying is to engage with them actively. Try paraphrasing. This is when you restate what you’ve heard in slightly different words to make sure that you understand correctly. You might also ask questions.For instance, repeat back the main point once your peer has said something, i.e. “So, what you’re saying is that you don’t think I respect you” or “So, you seem to think that I’m too confrontational. Is that it?”
Paraphrasing shows that you’re listening respectfully to the other person. It also helps you better grasp his or her perspective.
Try asking some questions, too. Aim for open-ended questions to draw out more of a response. Ask something like “Why is it specifically that you think I don’t listen? Can you give some examples?”

, People will appreciate it if you take a moment to affirm their views. You can do this even if you don’t agree. Just let your friends, loved ones, or colleagues know that you have listened to and understood what they’ve said.For instance, you could say something like “Well, James, I don’t exactly agree with you but I respect your position.” Or “Thanks for speaking freely, Fatima. I can tell this is important for you and will give it some thought.”

Choose optimism.,
Let go of anger.,
Let go of fear.,
Avoid comparing yourself to others.",How to Stop Getting Discouraged2," To overcome discouragement, you have to choose optimism and positivity. Even though this might feel forced or like you’re “faking it” at first, eventually your efforts will pay off. Rather than thinking you will fail at achieving your goal before you even start, believing that you can achieve it if you go slowly and work hard will help you accomplish your goal.If you have 50lbs to lose, for example, it can seem overwhelming. However, if you reframe your weight loss goal in a positive light and imagine that you only have to lose 5lbs ten times, then your goal seems more doable. Optimism and positive thinking are key to mentally framing your goals and subsequently achieving them.

, Anger over past mistakes or injustices will discourage you and make you feel inadequate. Acknowledge your anger and remember that while it’s okay to feel that way, it isn’t beneficial for you. Move past your anger and focus on your goals.Anger is often a manifestation of other emotions like frustration, insecurity, injustice, or feeling hurt. Try to channel your anger constructively. Healthy ways to Control Anger include deep breathing and taking a time out, for example.Relaxing distractions like reading or journaling are also helpful outlets for venting frustrations.

, Fear, just like anger, is toxic to encouragement and happiness. If you live in fear of failure or never accomplishing important goals, it can feel like your fears are paralyzing. Incorporating anxiety alleviating techniques is key to moving beyond your fears and avoiding discouragement and fear. It's important to address your fears so that you can adequately Deal With Anxiety.


For example, if you have to fly for work and you're afraid to fly, this can disrupt your plans to earn an excellent evaluation at work. Using exposure therapies and cognitive behavioral therapy helps you calm your fears and desensitizes you to the intimidating experience. Use Cognitive Behavioral Theory to help you face your fears and anxieties head-on., Comparing yourself to friends, family, or colleagues breeds anxiety and discouragement. You don’t know the struggles and discouragement those people went through to achieve what they have. You can only do your best, so focus inwardly on what you can do to achieve your goals. Avoid outward, surface-level comparisons to others, which only serve to discourage and distract you from accomplishing your goals."
"
Squeeze in a workout.,
Find a mentor.,
Journal daily.,
Treat yourself for accomplishments.,
Spend time with like-minded friends.,
Talk to a therapist.",How to Stop Getting Discouraged3," Exercise combats depression and elevates mood. If you find yourself feeling down or discouraged, make an effort to spend at least twenty minutes a day on exercise. If possible, go for a walk or jog outside in the fresh air and sunshine., If you are feeling discouraged at work, seek out the mentorship of a senior colleague. Your mentor should be someone who is positive and willing to work with you. Avoid trying to force a mentor relationship. Be sure to Find a Mentor with whom you think you will work well.


For example, if you are a new teacher and feel overwhelmed, ask a friendly colleague how they dealt with stress and discouragement when they were just starting out. Their wisdom and experience will be helpful, in addition to letting you know that you’re not alone in your feelings.

, Documenting goals, setbacks, and feelings will help keep you aware of how you’re progressing. Being aware of your feelings and how certain situations affect you is key to achieving balance and avoiding discouragement.


For example, did a setback at work make you especially discouraged this week? Did you ace a test that you studied hard for? Note good and bad feelings and experiences in your journal.
A gratitude journal is a great way to stave off discouragement. Start a Gratitude Journal and try to journal each day about something that went well for you or that you’re grateful for.
You can download journal and gratitude journal apps onto your phone, tablet, or computer, if you prefer. Otherwise, an old-fashioned notebook will work just as well.

, When you work hard on something and you achieve a goal, celebrate it! Go out for a nice meal, get a pedicure, or simply plan alone time for yourself to relax at home. No matter how small the goal, if you set a goal and accomplished it, it’s important to reward yourself., If you are trying to change your outlook from one of depression and discouragement, then you must surround yourself with others who express positivity and encouragement. Spend time with friends who support you and don’t question you for trying to change your outlook or accomplish your goals. Especially avoid those who belittle your goals and try to drag you down., Despite our best efforts, sometimes enlisting the help of a mental health professional is necessary to help us overcome feelings of discouragement and sadness. Therapists are trained to help you identify your stressors and can be invaluable for overcoming discouragement.


If you feel overwhelmed and discouraged and don’t think you are improving on your own, a licensed therapist will be able to encourage you and help you have a more positive outlook."

See the pain body as your benevolent teacher.",How to Stay Rooted in Being," This means to watch your breathing by feeling your belly movement, sound, inflow and outflow of air, gaps between inhaling and exhaling cycles, etc. It's all being run by the intelligence of your body, along with thousands of other bodily functions in a synchronous and accurate manner.""Because the practice of breath meditation takes us out of the activity of thought, it is an effective way to awaken. In fact, breath, because it has no form as such, has traditionally been equated with spirit, the formless One Life.In the German language, the word atmen, meaning ""breathing,"" is derived from atman, which in Sanskrit, the language of ancient India, refers to the innermost essence or universal self."";
, Can you just look, smell, touch, taste and listen, without any mental commentary? Focusing your attention on the sensation from the sense perceptions takes you out of the activity of thought and brings you into present.


Improve your posture. Such a simple thing as right posture can help you a lot to stay rooted in being. Have you noticed that you feel more relaxed and present when you put your legs on an object? It helps even more if you cross your legs. This is because when you do that you are more in contact with your sense perceptions (touch), as they take attention from the mind.
Keep and feel your feet connected to the ground. Focusing your attention to that sensation can calm you down dramatically.This is because you are replacing thought activity with the sensations from your sense perceptions (touch) and that's what anchors you in present moment.

, Can you feel the aliveness or energy field or spaciousness in your body? Your hands, chest, belly, waist, legs, face, head, lips, genitals etc? Just invite the presence and then feel.


This spaciousness or aliveness is always present within us but we can't feel it because we are lost in thoughts and emotions most of the time.
There is a saying in Zen: ""Breathe from your heels"". Does that make sense? They are talking about inner body.
Your body is like an ideal sink that absorbs the negativity and pain and all you are left with is immense peace of 'no mind'.
Being aware of your inner body not only anchors you into present moment but also strengthens your immune system. Your body loves your attention. It's like when the owner of the house is not there, all kinds of shady creatures like bugs, wasps, spiders, etc., get inside.
To help see how being aware of your inner body can increase the quality and creativity of your actions and words, here's a practice activity: from now on don't give 100% of your attention to the outer realm, like thoughts, objects, people etc. Just keep some attention within(inner body), and then monitor the quality of your life., It's subtle––what is being channeled? If you remain aware of your inner self for some time, you will notice how most of your consciousness or attention is consumed by thoughts. Its like a dirty window that doesn't let the sun shine through.


Being aware of your body creates a bridge between mind and body dimensions, which allows the mind-trapped consciousness to naturally flow into the body without any effort on your part. As this consciousness wants to become conscious of itself through you. So invite the presence in your life.
Can you keep some attention with in your body, breath and/or sense perceptions as you continue reading? Read How to Live in the Present (Spiritual Way) for more depth.

, Just be aware of your emotions. Don't think about them. Instead go deeper into your emotions and surrender to them.


If you can just single out the moment, you will observe that emotions are no more than energy movements, intense pressure, discomfort and physical movements in the space of body. It's the negative thoughts that come in response to them that make you unhappy and that's not you. Read How to Dissolve the Ego and Know Your True Self for more depth.
When you don't resist the flow of life (thoughts and emotions) within you, then 'low frequency' life energy naturally transforms into high frequency of consciousness and you become more aligned with universal intelligence. This is why there's great strength in non-reaction.

, Don't look at the concepts or words, but look where they point to. For example the word 'orange', for many people, points to a visual image of the fruit orange or the color orange. That is the conditioned mental interpretation of that word. However, when the human mind is given a phrase or object that it has never interpreted or labeled before, it will keep trying until it comes up with an interpretation on the basis of its conditioning and current information. As mind has a compulsive need to conceptualize or label things. So there is a possibility that your mind may come up with interpretation of the phrases 'being aware' or 'free yourself from concepts' etc. However, that interpretation would be another mind made concept.


This doesn't mean that labels or concepts are not to be used. In fact, they make the communication more easier and can be great pointers. So they are part of the journey to go beyond mind, but realize that doesn't matter how perfect the words or labels or concepts are, they are no more than stepping stones to be left as quickly as possible. According to a Zen saying, ""Finger (concept or thought) pointing to the moon (Non conceptual intelligence) is not the moon"".
True awareness is unconditioned, and non-conceptual. ""Can you just observe without adding any interpretation to anything?"" (Eckhart Tolle). Read How to Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth on this.

, In other words, be aware that your breathing doesn't change from 'automatic to manual' mode due to mind's interpretation of 'watching'. This means be aware or witness of your breath without any mental interference, rather than forcing yourself to breathe deeply. As this awareness will naturally restore its inherent depth.


Another example: Be aware, especially when you feel heavy emotions in your body, that 'watching your inner self' or ""allowing it to be"", doesn't get mentally interpreted as 'clinginess' or resistance or fighting.
For example: Have you noticed when you have a sore throat, you feel an impulse to swallow every few seconds to check if its healed or not? That's clinginess or interference and not a 'relaxed' awareness or alert seeing.
If you look closely, in any of the mentioned practices, in essence, there's no trying or effort involved but an alert watching or seeing..

, Physical workout in any form helps dissipate accumulated surplus energy from your body, which drastically reduces mind activity. Have you noticed that your thought activity is high when you didn't workout for few days?, Whenever you find yourself feeling fatigued or upset, listen to some peaceful music, watch some videos(like spiritual, funny or even entertaining), read some spiritual or even interesting text, or do something that you enjoy, replace it with affirmationsetc. You will notice that they work as a catalyst to help you become more present.


Its like we are replacing repetitive and negative thought(and emotional) content with constructive content or action. From there it becomes easier to become aware of present moment anchors like inner body, breath, sense perceptions etc. Read Practice 'Wheel of Awareness' Meditation to get more insight on this.
As an analogy: you are going along a fast flowing river(mental noise from years of conditioning) on an boat(constructive content or concept) as you cross the stream to get to the other shore(present moment).
Note: Its a journey and not a means to an end. Replacing clutter(mental noise) with more and more spiritual information in hope that it will get you enlightened fast, doesn't work. Spiritual growth is natural and essentially happens without any effort on your part. So get out of seeking mode and don't look for any other state than the one you are in now. , When you don't forgive yourself and others you are holding on to psychological burden of past and future. Thus you miss the present moment. ""I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear."" Martin Luther King, Jr. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) and Surrender to the Present Moment for more insight.

, Thoughts can be slippery, quick and brief, including and especially pre-verbalized thoughts, but they have a great power to manipulate us like a puppet. So a high degree of alertness is required.


It helps to write your recurring thoughts and reactions, including the thought that ""you have to write your thoughts"". Writing will help you give them full attention and full attention implies full acceptance.Alternatively, you can also record or verbalize your thoughts. Consciously verbalizing your inner state not only helps you to go deeply into your thought process (including emotions) but also make the unobserved patterns and irrationality of mind more conscious.
Also verbalizing makes you more aware of your sense perceptions (listening and touch). Since being aware of the sense perceptions is one of the anchors to stay rooted in being, it smooths the transition from a mind-dominated to a more aware state. Also verbalizing is like taking action, and taking action is a practical way to become present.
Its like listening to your never stopping mind. Just as a therapist would. So unless you are consciously going deeper into your unobserved mind patterns, they will continue to run your life.
While you verbalize, be aware that there is a space or a sense of dis-identification between you and thoughts. You are not your thoughts. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more insight.

, Using a structured method or routine, in the beginning, to practice the 'art of presence' is fine. For example: it's fine to start out using a particular Buddhist or Zen method of meditation, reading spiritual text, using a negative situation to become aware, replacing with constructive content etc. However, as you go along, there should be no method, so you don't become reliant on it.


This is one of the reasons that the above methods, for the most part, are structure-less and don't need you to dedicate special time to practice them. You can be aware of your sense perceptions, breathing and inner body, any and all the time. Again, in essence, there is no doing required from you but just an alert watching or seeing.
Even if you are the busiest person, you still have some moments to just look, listen, breathe, feel the inner body etc, in between or while doing your tasks.
Although, it's fine to use some of the methods from time to time to regain the touch with your 'being'. But again, don't use them as a crutch.

, Its not that easy to get in touch with being, especially when mind activity is high. As mind has an incredible momentum from years of collective mental, personal and cultural conditioningthat could drag you along like a wild river. So forcing or 'trying' to become present is not an effective practice. As most often this 'forcing' gets conceptualized or misinterpreted as suppression, which causes automatic resistance to thoughts and they come with even more intensity. Plus suppression can take you below mind which is like pseudo escape; a similar state as that of an animal. We need to go beyond mind to ensure our survival. So smoothing the transition from clutter to inner being is a pragmatic, fluid and unforced practice.Whenever you find yourself lost in thought or feeling negativity, that 'finding' is the start of coming out of thought stream. Like a sun ray peeping through a cloud.
From there either you can become aware of your breath or if its not that easy then you can experiment with any combination of above pragmatic practices such as verbalizing, smiling, replace thought content or just being their as a witnessing presence etc. Whichever agrees more with your personality. For more pragmatic practices, read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings). From there it becomes easier to go more deeply into your breath and being there as a witnessing presence. Subsequently, it becomes easier to become aware of inner body.
As an analogy, its like reducing and replacing the dose of drugs(in this case, its thoughts) of a patient gradually, but not abruptly. Which could cause severe consequences for the patient.And yes, whether you know that or not, most people are addicted to thought stream and emotions because they provide a sense of 'familiarity'. Its cause unknown(in this case, its present moment) is dangerous to mind..

, This refers to the identification with mind and form, the current state of consciousness of humanity. To truly stay rooted in being, you must dissolve the ego. It's highly recommended that you read How to Dissolve the Ego for more insight.

, ""Surrender is simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life"" (Eckhart Tolle). This means to yield to the flow of life within you at 'this' moment. What's the flow of life within you? The thoughts and emotions that come in response to anything (including circumstances, thoughts, emotions and reactions).

There's a great strength in surrender. Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Read How to Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth.







, Have you noticed a heavy cloud of emotions or a dark entity that gets activated by a peculiar event or thought, and takes you over? That's pain body. Pain body is the collective residue of the pain from personal past, as well as the thousands of years of collective pain and suffering endured by humans.


Usually the pain body is dormant and gets activated by an event or thought that is peculiar to you. That peculiar event or thought could be women's menstrual cycle, painful memory or pattern from the past, particular people, a familiar situation, etc. However for a deeply unhappy person, the pain body may remain active all the time.
Most humans carry a varying degree of pain body in them. Usually it is more prevalent and heavier in women than men because of thousands of years of collective conditioning, exploitation and immense suffering afflicted on them. It's also heavier in people who have been through immense suffering or their ancestors have been through immense suffering.
Pain body has high momentum and can carry you with it like a wild river.
Since emotions are a reflection of mind in body so when the pain body gets activated, it makes your thinking deeply negative and vice versa. As pain body is one of the strongest things that ego can identify with.
An activated pain body usually triggers pain bodies of the people around you with similar energy frequencies. This means it may cause other people to harm you physically and verbally or you may harm them.

, Deeply realize that that pain is not you (dis-identify with it), but just a psychic parasitic patternthat takes you over and then becomes dormant. So allow it to be, smile at it with high alertness and go deeper into it. Be the alert guardian of your being. Yes, the normal response would be to escape from the pain but in the long run you may realize that there is no escape. So the only way is the way through.


Watching severs the link between thinking and the pain body; it loses energy as it doesn't let your pain body to enhance itself through thoughts. It also helps to prevent the pain body from rising up to mind and turn into thinking.
You can also become aware of your body and then you will see that pain body is no more than a bundle of accumulated emotions floating in the space of your body.
It is possible that during your spiritual journey, pain body may make you do or say things which you would never do when you are relatively conscious. However, be assured that it is an insubstantial phantom which cannot stand in the light of your presence. Be aware and allow it to be. Being with a conscious person helps as he/she can help you stay present.
Again, don't interpret the words 'watch' or 'aware' through concepts or mental conditioning. You wouldn't even realize you have been watching and acting through concepts. Even if you are, be aware that you are seeing it through concepts. As this awareness will eventually grow and take you beyond them.
Watching or go deeply into the 'pain body' may get misinterpreted as clinginess or resistance. Which usually re-energize the pain body and keeps it there. As a more precise pointer, put enough attention on your pain body, so you are just aware of it and it doesn't feel like resistance or pushing or clinginess. Mind believes that fighting or resisting the pain-body will dissolve it, which is, of course, a delusion. You need to be the larger than thought(awareness) to see the futility of resistance or clinginess.
A practical pointer: it helps to keep yourself busy especially when pain body gets activated. Read Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth.

, Either pain body can take you deeper into unconsciousness or become your greatest teacher to enlightenment. Its like a fuel that transforms into presence. The more fuel, the more awakened you become.


We are not talking about presence in abstract terms; you will feel transformation of pain body into aliveness. Like alchemy.
Most great people once had a dense and heavy pain body. This encapsulates one of the reasons why more women are reaching fully conscious state than men. Recognize the interconnection?

Admit that it takes hitting rock bottom to get the wake up call to make changes.,
Allow yourself to transform.,
Consider what is holding you back.,
Find things that cause you to smile and laugh.,
Dedicate yourself to starting over.,
Reach out for help.,
Use the time you have well.,
Assess your progress towards your new life.",How to Start Over After Hardship," Hitting rock bottom can be the moment at which you finally accept that what you have been doing to this point simply isn't working and to try doing the same things again would be madness. This time, you have little choice but to make changes. This is a good thing though, as it is the start of progress in the right direction, a new direction.;
, During the stages leading up to hitting rock bottom, it's common to cling to what you know best, to try and keep and make survive all that which you have striven to be, obtain and make. The sudden jolt of everything no longer working out for you is a clarion call to transformation. You no longer have to divert all those energies into making the unworkable work––you can now instead concentrate on transforming yourself and trying something completely new and different with your life.

, It's fear and the voices of the past and the expectations of the people you carry around in your head. Hitting rock bottom shows you that trying to match up to those imagined fears and expectations didn't exactly help now, did they? So, let go and feel the fear but do it anyway, as the infamous and late Susan Jeffers always used to say.

, Having been to the bottom of the chasm, the only way left is... up. And laughter helps to raise you, to give you a sense of joy long robbed from you during the descent. Finding your sense of humor again is a sign of becoming more human again and seeing that despite the dire things that have happened to you, you can find the lighter side to it and help yourself to recover.


Notice the little things. Having gratitude for the natural wonders around you, the inquisitiveness of children and the friendliness of animals are just some of the things that can bring a smile, even in the midst of hardship.

, Make building a new life your new mission. What will it be? That's for you to decide, the go about it as best you can. Consider writing a plan with goals to reach, simple and truly doable goals, not lofty and nonsensical ones. Such realistic and wholesome goals as getting a roof you own back over your head, starting your own tiny business that brings in a living wage and keeping the kids well educated.

, Don't be too proud but most of all, realize that it's absolutely okay to seek help and it is not a sign of weakness. Human beings are social beings, bound to one another and in need of making connections to thrive. Enough people care out there to lend a helping hand, offer advice, mentor you, shelter you and even feed you in times of need. Just be sure to give back what you can by way of respect, delivery on promises, reliability and friendship.

, Time is a resource few have much of. Even if you do not have gainful employment, behave as though you do and treat your job-hunting, business planning and re-nesting as seriously as going to work every day. If you do have a job, take care not to use it as a crutch for not working through the other issues that caused you to hit rock bottom. Seek balance in all things and use that time you have wisely.


Spend more time with friends and family if you haven't been doing so. Their love and support will be a source of comfort.

, As you follow your new goals and hopes, take stock now and then to ensure that you're still going in the way you wish to go and to be certain that you're not repeating some of the mistakes made in the past that caused you to hit rock bottom.

Figure out your triggers.,
Figure out why something triggers your competitiveness.,
Re-think competitiveness in the moment.,
Stop making comparisons.,
Check your black and white thinking.,
Stop thinking of love as finite.",How to Stop Being Competitive1," It's important to figure out what triggers your feelings of competitiveness and jealousy. Maybe you get jealous at work when someone else does better than you, or maybe you let losing at a board game get to you. Whatever your triggers are, starting to identify them can help you take control of situations where you're too competitive.When you feel yourself getting angry or irritable, ask yourself, ""Is it because I'm jealous?"";
, Next, it's important to identify why these things trigger your competitiveness. Maybe you get competitive at work because you never did very well in school, and you're trying to make up for it. Maybe you feel competitive at board games because you always felt less-than with siblings.To figure out why things triggers, spend some time writing about it in a journal or talking about it with a trusted friend. Keep digging deeper to find the source.

, When you're feeling competitiveness rage up, take a moment to stop yourself and re-think. Is your competitiveness from jealousy? Is your jealousy merited? Try to remember where your jealousy is stemming from. It's usually not from the current situation, so reminding yourself of that fact can help you calm the jealous beast.

, When you see other people doing well, it can be easy to want to compare your life with theirs. When you compare, you scrutinize both of your lives, and tally up who is better. On the other hand, being competitive without the comparisons can spur you forward, as long as you aren't basing all your worth on the competition.Instead, realize that no one succeeds at the same pace. You are right where you need to be right now, and you are enough.

, Often, people who are competitive or jealous will also think in absolute terms. In other words, you may think that if someone else gets praised at work, that means your work has been awful. In reality, someone else doing well doesn't mean you're not doing well, nor does it negate how well you're doing., Sometimes, competitiveness springs from jealousy that other people are getting more attention or praise than you. In other words, if your boss praises someone else's work, you start to feel jealous and competitive because it makes you feel like your boss doesn't value you work. However, love and praise are not finite resources. Your boss or loved one can praise someone else and still value what you do, even if they don't say it at the same time.

Try caffeine.,
Eat protein and complex carbohydrates instead of simple sugar.,
Stay hydrated.,
Try aromatherapy.",How to Stay Awake No Matter How Tired You Are1," Caffeine is one of the most tried-and-true methods of staying awake. A brewed cup (8 ounces) of coffee can have anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of black tea can be anywhere from 14 to 70 milligrams. As a comparison, a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola has 23 to 35 milligrams of caffeine. If you're not accustomed to drinking caffeine, you should start with a beverage that has less caffeine such as green tea (24 to 45 milligrams per 8 ounces).Caffeine works by replacing an inhibitory neurotransmitter, adenosine. That is, it binds to the receptors in cells in place of adenosine. Adenosine tells your cells to prepare for sleep, and the longer you stay awake, the more adenosine you have in your brain. When caffeine takes it place, it does not tell your cells to slow down. Rather, it speeds them up, as well as increasing the firing of neurons in your brain.You do build up a tolerance to caffeine over time, meaning it becomes less effective the more you use it. Therefore, if you want it to be more effective, you should only use it when you really need to stay awake.Though rare, you can overdose on caffeine, especially if you are taking it in pill form. You should watch for signs of jitteriness, heart palpitations, sweating, dizziness, anxiety, racing heartbeat, or even cardiac arrest.;
, When you stay awake, you use more energy than you would will sleeping. Although simple sugar, such as what's found in sodas and candy bars, can give you a burst of energy, it can also cause you to crash in a few hours. Protein is better because it is in charge of maintaining the neurotransmitter orexin, which in turn maintains your body's wakefulness. In addition, protein tends to stick with you for longer than sugar.Try eating a piece of cheese or a couple of slices of lunch meat. If you must also have carbohydrates, pair it with complex carbohydrates such as whole grains. You could also try a piece of fruit. Though it has sugar in it, it is a more complex carbohydrate that will last longer., Dehydration can contribute to fatigue, so if you find yourself getting tired, try drinking some water. Ice water in particular can help wake you up.You can also try fruits with a high water content, such as watermelon., Some people have had luck using certain scents to stay awake. For instance, peppermint, rosemary, eucalyptus, and citrus scents can all aid alertness. Try smelling essential oils or using candles with these scents."

Be compassionate to yourself.,
Work on interpreting situations differently.,
Remember no one is perfect.,
Focus on the positive.",How to Stop Being Competitive2," Everyone makes mistakes or has times when they're feeling low. The important thing is treat yourself with compassion, just as you'd treat a good friend. Don't beat yourself up for every little mistake. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn and move on.For instance, you could say to yourself, ""Yes, I made a mistake, but it's not the worst thing in the world. I'll do better next time.""
Increasing your self-esteem overall helps you become less competitive. Often, if you're a very competitive person, your self-esteem may be dependent on you doing well. If you fail at something, your self-esteem also falls. Learning to hold on to your self worth no matter the situation can help you become less competitive., Often, people with low self-esteem interpret situations in ways that continue to suppress their self esteem. They often take a negative approach, when in reality, many people around them are looking at the situation differently.For instance, you may blow things out of proportion; you make a mistake, and think that everyone sees you as a failure. Instead, try to put that in proportion. Was the mistake really that big a deal? Did anyone actually say that you are a failure or not up the job?
Other times, you may take your successes and turn them into failures. For example, you might say, ""My boss praised that report, but it was only good because I used the numbers from accounting."" Instead, it's important to celebrate your successes when they come.
You might also think that what you're feeling is absolutely fact. If you're feeling like an idiot, you may think everyone else sees you that way, too, when in reality, they all likely have respect for you.
Another way you may interpret situations negatively is to take small, non-relevant indicators as proof that something is wrong. For instance, if you text someone and they don't text back for a few days, you may think, ""My friend must hate me at the moment,"" when in reality, there are plenty of reasons they might not have replied, including they may not have seen the text.

, With every mistake you make, you may want to kick yourself. However, remember that no one can achieve perfection. You have to realize that everyone makes mistakes. When you realize that, it makes it easier to live with your own, knowing that perfection is impossible.Don't forget to adjust your vision of yourself. You change and grow over time, and so do your abilities. That means that you can't judge yourself by a past version of yourself. For instance, maybe you were once stellar at science, but you've let those skills slide in favor of other ones. That's fine, just keep in mind you're not the scientist you once were, but now you can make a killer omelet or write an amazing article., If you have low self-esteem, you probably notice what's wrong in every situation or how you could have done better. However, you also need to pat yourself on your back for what you did right. Focusing on what you did right can help build your confidence and remind you how far you've come.For instance, maybe you wrote a paper for class. You may find yourself focusing on all the mistakes you made. Instead, think about how far you've come. Read a paper from a year ago, and you're bound to see how you've improved.

"
"
Have admiration instead of jealousy.,
Compliment others sincerely.,
Remember we're all connected.,
Practice gratitude.",How to Stop Being Competitive3," If you see qualities or successes you like in another person, try striving to admire the person rather than be jealous of them. In other words, use their success as a way to set a goal for yourself, rather then letting it turn into envy.When you start feeling jealous, which can lead to competitiveness, think about all that person did to get where they are. Admire their hard work and determination. You can even ask them how they achieved what they did, so you can learn from them.
For instance, maybe a friend is getting a book published, a long time dream of yours. You could choose to be jealous, and turn that jealousy into competitiveness. On the other hand, you could choose admiration. Your friend has accomplished something amazing, and you can use that to inspire you to finish your own novel.

, If you're competitive, you may have problems reveling in other's success. Learning to be non-competitive means learning to celebrate those successes with your friends, family, and co-workers. If you see someone doing something great, compliment them. You may not always feel the sentiment, but just voicing it can help you work towards being genuinely supportive.For instance, if you notice your co-worker has done an excellent job on a project, you could say, ""Thanks for putting all of this together, Janine. You're really great at organizing!""
Don't limit yourself to people you know. If you read an article online that you love, tell the author. If you notice someone doing a good job at a store, tell them. It never hurts to make someone's day better.

, When you want to compete with others all the time, you likely see them as outside of your experience. You may not see the trials they go through to get there, making you feel like a failure. Therefore, acknowledging your own pain as something that's common can help you see where others work hard, too. You're not alone in your experiences, and therefore, you have people to take the journey with, not just compete against., A competitive nature often comes from counting other's blessings more than your own. Then you end up feeling jealous and wanting to get ahead. Instead, learn to be grateful for what you do have by incorporating gratitude into your everyday life.Try thinking about all the things you're grateful for before you get out of bed in the morning.
You could also try a gratitude journal. Take the time to write down 5 things you're grateful for every day. You can do it in a private journal, or you can even do it on social media, making a post each day about the things you're grateful for.

Live by your values.,
Honor your feelings.,
Be teachable.,
Maintain a non-judgmental attitude.,
Keep your commitments.,
Treat people with respect.,
Act calmly in conflict.,
Avoid being defensive.,
Own your shortcomings.,
Make requests.",How to Show Maturity," Maturity includes making decisions based off of your values, ethics, and morals, instead of what feels good in the moment. While spur-of-the-moment decisions can be fun, weigh whether there are any long-term consequences. Allow your values to guide your life. Let your character master your desires.Reflect on people you admire and what values they embody. If it’s an athlete, maybe you admire hard work, dedication, and pushing the body to the limits. If you admire a spiritual leader, you may admire the commitment to honesty and compassion. Reflecting on positive traits of others can help you discover your values.
Whatever you choose, commit to it. Show people that you are willing to live out your values, even if it presents minor inconveniences to you.;
, Maturity includes emotional development.Unfortunately, people (and especially teens) get feedback that tells them to ignore feelings or to devalue them. Some examples include holding back tears, apologizing for crying, or saying “I’m fine” when you are hurting inside. It’s healthy to express your feelings and to really feel them. We are wired to have feelings, and expressing them is a loving acknowledgment of the beauty and struggle of life.Show maturity by articulating your feelings.


When feeling sad, take a moment to check in with your feelings. Reflect on what may be making you feel sad, such as a fight with a friend or parent, a low grade, a pet that has run away, or being away from a parent for a weekend. Instead of ignoring the feeling, feel it fully and recognize that it’s important to acknowledge all of your feelings, even when they are painful.
When expressing your feelings, start by saying “I feel…” and avoid saying “You make me feel...” Notice the difference between “I feel sad” and “You make me feel sad.” One accuses someone and the other expresses the self. Expressing your feelings allows you to empower yourself. It’s not an opportunity to make accusations.Once you've acknowledged your feelings, start working through them. For example, you can tell yourself, ""It's not fun to feel sad, but I know that feelings don't last. I'll feel better soon and I'll find a way to work out what I'm feeling."" You can also remind yourself that feelings aren't facts: for example, just because you feel ""stupid"" one day does not mean that you are. Be generous with yourself as you work through your feelings.

, It might be fun to feel like you have all the answers and you don’t need anyone’s input, but maturity includes being open to the knowledge and wisdom of others.It’s okay to admit you don’t know everything (nobody does!). People around you have wisdom that you may not, so seek out the wisdom of others before making big decisions. This shows that you are willing to learn from others.


When faced with an important decision, seek input from people you trust, like a teacher, coach, spiritual leader, parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle, best friend, or other trusted adult or friend.
Remember that no one can make decisions for you. While others can be helpful (or not), your decisions are ultimately yours to make and nobody else’s.

, We all love that friend that is always supportive, never gossips, and we feel like we can tell anything to, even if it’s embarrassing. Being non-judgmental means having an attitude of acceptance, understanding, and acting authentically. Accept the people in your life as they are (including yourself!). Don’t demand changes. Don’t put yourself on moral higher ground, but show others that you can learn to accept everyone in your life through understanding. Nobody is higher or lower than you are. Learn to withhold your judgments and approach people through compassion.


Judgments are ways to create distance between yourself and someone else. Use empathy and “walk a mile in her shoes” and discover that regardless of how flawless someone’s life appears, she has problems that cause her pain, too.
Gossip is one way to spread judgment about someone. Be careful what you say when you talk about people.
If someone starts to gossip, you can say, “That sounds like gossip, and I’d rather not hurt anyone’s feelings. I’d rather talk about cats.”

, When you were younger, your schedule was made for you: you went to school or sports or dance. Now, you may have more ability to make your own schedule. When you say you will do something, do it. Even if it isn’t your idea of fun, show people that they can count on you and that you are reliable.When you tell someone “yes”, honor your commitment. Show people that you can be trusted.

, Treat those around you with respect, with both your actions and your words. Respect builds trust and support in a relationship, whether it be with your parents, siblings, friends, or romantic partner.A good way to learn respect is to first treat yourself with respect. Don’t feel pressure to do anything just because everyone else is doing it, but respect your mind, body, and spirituality enough to listen if one of them is telling you not to participate.Learn what it feels like to respect yourself, and make sure you treat others with the same respect.


Say “please” and “thank you” often.
Even if you’re in an argument, refrain from name-calling. You can disagree with someone while still being respectful. Think before you speak and hold off from saying anything that can be hurtful. Say, “I appreciate and respect your opinion, even though it differs from mine.”
Treating other people respectfully shows maturity in how you interact.

, It may be easy to retaliate when in an argument and unleash your anger, but keep your cool. Keeping calm in stressful situations has positive long-term health benefits, such as less inflammation in the body.Being calm and thinking about something positive can help when stressful events occur. By not raging but choosing to keep calm, you show others that you are able to handle your emotions in a mature way.


When you feel anger coming on, take a couple deep breaths and connect with your body.Feel where the anger comes from and listen to what it is telling you. Allow your rational mind to determine how you want to handle the situation.
If you struggle to respond calmly, ask for a time out. Say, “This is important and we need to talk about it, but I am so angry and I need to cool down. Can we talk about this after I’ve had some time to think?”

, When things get heated, resist the urge to defend your views. Don’t be a brick wall, but be intentional to listen to other people’s opinions, even if you fiercely disagree with them. There are no two people on the planet that will agree on everything. Be respectful and listen, just as much as you want the other person to listen to you.Listening to what other people have to say and not acting defensively shows that you are mature enough to handle conflicts.


You may disagree on clothes, texting, boys/girls, or friends with your parents and you may not find common ground. If you want your parents to understand you, make sure you understand them, too.
If you feel defensive, don’t fight back, but speak your feelings. Instead of saying, “You’re calling me a liar! I’m not a liar!”, say, “It’s important that people are truthful with me, which is why I’m hurt that it feels like I’m being accused of lying.”

, Don’t blame other people for the problems in your life. Recognize that you have choices in how you act and react. All relationships are interactional, meaning that you both contribute to how you feel and what happens. It’s much easier to blame people for how bad you feel, but recognize your role, and take responsibility for your actions. Reflect on what actions you took that contributed to the situation, and own up to them.Even if someone does have shortcomings, it doesn’t mean that you can blame her for your problems or how you feel, or treat them as less than you.If you’ve let somebody down, let them know. Instead of blaming external things, say, “I’m sorry I didn’t show up on time. That was my fault and I didn’t allow enough time.” Plan for how you'll do things differently in the future: ""Next time, I'll leave ten minutes earlier so I can get there on time.""
By owning your own mistakes, you show others that you are humble and can admit fault, a very mature action.

, When you want something, don’t be demanding. Imagine how you would react if someone was always demanding things of you: you probably would not like it. Instead, make requests. Make your case and then explain your request. It’s the toddler in the shopping cart that yells at her mommy to buy the chips. You’re better than that.


If you want a dog, don’t whine until you get one. Ask your parents for a dog, and show that you will take responsibility for it by walking, feeding, and taking care of it. Show your maturity by making a request and following through with actions.
Instead of saying, “I deserve it!” or “Why aren’t you giving me what I want?”, say “I would like to tell you that I really want something, and I would like you to hear me out.”

Ask yourself, ""So what?"",
Ask someone else to read your statement.",How to Start a Personal Statement," Many colleges and universities will provide specific prompts for your personal statement. These may take the form of essay prompts, specific questions, or general guidelines. Making sure that you address the prompt is the most important thing to keep in mind while writing a personal statement.Specific essay prompts are common for undergraduate personal statements.Business, law, medical, and graduate school applications may ask specific questions that you must answer.Sometimes, particularly with graduate programs, you will be asked to write a personal statement and a statement of purpose as separate elements of your application. In this case, the personal statement should focus on your personal background and why you are pursuing your program. The statement of purpose should focus on your academic preparation, plans for your program, and your career goals.;
, Most programs will give length restrictions for personal statements.They may range from 250 words to 2 or more pages, but the most important thing is never to send a longer document than requested. Many admissions committees may simply stop reading if an essay or statement rambles on.If you are submitting your personal statement online, you may be restricted to a certain number of characters. You will be unable to submit the application if you exceed this requirement.

, Brainstorm. Make a mind map. Try a freewrite. Explore every possible direction your statement might take.Asking yourself questions will help you explore the topic. For example, in starting a personal statement for a law school, ask yourself: What am I passionate about? What are my personal strengths? What work experience do I bring to this program? What about my life experiences might be relevant and interesting to the program reviewers?
If you can't visit the school, follow their social media feed to get a better idea of the kind of student they seem to focus on. When you're brainstorming, consider the way your own experience and education might interact with the school's focus.

, Strong personal statements often pick a particular moment and use it to set the ""scene"" for the rest of the statement.Giving a vivid idea of what you felt, thought, and experienced in that moment can help introduce you to your readers.For example, you might begin a personal statement for medical school by talking about a particular moment in which you realized you wanted to be a doctor.
If you are interested in a particular subject, you might start with an anecdote about how you became interested in it, or a particularly exhilarating moment when you got to explore something about your subject.

, The strongest personal statements provide insight into your own life. Basing your statement in your own experience allows the readers to learn more about whether or not you'd be a good fit for their program.Use your opening as a springboard for the rest of your statement.
Think about how your experiences brought you to this application process. What stands out in your memories that the application's readers might want to know?
The best essays share someone's own personal growth, difficulty, strength, or confidence, all of which people experience in very different ways.
Consider the examples here: http://www.cmu.edu/hpp/apply-to-schools/personal-statements/samples.html. Both of these essays, while very different, make a deeply personal connection between the authors' lives and their desire to study in a particular program.

, Readers of applications read hundreds of personal statements every year, and many of these use the same openings. Try for something unexpected or surprising to catch your reader's attention.For example, you could start by describing yourself already working in your desired career. What would you be doing, and why?You may even try an opening that says you have not always wanted to be a doctor/lawyer/professor/etc. This will allow you to show your development over time and could be a more interesting opening for readers., Starting your personal statement by saying something like ""I have been interested in archaeology since I participated in an internship program"" is vague and general. Instead, try to use concrete, detailed language to give your readers a vivid picture of your thoughts and feelings: ""Kneeling in the dirt hunched over a delicate fossil, I realized that even though I was sunburned and aching from the long hours of meticulous labor, this was where I was meant to be.""

, Your writing should sound friendly and natural. Keep your wording concise, and avoid using overly complex wording when you can. Avoid unexplained jargon and ""SAT"" words -- these don't make you look more intelligent, they make it look as though you don't know your audience.If you love the topic you'll be studying, allow this to come through in your writing.
Incorporating quotes can help you articulate your theme. You can use quotes to accentuate your point, add humor, or provide insight. However, avoid relying too much on others' words -- the committee wants to know who you are.

, You may not know what openings are most commonly found on personal statements, but you can easily do an internet search for ""personal statements"" to get an idea. Reviewers read so many applications that they get bored of reading the same statements over and over again.Common cliches to avoid include things such as ""From a young age, I have always been interested in..."", ""I have always been a..."", defining dictionary terms, opening with a quotation, and using sweeping generalizations such as ""Humans have always...""Avoid things that are overly general and could apply to anyone, such as ""I want to become a physician because I want to help people."" This says nothing particular about you., Most applications will also ask for a resume or CV that displays your accomplishments. While you should talk about significant experiences in your development, don't use your personal statement to rehash everything on your resume.Instead, try to pick one or two moments that really stick out to you as influencing your decision to apply to this program.

, You do not know the beliefs and values of the admissions committee reading your personal statement. While you may have strong beliefs about particular things, such as religion or politics, it is best to keep the tone of your personal statement neutral to avoid offending anyone who does not share them.This does not mean you can't mention things like religion if they are important to you. For example, you could say something like ""I have honed my leadership skills by serving as a youth counselor for my church."" However, you would probably want to avoid things such as ""I know that God's plan is for me to cure cancer,"" since not everyone may believe in this.
Of course, there are always exceptions. For example, if you are writing a personal statement to apply to a seminary program, it would be appropriate to talk about your religious beliefs in detail.

, Many times, simply reading your own words aloud helps you correct mistakes you might have overlooked. You'll be able to notice where you've used words that are grammatically incorrect or overly formal language.Reading out loud will also help you hear sentences that are unclear, confusing or awkward.
If you're using this statement for multiple programs, reread to make sure that your statement is effective for each program. You will probably need to tweak the statement somewhat for each program., The best personal statements have emotional power, as well as practical life application. Read your statement to yourself, and imagine asking the question, ""So what?"" at the conclusion. If you don't feel you have a clear answer to this question, keep working until you do.The question may lead you into a deeper understanding of the reason you chose the way of writing your personal statement as you did.
Most schools want to know not only about your personal experiences, but how those experiences have changed you as a person.
This information won't be found in the beginning of your personal statement. Once you've completed your personal statement, reread the start. Make sure that start of your statement has a kernel of the way your statement will end.

, The best reader will be someone who knows you well, but who is also able to consider what the school might want to hear. Allow the reader to offer their honest feedback. Her criticism will help you learn, even if you disagree with it.Be specific when asking for feedback. If all you want is someone to check your spelling and grammar, let your reader know this.
Ask your reader to tell you what your central message was in your personal statement. If your reader isn't sure, your statement isn't clear enough.

Create an environment that allows you to focus.,
Remove distractions.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Reward yourself when you succeed.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Exercise.",How to Re Program Your Ability to Focus," There are some places that make it nearly impossible for you to be able to think, let alone focus on anything important. Stay away from those areas. Find a place that is quiet, has good lighting, a comfortable temperature, proper ventilation, appropriate space, comfortable seating and allows you to concentrate. This may be an office at work, your workshop at home, the park, a local cafe of library. You know what works for you. Find a space where you can properly focus.;
, If the telephone is constantly ringing or your Facebook alerts continually pop up, turn them off. If the television is on and it's distracting, shut it off. Avoid distractions that divert your attention from the task at hand. The most important thing you can do is to take control of your environment.

, These may be mini-goals or long-term goals. Setting goals allows you to focus on something specific. Otherwise, it's easy to get distracted with details and items that are not significant to your task at hand. It's alright to make notes about things you need to do in the future, but don't let them distract you from your current goals.

, When you've successfully completed a task or met a goal, give yourself a treat. That could be a manicure, an ice-cream sandwich or a few minutes to sneak away to a movie.

, If your body is tired and your mind is fuzzy, it's not going to be possible to focus no matter how hard you try. Try to get between 8 and 10 hours of sleep per night to enhance your ability to focus.

, If your metabolism is out of balance, that can affect your neurosystem, which can affect the way you think and focus. Eat regularly, and include vegetables and protein in your diet.

, When your body is physically fit, your mind is more apt to be, too. Exercising regularly helps your body process toxins, be more alert and feel better overall. When this happens, your ability to focus is enhanced.Remember a fit mind can work wonders.

Write learning time into your schedule.,
Replace empty time in your day.,
Follow the five-hour rule.,
Remind yourself to take the time.",How to Set Aside Time for Learning Each Day1," In order to set aside time every day to learn, write it into your schedule. Create a block in your day to day schedule that is specifically made for learning. Try to make it a time that will be the best for learning. This means avoiding times when you will not be able to focus, such as right before bed when you may be too tired or first thing in the morning when you are still waking up.


This may be hard with a full work schedule and a family or everyday obligations, but scheduling time to learn will help prioritize it in your life every day.
You can write out your schedule weekly or monthly, whatever works best for you.About an hour a day is considered the most beneficial for long-term learning.;
, When you are looking for placed to add in learning time, think about empty times in your day. Instead of wasting time doing mindless activities, switch the time out for learning time. This could be times when you find yourself flipping through the channels aimlessly or scrolling through things on your phone.


You may not even realize that these times exist until you start looking at your daily activities. If you find a chunk of time where you aren’t being productive or doing something meaningful to you, switch this time over to learning time., There are many people throughout history who approach learning with the “five-hour rule”. This means that they found five hours per week to dedicate to learning. People such as Benjamin Franklin, Steve Jobs, ad Bill Gates approach life in this way and it helped them to be life-long learners and achievers.


You can choose to take all five hours during the week and take the weekend off, do two hours over the weekend and skip stressful days during the week, or break it up over all seven days of the week. As long as you are learning at least five hours a week, you will get the benefits of this method.
Avoid getting behind and trying to do all your learning in two or three chunks. This will impeded your learning process over time., Even if you schedule time to learn every day, make a plan, and set goals, you need to continually remind yourself to take this learning time every day. Set a reminder in your phone’s calendar or set an alarm at home to remind you.You can make yourself less formal reminders such as post it notes around your room or in your office at work.

Create a learning plan.,
Give yourself goals to achieve.,
Experiment with different types of learning.",How to Set Aside Time for Learning Each Day2," The idea of filling learning time every day may be daunting. Instead of leaving it to chance, create a learning plan that lays out what you want to learn. Come up with a series of subjects, tasks, and activities you want to learn and plan out when you want to do which.This will help you be prepared for learning each day instead of wasting some of your learning time deciding what you want to do.
For example, you may choose a topic for each week. During week one, you may learn the capitals of Europe, during week two you may learn the capitals of Africa, then Asia, South America, and North America. You may choose a new inventor each week and read about their inventions and discoveries. You can choose a historical war and spend a week or two reading about the causes, battles, economic and social effects, and results.
You may decide to take a month and learn how to shoot a bow and arrow, crochet, play the piano, or cook a difficult recipe.
You may make each day a different type of learning. You may read on Mondays and Wednesdays, watch documentaries on Tuesdays and Thursdays, visit websites on Fridays and Saturdays, and choose any method you want on Sundays. If you are learning a skill, spend one day a week reading about the skill, then four days practicing, and one day trying something new you haven't before.

, When you start making time for learning, you don’t want to approach it without goals in mind. Goals will help motivate you to learn more and give you something to work towards. Once you’ve written your learning plan, put in goal markers along the way for each new subject, task, or activity you are learning.


For example, set the goal of two weeks to master a basic knitting pattern for a scarf.You may choose a month to learn as many world capitals or periodic table elements as possible, or learn a basic piano song in two months.

, Not every person learns in the same way. When you are figuring out what to learn, try different learning approaches to see what works best for you.You may like more visual learning through instructional videos, documentaries, or texts with more visual materials. You may be more of a tactile learner and need real examples of things as you learn about them, or a textual learner that needs to read instruction manuals or articles as you learn.


For example, you may watch a documentary from the History Channel about World War Two if you are a visual or auditory learner. For an auditory learner, you may listen to a podcast about whales, while visual learners may go to an interactive website with pictures and video footage of whales. If you are a hands on learner, you may need to practice the same song over and over until you learn it.
It will be a trial and error kind of process to begin with if you aren’t already familiar with how you learn.
Changing your learning environment while you learn can also lend to better learning each day.

"
"
Learn in small increments.,
Include your family and friends in your learning time.,
Turn it into a game.,
Give yourself rewards.",How to Set Aside Time for Learning Each Day3," If you find it hard to schedule an entire hour at one time, break the hour up into smaller increments. Try instead to set aside a half an hour or fifteen minutes multiple times a day. This will still help you find time to learn every day without having to carve large chunks out of your day at once.


You can either keep the same subject over these smaller increments or choose different topics at each. This will keep you interested and make you want to take the learning breaks.For example, you take 10 minutes in the morning to read about a topic. At lunch, you may read 10 more minutes about the topic, then check out an interactive website for 20 minutes after work and then watch 20 minutes of a documentary after dinner.

, A good way to make sure you include your learning time into your routine every day is to include your loved ones. If you have kids and a spouse, find something that you can learn as a family. If you have a significant other or roommate, include them in some of your learning time when he or she are around for it.


For example, you and your children may watch a documentary on giraffes on the Discovery Channel. During commercials and after the program, you can discuss what you learned.
Discuss what you have read with your spouse or friends. Tell them interesting facts or share with them stories about historical figures you have learned.
This has the added bonus of getting your loved ones to set aside time for learning every day as well.

, A way to keep your learning interesting is to turn it into a game. Make yourself flashcards of facts you want to learn. Create trivia cards for things you have been learning and get a friend, family member, or significant other to read them to you.You can even create a Jeopardy! style game for you and your family and play together.


For example, you can use flashcards to learn world capitals, the names of composers and authors, or even facts from history and mythology. Keep score with yourself and see if you can beat your previous day's score. Compete against your friends and family to see who gets the highest score.
This will also have the added bonus of testing your knowledge of what you’ve been learning and helping you remember what you’ve learned longer.

, As time progresses and you learn more, you can give yourself small rewards for reaching a goal or completing a task or activity you learned. These should be small, helpful rewards that are meaningful for you.For example, you can take yourself out to lunch at your favorite restaurant, buy yourself a latte during a coffee break, or buy yourself the new book you’ve been wanting.

Ask yourself why you are doing or thinking something.,
Examine your attitudes.,
Keep some kind of log or journal.,
Acknowledge when an action is not bringing the desired result.,
Ask your friends and family how they perceive you.,
Have a friend interview you on video tape.,
Analyze the feedback.,
Take mental notes and snapshots through the day to gauge your progress.,
Be aware of the world beyond you.",How to Raise Your Self Awareness," Here are some questions to inspire you:


Why do you like the entertainment you chose?
Why do you chose to love one person and not another?
Why do you avoid doing certain things?
What are your values? What do you want? If that's too hard, start with this:
What do you not want? For example, what would you never want to happen again?
How do you feel about lying?
Do you have clear character and morals?
Are you happy, under stress, or tired, and how does that come across to others?
How do others perceive you? (See below.);
, Attitudes are based on expectations. Our expectations are often unrealistic and exaggerated by fear or hope. Positive attitudes are more helpful than negative because hope tends to give people the strength to deal with any problems that come up.


For example, racism is a negative expectation about other people that often is totally unhelpful in judging how a person is likely to behave. You might have absorbed this attitude from others.
Another example is negative attitudes about your own potential. If you limit yourself and say ""I can't do that"", you certainly never will. Everyone is capable of a lot more than they realize. Sometimes you allow others, like your family and friends, to create a limiting self concept of you in exchange for love and a feeling of security. People will still love you if you exceed who you used to be and grow. They may be surprised but they will adjust.

, This will help you to realize when some events or attitudes repeatedly lead to others. Review your log at decided intervals, such as on new year or on your birthday.

, It would be stupid to keep butting your head against a wall to knock it down. But we often do just that in life. A key is to notice when doing something makes you feel bad instead of how you want to feel.

, Ask yourself some basic questions of identity and character, attitudes and desires. For example:


Do I carry myself tall or do I slink? Or simply, How do I carry myself?
How do I walk?
Do I make eye contact with people easily?
Do I have a firm handshake?
Do I smile a lot or frown?

, Remember that witnessing yourself recorded is not for self-criticism but for awareness. View yourself with a compassionate and an unbiased eye.

, Once you have some feedback and a basic awareness about yourself and people's perceptions of you, you can go about addressing them. You have probably heard of the principle of smiling when you talk on the phone because it carries through the conversation in your voice.

, The more you think about the behavior you want to change, the more you will be prompted to apply and practice the new behavior. What you may find is that focusing on one aspect will usually tie the rest to it, and when you remember to do the one, they will all be involved. This is the cascading effect, and it is very powerful. You can change once you identify the behavior you want to change.

, This requires developing an attitude of mindfulness, to be present and not on autopilot. Learn to respond and not to react to other people by practicing mindfulness.

Connect with your lower self first.,

Identify and get rid of limiting beliefs.,
Build Positive Momentum.,
Fill every day with gratitude.,

Practice Non-Reaction.,
Learn to stay neutral.,

Surrender.,
Let go.,
Meditate.",How to Reconnect With Your Higher Self," Before you can delve into such a sacred undertaking as connecting with your higher self, you must connect with your lower self. We all share the same lower self, and that is Mother Earth. You cannot reach Her via meditation but rather by being joyous, playful and truly becoming a kid again. You will know when you have made the connection because you will never feel safer or more exuberant than when that time comes. If this first step isn't completed, the journey to connecting with the higher self becomes virtually impossible.;
, Do not hold on to the past. Realize that you don't have to ""forgive and forget"". You can still acknowledge that you or someone else did something ""wrong"" while at the same time forgiving. Non-forgiveness binds you energetically to the other person and your lower self/ego.

, Write down every time you engage in bad habits and negative energy (such as anger, doubt, fear, worry, discouragement, resentment, etc.) At the end of the evaluation, list what you consider to be your worst habits and momentum. Then resolve to go after them one by one and overcome them! Awareness begins the undoing - intention, determination and focus continues the dissolving of bad habits and negative momentum.

, We all pick up limiting, false beliefs along the way which keep us from being all we can be. Those beliefs can even cause pain and suffering. Resolve to really look at the things you believe in and WHY you have the belief. Realize that no one is forcing you to believe anything and that beliefs are NOT a part of who you really are! Determine to keep an open mind and know that limiting beliefs are keeping you from fully connecting with your True Self. Clearly see that false beliefs are restricting you from experiencing all the goodness of life, as well as contributing to suffering and a sense of struggle in life. Determine to let them go!

, Developing and maintaining positive momentum is essential on the spiritual path and will help you reconnect more fully with your Higher Self. Each day focus on one positive momentum you would like to work on and commit to integrating it throughout the day. For example: keeping your harmony, being more joyful, helping others, etc.

, As you go through your day, regularly express your gratefulness for everything you can think of - the wonderful day, the beautiful flowers, the sunshine, your spouse, the smile on your child's face, your family's health, and on and on. Let gratitude fill your heart and you'll be surprised to see what a difference this will make! Gratefulness opens the doorway to your True Self.

, Harmony is one of the major keys - if not THE major key - on the path to raising your consciousness and reuniting with your Higher Self. Harmony is an internal quality springing from the heart and not just an external expression. Harmony involves mastering your emotions and not letting them control you. State your clear intention to be centered in Harmony and to be harmonious in every situation you meet. Keep centered in the heart as much as possible and focus on peace and harmony.

, Reacting negatively to situations destroys harmony. Realize that in every situation you can choose to react in a positive way or a negative way - that's up to you. There is always a split second before you react to something where you DO have a choice. Even if you react in a negative way initially, you have the choice to continue to react and revolve the situation, or to let it go! Diffuse a negative reaction by centering in your heart and breathing deeply. This will help connect you with your Higher Self.

, Neutral is a powerful state of emotional balance and inner quiet and peace. It is a place of equilibrium where you are more able to access the wisdom of your Higher Self. Learning to stay neutral is a key to becoming non-reactive to situations. Being neutral is not a state of not feeling anything, but rather a state where you are in balance with your emotional responses to what is happening - neither reacting negatively or becoming overly excited.

, Much of suffering comes from not living in the now. Our minds are unbelievably powerful when focused, but most of that power is lost by not living in the moment. The Present is where your power is! Most importantly, you can only connect with your Higher Self when you are in the present. Learn to let go of the past, projecting into the future, worrying and anything else that takes you away from the present moment. Peace is in the now!

, One of the most important things we can do to reconnect with our Higher Self is to surrender - let go of that which causes us pain, suffering, unhappiness, and limitation. As long as we are primarily operating from our lower self/ego, we are unfortunately tying ourselves to those very things. When negative emotions arise, the key is to immediately surrender them to God/the Universal. If you find yourself reluctant to surrender something or find you are still revolving the same thing over and over along with the negative emotions, you need to ask yourself why - what is the payoff? What is the ""juice"" the lower self is feeding on? (""poor me"", ""look how I was wronged"", etc.) Realize that whatever the ego is holding on to, it will continue to cause you grief and suffering until you are willing to surrender it completely! Remember - you have a choice - to continue to hold on to negative emotions and suffering - or to surrender them and as a result, find more happiness and peace in your life.

, Realize that we cannot control everything and the events in our life through the human self. Sometimes it is necessary to ""let go and let God"". Letting go involves surrendering yourself (and your ego!) to a higher force, and the ego does not like that at all. As you connect more and more to your Higher Self, surrendering and letting go becomes less difficult. Letting go also means surrendering fears, worries and insecurities and trusting God/the Universal that everything will work out.

, Meditation is essential on the spiritual path. If you are to connect with your Higher Self, you must be able to still the mind through meditation. Through that inner quietness, you can then learn to listen to the ""still, small voice within"" of your True Self. Meditation is a key which can open the door to higher perception, unlocking the perfect wisdom in your very own heart! Through quieting the mind and focusing your attention, you will allow your own innate inner wisdom to flow into your awareness.

Identify target behaviors.,
Include the right mix of quantitative and qualitative monitoring.,
Build in rewards.",How to Self Monitor Your Behaviors1," It is best to monitor one behavior at a time. This can be anything you choose, from dietary choices to how often you get distracted. Choose the most important/interesting behavior and monitor that first., Quantitative measurements allow you to put a numerical value to your observations. Qualitative measurements depend on experiential evidence. You should favor qualitative measurements whenever possible, as they are more objective and reliable., You can reinforce behaviors that you want to exhibit by building rewards into your plan. Each time you observe yourself behaving the way that you prefer, you reward yourself. Make the reward proportional to the behavior you want to exhibit.For example, an appropriate reward for spending an hour studying could be taking a walk. A weekend out of town would be a more appropriate reward for having made straight A’s.

"
"
Use prompts to initiate recording.,
Create charts to count events.,
Tape yourself.,
Decide when or how additional technology will benefit monitoring.,
Utilize your smartphone.,
Invest in additional bio-monitoring equipment.,
Graph your results.",How to Self Monitor Your Behaviors2," It is not always possible to record every move in real time. In this case, designate certain times or situations in which you will record your behavior. You can set a reminder such as an alarm to help you remember.For example, you could count the number of times you raised your hand at the end of a class instead of trying to count how many words you spoke.

, Having a chart with appropriate columns (e.g. one each for behavior, time, and frequency) can make recording much easier. You can hand draw a chart or print one off from a computer. If you are having trouble designing the chart, look for a chart template., In some situations, the behavior measured is impossible to keep count of alone. For example, if you want to know how many times you looked down while delivering a speech, you cannot count during the speech. Instead of trying to count them as you go, record yourself with a video/audio recorder. After the event, go back and count the times you exhibited the behavior in question., The behavior being monitored will determine when/how technology will be helpful. Physical activity is a commonly monitored behavior. Technology is very well suited to help you measure anything from heart rate to steps taken in a day.Many technological devices do the work of graphing your behaviors, too.

, If you have a smartphone, you may not need to buy any new equipment. Smartphones can use apps to tell you how far you’ve walked, what pace you held, and how many calories you burned. They can be used to keep track of dietary habits, sleep patterns, and a host of other daily behaviors. If your phone does not come with an app for monitoring these behaviors, you can go to your app provider and download one., If you decide that your smartphone does not accurately measure all of the variables you want to measure, you can get more advanced equipment to monitor your behavior. Devices such as an EKG or EEG can be used to monitor the heart and brain respectively. You can also use MRI technology to monitor your brain’s behaviors. While these devices have great potential, they are not always readily available to the public and may require a large financial investment., Once you have tallied up the number of times you showed a certain behavior, you can put the information into a graph. This allows you to show the frequency of your behavior compared to another variable, such as time. This can be a great tool for monitoring your progress when working on different behaviors."
"
Study the graph.,
Fade prompts and rewards slowly.,
Use your results to model future efforts.",How to Self Monitor Your Behaviors3," The graph of your results will not only show you the frequency of a given behavior, but also your trends over time. You can use the graph to compare different variables and analyze where your problem behaviors, or desired behaviors, show up most often. This can help you adjust your rewards and prompts to maximize results.For example, if you are trying to exercise more frequently, you can study a graph of how often you take an evening walk. If you notice that you consistently miss walks on Tuesdays, you can analyze your Tuesday routine to identify the problem and fix it.
If you are using something like a smartphone, it will often generate graphs for you automatically.

, As you start seeing more of your favorable behaviors, you should start using your recording prompts and rewards less often. Taper off by using only half as many prompts for a while, then half of that, and then no prompts at all. You can do the same with rewards., Once you have created a successful routine to monitor and change one behavior, you can apply that routine to other aspects of your life. Each behavior you alter may need slight adjustments, but overall the same method should work for groups of similar behaviors. This will allow you to monitor and tweak any behaviors that you would like."

, Do not give in to peer pressure. If someone tells you to light one up or take a pill, refuse immediately in a strong voice a walk away. If they are your friends, they are not true.


Do not be rash with relationships. A lady is a subtle flirt, nothing more.







, Brush your teeth twice daily. Shower daily or every other day depending on your schedule. Wash your face twice daily. Get a facial once in a while. Just look clean and pampered.

, Dress in modest and timeless pieces. Never make yourself look like a boy. Don't ever reveal too much skin. Have a style icon such as Audrey Hepburn. Not only does she dress impeccably, she also is an ideal role model.

, Try stick to the natural look with BB cream, a full set of brows, glowing cheeks and plump, soft lips.

, Style it to appear refined. If a lady was feeling adventurous, she might want a pixie cut or a side shave!

, Never slouch or lag. It is not ladylike and will cause health problems. Imagine a string is tied to your stomach and is pulling you up straight and high. Also hold your head high, but not too much.

, Even though this seems cheesy, smile!

Ideally, you should try to eliminate any conscious thoughts and let your mind rest in a blank state.While the goal of meditation is to clear your mind of all thoughts, many novice meditators find this difficult. A good way of training yourself to meditate is to keep your mind completely focused on a singular object like a red ball.

Chuck Roast
Beef Stew
Shredded Chicken
Turkey Breast
Soup

, If you make large batches of food, you can save them by freezing. This will reduce waste and save time. Stick the extra servings in a plastic container or freezer bags. If you need a quick meal sometime later in the month, you can thaw it out and cook it. You should let foods cool completely before placing them in the freezer. You can hurry this process up by letting them cool in the refrigerator.
If using freezer bags, make the bags as flat as possible. This will help them thaw more quickly.
Label the food with both the date you cooked it and the meal name before placing it in the freezer., Some foods are fast but still healthy. Try to pick healthy foods that are easy and quick to make. This is especially helpful with side dishes, such as vegetables or starches.Frozen vegetables are just as healthy as fresh vegetables. They usually only take a few minutes in the microwave to cook.

, Family dinners are a great time to bond, and if your family enjoys the meals, they’re much more likely to stick to the meal schedule. Try to come up with interesting topics for discussion. If the children don’t answer right away, you can start discussion by giving your own answer. You might try asking: If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?
Are you meeting any interesting people at school?
Have you had any interesting dreams lately?
If you had a superpower, what would it be?
If you could meet anyone from history, who would it be?

The list currently should not be very detailed or specific - you are simply doing a quick first draft. Include everything on your list, no matter how big or small the task, to make sure nothing gets overlooked.;
,


Ask yourself ""Does this task really need to be completed? Will it help me to reach my long term goals? Is it urgent and/or important?"" If you answer 'no,' simply get rid of the task.
If you have children, assign smaller or easier tasks, such as folding laundry or vacuuming, to them and reward them with an extra dollar in their weekly allowances. This will free up your time for bigger jobs and help them learn responsibility.

, SMART is an acronym which stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time based.


Specific: Make your goals specific. For example, if your current goal is to lose weight, you should specify how much weight you want to lose.
Measurable: Have a way to measure progress. For example, if your goal is to write a novel, you could measure your progress by looking at how many chapters you have wrote.
Attainable/Achievable: Decide if your goal is possible. For example, will you really be able to lose a stone by the end of the week?
Relevant: Set goals that you want/need to achieve, not what others think you should. If a friend thinks you should aim to become good at chess, and recommends you join a chess club, but you hate chess, do not join the club,(Although, if you dislike it because you aren't good at it, you can improve).
Time based: Create a time you want to achieve the goal by. For example, if your goal is to write two chapters for a novel, set a time you want to have wrote the two chapters by. The end of the week? Before the month is out? Make sure to set a realistic time.

, Everything needs to get done, but some need to be done sooner than others. Complete everything that's urgent or that has a strict deadline to make sure nothing is late. Put these tasks at the top of your list or highlight them so you can do them first, then focus on jobs that have a more flexible time line.

, Plan on a half-hour to wash the dishes or an hour to mow the lawn. This will help you organize other tasks and know how much time you have left to work with.

, Perform chores that require you to travel when traffic is light to save time. Avoid running errands during rush hour or when school lets out and buses will be driving children home. Traveling at times when traffic is light and on direct routes will reduce the amount of time you waste sitting in your car.

,


Make the most of commuting time - maybe you could listen to podcasts while driving? Public transport systems are good for reading things.
Carry around reading material or transportable tasks so that you can read/do them whenever you are waiting for something.
If possible, record programs instead of watching them on T.V. This means you can watch them later and save time by fast forwarding through the adverts.
Learn to do the good type of multitasking. Get it all done by multitasking and combining small jobs to save time. Write out your grocery list while you're waiting for the iron to heat up or organize the pantry while the dryer's spin cycle finishes. This will help prevent wasted time and get you started on your next task so you don't lose momentum.

, Stay away from social media sites and email while trying to do work. Ask other people to not distract you because you are busy. Turn off your phone. It is also possible to download computer programmes which block certain sites while they are turned on.

Dim the lights around an hour and a half before bed.
Do not use electronics in the hour leading up to bed.
Make sure you are relaxed when in bed.

, You may have heard that you should aim to drink 8 cups of water a day, but you will need even more when doing large amounts of exercise or in hot weather. If you are well hydrated, your urine should be very pale.


Find a reusable water bottle you like and keep it with you wherever you go. This will make drinking water more convenient and you will begin desiring water more.
Drink a cup of water with each meal.

Research the eatwell plate.
Pick one or two things to change about your diet, and start simply with those. Every week or two, try something healthy and incorporate it into your daily or weekly menu.
When cutting out something bad from your diet, replace it with something healthier and tasty.
The first things to cut out are fried, fatty foods (like McDonald’s) and stuff that’s too sugary (donuts, colas, candy) and other junk food. Don’t cut it out completely, but start to phase it out gradually and replace it with healthier, tasty stuff (see first two rules).
Eat smaller portions and more often during the day. If you wait until you’re really hungry, you’ll pig out.
Pack healthy snacks to take with you, and plan for meals when you go on the road.
Set long-term goals, and don’t expect quick results. Be patient!

Know how much physical activity you need.

Adults between 19 and 64 should get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. The guidelines suggest that you spread out this exercise during the course of a week. Adults should also carry out strength training exercises at least twice a week. People at the age of 65 or over should have the same amount of exercise but at a lower intensity.
For people between the age of 5 and 18, 1 hour of exercise should be carried out a day.
Children under 5 should have around 3 hours of physical activity a day.


Exercise doesn't have to be in large chunks - four ten-minute walks is not much worse than one forty minute walk.
To make exercise more fun, do it with friends or family and/or do activities you enjoy. Most children do not see exercise as a chore, but as a fun activity. Climbing trees is exercise!

Put aside your doubts.,
Don’t obsess over money.,
Be prepared to encounter obstacles.",How to Find Your Calling," In order to pinpoint your passion, it’s worth asking yourself how you would spend your day, every day, if you didn’t have other responsibilities to get in the way. Take into account your curiosities, hobbies or favorite activities and see if you can identify a common thread running through them. For instance, if it brings you joy to babysit or coach a little league team, working with children might be what you were meant to do.Think back to your childhood ambitions. The dreams of your childhood can act as a compass to point you toward the things that really matter to you.It’s just as important to consider what you don’t like to do. Anything that makes you miserable is not worth your time.;
, Your vocation won’t necessarily be clear to you right away. However, you can inch your way closer to it by trying your hand at a multitude of related jobs or disciplines. You might find that there’s one aspect of a certain field you enjoy more than another, or that learning about a subject in a broad sense helps you narrow your focus to a more specialized niche.Volunteering as a student reader might spark a desire to be a teacher, which might make you interested in working with underprivileged students, which could ultimately lead to teaching abroad.
There are always ways around your circumstances. For example, if football is your consuming interest, but you were injured playing in high school, try getting involved in a different way by going back to school to study exercise science so you can work directly with professional athletes.

, Sometimes when you get bogged down with your own thoughts, it can help to get some perspective from your loved ones. The people closest to you can offer insight into what they see as your natural talents and highest virtues. These viewpoints can be refreshing if you feel burned out from trying to come up with an answer on your own.Pose questions like, “What do you think are my strong suits?” or “In your opinion, what do I care about more than anything else in the world?”
Your friends and family know you best—in some ways, maybe even better than you know yourself.

, There may be naysayers that come along and tell you what you should be doing with your life, or attempt to belittle your dreams by saying they’re unrealistic. Don’t listen to them. At the end of the day, finding your calling is about being true to yourself.You're the only one who can decide how to live your life.
If you’re constantly worried about what other people may think, it will limit your ability to act in your own best interest.

, Once you have an idea of your life’s true purpose, it’s time to develop a plan to put it into action. To get started on your journey, look for jobs, internships or educational programs related to your field of interest. The ultimate aim is to be able to make a living doing what you love.Study the success of people who get paid to do what you want to be doing.It may be necessary to take an indirect route to reach the place where you want to be. For example, if you’re determined to become a world class sushi chef, you might have to start as a line cook in a local Japanese restaurant and work your way up from there.

, Wearing many hats will sharpen your awareness of what you like to do most. For instance, you might work as a community organizer by day and run your own personal training business in your free time. There’s no need to confine yourself to a single endeavor—in fact, diversity may be the key to contentment for people with wide-ranging interests.Having multiple different jobs will not only provide additional sources of income, it can also keep day-to-day tasks from becoming monotonous.
As you get more invested in your side job, you might be able to find a way to make it your primary line of work.

, If you have a particular set of interests, take every opportunity you can to explore them on your own time, even if you're not getting paid. Whether it’s breeding horses, designing video games or making art, seizing on occasions to indulge your interests is essential for finding contentment.You won't always be able to put your dreams into practice professionally, but making room for hobbies you enjoy can be very beneficial to your health and happiness.
Consider demonstrating your craft via competitions, exhibitions or self-publishing. This will give you a more public outlet for letting the world see what you can do.

, Upon discovering your purpose, set your sights on what you want to accomplish and pour everything you have into it. Make it your mission to constantly find new ways to get better, to do more and to be more useful.Remember: getting good at anything is a matter of practice. The more time you spend improving your craft, the more of a difference you’ll be able to make.
It’s pointless to compare yourself to other people. Not everyone has the same capabilities, motivations or desires. Rather than trying on being the best, focus your attention on ticking off your goals., At times, you’ll be confronted with the fear that you’re not good enough, that people won’t understand you or that you should have settled on a “safer” career. It’s natural to have these kinds of concerns when you’re stressed out or uncertain about what lies in store for your, but they don’t mean that you’re not cut out for your vocation. Learn to recognize them for what they are—insecurity—and keep pushing ahead.When you catch yourself experiencing doubt, remind yourself how fortunate you are to able to do what you love most.
Doubt can sometimes be a sign that you’re better off using your talents some other way. There’s no shame in moving on to something else when you no longer feel as strongly about your passions as you once did.

, While making a living is definitely a necessity, it shouldn’t be the deciding factor in determining how you answer your calling. What’s more important is the satisfaction and sense of purpose your life's work brings you. As long as you're keeping the bills paid, you can continue devoting yourself to more meaningful pursuits.Find a side job to supplement your income while you concentrate on the thing that makes you happiest.The career that pays a lot may not be right for you, and the career that’s right for you may not pay a lot.

, Following your calling won’t always be easy. There will be failures, stumbling blocks and heartache along the way, but you shouldn’t let them hold you back. If you truly believe in what you're doing, you’ll stop at nothing to see it through to the best of your ability.Take disappointing setbacks in stride, then bounce back and redouble your efforts.
Think of difficult times as challenges to strengthen your resolve.
People’s priorities change with time. Don’t be afraid to let yourself evolve naturally. Your might stumble upon a different calling as you grow and accumulate new experiences.

Stop and consider.,
Accept things you cannot change.,
List and evaluate your perspectives.",How to Put Things in Perspective1," When you feel like that you aren’t able to put things in perspective, or that life seems too much, stop whatever you are doing and reflect on the situation.Taking some time to ask yourself some simple questions and become more mindful of the situation may help you to see things differently.Ask yourself: “What, exactly, am I struggling with?” Pinpointing the specifics can help identify how you can assess and change.
Consider: “How do I really feel about this situation?” If your emotions are turbulent, you are more than likely unable to put things in a clear perspective.
Ponder: “Why do I react this way? What are the causes, and are they appropriate?” Sometimes, we can overreact to a situation. Stopping to think about the reasons why we might be doing this can help put our thoughts in a clearer perspective.;
, Worrying about things out of your control can be futile and infuriating. This can definitely lead to a muddled perspective on life.To work toward a habit of accepting things that cannot be changed, do the following:


Recognize your role in the situation. Is the situation out of your control, or can you do something to change it?
Stay positive. If you’re in a situation that you cannot change, at least try and find something positive about it. This will help you cope.
Move on.If find yourself in a recurring situation in which you have no control, analyze the steps that got you there and consider an alternative route.

, This will help you become more honest with yourself. It will also provide a tangible list to consider when trying to evaluate your values and perspectives.


Consider perspectives. How do these perspectives shape you and your relationships with others. This will help you develop perspective on your life and your relationships. Ask yourself:
”Does my view on affect the way I treat ?”
For example: “Does my view on Judaism affect the way I treat my Christian friends?”
Do my parents unhappy marriage affect the way I treat my significant other? Is it fair?

Toss files that aren’t necessary.,
Make a numeric or coded filing system if your office is already using codes.,
Consider moving to a digital filing system if you get few physical documents but keep plenty of digital files.,
Store all types of documents together.",How to File1," You will need a filing system that is big enough to handle the amount of filing you need. If you can’t afford a state of the art file cabinet, check thrift stores or used furniture stores for used models.;
, You will need a standardized procedure that all people filing documents will follow. Type this set of instructions up, so that documents can be accessible to anyone who needs them.

, When it comes through the door, you should write or stamp the date on the top, in the same location on each document. Take the time to write dates on past files for consistency.

, Separate your documents into projects or subsets of projects. Over time, you may need to adjust this system slightly to accommodate projects with large amounts of data.

, If the filing cabinet has multiple levels, you can use the top cabinet for ongoing projects and the bottom cabinets for completed projects.

, Folders are available in a large number of colors. Buy a different color for each type of project you are working on. For example, all financial files might be blue, while all design files might be pink.

, Most file cabinet folders come with plastic tabs and labels. Use them to ensure you can open your filing cabinet and immediately find what you need.

, Keep them in chronological order with the oldest at the back. It will save you time when you need to hunt for a document.

, Put the documents you need to deal with in the day’s system so that you can organize what you need each day.


Move the files that didn’t get dealt with today into tomorrow’s folder if need be.

, Since you have ongoing project folders, you should file important documents in those sections. You will lose fewer files if they are in the correct place.

, Part of a good filing system is throwing or shredding non-essential documents. It will reduce the size of your files and allow you to find other documents more easily.

, This can be a great way to use the job-specific information to file documents more accurately., Some items, such as receipts, are created to fade over time, so they are better for a digital filing system.


Move on to the next method to learn how to transition into digital filing.

, Instead of keeping a separate section for disks, thumb drives, folders or flyers, keep all types of documents together as long as they are part of the same project or subject."

Stop comparing yourself and your actions to others.,
Learn from history and from others.,
Talk to others.,
Focus on what you can do.,
Look to the future.,
Identify your feelings rather than focusing on others.",How to Put Things in Perspective2," Comparing yourself to others -- in any way like job, looks, talent, intelligence, etc -- is unfair. You live an entirely different life than others, and it has affected and shaped you differently.This will help ease expectations you set yourself, and help put your own life in perspective.


Remember that you are unique; no one else has the same exact history as you.
For example, do not compare your looks to your friends. They have had different experiences than you.
If you feel like you are not as smart as your classmates, consider the fact you have a different educational history and experiences than them.

, Whatever you are struggling with, a great way to put your life in perspective to consider what has come before. Consider what has happened in history and think about your problems in relation to that.


Your problems and your life may still cause you to feel strong emotions. It is very important not to discount your emotions even if you think that you might “not have it that bad.” Reflecting on historical facts is meant to consider change, not to discount your thoughts.Read books on history or take a class about a culture that might interest you. There are also great history podcasts that are offered for free through very reputable institutes and organizations.

, A great way to find perspective is to talk to others. They can help you consider new view points or acknowledge your viewpoints and opinion.


Always be polite and respectful to people’s perspectives, even if they are different from your own. Perspectives and stances can be personal.

, Seeing a situation as hopeless can make it hard for you to get anything done, but you can change that. If you feel like you are not capable of changing something, then try to identify something small that you could do.For example, if you feel like you are not capable of finding a job, then try to identify what you might do to start the process. Perhaps you could identify three jobs that you would like to apply for or fill out one job application at a place that is hiring.

, A negative outlook may make you feel like things will never change, rather than viewing the future with hope and possibility. Try to reframe any negative thoughts that you have about the present with positive thoughts about the future.For example, if you think to yourself, “I am never going to finish this project,” try asking yourself something like, “When I imagine myself completing this project, what do I see happening to reach that goal?”

, Fears about how other people view you may also interfere with your ability to have a positive outlook. Instead of focusing on how other people may or may not see you, try to focus on how you see yourself.For example, if you find yourself thinking, “No one likes me,” try asking yourself, “What do I like about myself?”

Studies have shown that those who can adapt and accept changes in life, live a happier life (and sometimes longer) life.A great way to do this is to look at old pictures. You can see how you’ve changed physically to put things in perspective.
You can take pictures of yourself in the moment to create a baseline of what you want to change. This “before” picture can be a great motivator and really help to focus on the now.

, You are one of more than 7 billion people on this earth.This can be a comforting thought if you think you may be the only person who struggles with a specific problem.


You are one person in this universe. You will not be able to conquer all of the world’s problems on your own.
Another great way to gain perspective is to watch documentaries to learn about the world around you. Your local library may have some great ones to get you started. Learning about other cultures or history can definitely put your life in perspective.

,


One way to do this is tap into your own empathy. Think about how many children go without food or do not have families. Use this empathy for good and consider giving to therapy.

, As with the world’s population, it is sometimes comforting (although sometimes awing and scary) to think about what a vast universe we live in.


For example, the sun, which is so small in the sky, is 93 million miles away.When we consider this, it is easy to see how small we really are and how small our problems can be.
To do this, stargaze. The sky can look endless.
Check out pictures of the universe. There are great free images available to showcase just how beautiful and vast universe is."

Create attainable goals.,
Forgive yourself.,
Avoid the dramatic.,
Acknowledge that you are your own person.",How to Put Things in Perspective4," One step to maintain perspective is to to create attainable goals, rather than focusing on too big or unreachable goals.


For example, if you need to lose 100 lbs and you can not quite put that in perspective or believe it, try breaking it down into smaller goals. For example, try starting with losing 5lbs a month.

, You cannot move on and put your life in perspective without first forgiving yourself. Acknowledge what you struggle with, and then work toward forgiving yourself.


For example, if you feel like you are holding on to a past mistake, you can try writing down what it is you need to forgive yourself for. After this acknowledgement, think about the associated feelings with this past action. Take small steps from this to let go of these feelings and get a fresh perspective.

, If you find yourself stressed and out-of-perspective because of drama in your life, try and remove yourself from dramatic situations.


Avoid hanging out with friends who like to cause personal drama.
Consider changing careers to maintain a healthy outlook on life.
Surround yourself with people who make you feel good and encourage the positive.

, To maintain a healthy perspective, you should always remember that you are your own person. You, and no one else, are responsible for your own actions and reactions.


Take time to pamper yourself. Take a day off and do something you enjoy. This will help you realize you can make it on your own.
Think about what YOU want to achieve out of life, and not what someone expects you to do.

Set a deadline.,
Create a to-do list.,
Prioritize.,
Make a schedule and manage your time.",How to Finish What You've Started1," Having a deadline (especially one set by someone else) increases task completion and reduces procrastination.If you have a pre-set deadline, remind yourself why you need to keep that deadline. Identify consequences of not meeting the deadline. Write the deadline on your calendar and circle it.
If you do not have a predetermined deadline you can set one for yourself. Identify how long you need to complete the task. Be reasonable and allow yourself plenty of time in order to reduce unnecessary stress.
Set a deadline for each small part of the project you have identified. This way you will be able to keep yourself on track as you go along. For example if you need to complete a research paper by next month, you might set a weekly deadline in order to complete certain portions of the project (such as conducting research and creating an outline).
If you find yourself distracted or procrastinating, look at your calendar and remind yourself of your deadline. You can think or say something to yourself like, ""If I continue to procrastinate I might not meet my deadline. I need to focus on my goal."";
, Having step by step instructions can help people achieve more and complete assignments or projects.If you learn to break down huge tasks into smaller steps over the course of days, weeks, or even months, it can reduce the stress you feel about the project.


Focus on completing small sections at a time. Taking small steps consistently adds up. If you were to write 10,000 words in one day, this is a major achievement, but you wouldn't be able to keep it up. However, you could write just 200 words a day and get more done. This takes almost no time, and over the course of a year would add up to 73,000 words.
Simply write down everything you need to do to finish the project. For example, maybe it is a school project and you need to: research the topic, write the essay, make a PowerPoint presentation, write a speech and practice your speech. Each of these items may require a separate to-do list. Be as comprehensive as possible.

, One of the most important aspects of success and completing projects is prioritization. We need to prioritize our tasks if we want to be efficient and complete them.


After you’ve made a to-do list, take the most important or time-limited part of the project, and do that first. Focus on one thing at a time. For example, you would need to research a topic before you began writing a speech about the topic.
Perhaps you do not need to focus on certain tasks at the moment. For example, maybe you want to program a game, but you've lost interest in it. Don't force yourself to do something that has greater negative outcomes (boredom, time wasted, etc.) than positive outcomes (in this case, computer skills and possibly money). Always focus on what you have to do first such as work or school obligations rather than personal projects.

, Many people find that scheduling their activities makes them much more likely to carry them out. Take each item on your to-do list and allow yourself a reasonable time to complete it.


Keep a calendar and make sure you identify what needs to be done each day in order to eventually meet your goal. If you don’t complete everything you needed to each day, don’t be hard on yourself, simply add it to the next day.

Create a backup system before you organize.,
Set the backup system to backup your entire computer and/or website information daily.,
Purchase a scanner that connects to your computer.,
Keep your backup password protected.,
Decide if you want to use software or not.,
Create a standard naming system.,
Codify your folders and subfolders.,
Avoid the temptation to save files on your desktop.,
Research and use native programs.",How to File2," The most important part of digital filing may be ensuring that all your files aren’t lost if a hard drive shuts down, a computer is stolen or a password is lost. Purchase a removable hard drive or a cloud storage system.


Better yet, create two backups. If you are going paperless, you should have an on-site and off-site backup, in case something happens to your office or computer.

, For businesses that log a lot of information daily, you should back up every hour.

, Scan each important document when it arrives in the mail to create a digital backup and filing system. For extensive digital filing projects, buy a document scanner with an automated document feeder and filing software to save time., Remember that it is safer to write down your password on a piece of paper stored in your wallet or on your desk than it is to store it on a document on your computer. A digital thief is less likely to go into your office than onto your computer.

, If you want to control all of your files directly, you should simply set up folders and sub-folders on your computer’s hard drive. If you want to jump into a previously created document management system, buy a filing software and scan program with Optical Character Recognition (OCR).


OCR means that the scanned documents that are created are searchable. The computer can read the documents when you type search terms into the software program.
OCR filing systems will allow you to search for documents using text that might be within the document, such as a store name or a subheading.

, Name each document in the same manner, including the subject, date and other pertinent information. For example, receipts should have the store name, date and products you purchased.

, If you are filing using folders instead of a document management system, you will need to separate your documents using dates, subjects or projects. Create a new subset of folders to organize folders that have too many documents in them.

, Once you download files, name them according to your system and file them immediately for easy access.

, Apple computers come with color-coded tags for frequently used files. Both Apple and Windows computers often come with automatic backup and search capabilities.

Nail down the little tasks sooner rather than later.,
Be comfortable with alone time.,
Ingest some of your favorite media.,
Take time to complete the daily goal that you meditated on.,
Get to bed at a reasonable hour.",How to Find Time1," Whether this occurs on Monday morning or over the weekend, it's good to create a loose sketch of what you'll need to accomplish each day of your week. New tasks will surely crop up, especially if you're working for full-time or caring for your children, but it's good to have a rough outline of your weekly schedule.


Make sure that you're adding to this guide throughout each day. This way, you won't forget to take care of new issues that present themselves.You might want to rely on an iPhone Calendar or online planner, but a hand-written list is often very helpful, especially because writing by hand can improve your subconscious memory of your tasks.
Keep multiple plans or lists for different responsibilities in your life, (i.e. Groceries, Work, Kids' Schedules), as well as a Master List that can dictate the entire schedule of each day. Try color coordinating your lists. Creating these distinctions between your responsibilities will keep them organized.
In addition to your daily schedules, it's helpful to have a list of larger weekly tasks that you'll need to accomplish. This will put the smaller responsibilities in context with more overarching responsibilities that you certainly can't ignore. It's important to balance your energy between day-to-day and weekly tasks. This will ensure that you don't forget things on a minute scale or on a larger scale.;
, Whenever you get the opportunity to be alone during your busy week, take five minutes to think about an achievable goal for that particular day. The practice of setting daily goals is immensely important to your personal happiness.Try to fit the time necessary to accomplish this goal into your schedule.


Your daily goal doesn't have to be attached to how you'll be spending the majority of the day itself. In fact, it's often useful to separate this goal from your work schedule or other more time-consuming commitments. That way, this time will feel like your time and no one else's.
Creative types might fill this time with working on finishing the latest draft of their novel or sketching out an animation design. Even if you don't consider yourself a creative type, however, you still have the right to this time. The goal will vary on a case-by-case basis, so make sure that it aligns specifically with what you feel you need to accomplish on that particular day.

, Whether this is responding to an email you've been ignoring, cleaning your counters, or taking the dog out for a walk, make sure that you don’t ignore the small daily chores. They will linger in your mind throughout the day, distracting you.

, 55% of Americans believe that their alone time “very important,” while an additional 30% call it “important” to their happiness. Take solitary moments throughout the day and don’t feel uncomfortable about wanting them. Everyone needs some time to cool off, and you'll find yourself refreshed if you take this time, especially if your daily schedule involves a great deal of communication with others.In the technological age, it's tough to feel completely detached, as we're constantly in communication with others because of our phones. For that reason, your alone time might also involve shutting off your mobile device to avoid distractions.Let anyone that you're speaking with know that you're going offline for a while; they might have the desire to do the same!

, This could range from reading a book to listening a brand-new album that you've discovered. Regardless, it’s important to enjoy some entertainment when you can in order to reduce stress levels.


If you're more into the idea of doing something active, take a long run or hit the gym. Whether you need mental or physical stimulation is up to you.

, If you haven't done it already, make sure that you take the time to achieve your goal. If you had a more open-ended goal, like making more eye contact with others, you may have been achieving this goal all day. If not, however, take some time to be productive for yourself.

, It’s tough to always get eight hours of sleep with any busy schedule. If you’ve planned your day out right, hopefully you can. Research shows that even an extra 60-90 minutes a night can help your happiness, so starting there might be more realistic.Even after a busy work day, it's often tough to calm the overactive mind before falling asleep.Some tips for falling asleep include:


Slow your heart rate with long, calming breaths. Exhale any of the troubling or anxious feelings from the day.
Lead yourself through a guided meditation, either with strategies that you've learned or using an audio CD.
Read a book, but not one with too much intensity, or else you may not be able to fall asleep.
Turn off your computer far before bedtime, as the glowing screen will keep your eyes from properly settling down.

Wake up earlier in the mornings.,
Give up one commitment in your day.,
Use your lunch hour for yourself.,
Leave work or school early.,
Skip social gatherings for time to yourself.,
Extend your childcare one hour extra a day.",How to Find an Hour a Day for Yourself1," If you are a morning person, you may find it easy to wake up one hour earlier in the morning to create some extra time for yourself. Set your alarm to one hour earlier than your normal wake up time. Having extra time in the morning can also give you a chance to prepare for the day ahead.If you are not a morning person, you may get yourself used to waking up earlier by adjusting your wake up time gradually. You may start by waking up fifteen minutes early one morning, then thirty minutes early the following morning, and then forty-five minutes early the next morning. Over time, you should be able to wake up every morning one hour earlier.
Make sure that you still get eight hours of sleep a night so you are not sleep deprived during the day. You may adjust your bedtime so you go to sleep earlier to then allow you to wake up earlier and still feel well-rested.;
, You may also shuffle your existing schedule around by giving up one commitment in your day that is not absolutely necessary or “must-do.” This could be in-person meetings that can be done more efficiently through email or a meet up with a friend that you may be willing to skip. Look at your schedule and try to identify commitments that you could give up to make one hour of time for yourself.You may also try to move around existing commitments on your calendar to try to carve out one hour of free time a day. Perhaps you shorten your meeting times so you have a full hour of time at the end of the work day. Or maybe you allot time between two commitments to just be free time for you.

, If you get a full hour for lunch, you may decide to use that time to yourself. Rather than go out with coworkers every day or eat with friends, you may opt for doing something for yourself during your lunch hour. This way, you can also get a break in the middle of your day and spend some time on your own.You may try alternate lunch days where you spend time with coworkers or friends and time alone. This may allow you to feel social and also enjoy your solitude.

, You may also try to set aside time for yourself by leaving your workplace early or getting out of school a bit early. You may need to rearrange your existing schedule so you still get your work done and can leave early. You may get into a new routine where you get into the office earlier. Or you may try to get to school and study in the mornings so that you can then leave earlier at the end of the day., Though you may enjoy spending time with friends and family, you can put aside time for yourself by skipping social gatherings. You may opt for spending time on your own as opposed to socializing with others, especially if you feel you desperately need solitude. Avoid planning social gatherings too often during the week. Spread out your hang outs so you are not committed to going out with others every day.For example, you may designate one day on the weekend as your hang out day and plan to see friends on this day. This may then allow you to carve out one hour of time to yourself during the weekdays.

, If you are a parent with children and you are trying to find an hour of free time, you may consider extending your childcare. You may ask your babysitter to stay an extra hour a day so you can take some time for yourself or arrange for your children to stay in daycare for an extra hour. This may then allow you to take time for yourself amid your busy schedule and caring for your children.

Limit distractions and interruptions.,
Ask for help.,
Reward yourself.,
Encourage yourself.,
Take breaks.",How to Finish What You've Started2," Interruptions may create a need for closure in unrelated areas. This may account for why interruptions or distractions cause us to be preoccupied with something else, or to get off track.Put yourself in a comfortable, quiet area that can help you focus. This may be a library, coffee shop, your work desk, or your bedroom.
Play some music if that helps you concentrate.
Put your phone down or in another room while you work. Another option is to block social media sites form your computer, or set a time-limit you can spend on them. You can also disable your account on certain social media sites (i.e. Facebook) for a while and then regain it once your project is finished.

, If you get stuck, one of the best ways to move forward is to get assistance or guidance.


Get another perspective.
Ask someone to keep you company while you work on it.
Find someone that will work on it with you.

, Rewards, or positive reinforcements, help people stay on track and finish tasks.Reward yourself after completing a small section of the task. Perhaps allow yourself some time to watch television, eat a snack, or play a game.
Plan on rewarding yourself after your goal is finally completed. You could take yourself to dinner, go on a vacation, or plan a fun weekend.
If you find yourself distracted again, set boundaries - tell yourself that you are not allowed to do anything else until you get a portion of the task completed (not a large part but one that takes a few hours or so). Plan on a particular reward that you enjoy once that portion is finished.

, Using positive self-talk or affirmations can benefit your ability to be productive.Repeat several times throughout the day, ""I will finish this.""
Repeat, ""I'll finish this for ""
Leave it in a place that you frequently pass by as a reminder. You'll think, ""Oh! I still have to finish that!"".

, Research suggests that taking breaks can actually help you increase your ability to brainstorm and become more productive overall.Take a little break, stretch or move around, and come back to it once you're refreshed.
Take a few hours or a day off if you find yourself overly stressed out. New ideas may arise.

"
"
Focus on your commitment.,
Change your thinking.,
Become interested in the topic.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Finish What You've Started3," Focusing on why you wanted to do what you started can help you identify reasons to stick with it.


Why did you begin this project? Make sure to think about your true motivation. For example, if you are writing a novel you may want to become published, but why - to express your ideas? To write the story which has been unconsciously building in your head?
Identify why it is important to complete. Perhaps you need to write an essay or speech for school or work. Will there be negative consequences of not completing it such as a lower grade or a negative effect on your work reputation?

, If you are avoiding the work it may mean that you are evaluating it in some way that creates a desire to avoid it. Sometimes we may think thoughts like, “This is too hard,” or, “This is going to take too long.” These thoughts can lead to anxiety and avoidance.


Focus on what you have completed in the past. We often remember or think about our unfinished tasks rather than our finished projects.Control perfectionism. While perfectionism does help you to have higher goals in life, it can also stop you from completing tasks, especially creative tasks like writing a novel. This is because perfectionism can make you feel as if the project is never good enough, and you will just continuously try to improve it.
Forgive your procrastination. Accepting your procrastination and forgiving yourself for it can actually lead to less procrastination.This is because when we accept our mistakes we can then begin to change them. The acts of fighting against them or denying them do not allow us to move forward toward positive change. If we let ourselves be controlled and do not accept ourselves, we give power to the problem. Instead of holding on to the rope in the game of tug-o-war, simply let go. However, this does not mean make excuses for yourself or give up completely on your goals. It means accept and admit that you have a problem with procrastination and then work toward a positive solution.
Celebrate what you've done so far! This may help you to feel better about the project.

, When you are interested and can use a variety of your skills when working on something, procrastination is reduced.Find a way to be interested in what you are working on. For example, if you are writing an essay – make a creative thesis and focus on writing about what interests you. Be creative.
If you get stuck, try brainstorming or free association. Simply write down everything that comes to mind when you think of your project. This can help you come up with new and create ways of looking at your task., You won’t be able to be very productive if you aren’t healthy enough to complete the task. Being healthy can help to increase your motivation because it can give you the physical energy that you need to move forward.


Manage stress appropriately through exercise, relaxation time, and keeping yourself occupied with positive endeavors.
Exercise – try yoga, dance, aerobics, or kickboxing.
Take care of your physical health. Eat healthy by eating enough protein, fruits, and vegetables. Get enough sleep; your brain continues to work on problems while you are sleeping."

Learn how to convert the first twelve hours of 24-hour time to 12-hour time.,
Learn how to convert the second twelve hours of 24-hour time to 12-hour time.,
Convert backwards from the 24-hour clock to the 12-hour clock.",How to Convert from 24 Hour to 12 Hour Time," In 24-hour time, 00:00 is equal to 12:00 AM, and then you can think of the rest of the hours between 00:00 and 12:00 as being equal to the hours between 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM on the 12-hour clock. This means that the conversions are as follows:


00:00 = 12:00 AM
01:00 = 1:00 AM
02:00 = 2:00 AM
03:00 = 3:00 AM
04:00 = 4:00 AM
05:00 = 5:00 AM
06:00 = 6:00 AM
07:00 = 7:00 AM
08:00 = 8:00 AM
09:00 = 9:00 AM
10:00 = 10:00 AM
11:00 = 11:00 AM

, If there is a time that reads 12:00 or greater for the hour, know that it will convert to a PM-based time on the 12-hour clock. When the hour is greater than 12, subtract 12 from the hours and that will get you the time in PM. Here's how you do it:


13:00 - 12:00 = 1:00 PM
14:00 - 12:00 = 2:00 PM
15:00 - 12:00 = 3:00 PM
16:00 - 12:00 = 4:00 PM
17:00 - 12:00 = 5:00 PM
18:00 - 12:00 = 6:00 PM
19:00 - 12:00 = 7:00 PM
20:00 - 12:00 = 8:00 PM
21:00 - 12:00 = 9:00 PM
22:00 - 12:00 = 10:00 PM
23:00 - 12:00 = 11:00 PM

, Once you know what to do whether you're working with a time between 00:00-12:00 (just add ""AM"" at the end) or a time between 12:00-00:00 (just subtract 12 and add ""PM"". at the end), then you're good to go when it comes time to convert from the 12-hour to the 24-hour clock. Here's how you do it:


For times between 00:00 and 12:00 (12:00 AM - 12:00 PM.), just write down the time without using ""AM"" or ""PM"" So, 1:00 AM = 01:00, 2:00 AM = 02:00, 11:00 AM = 11:00, and so on.
For times between noon and midnight (12:00 PM - 12:00 AM), just add 12. For example, 1:00 PM = 01:00 + 12:00, or 13:00, 2:00 PM = 02:00 + 12:00, or 14:00, 11:00 PM = 11:00 + 12:00, or 23:00, and so on.
If the time is exactly 12:00 PM, then just write 12:00. If it's 12:12 PM, then just write 12:12
There is no such thing as 24:00. 24:00 is really 00:00, and it means midnight.
Just convert the minutes along with the hours. So, 22:34 in the 24-hour clock just becomes 22:34-12:00, or 10:34 PM.

Eliminate potential distractions from your workplace.,
Catch up as quickly as you can.,
Learn how to say ""no."",
Remember why you love your job.",How to Find Time2," This could be more mental, like sleeping enough to operate at your highest level of efficiency. It also could be quite practical, like making sure you have all your needed supplies and uniform. Try to prepare the night before, setting out your clothes and work bag in a place where you can easily access them.When you wake up, everything will be laid out for you and ready to go.

, Before each work week, you should organize your schedule for the entirety of the week. It's also beneficial to plan out each work day into a separate daily schedule. Make sure that you're comfortable not only with the work you'll have to do each way, but also with the amount of work that you've committed to for the week. If you plan realistically for your own workflow pace, then you can avoid falling behind.


Use a priority matrix to help you organize responsibilities in a simple, direct way.Any task that falls into the First Quadrant should be taken care of immediately. That way, you won't miss any deadlines. This will give you ample time to work on important Second Quadrant tasks, which you can complete at a comfortable and productive pace. This will also showcase your highest capabilities as an employee. Using this method of organization will prevent you from wasting time on unimportant busy work or forgetting about important tasks that aren't yet urgent.

, Whether you’re taking public transportation or driving, the commute can be a great time to shut out outside stress and attempt to reduce it in a healthy way.


You may want to use this time to manage loose ends in your job itself, i.e. responding to emails, but it’s often best to focus elsewhere during your commute, if you can. Listen to a podcast or journal on the train. If you hold yourself to a day of productivity, you should feel comfortable taking this time for yourself.

, Even though the work week can be long, it’s highly beneficial for both you and your co-workers if you keep up a positive energy. Your negative attitude can have a much larger effect on the group than you might think.If you tune others out throughout the day or allow mistakes to frustrate you, you'll not only be less efficient, but will also damage relationships with your co-workers, precipitating a more hostile work environment.

, There are countless ways to distract yourself from your work, especially while working at jobs that require a great deal of computer usage. From Facebook to Instagram to reading articles in the New Yorker, any excessive web surfing can really take your mind off of completing your work.If you receive an email or message from a friend online, don't feel the pressure to respond. Send them a short message letting them know that you'll get back to them when you have time, or just save your response until after work, especially if it doesn't seem urgent.
Even if you do have some downtime at work, don't fall back on these distractions. If these forces stop you from completing your work, you'll regret it at the end of your work day, spilling your job stress into your personal life. Avoid it!

, If you are falling behind, don’t push your incomplete work until the next day. It will end up piling up over time, and you’ll finish your work week unsatisfied and frustrated.


If you're attempting to get a week ahead, there are many strategies for completing extra work.Don't think about this as completing additional work in a more expedited way. Instead, imagine that you're still working at your normal pace, but simply doing work for the future. This will probably require dipping into your relaxation or social time for the present, but if you know that you're getting ahead for upcoming leisure time, you'll thank yourself later.

, It's okay to kindly refuse an offer to take on more work at your job.When you're just starting at a company or hoping to move up, you might feel the pressure to accept all offers thrown your way. If you know that you can't handle any additional responsibilities, you can be honest about this with your employer. Here are some guidelines to know when saying ""no"" might be appropriate:


You're already a little behind, or feeling overwhelmed by your current workload.
There aren't enough hours in the day. This might seem simplistic, but look at your current schedule to figure out if you actually have enough free hours to take on more work.
You won't be able to complete your other responsibilities if you take on a heavier load.
You aren't qualified for the tasks that have been laid out for.
The company's progress might suffer because of your inability to complete your tasks.

, At the end of the day, you should be satisfied by your work. Even if it’s a day job that doesn’t align completely with your passions, something about the job, whether it’s the work environment or the cause that your work supports, should inspire you. Never forget why you wanted the job in the first place.


If you can’t find a reason for liking your job, find a new one. It’s very hard to get yourself unstuck from a bad job, but if you aren't happy working there, then it will benefit you to look elsewhere.

Plan ahead.,
Meet somewhere convenient for both of you.,
Don’t be self-conscious about asking people to hang out.It’s not always easy to reach out, especially when you haven’t seen this person in a while or your last attempt to make plans was unsuccessful.,
Create big groups to get more people involved.When everyone is busy, it’s often tough to find one-on-one time for everyone.,
Make sure your friend time isn’t distracting from alone time.",How to Find Time3," People often have trouble finding time for socialization because of the meticulous planning that it requires, especially with busy work schedules. If you really want to see another person at a particular time, contact them early in the week before you both get too busy., This might mean that you'll have to travel to them, if they have a crammed week. Don’t be afraid, however, to ask people to come to you if you’re short on time. They’ll appreciate your honesty. Even better, meet somewhere in the middle.

, Don't let this hold back your attempts to maintain interpersonal relationships.


Even though it requires some extra effort, don’t shut yourself off from forging new relationships. These might include colleagues or people you’re taking an outside class with. Part of socialization involves getting to know new individuals and introducing them to old friends. It’ll be an exciting blend for all parties involved!

, Invite a group of friends to your home for board game night or out to a local bar. Most people will appreciate this opportunity to catch up with a larger number of friends.


Don’t let socialization suck up all of your money. Hanging out can often get expensive, especially if you make plans for dinner, drinks, movies, etc. Be honest with your friends and yourself and do some free activities when you can!
If you sense that a person does need alone time with you, you should be sensitive to that. This is especially true for a significant other, who may want time away from a massive group.Large social situations will be great for some couples, but you don’t want to ignore your partner's desire for a more intimate environment.

, Even though socialization can help you cut loose, it’s still important to take time for yourself, especially after a long week. You’ll also struggle to be as fully responsive and present with your friends if you haven’t taken the time to check in with yourself.

Go on a social media diet.,
Be more organized and time efficient at work or school.,
Designate one day to do chores.,
Place your children in a one hour a day class.,
Let family and friends know you need some “me time.” You should also communicate you need for “me time” to those closest to you.",How to Find an Hour a Day for Yourself2," You can add an extra hour of time by taking a step back from social media, especially if you find yourself glued to your computer or your phone throughout the day. You may try to spend one hour off your phone so you do not look at social media. You may also close your computer for an hour so you do not surf the web. You could then use this one hour of time for yourself.If you find you are a chronic email checker, you may try to cut down on checking your emails every hour. Try to set aside time in your day for checking emails and avoid looking at emails when you wake up in the morning. Often, if something is very important, you will get a phone call or a text message., You can add an extra hour to your schedule by managing your time at work or at school. Rather than have tasks scattered throughout your day, try to group tasks together so you do several things within a short time frame. This can then help you to have extra time in the day for yourself.You may have a day planner where you schedule in every hour of the day. Include an hour of time for yourself as part of your schedule and then plan around it.
You can also try overlapping tasks so you can get two things done at once. For example, you may take your child on an adventure to the post office and the grocery store so you can take care of your child and get your errands done all at once.

, You can also try planning to do all your chores on a set day during the week so you can have free time for yourself. Grouping all your chores together on a chores day will also ensure they all get done every week.For example, rather than do the laundry in small amounts throughout the week, you may designate one day as laundry day and get it done all at once. You can then use the time you might have spent on laundry throughout the week on free time for yourself instead.

, If you are parent, you may find it challenging to carve out ""me time"" in your schedule. You can allot some time to yourself by putting your children in a class that takes one hour a day, such as a dance class, an after school art class, or a sports class. Once you drop off your children, you can use the hour to focus on you and take some time to yourself.


If you have a partner, you may also ask them to do the picking up and dropping off so you can stay home and enjoy one hour to yourself.

, Let your family and friends know that you are trying to set aside an hour a day for yourself and ask them to respect your alone time.You may also ask your family and friends for support. Ask your partner to help you out and cover a few of your responsibilities so you can enjoy your alone time. Or, you may have a family member come over and babysit for you so you can have an hour to yourself.

Do self-care.,
Focus on a hobby you enjoy.,
Improve your existing skill set.,
Volunteer your time.",How to Find an Hour a Day for Yourself3," You can take advantage of your free hour a day to do some self-care, where you focus on your needs and wants. You may practice emotional self-care by writing your thoughts down in a journal or by doing meditation to manage your stress levels. You may also do physical self-care like doing a fitness class or going for a relaxing walk.You may also try doing professional self-care, where you set up a comfortable work station for yourself in the office or at home. You may also use your hour a day as a break from work so you can do a relaxing activity on your own.

, You may also use your free hour to do a hobby you enjoy doing on your own. You may create something as a hobby, such as woodworking, painting, or drawing. Or you may enjoy cooking or baking as a hobby.You may also use exercise as a hobby you enjoy. You may schedule in one hour runs or one hour workout sessions as a way to stay healthy and do something you enjoy.

, You may opt to use your hour for yourself to work on getting better at your existing skills. This may be especially useful if you have career goals that require you to improve upon your current knowledge or abilities.You may use the free hour to do tutorials and learning modules online to become certified in a certain field. Or you may take a one hour online class to improve on your existing skill set.
You may also use the free hour to explore information online or in person that could help you advance your career. This way, you can use your free hour productively.

, You may give back to others by using your free time to volunteer for a cause or organization you believe in. Look for a local organization that you can get to easily from your home or from work and devote one hour a day to volunteering. You may also donate your time at school for a cause you believe in.

Get a spacious backpack.A good backpack with multiple compartments can assist your organizational development.,
Take notes in class.,
Organize schoolwork events and assignments.Put all your assigned homework, tests, and projects in a list.,
Use folders to manage your assignments.You can have one folder for each class.,
Place sticky notes on important documents.If you have colored sticky notes, then you don’t even need to write on them.,
Use colored pencils or highlighters on important passages.When trying to identify the main idea of a text, or important information within a given paragraph, trace beneath it with a colored pencil, or go over it with a highlighter.",How to Develop Organizational Skills1," Keep books in one pocket, assignments and class folders in another, and school materials like pencils and calculators in another.;
, You can use multiple notebooks (one for each class) or just one big notebook separated into sections with dividers for each class. Listen carefully to your teachers or professors and write relevant material in the corresponding notebooks.

, Order them by due date. For instance, if your math homework is due tomorrow, your history test is in four days, and your physics homework is due in two days, complete your math homework, then your physics homework, then study for your history test.


If you have two assignments due on the same day, do the easier one first. This way you will be able to get it out of the way and have an accomplishment under your belt to keep your momentum and motivation high.
When you get new assignments, projects, and tests, write them down in a daily notebook. At the end of the day, consult the notebook and revise your larger list of existing assignments and tests by incorporating the new assignments.
Get a planner. A planner is a special notebook specifically designed to help you schedule your time and keep due dates for tests, homework, and projects organized.

, Use folders of different colors, and try to match them to the covers of the corresponding textbook for that class.Within each folder, it is helpful to have (at least) two pockets. You can use one pocket for completed assignments that you wish to turn in, and one pocket for assignments which you have not completed and need to finish. If you have a third pocket in your folder, place returned and graded assignments in there.

, For instance, you could place a pink sticky note in a text book with half of it sticking out over the top edge of a page you want to study later. You could apply a green sticky note to assignments that are due next week. Use a system which makes sense to you in order to indicate due dates or levels of importance.


If you’re using non-colored sticky notes, write the relevant information on the sticky note. For instance, you might write “Due Tuesday, 2 November” to help you remember when something is due.

, This way, your eye will automatically be drawn to it when you flip through the text later.


Do not write in textbooks that you do not own.

Identify what you want to achieve through organization.,
Start developing organizational skills with small, practical steps.The task of developing organizational skills can take time.,
Work on the most pressing assignments first.Give each assignments or project a separate folder and order them by due date or importance.,
Discard clutter.You probably have a lot of stuff in your cubicle or workspace that has nothing to do with your work.,
Use the one-touch rule.The one-touch rule demands that you either discard, file, or act on a given memo or document (by, for instance, replying to it) immediately.,
Put old documents you’ll need to consult again in folders.Label each folder clearly according to its contents.,
Find an appropriate storage space for necessary documents.Once you have filed your old documents, find a way to store them.,
Make checklists.Each day, draft a list of everything you need to do that day.",How to Develop Organizational Skills2," Do you want to work faster? Do you want to spend less time looking for documents or files? Organizational skills can enhance many aspects of your workflow. To help you stay focused on the best steps to remedy your disorganized work habits, think about what the end result of a more organized office or workspace might look like.

, Break it into smaller, more manageable chunks to ease the burden. Try to integrate at least one new organizational technique into your workflow each day.


For instance, you might start by organizing your desk drawer. The next day, maybe you’ll start by organizing your storage folders and files. The third day, you could try re-ordering your project queue so the work projects due soonest are on top.
Think about your work space and find small ways to become more organized each day.

, After finishing a project, empty the folder and bin documents that you won’t need again.


If you are unsure which assignments are most pressing, or need more time to work on something, ask your boss which tasks are absolutely crucial and which can be deferred., Recycle it, throw it away, or take it home. For instance, your takeout menu from the local Chinese joint should be recycled. Even some work-related documents or items should be removed. You don’t need two pairs of scissors or two staplers, for example. Find an appropriate place for the extra stuff in your workspace.

, By dealing with incoming documents immediately, you avoid a build-up of unread documents.

, For instance, you might label one folder “Budget - 2012” and place everything related to the 2012 budget in that folder.


Do not keep or store documents you won’t need again.

, You could store them in small plastic boxes, or in vertical filing cabinets. Whatever method you choose, ensure they are ordered in a way that makes sense to you.


Your company or employer may have a protocol for storing necessary documents. Ask if you are unsure.

, Rank the items from most to least important. The most important things are those which you need to do, or things that have a deadline or time limit. The least important things are those that can wait until another day if necessary.


For instance, if you have to pick up the dog from the vet, buy groceries, and read a book, then decide which is the most important (picking up the dog) and then decide which of the remaining two chores you’d rather do.
Planners are good tools for managing your time. A good planner will have both a calendar and a daily view, allowing you to add more detail for things you need to do.

Clean up regularly.You could divide household duties up on a permanent basis, or choose to rotate cleanup tasks.,
Put things away when you’re done with them.,
Choose a designated study or work space.Study or work in a space which is quiet, clean, and well-lit.,
Select a specific time to study time.,
Establish a regular bedtime.",How to Develop Organizational Skills3," Keeping the house clean with or without a full family takes a lot of energy and can help develop planning and organizational skills.


If your family chooses to permanently assign cleanup chores, you might do the dishes each night, someone else might do the laundry, and someone else may do the vacuuming.
If you choose to assign cleanup tasks on a rotating basis, you could use a calendar to track who is responsible for what and when. You might write “Bobby, dishes / Sandra, laundry / Mike, vacuuming” on Sunday of one week. The next Sunday, you might write “Sandra, dishes / Mike, laundry / Bobby, vacuuming.”

, Everything should have a proper place assigned to it. After you’ve used something, place it back where it belongs. For instance, put the salt and pepper on the table where they belong, and put dirty dishes in the sink when finished eating. Encourage the rest of your household to do likewise.

, It might be helpful to have a desk or table on which to work. Stock the drawers with small containers containing useful materials like pencils, erasers, and paperclips.


Try to keep your study space free of distractions like TV and video games. This might make it easier to stay organized and focused on your work.

, Set aside time to study for tests and do your homework. Ideally, you should study at the same time each day. Think about your schedule and choose a time when you will feel fresh and motivated to get some work done. The best time to study is usually not immediately after school. Try to wait until shortly after dinner so you have some time to relax, shower, or talk to your friends.


For instance, if you get home at 3:00 each day and like to have a snack and chat with your parents, set aside time from 6:00 to 8:00 or so to work. Extend the study period if you need to.

, Getting enough sleep is always a challenge. Having a regular bedtime and wake-up time makes it easier. Set an alarm clock so that you wake at the same time each morning. If necessary, set an alarm clock to indicate when to go to bed as well.


With a regular bedtime, it may be easier to wake up fully rested and avoid scrambling for your breakfast, books, assignments, backpack, or suitcase.
Adults need to get at least seven hours of sleep each night.Aim to get at least that many hours of sleep. For instance, if you want to be up by 8:00 each morning, be in bed by midnight to allow yourself time to fall asleep.

"
Take advantage of technology.Phones, computers, and tablets have many useful organizational tools.,
Organize your electronic files.Create a folder named for each assignment or class you have to add work on.,
Use the one-touch rule for email.When you receive an email, reply to it immediately if necessary, or archive it if you think you’ll need it in the future.,
Use a digital watch.A watch helps you manage your time.",How to Develop Organizational Skills4," For instance, you could use your phone’s calendar to create automatic reminders that a certain assignment is due soon, or that a meeting is coming up. While these tools might have a slight learning curve, making use of them will help you develop your organizational skills.


You could also download useful organization apps to help you develop organizational skills. Things is an app that helps you create checklists and break complex tasks down into simple steps. RescueTime is another useful app to help you keep track of your time when you’re online by monitoring and reporting back to you what you’re looking at the most.Besides the calendar, you can organize names, phone numbers, email addresses, and home or business addresses with your phone.

, For instance, you might create three folders labeled “History,” “English,” and “Sociology.” Within each folder, you could add new folders with dates for each week of assignments you have.


For example, you might create a folder titled “6/6 - 6/10/2016” to manage all your assignments written between the dates named in the folder.
Alternately, you could just keep all your files on a given project or topic in one folder, and use the operating system’s built-in organizational options to sort the files by date of creation.

, Delete old messages you won’t need again. Check your email at least once a day to ensure they don’t pile up. The more emails you have, the less likely you’ll want (or be able) to sit and check them all.

, Without a watch, you will be constantly looking around for a clock, or forget about the time altogether.


Set the timer on your watch to ring when you need to transition to another task. Factor in the time it takes to get ready and travel to your next destination as necessary. For example, if you have to be at school at 8:00, you might set your watch to, for instance, 7:30 so you have time to prepare and travel there.

Consider who you’ve become and what defines you.,
Reflect on the differences between your ideal self and actual self.,
Keep a journal to track your journey of self-awareness.",How to Practice Self Observation1," Over the course of our lives, we go acquire deeper levels of psychological awareness. During adolescence, we form our identities and our self-image becomes more robust. Spend time reflecting on you’ve become, what values you hold most dear, and what your defining traits are.Ask yourself, “What sets me apart from others? What characteristics make up my essence? What are some key life experiences that have made me who I am?”
Examples of traits and values could include humor, honesty, or loyalty. A skill like singing or an athletic ability could be an important part of who you are.
Remember to be open to more than just positive attributes. When you’re reflecting on who you are, be open to things about yourself that might not be the best qualities. For example, you might ask yourself, “How is my laziness or temper a part of me? How do these attributes fit into my overall being, and what do I desire to change about myself?”;
, Think about how you represent yourself to others, especially as you consider the attributes that make you proud and those you’d like to change.Ask yourself, “What are the differences between how I represent myself to others and how I perceive myself? Do I let others define me too much? How can I integrate, or unify, the ideal self that I show others and the actual self I try to keep to myself?”

, Psychologists agree that self-awareness is a dynamic, changing process. We shift between degrees of self-awareness, self-deception, and everything in between.

Try keeping a daily journal and write a daily self-reflection to keep a record of your journey.

Write down a few details about your day, how you interacted with others, and recall your reactions and feelings about the day’s various happenings. You might write, for example, ""Today I ran into James and we ended up having a disagreement. He said something that I thought was an underhanded way of insulting me, so I called him on it immediately. It escalated, and we ended the conversation on really bad terms.""
Choose a regular time, whether every couple weeks or once a month, to read your past entries. You might read back an entry and think or write in response, ""After a couple weeks' distance, I've realized that James probably wasn't trying to offend me. Reading my entry back, I realize I probably jumped to conclusions. Observing this conversation with a little distance has given me the motivation to try to smooth things over with James.""
Try not to feel embarrassment or self-judgment when you read things you wrote, but try to be open to learning about yourself. Observe yourself taking shape with each experience. Open yourself up to being aware of how you react to various situations, how your feelings respond to interactions, and how those responses in turn shape you into the person you are.

"
"
Prepare to meditate.,
Ponder your blind spots.,
Become your own inner witness.,
Consider using a guided meditation app.",How to Practice Self Observation2," Find a quiet place to meditate that’s free of noise and other distractions. Designate a time that you can dedicate to meditation without thinking of other tasks or necessities.


Sit comfortably on a cushion or chair. Play soothing music or white noise sounds if it helps you free your mind. Close your eyes or leave them open, depending on whichever better helps you focus.
Control your breathing by counting to four as you breath inward, holding for a count of two, then counting to four again as you exhale.

, As you put yourself in a meditative state, try to open your mind to objectively consider your blind spots. Visualize your actions and thoughts as if you were a detached observer. Open yourself to self truths you might be keeping yourself from discovering.Ask yourself, “Do I have any unrealistic expectations of myself, or of my thoughts and actions?” As you breath, visualize your self-expectations melted away with each breath.
As each layer of expectations melt away, imagine the self truths left behind with each passing layer of your self-representations. Ask, “What thoughts, values, and experiences are left behind as I peel away the various ways that I show myself to the world?”

, Focus on an individual thought, emotion, or action. Try letting your mind wander, and as your mind generates random thoughts, follow them rather than react to them. Observe your own stream of consciousness as if you were an outsider looking within your mind, then guide yourself back to your silent meditation.Ask, “What is this thought or series of thoughts, and why does my mind conjure it? What does it mean that my mind drifts into this stream of consciousness?""

, You might think you need to switch off your mobile device in order to meditate. However, there are several excellent mobile meditation apps available for both Android and iOS that can help guide you to a peaceful, reflective state.The Mindfulness App, Headspace, and Calm are easy to use and have free services with additional options for per track purchases or monthly subscriptions.
The app Smiling Mind is completely free and offers tracks divided by age group, making it a great option for children, teens, and adults.
If you want to avoid using your mobile device or don't have one, you can also search Youtube for guided meditations that encourage mindfulness and self-reflection.

Use self observation to learn new skills.,
Record yourself doing your job.,
Focus on progress when practicing self observation.",How to Practice Self Observation3," There's evidence that observing yourself on video as you learn a new motor skill provides motivation, better execution of the skill, and helps you remember how to do the skill. Further, self observation using video benefits both children and adults.

Consider using a cell phone or other video recorder to observe yourself. It can help you have an easier time learning a new routine in dance class, footwork for a sport, or other physical act of coordination.

, In addition to learning new activities, you can use self observation to improve your job performance. For example, it's been shown that observing video of themselves at work had positive effects on teachers' professional development.Similarly, evidence suggests that video recording helps nurses and student nurses master clinical skills and improve patient interactions.Since cell phones and computers with built-in webcams have made video recording so universal, you can easily apply these findings to your own life. Record yourself doing your job to promote your own professional development. If you have to make a speech or presentation, record yourself and look for parts of your public speaking performance that need a little work.

, Successes and failures are central to self observation, whether you’re practicing meditation, keeping a journal, or recording yourself giving a presentation. Cognitive behaviorists and psychologists agree that focusing on accomplishments when observing or monitoring yourself generates more accomplishments.In other words, recognizing your progress motivates you to keep succeeding. Emphasizing failures decreases motivation and lowers the chances of future progress.
Stay positive when practicing self observation and focus on how you can improve yourself instead of things you don’t like! When observing your own flaws and failures, look for potential causes and changes you can make instead of just getting discouraged.
For example, you might read a past journal entry and think, “Gosh, I really overreacted and lost my temper for no reason,” or you might have noticed in a video recording that you kept missing a step in a dance routine. Try not to focus on what you did wrong, but think of ways you can improve your temper or nail that dance step.

Acknowledge and accept the feeling of depersonalization.The feeling of depersonalization is usually not dangerous and commonly fades.,
Focus on your immediate surroundings.Notice what the temperature is, what things are around you, and what sounds you are hearing.,
Engage with those around you.Begin a conversation, or get back into the conversation you were having.",How to Overcome Depersonalization1," Remind yourself that the feeling is uncomfortable, but temporary. This will make depersonalization have less control over you.


Tell yourself, “This feeling will go away.”
Tell yourself, “I feel weird right now, but I am OK.”
Think about any other instances in which you experienced depersonalization, and remember that the feeling went away then, too.;
, Engage with a nearby object, such as turning on a fan or writing with a pen. This will force your mind to be in the present moment, and it will lessen the feeling of depersonalization.


You can also carry around a tactile item, such as sandpaper or something furry, to touch during intense depersonalization moments.Mentally list things you see, hear, and feel around you.
If possible, listen to music. Aim for favorite tunes that give you positive feelings, rather than any music that may increase anxiety or sadness. Research shows that music therapy is effective for all sorts of mental illnesses and can significantly reduce anxiety, depression, or agitation, all of which may be present in chronic cases of depersonalization., This will bring you into the present moment. If you are alone, text or call a friend or family member just to chat.


You do not have to reveal your depersonalization to others.
At the same time, many people are aware of and have experienced depersonalization; if you feel comfortable, talk about your feelings with a friend as they are happening.

Practice diaphragmatic breathing.When you feel anxious, your body goes into ""fight or flight"" mode.,
Combat negative thoughts.,
Make time to engage in positive activities.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get adequate sleep.",How to Overcome Depersonalization2," Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can interrupt that reaction and help you to relax. To practice diaphragmatic breathing, lie on your back on your bed. Leave your knees bent by placing a pillow beneath them for support. Place one hand on your chest and one below your rib cage to monitor the movement of your diaphragm. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose. Notice your stomach pushing your lower hand out (the upper hand should remain still). Tighten your stomach muscles, and exhale the breath through pursed lips making sure that your chest is not moving. Repeat.


If you are in a group situation, excuse yourself to the bathroom or another private area to practice deep breathing.
You can breathe in this rhythmic way for 5 to 10 minutes about 3 or 4 times per day when you notice yourself feeling anxious or disconnected.

, Having feelings of depersonalization can cause you to think you are crazy, to feel as if you are not in control, or might even make you feel like you will faint or stop breathing.Combat any negative thoughts with positive statements, such as:


I’m going to be ok. I will relax.
Feeling like I’m not real isn’t dangerous; I’ll be fine.
I don’t like these feelings, but they will go away.
I am present in this moment.

, Your hobbies may include playing the guitar, scrapbooking, or collecting antiques. Whatever it is that relieves your stress, try to do it often, particularly when you find yourself experiencing more anxiety or depersonalization. This will prevent moments of severe anxiety and will help lessen the instances where you feel depersonalization.


Practice stress management daily whether that means taking time out for quiet or pulling aside a few minutes everyday to take part in an activity you enjoy.

, Because depersonalization is commonly associated with anxiety and depression, exercise is a great way to relieve feelings of being “un-real.” Exercise boosts your confidence, releases tension, and helps manage stress levels.Engage in daily walks, begin a jogging regimen, or find another type of physical activity that relieves your stress.


Scientists have found that a neuropeptide called galanin, which is released during and after exercise, protects the synapses in the prefrontal cortex and helps our brains with emotion regulation and stress resilience., Maintaining a regular sleep regimen of about 8 to 9 hours per night is significant for relieving anxiety and overcoming the resulting depersonalization that can occur from it. The link between sleep and anxiety/stress is a two-way street, in which not managing one causes a problem in the other. Practice good sleep hygiene to ensure that you get the amount of sleep required to fend off feelings of depersonalization.Avoid caffeine or alcohol as they both can trigger anxiety and keep you up at night.
Establish a winding down routine nightly that includes relaxing activities such as reading, listening to soothing music, or meditating.
Reserve the bedroom for sleep or relaxation only. And, cut off all electronics at least an hour before bed.

Find a therapist.,
Attend therapy as often as necessary.,
Keep a diary of your symptoms.,
Take medication if necessary.",How to Overcome Depersonalization3," If your feelings of depersonalization are interfering with your daily life, you need to consult a medical professional. There are many types of therapy for treating depersonalization disorder. When finding a therapist, ask what type of counseling they provide and which type of counseling is right for you. Common forms of treatment for depersonalization include:Cognitive therapy- works on changing your thoughts about feeling unreal
Behavioral therapy- helps you to develop behavioral strategies to distract yourself from depersonalization symptoms
Psychodynamic therapy- aims to resolve painful feelings and experiences that stimulate a need to detach from yourself and reality
Grounding techniques- similar to those listed above, these tactics use the five senses to help you feel more connected to yourself and the world around you
If you find a certain therapist to be unhelpful, you can always go to a different one.

, This will vary according to the severity of your depersonalization. Some people attend therapy monthly, weekly, and, in severe cases, daily. Your doctor will determine how often you should go to therapy.


Skipping out on therapy sessions will prevent you from getting the help you need; attend all scheduled appointments.
If you do not have a scheduled appointment and feel like you need immediate help, call 911.
If you are suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)

, This will greatly aid you in communicating about your depersonalization. Write down where and when you have any attacks, and record as much detail about the attack as possible, including your thoughts at the time. If you feel comfortable, show these records to your therapist, or bring them to therapy sessions as a reference.


Be sure to take note if the symptoms of your depersonalization overlap with that of another illness. Depersonalization often accompanies serious mental illness such as schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Tell your doctor if you are avoiding friends, family, work or activities that you once enjoyed because of your symptoms as this could indicate a larger problem or a co-morbid disorder., Though there is no medication specifically prescribed for dissociative disorders, anti-anxiety or antidepressants are commonly prescribed with varying degrees of success. Your doctor may prescribe fluoxetine, clomipramine, or clonazepam.Just remember, if you do begin to take medication, never stop taking it without consulting your doctor first.
Avoid drugs and alcohol when taking any anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication.
Never take more medication than the prescribed instructions allot.

Set SMART goals.,
Develop a personal mantra or motto.,
Find music that motivates you.,
Analyze your role model.,
Expect setbacks.",How to Overcome Your Problems when Everybody Is Against You1," Specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, time-bound (SMART) goals are the best way to success. This method of setting goals allows you to define a goal that can be reached in a way that you can measure your progress and success over a period of time. Once you have set your goal, go through each letter of the SMART acronym:Is this goal specific? Can it be more specific? Instead of saying “I will do well in school,” you should say “I will achieve a 3.0 this semester.”
How will I measure success? In the example above, success will be measured by your GPA.
Is my goal attainable? Are the resources needed available? - Do you have the books and other resources you need?
Is my goal realistic? Can it be achieved in the way that I propose? Are your grades currently at a place where a 3.0 is possible to attain?
Have I given myself an appropriate amount of time for this goal? If you set this goal in the last week of the semester, it might not be a reasonable amount of time. You should set such a goal in the beginning of the semester, giving you the entire semester to work on the goal.;
, To develop a motto or mantra to drive you toward success, you should consider your core values. What are the most important qualities and concepts in your life? Which ones will help you attain your current goals?Once you have your SMART goal set, you can use it to develop your motto. To use your motto or mantra, repeat it to yourself often (especially when your motivation needs a boost).Using the 3.0 goal above and noting that academic support is an important concept in your life, you might develop a motto such as “Go to class, don’t slack.”

, It is important to listen to music that you can identify with. Make sure that you identify with a positive, motivating message in your music. Music has the power to alter your mood and attitude in a way that few things do. If you do not identify with the music you listen to, try browsing the internet and trying different genres and playlists developed by others. These can easily be found places like Pandora and YouTube., It is often very helpful to have someone to emulate. It does not matter if your role model is your father, or your favorite superhero. Identify the things about that person that you admire and try to emulate them. Use these positive traits to propel yourself toward overcoming your problems on your own., One common mistake that people make is expecting to overcome their problems with no problems. This is not usually the case, especially with the added obstacle of having little or no support. Learn from your setbacks and keep pushing forward."

Sequester yourself.,
Remember the problems that lust creates.,
Pray for God's help.",How to Overcome Lust," Learn to stop seeking out things which make you lustful. This mainly means training yourself to fight the temptations of pornography but it can also mean not going to movies or avoiding driving on certain parts of the highways. This is difficult, but lustful habits are just like any other bad habit and can be broken. Be persistent!;
, If you allow lust to be the driver in your daily relations with others, then you're not connecting fully with yourself. You are allowing your bodily desires to determine who you are and how you behave, rather than letting your mind and personality do some of the thinking. Similarly, you are not respecting them by viewing them in this lustful way. If you truly have feelings for them, you will work hard to fight these feelings and do right by them (and yourself!).

, Drugs and alcohol remove your inhibitions, making it harder for you to fight lustful feelings. If you partake in these, stop. It will really help a lot! You can still go out to bars with friends, just ask to drink any soft drink or apple juice instead (both look like alcohol, so you won't feel awkward).

, Most holy books acknowledge that sexual desire is normal, so don't feel bad about having sexual needs. Acknowledge them, because not doing so can create a very unhealthy mentality and make those feelings even stronger! Let yourself feel sexual feelings but do not act on them.

, There are lots of different kinds of lust and lots of different ways of looking at lust. Now, if your lust is causing or may cause someone else physical harm, then yes, it is a problem that needs to be dealt with. However, if your sexual feelings are released between two consenting adults, that may be okay. Sexual feelings are natural, and if your concern with them is only based in your religious teachings, it may be time to further explore other religious teachings. Different sects will take very different positions on the matter.

, If you go in unprepared, then of course you're going to have problems. Acknowledge that you have issues with lust and then prepare yourself when you know you will be going anywhere with temptations. Preparing yourself mentally and having a game plan is half the battle., When you go somewhere where temptation is strong, follow the practice of bouncing your eyes. This means that if you see something that can cause lust, immediately find something else to look at. This is a very handy practice and can help a lot.

, Another thing you can try is to focus on doing something you enjoy. This is a great trick for when you're having lustful thoughts at home or in other areas where your temptation is within yourself and not from an outside cause. Having an activity which is mobile is especially helpful, since these thoughts can occur at any time.


Consider learning decorative braiding, or other creative hobbies which are easy to do anywhere.
You can also challenge yourself to memorize as much holy text as possible.
Another method would be to volunteer. This is an activity which can not only distract you but it can also help you do God's work.

, Another way to distract yourself would be to recite, either aloud or in your own head, any verse you know. This can remind you of God's love and help you keep his laws.

, The best way to avoid lust is to remove the causes of your temptation. For many people the main cause of temptation is pornography. If you find that you can't focus on the important parts of life and your pornography collection is building up like the pyramids in Egypt, it may be time to take a break. Set up a filter on your computer to keep you from looking at the images.

, If you cannot avoid the person who causes you to lust, you'll need to find a healthier way to interact with them. One option would be to only spend time together when you are with other people. This will help keep you from saying or doing things you shouldn't.

, If even spending time only in groups isn't helping, another option is to spend time with them only in places like a church, temple, or other holy meeting place. God will protect you and help you focus only on Him and not on your lustful thoughts.

, When you look at them, make sure you focus only on their eyes and not on any body part which excites your lust. They say that eyes are the window into the soul, so focus on their eyes in order to see their soul. This will help make you more respectful and remind you how God would want you to treat them.

, Only do things with them that respectful friends would do. Do not do activities which may seem like dates. Just look at any situation you're in and think about what your grandmother would say about what you're doing. If she would approve, then you're probably okay.

, Touching them, even if you just touch them in reasonable places like the hand or arm, can sometimes make lustful thoughts worse. Try not to touch them at all, if you're really having trouble. This can help a lot.

, If you really can't keep your behavior in check around your boyfriend or girlfriend, it may be time to get married. This is God's intention and why he created husbands and wives, so that they can exercise these feelings in a way that pleases him.Just keep in mind that you should marry someone who is a good match, spiritually, physically, and mentally, for you and only get married if you are ready to be serious about each other. If you can't take your relationship that seriously, you may not be ready for a sexual relationship.
Getting married to give yourself an outlet for sexual feelings should be a last resort. Marriage is a serious undertaking and should not be approached lightly.

, If you do not have the option of marriage and the other tricks aren't working, you may need to acknowledge that you need help. You know what they say: ""Admitting that you have a problem is the first step to fixing it"".

, Talk with your local priest, preacher, imam, rabbi, or other spiritual adviser. They will be able to give you some advice and also help keep you on the right track. That's what they're there for! Don't be ashamed: they are trained to deal with problems like these and they know that this can be a problem for even the most devoted and faithful.

, Take yourself as far away from temptation as possible. For men this may mean joining the military. For women this may mean going to an all-women's college or all-girl's school. Your family will understand and support your decision. Stay with members of your own gender until you learn to overcome your feelings.

, If you act on these lustful thoughts, you are opening yourself up for according punishment. STDs, STIs, unwanted pregnancy, as well as other punishments, will await you if you cannot keep yourself under control. Be careful and act responsibly!

, God will help protect you from these unwanted feelings but you must work with him. He will send you help but you have to keep your eyes open and look for the solution that he has sent. This can be hard sometimes, but with the help of your friends, family, and spiritual advisers, you will get the help you need.


""No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."" - 1 Corinthians 10:13

Understand the tax consequences.",How to Choose Between Compensatory Time and Overtime," Federal law requires that you be paid 1.5 times your base pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a week.You should first calculate your base rate of pay. For example, if you are paid $12.00 an hour, then this is your regular rate of pay.


If you are paid a salary, then you need to divide your salary by 40 hours in order to get a regular rate of pay.
Under federal law, a worker with a base pay of $12.00 will earn $18.00 in overtime pay.;
, States can also pass their own overtime laws provided the state law is more generous to workers than the federal law. In California, for example, you can get overtime pay if you work more than eight hours in a day. If you work more than 12 in a day, then you get double pay.For example, if you work 10 hours in a day, then you must be paid overtime for the two extra hours on that day, even if you work 40 hours or less for the entire week.
California also grants overtime pay if you work seven consecutive days. On the seventh day, you earn 1.5 your regular rate of pay. If you work more than eight hours on the seventh day, then you earn double the pay.
To find your state’s overtime rules, you should contact your state’s Department of Labor. You can find contact information on the Internet.

, Before you can choose between comp time and overtime pay, you should calculate how much you will be paid if you work overtime. For example, if your regular rate of pay is $12.00, then you will earn $18.00 for every hour of overtime.


If you worked 50 hours in a week, then you would earn $480.00 in regular pay and then an additional $180.00 in overtime pay. Your total paycheck would be $660.00.

, Each state has an agency that handles wage and hour issues. It is usually the Department of Labor. You can direct any questions you have about how overtime pay is calculated to the agency.


To find your state agency, you can visit the Workplace Fairness website. They have a map of the United States.Click on your state, and you will be provided with the name and contact information of your state’s agency.

, It is a common misconception that you will earn one comp time hour for each extra hour worked in a week.However, federal law mandates that you be given 1.5 hours in compensatory time for each extra hour worked in a week unless you are exempt from the federal overtime laws.Before you can choose between overtime pay and comp time, you should understand how the comp time is calculated. Look at your employee manuals, which should explain the formula. If nothing is listed in the manual or in your employment contract, then contact Human Resources.
If you are unionized, then read your collective bargaining agreement. This agreement should spell out how compensatory time is calculated.

, Your employer might try to put limits on when you can take your extra time off. You should know this before choosing between comp time and overtime pay. You don’t want to choose comp time based on a false belief that you can take the time whenever you want.


You can ask your supervisor about the policy on taking comp time. However, you should also check with coworkers, who are more likely to be honest with you. If you are new to a workplace, then ask other people in comparable positions if they have had a problem taking time off.
If you have been with the organization for some time, then think about how difficult it has been to get vacation days off. An employer who tries to limit your use of vacation or personal days is unlikely to let you take comp time.
Your employer may also decide to send you home when work is slow. To get paid, you would then use your comp time.This might not be an ideal situation for you because you do not control when you take your comp time. You should ask your employer whether this is a possibility.

, You should understand the policies for “cashing out” accrued comp time. For example, you might want to accrue comp time during the year and then decide at year’s end whether to cash out the comp time.


If your employer is flexible about cashing out comp time, then it is a more attractive option than overtime, since you can’t convert overtime pay into extra time off from work.

, You might be limited in the maximum number of comp time hours you can accrue. You should know this fact as well. For example, federal law generally limits the maximum number of comp hours to 240.State law and workplace policies might also limit the total amount of comp hours you can carry at any one time.


If you work in a seasonal, emergency response, or public safety activity, then you can accrue up to 480 hours under the federal law., If you are given the choice between comp time and overtime pay, you should consider which you need more: extra money or extra time off. This may or may not be an easy choice.


Think about any major expenses you have on the horizon: home repairs, health care costs, trips for vacation, etc. Check if you have the money to cover the costs. If not, you might want to take overtime over comp time.
Also consider demands on your time. You might need time off to take care of a sick relative, take an extended vacation, recover from surgery, or finish education requirements. If you can’t easily fit these demands into your schedule, then you might decide that comp time is more important than overtime pay.
Be sure to discuss your decision with friends and family. You should get feedback from the people closest to you about whether or not you should take compensatory time or overtime. Your children, for example, can let you know about upcoming events that you might want to attend.

, You might not care whether or not you take overtime or comp time; nevertheless, your employer might have a strong preference for one over the other. Sometimes, employers are worried about paying too much in salary and would prefer that their employees take comp time.


You should consider how important it is to keep your employer happy. If you are new at a job or do not want to make waves for any reason, then you should try to take whichever your employer prefers. You can ask your boss if he or she has a preference for whether or not you accept overtime or comp time.

, Your income tax is based on the income that you earn in a year.This includes your overtime pay. Before accepting overtime pay, you need to calculate how the extra pay will impact your taxes.


You should meet with a tax professional to discuss the consequences of taking overtime pay. To find a qualified tax professional, see Hire an Accountant.

Own up to your mistakes.,
Lose the defensiveness.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Overcome Pride1," If you are a prideful person, you may have trouble admitting when you’re wrong. In a way, everyone has some difficulty taking ownership for mistakes. You might deny responsibility because the act of “being wrong” doesn’t align with your self-concept. But admitting you’re wrong is not a weakness—it’s simply a part of being human.Learn to admit the mistake, and apologize/rectify when you’re wrong. Simply say, “I apologize; that was my mistake.” Doing so will help you retain relationships and may even benefit your personal growth.;
, In a way, excessive pride places you on shaky ground because you’re always fearful of losing favor or status. Because of this instability, you might be quick to defend. Defensiveness makes you appear inflexible and insecure. It also shuts down the lines of communication.


Instead of jumping to defensiveness, pause. Don’t follow your instincts, which are to defend. Take a few deep breaths. Agree—to a degree—by saying “Yes, and…” This is preferable to “Yes, but,” which comes off as defensive. Then, try to work with the other person to brainstorm an effective solution that doesn’t jeopardize the relationship.Do you best to develop a curious attitude and to take in others’ points of view.
Work on accepting criticism as a learning experience. Taking things personally makes it difficult to reflect and improve.

, Mindfulness allows you to slow down and connect with the present moment. It brings awareness to your thoughts and can help you notice your prideful thoughts and reactions. Start a mindfulness practice to notice and eventually accept those parts of yourself.You can activate mindfulness during times when your pride is in control. For example, you feel threatened by a coworker who is doing outstanding work. You might slow down and tune into your thoughts and feelings. Remember that you don't have to see others' success as a threat. Think of ways you can learn from the person instead. It can help to celebrate the success of others.

Let go of any expectations for family support.,
Understand why your family doesn’t support you.,
Put your needs and convictions first.",How to Overcome Your Problems when Everybody Is Against You2," Most of us believe that our families should actively support us no matter what. When they fail to meet that expectation, we get frustrated and stressed. To see the situation for what it is, you have to stop obsessing about it and let the stress dissipate.Regardless of what your family thinks, you make your own choices in life for better or for worse. Remember this and make your own decisions.

, In a healthy family, this can be as simple as asking your family members why they do not support you in overcoming your particular problem. It could be that they are going through their own problems, or that they morally disagree with you. In a dysfunctional family, things can get more complicated. Dysfunctional families do not communicate as well and the lack of support could be a product of abusive treatment. If this is the case, confronting your family members will likely result in more conflict.You should not give up on finding a resolution to your problem just because your family is not supportive. This is all the more reason to stay true to yourself.

, If you have found yourself in conflict with your family, you may feel guilty. This guilt can lead you to allow others to impose their best interests on you, creating more problems than resolutions. You must stay strong and put yourself first to overcome your problems without your family’s support.If all of your family attends a particular church but you do not follow that religion, you have to put your convictions and needs first. Do not be pressured into pretending you believe what your family wants you to.
Another example of putting your needs first is when your family tells you that you have to come home for the holidays. While this is what most people do, if you feel that you should be somewhere else, it is not your family’s place to tell you that you have to do things their way.

"
"
Confront your friends.,
Control your emotions.,
Acknowledge your friends’ concerns.",How to Overcome Your Problems when Everybody Is Against You3," Remember that confrontation does not have to end in conflict. You should respectfully address your friends with your concerns about lack of support. You may find that their lack of support was unintentional, or that they have good reason (at least for themselves) for not supporting you., If a friend is not supporting you, it isn’t necessarily a personal attack or the end of your friendship. Listen calmly to your friend’s concerns. Maybe they feel that the problem you are facing is something they cannot help you with objectively (e.g. you are going through a divorce and turn to a friend that is loyal to both you and your spouse), or they have their own problems to overcome at the moment.Either way, take a deep breath before responding to your friend and be respectful.


If you are too upset to be respectful at the time, do not say anything until you calm down.

, If you have a goal or a problem that you are facing and your friend isn’t supportive, you should pay attention to any specific concerns. Remember that you are friends with this person for a reason, and it’s likely that they know you well and have your best interest in mind. Do not give up on your problems or goals because a friend doesn’t support you, instead, use their criticism to tweak your approach so that you better overcome your problems."

Evaluate the risk of damaging your career or reputation.,
Challenge the status quo in your company or field.,
Leave doors open to colleges who question your approach.",How to Overcome Your Problems when Everybody Is Against You4," Overcoming problems in your career can be tricky. You peers can be friends, advisors, and adversaries all at the same time. When you have problems in your career, you are likely to be told to suck it up and fall in line. Many peers may not be receptive to you “solving” your problems if it does not directly benefit them. You risk causing new problems, including being fired, if you rock the boat too much., Innovative solutions to your problems at work can send you to the forefront of your field. It is likely that if you are having a problem in your career, others in the same career are having the same problem. Innovation does not happen by “falling in line,” but do not expect support from most peers. Some like things the way they are, others will be envious of your innovation., Do not let a solution to one problem inflate your ego too much. Alienating those who did not support an idea may prove to cripple your career later. Take the criticism as constructive and leave doors open with peers that you may have to work with ― or for ― in the future.

"
"
Take more risks.,
Embrace constructive criticism.,
Stop comparing.,
Ask questions.",How to Overcome Pride2," Pride makes you self-conscious. As a result, you’re less likely to do anything that will upset your status. You may avoid doing anything that will cause people to judge you, which may involve not taking any risks or trying new things.Identify one thing you would like to learn or do, and make a plan to get started within the next week. Don’t overthink it, just do it.
As you engage in this challenging activity, focus on how you feel to be defying your self-consciousness. Refrain from giving any thought to others’ opinions or judgments. If you make a mistake, embrace it as a part of your development. It ir normal and natural to make mistakes.

, Prideful people rarely seek out feedback. Yet, getting another point-of-view at times is the only way to maintain an accurate perspective of yourself. Make a commitment to start seeking out, and using, constructive criticism.To start, ask a few friends or colleague to give an honest list of three traits they admire about you and then three traits where you might need to do some work. Don’t defend. Say, “Thank you,” and see how you can use their suggestions for your personal growth.

, When you compare, you are searching for some way that you are better than others. As a prideful person, you may tie your self-worth to what you have or what you’ve done. The healthiest form of self-worth, however, is connected to who you are. It’s not reliant on achievements or belongings.Acknowledge your current beliefs but learn to question them. This will help you grow.

, Pride and self-consciousness often delude you into thinking you know all there is to know. And, if you don’t, you wouldn’t dare tell anyone. Overcome pride by admitting that you don’t have all the answers. Be okay with saying “I don’t know.” And, have the courage to ask questions to expand your thinking.For instance, you're in class and the professor asks you a question. Your typical reaction when you don't know something might be to become defensive. Instead you might say, ""I'm not sure. Can you help me understand?""

"
"
Share your imperfections.,
Be open to different points-of-view.,
Praise others.,
Learn to ask for help.,
Serve others rather than being served.",How to Overcome Pride3," If pride rules you, you probably have difficulty admitting your shortcomings. Take an exercise in vulnerability and start disclosing your imperfections. You may find that others are more attracted to you. Plus, you are in a better position to offer feedback without coming off as haughty.


This doesn’t have to be some big revelation. You can start small. The next time you hear someone else being vulnerable—say someone says “Oh, how I have trouble resisting sweets!”—if you can relate to them, say so. Don’t hold yourself back from developing deeper connections in an effort to appear perfect.Vulnerability takes courage but will get easier the more you practice.

, Actively listen. You can learn something from everyone, even people who appear to be beneath you. If you adopt the belief that what you have to say is more valuable than what others have to say, you’ll push others away. This approach will also severely limit your growth options.Even if someone approaches you with a far-out idea, show them the respect of listening. Who knows, perhaps half-way through their spiel, you might start to see the genius of their plan.

, Whether in your professional or personal life, it pays to share the spotlight. Sometimes, prideful people are hesitant to let others shine. You may think that it will diminish your own achievements. It won’t. Give credit where it’s due. And, when you see something positive in someone else, tell them.For instance, if you notice that a friend appears to be really good at writing, say so. Say, “Wow, I always thought I was the writer of the bunch, but you got some skills, Terry. This is awesome!”
Lifting up others also helps you lift yourself as you develop more fully as a person.

, Humble people understand that everyone, at some point, needs a hand. Prideful people, however, may attempt to do it all themselves, pretending that they don’t need others. Asking for help isn’t a sign of weakness. In fact, if it reduces suffering and promotes collaboration, it’s a smart thing to do.Take baby steps by asking others to help you when you are in need. This could be as simple as asking someone ahead of you to hold the door or telling a friend you could use a listening ear. Notice how receptive people are to your requests—people like to help out!

, Being humble doesn’t translate to putting others before you at the cost of self. Rather it simply means not being so focused inwardly that you miss opportunities to serve. Turn your focus outward and identify how you can serve and connect with others, as equals.The next time you see someone struggling, offer them a hand. Ask your coworker, partner, or friend, “Is there anything I can do to make your day better?”
You can also serve by volunteering your time in the local community.

Combat that negativity with deliberate, positive self-talkand try reframing your situation to gain new perspective.


Reframing works like this: Instead of thinking ""I didn't get the part in the play because I'm a terrible actor. I should just give up,"" you take a more hopeful approach, like ""I guess I wasn't quite what the director had in mind. I'm going to ask him if he has any feedback about what I can work on.""
Even just replacing the thought ""I can't,"" with ""This may not work, but I'm going to try,"" can have a positive impact.When you notice yourself having negative thoughts, deliberately interrupt that thought and try reframing it with something more positive. This takes practice, but if you keep with it, looking on the bright side or for the positives can become a habit.For more help, check out the wikiHow article Get Rid of Negative Thoughts.;
, But all it really means is that you haven't found something that works yet; maybe your timing has been off, or you need to learn a few more skills, or you just haven't found the right approach. It is important to keep trying, even if it means you may face more disappointment. Success comes from perseverance.A counselor or therapist can help you learn new, productive ways of thinking.

, You may feel like you want to give up on everything; you may be overwhelmed and feel that you are out of options, because the things you have tried so far didn't work. Despite how you may feel, giving up on life will not solve your problems.If you are feeling hopeless or considering suicide, seek help immediately.


You can call a suicide-prevention hotline, like the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or TheHopeLine at 1-800-394-4673. Seek help from a trusted friend or family member, a teacher, or a counselor.

, Try first to identify what really matters to you. Is it academic success? Your career? Fame and fortune? Setting goals that really mean something to you, that work with your values, will help you to stay motivated in the long-run.


Try to figure out what matters most to you. This could involve your upbringing and what your parents stressed, whether money, appearance, success, or education. It might also be reflected in what you do, for example, and whether you work in finance or for a non-profit organization.
Ask yourself what you want in life. Is it to get a good job, to feel a sense of fulfillment, or maybe to help people?Map out your goals in a hierarchy from most important to less important. Then, write down what values in life you think lie behind these goals. Namely, what is your motivation to achieve them?

, Focus your energies on goals that you really want in life and that suit your basic values. If you have always wanted to be a doctor, for instance, and helping people is important to you, then going to med school might be a well-suited goal. You might feel unfulfilled, on the other hand, if you want to help people but have a life goal of working in advertising.


Reassess your list of goals and compare it to your motivations. Do your motives work against your goals or do they go together?
Say that you want to be a doctor but find that your motive is not helping people, but earning a lot of money. Are you OK with this? Or will you be unhappy with your job in the long run?

, Once you have carefully considered your values, think about setting long-term and short-term goals. Having both is important for motivation. Short-term goals are like milestones along the road to one or more long-term goals. Your goals for the near future will help you to see progress, keeping you on track to more distant end. For example, a short-term goal might be something like handing in your assignments in on time or passing your weekly quizzes. These help you along toward longer-term goals, like getting a good grade in your trigonometry class, passing AP Math, or getting into a good college.
Write these down, again. Think about what you want to achieve in the future (long-term) but also about how you will get there (short-term). Putting the specific goals on paper will help to crystallize them.
Keep the list handy so that you can review your progress from time to time and check items off. Occasional review will remind you of your goals and also allow you to track your progress.

, By setting unreasonable, unrealistic goals you may be setting yourself up for failure. Someone who always wants the perfect job, the perfect house, or the perfect life is a perfectionist. Striving to be the best is good, but extreme perfectionists tend to be unhappy and unproductive.Set high but achievable goals. Having a high goal will challenge and motivate you without setting you up for a fall. Gun for a high score on the SAT without insisting on perfection, for example, but still be happy if you didn’t ace it.
Set measurable goals, as well. “Being the best” is admirable but not very effective as a short- or long-term goal. Be more specific.Say, rather, “This year I want to lower my golf handicap and shoot an 80 on 18 holes.”
By meeting realistic goals, you will end up gaining more confidence and fearing failure less., You’ve already put together a long-term plan with short-term goals. This will help you stay on target, and keep you from giving up when the end seems too distant. To make things even more manageable, you can also break short-terms goals into smaller parts.Take academic goals. Say that you want to be a high-school teacher. In the long-term you’ll have to go to college for a bachelor’s degree in education and maybe take a teaching certification course. In the short-term, though, you can focus on getting good grades and for a mid-term goal being accepted into a teaching program.
Athletic goals are similar. In order to be a top swimmer, break things into smaller parts. First, train hard and improve your times and work on your free-style, butterfly, and different strokes. Try to qualify for local or regional swim competitions. Later, as you improve, aspire to state or even national meets.
Draw up plans for each substep, plans for each smaller part toward your big plan. Try to keep the big picture in mind and how each part fits into the whole.

, Step back from time to time to review your goals and your progress toward them. Doing so will help you to maintain focus. You may also find that you need to revise or even to rethink your long-term goals.


Things won’t always work out as you intend. Stay flexible. For example, just because you weren’t able to advance past the state meet as a swimmer does not mean you have failed. Perhaps it opens new doors as a swim instructor, or perhaps that chapter of your life will close. Or, maybe you can change up your training and your diet and try again. People peak at different times in their lives, so maybe the next time around will be your time.
Staying open to new experiences and skills will help you stay flexible. Say that you have to take anatomy to get in to your pre-med program. You’ve never taken anatomy before! Rather than be discouraged and give up, embrace the opportunity to take on a challenge and to learn something new.
You might need to make small changes to the long-term plan. While working toward your bachelor’s, for example, you might realize that your passion is in pedagogical research rather than teaching. You could aim for graduate school instead of becoming a high school teacher.

, Breaking down tasks and assessing your progress – these are important. But equally important is to recognize and celebrate your successes. Let yourself relish the triumphs, even if they are little. Celebrations will keep you motivated and give you something to anticipate.Treat yourself when you’ve reached a milestone. For example, celebrate with a day off, an outing to the movies, or by popping open some champagne with your loved ones.
Even small gestures of celebration work, boosting your sense of accomplishment, your self-esteem, and your focus.

, There will be hiccups on the road to your goals, for sure, and you should plan for setbacks. Use failures to your advantage rather than becoming discouraged, though. Learn from mistakes, adjust, and move forward.Setbacks happen to everyone and are very common every day, even the most successful people.
Evaluate what happened. Say that you flunked a class in your degree program. Was it because of bad planning, bad preparation, bad execution, or something beyond your control? Figure out what went wrong and why and then try to make the necessary adjustments.
Apply what you have learned in the future. Say that you failed “Pedagogy 101” in your teaching program because the material was very hard – and very boring. Knowing this, you might reconsider your previous plans to go to graduate school.

, Hard work is easier when you have people cheering you on. Whether family, friends, or close mentors, cultivate relationships with people whom you trust, who have your best interest in mind, and who will have your back through ups and downsA few very close friends can be better than a stable of casual acquaintances.
Spend time with friends and family, call them, talk to them, and keep them in your life. Just knowing that they are there for you will be a help.
Be willing to reach out. Whether through talking or asking for advice, seek out support from your loved ones when you need it.
You can also seek peer support groups to find people with common experiences and shared histories. They've ""been there"" before., There is a big difference between caring and worrying. Caring is being invested in something, like a goal. Worrying, on the other hand, is “an attempt to control the future by thinking about it.” One is motivating. The other is impossible.Focus on what you can control. We are often faced with surprises or unforeseen events, so remind yourself that you are only human and cannot control everything.
Encourage yourself from time to time. Anxiety is like any other feeling. You might try telling yourself this, i.e. “I feel worried, but I do things to deal with it.”Keep things in perspective. Avoid “catastrophic thinking” by reminding yourself of the scale of your worry. For instance, failing a class is bad but not the end of your education. Finishing last at a swim meet is disappointing but not the end of the world. You still have your health, your life, and people who love you.

, Know when to let up when following your goals and dreams, otherwise you may face burnout – physical and mental exhaustion, discouragement, and cynicism.If you are under stress, find ways to rest, relax and recharge.


You know your mind and body best and when you might be slowing down. Make sure that your mind and body are well-rested. Otherwise, your efforts will be less effective.
It is OK to take some time off, whether that means you’re on vacation, at yoga, out of the pool, or mentally checked out for the weekend.

, Exercise and a healthy diet will keep you in good shape but also support your mental well-being. Make sure that you living a good lifestyle, because by keeping yourself healthy you’ll be less stressed and better primed to achieve and focus.Physical exercise releases endorphins, boosts blood flow to your brain, increases your energy, and just generally improves mood. Try to get about thirty minutes of moderate exercise five times per week.Make sure to eat right, too. Eat regularly throughout the day to maintain your blood sugar levels and energy, including at breakfast, and include a wide variety of vegetables, fruit, and whole grains in your meals., Almost everyone feels down or helpless at some point in life. You aren’t alone and should know that there are resources and people available to help. If you feel discouraged for a long period of time, or find that low energy and depression are interfering with your life, talk to a mental health professional.Depression can be mild or severe and can depend on your environment, events around you, or even on your physical makeup. Its symptoms include sadness, anxiety, feelings of emptiness or hopelessness, fatigue, and loss of interest in normal activities. It can even take the form of physical aches and pains.
Consider talking to a counselor, a therapist, or a psychiatrist. They can help you to manage your depression with a proper treatment plan.

Don’t be too inaccessible.",How to Make Girls Like You," It is better for a girl to like you for the real you. If you pretend to be something your not, the relationship will be short-lived. You can't keep up a false persona forever.


Forget about all the advice in men’s magazines and in the movies you have seen. Act in a way that is the most comfortable for you.
Try not to over think your response when engaging in conversation. Of course, it’s important to take your audience into account when formulating a response. You wouldn’t want to something that may come across as rude or offensive. For example, some of the jokes that you may share with your male friends may not be appropriate to share.;
, It is often obvious when someone is lying, making up stories or exaggerating. Dishonesty will lose her trust. Be honest about your feelings as well. Don't tell her you want to meet her parents or travel together if you don't actually want to take the relationship to the next level.


Research suggests that honesty builds trust which leads to better relationships. , Chivalry is not dead and respect never goes out of style. Girls want to feel special. There are many simple ways to show you genuinely care about her.


Hold the door for her, offer to carry a heavy bag, or help in a small, unexpected way.
Fix something that she hasn’t gotten around to repairing, or doesn’t know how to fix.

, Ask her questions about her life and things that matter to her. Avoid talking about yourself too much and let her tell you about herself. You want to her to see that you are interested in her as a person.

, Make eye contact when she speaks to show her you are listening. Ask questions about what she said or respond in ways that show you are actively engaged in the conversation.


Pay attention to her physical and verbal cues as well as your own. Texting, reading newspapers, watching television or looking around is rude and makes it look like you are not interested in her or what she is saying. If you notice her doing these things, you're losing her interest.

, Don’t try to initiate physical contact if it is clear she isn’t ready. Slow and steady wins the race. Find subtle ways to show you are attracted to her first. Compliment her appearance and her personality.

, No one wants to hang around a negative person. Being pleasant, positive and friendly makes you more appealing.Every person looks better when they smile. The stronger your smile the more good looking you seem. It can even make up for being relatively unattractive.

, Using good body language makes you look more confident to others. Stand-up straight with your shoulders back and head held up. Make eye contact to express your admiration. Too little eye contact can make you appear nervous or insecure. , Being well-groomed and wearing the right clothes are more important to being perceived as attractive than physical non-changable aspects. Put in the effort to shower, brush your teeth, and shave. Style and trim your hair. Wear clothes that compliment you. Girls will definitely take notice of your fashion sense and style.

, Don't say cheesy things or pick-up lines that you saw on a tv show or on the internet. Avoid such cliches if you want to get her attention. Dig deeper for your compliments.Telling her she has a great laugh or a great sense of humor shows your attraction is more than just physical.

, Show her you aren't overly possessive by encouraging her to spend time with friends. It is a good for both of you to have a life outside your relationship. Don’t get jealous that she has male friends. Jealousy is a big turn-off.

, Don’t be pushy. Each of you should feel free to make your own decisions that will be respected by the other.


If she says no to your advances, accept it graciously. Do not get angry if she rejects you. If you are respectful of her decision she may change her mind in the future. If you act aggressively or talk badly about her, it will only come back to bite you. Other girls may hear about your distasteful behavior and it will ruin your chances with them.

, A bit of cat and mouse can be fun but may get boring quickly. You can play bored or be distant to let a girl know you aren't going to desperately chase her, but you don't want to come off as uninterested."

Let go of the past.,
Do something you love!,
Alright, now lets say the person asked someone else for a drink now, after you said no.,
How old are you?",How to Not Regret or Worry," You don't want to dwell on the past. Like the example above, later that night, you start worrying and regretting. Let it go. Sometimes it's not that easy and you just can't stand it. Well here is what you have to do:


Don't let others make you regret it more. It didn't happen for a reason. If it were meant to happen, then it would have happened. Correct?

Do not focus on it too much. You are just over thinking it now. You don't want to focus on the past. Or the future. Live in the moment.

;
, For example, draw, paint, play video games, go outside, hang out with friends, hang out with family, go for a walk, plan a short vacation. Whatever floats your boat. My opinion on which example works best would be hanging out with friends. Don't be an anti-social. Go out there...have fun!

, (Referencing to my example above) Lets say the person they asked said yes. So they are having a drink, and not you are a bit jealous. And you think about how that could have been you and there is a huge feeling of regret inside of you and that was your only chance. ""Hello, wake up"" It's over...it's done and it already happened. If it were meant to be you, it would have been you. Maybe if it was you, something bad would have happened. Or maybe everything would have been normal or fine. But don't dwell on it. Think about this:


They asked you before they asked the other person.

You said no...whether it was what you wanted to say or not. And that is okay. Do you know them? Is the person really your friend? Then ask them to hang out, ask them to a movie, as friends or not. Whatever you choose.

Like the bullet point above, if you know them and you know you are friends. Then everything is fine. You can still talk to them or hang out with them. However, if you didn't know who they were and you really wish you did. Then get to know them! If you can't even do that...then it's just the sad truth that it just wasn't supposed to happen. You will just have to move on.





, This is also a big part of this.


Let's say it was a birthday party and you are around the age 10. This boy/girl asked you to have a drink (a soda, of course...at least i really hope so) and you never really talked to him at school and not you are flipping out. Here is your answer: You are far to young to be worrying about that. You have so much more things ahead of you.
Then say you are in your mid teens (15, 16, 17?). This could be different. Let's say this was at a school dance. And someone asked you if you wanted some punch and you said no. He asks someone else and you look at them and can't stand it. Later that night you are regretting and worrying. This is very understandable, you have your teenage hormones, your jealousy, your blues. But you just have to let it all go. It was in the past. Now you are in the present. Go do something you love!
Alright, how about 20+? You are at the bar and someone asks if you would like a drink with them. You say no, they ask your friend, she says yes. First, you are probably upset with your friend. Second, you missed your chance. Let it go. Go ask someone else for a drink, your friend already left you, get out there have fun (be responsible, but i think you know that).

Adjust your life plan.",How to Make a Life Plan," Each day we play different roles, or give ourselves different labels through our actions. These roles can include things like ‘daughter’, ‘painter’, ‘student’, ‘girlfriend’, ‘lover of cheese’, etc. Create a list on a piece of paper. Which do you think are the most consistent roles?Examples of other roles include (but are certainly not limited to): chef, dog lover, brother, photographer, boss, mentor, traveler, grandchild, thinker, etc.;
, Some, if not all, of your roles from the present might be the same roles you want to play in your future, such as ‘mother’ or ‘painter’. However, these roles are the nouns that you would want someone to use to describe you at the end of your life. Think about any of the roles you are playing the present that are stressing you out or causing a negative impact on your life--perhaps those are roles you would like to cross from your list in the future.


To help you form your list, think about things that you hope to do. Do you want to travel to another country because you’ve never left your home state? If so, ‘traveler’ would be added to the future list.

, To create a life plan, you need to decide what your priorities are at this moment in time. To do this, consider the roles that you want to continue playing, or those you want to add to your life in the future. What is the reason you want to play a certain role? Maybe you have ‘father’ written on your future goals because you want to have children with your partner and give them an amazing life.


A helpful way to figure out the reasons behind your desires is to imagine your own funeral (while this is a morbid thing to do, it really does help!) Who would be in attendance? What you want people to say about you or describe you as? Perhaps the most important things you would want someone to say is that you were an amazing mother and changed the lives of thousands of animals through the organization you volunteered with.

, Once you have really considered the why behind the things you want to be and do in your life, make a list of them. Making a list will help you to stay organized when coming up with your plan.


For example, you list might include: am ‘sister’ because I always want to be there to support my brother; want to be ‘writer’ so I can write down my grandparents’ story, etc.

, What will you need to be the person you want to be? If one of the roles you want to play is ‘climber of Everest’, you’re physical needs might include staying fit and eating well. If one your roles is ‘friend’, your emotional needs might be met by surrounding yourself with loving people., Use your roles, priorities, and needs to help you solidify some things you want to achieve. Think of this list as your ‘bucket list’--what do you want to do before you die? Remember, these are the goals you really want to achieve, not the goals you think others want you to have. If you need some extra help narrowing down your ideas, consider putting your goals into categories. Some example categories include:Career/Vocation; Social (family and friends); Finances; Health; Travel; Knowledge/Intellect; and Spirituality.
Example goals (according to the order of categories): Become a renowned architect; get married and have two kids; make enough money to comfortably send my children to college; maintain a weight of 120 pounds; visit every continent; earn my Master’s Degree in Architecture; visit Borobudur Buddhist temple.

, Once you have outlined the vague goals that you want to have in your life, such as earn your Masters, set out some defined goals and the dates that you want to reach them by. Here are some defined goals that are less vague than the ones written in the previous step:Lose 10 pounds by June of 2014.
Be accepted to Master’s degrees programs in architecture by April 2015.
Travel to Indonesia to visit the Borobudur temple in 2016.

, This means assessing where you are right now. What steps are you going to need to do actually reach your goal from where you stand in the present moment. For instance, to continue with the goal of getting a Master’s in Architecture:


From now until April 2015, you will need to: A. Research graduate architecture programs. B. Write any necessary documents for the program’s application. C. Fill out the rest of the application and submit it to the proper authorities. D. Wait to hear back from the schools. E. Pick the program that you want to attend from the programs that accepted you. F. Enroll!

, You can do this in any format you like--handwrite it, type it in a Word document, paint it on a large sheet, etc. Whatever format you choose to use, write the steps you will need to take to achieve each of your goals in chronological order. Congratulations--you have just written out your life plan.This is a good time to review the details of each step--like the names of the specific graduate programs you are going to apply to. Or, if one of your goals is simply to be happy, write out the details of what will make you most happy along the way.

, One fact of life is that it always changes--and so do we. The goals and priorities that you had when you were 15 are probably not the same as the goals you will have when you are 25 or 45. It is important to review your life plan every so often to make sure that you are following a plan that will truly give you a happy and satisfactory life.


When you review your life plan, also assess the successes that you have achieve so far. It is good to keep track of your accomplishments.

, When you do find that your priorities and the goals associated with those priorities have changed, its time to rewrite at least part of your life plan. Consider what is different, what is more important to you now, and how you will achieve this new goal. Rewrite your life plan as much as you need to.


Don’t limit yourself to a certain number of goals--your life plan is a fluid thing. Add goals as they become priorities in your life and remove those that aren’t as important anymore.

Monitor your activities.,
Determine your productivity times.,
Prioritize your tasks.,
Knock out quick tasks right away.,
Manage clutter and work materials.,
Schedule activities and appointments.",How to Be Organized at Work1," Spend a couple days keeping a journal or log of your daily activities. This will help you see exactly what you do that you might not even realize, and it will provide an initial glimpse into organizational and productivity gaps. This exercise should also be done with your big-picture goals in mind. Through the activity log, you can see what activities might be time-wasters and which activities might actually further your goals., Some of us are morning people, and some of us cringe at the idea of mornings. You might already have a sense of what times of day you’re most productive. Whether you prefer evenings, mornings, lunchtime, or right before or after workday rush hours, take advantage of those times to maximize your productivity.

, We all know that some tasks are more important than others, but we don’t always prioritize them accordingly. So develop a ranking system by flagging or starring important tasks, for example, and be honest and flexible.Use reminders, either through a digital calendar or through sticky notes on your computer or desk. Devote more of your time and energy to top-priority items on your list. Examples include time-sensitive tasks such as things due by end of business or tomorrow. You might also prioritize responding to clients, bosses, or anyone else who pays the bills. And if you’re not sure about the sensitivity or importance of a task, it’s always good to ask.

, Not all tasks need to be prioritized and scheduled for a future completion time. Some tasks take nearly as much time to plan for or schedule as they take to accomplish. If that’s the case and you can bang out those tasks right away, by all means do it! Handling quick tasks immediately also helps prevent procrastination.

, Our desks easily go from cluttered to tornado sites, obviously hampering organization. Some people even operate on a clean-desk-only policy. While that’s not absolutely necessary, take steps to clear your workspace.



Declutter. Toss your junk in the garbage and file your needed materials systematically. Clear clutter whenever possible: during lulls in the workday, breaks, or in between tasks.
Clean up after yourself immediately. That way it’s on the top of your mind. Plus, you avoid the inevitable agitation of having current clutter become part of your future clutter.
Keep necessary supplies handy. Not everything around you is clutter, of course. Having needed tools available saves you time and makes good use of your precious space.

, Some people schedule only meetings, but not activities on their to-do list. Scheduling the most important tasks as well as appointments can be helpful. You might also “batch” your days by having meetings only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example. Keep some holes in your schedule as well for creative time to yourself or to accommodate the unexpected.Use an organizer and calendar. These can be pen-and-paper organizers, or they could be software-based calendars and personal assistant apps, such as iCalendar or Google Now.
Categorize your activities. Categorizing or color-coding activities can give you a quick visual reminder of what’s important where. For example, categories might include correspondence, projects, events, meetings, brainstorms, and even breaks or exercise and gym time.
Streamline your technology. Online organizers and email platforms such as Outlook, for example, can combine your to-do lists, calendars, and addresses. This not only boosts your efficiency but helps streamline your thinking.Delegate wherever possible. In the madness of the workday, it’s easy to forget that you don’t have to do everything yourself. Delegate to an assistant or, if you’re particularly swamped, ask a colleague to do you a solid and help you with a particular task. You can always repay them later when things slow down. "

Re-evaluate your goals.",How to Manifest Your Desires," All of your current desires ultimately stem from who you are as a person, and where you've already been. Before you get on to imagining goals for the future, it's important to have a strong idea of where you already are in life. Set some time aside to ponder who you are, and what you've already done at this point.Would you say you're satisfied with the way your life has turned out? What aspects are you most or least satisfied with? Is there a significant gap between your potential and the life you're currently living? Asking yourself these questions will give you a clearer shot at pinpointing your goals.
It's helpful to actually write a few paragraphs about yourself. Frame this as a sort of freewriting exercise. Don't try to edit or micromanage your writing. Give an earnest portrayal of where you're at, including the status of your work, school, hobbies and personal life. Don't be afraid to be extremely personal with it-- no one ever needs to read it but you.;
, Think about the life you have, and use that as a springboard to imagine your ideal life. What would be different? Break down your dream life into aspects-- work, love, social etc. Write a sentence at least for each applicable aspect of your life. Mapping it out as a thought web is helpful as well.


The difference between your real life and your ideal life should be the basis for the goals you have for yourself.
For example, for describing one aspect of your life, you might write: ""I would like to see myself making music on a regular basis and playing concerts for a group of adoring fans.""
A more practical example might be: ""I would like to see myself gain a position at my company where I'm doing work that satisfies and properly challenges me.""

, When you write something down, you make it clear and more defined.If you're already looking to manifest your desires, it's likely you already have some goals in mind. If not, look to the distinction between your real and ideal life as a foundation for your goal making. Putting your goals on paper will make them tangible and concrete. You can write as many goals as you desire, so long as you keep your own human limitations in mind and don't bite off more than you can chew.


While you're pursuing these goals in the future, it's a helpful trick to post your goal list somewhere you'll see it every day, such as your refrigerator or next to your bed.
Draw out a map if you're more of a visual type. The outline of goals need not look like anything in particular; what's important is that your goals are clearly stated and defined.

, Looking at the circumstances of your life is not usually enough. If you want to find a realistic way to manifest your desires, you need to look at what you have got to offer yourself. Just about everyone has got something they're particularly good at. Write down a list of five things you at least consider yourself 'better than average' at. Cross-reference your existing skills with the goals you have. Will any of them directly help you fulfill your goals? If not, you'll have to work on learning skills that will.


Fortunately, skills and passions tend to line up more often than not. If you want to be a great painter, for instance, you will gladly take the time to hone your skills.
It is helpful to write the applicable skills next to the goals you have listed. Some of these will be obvious, but it's a good idea to think of indirectly beneficial skills as well. For instance, a musician requires good musicianship to succeed, but he'll also most likely require teamwork and a keen business sense to get ahead in today's industry.

, Goals left by themselves are intangible. In order to make your dreams a reality, you will need a clear, and above all, realistic gameplan to reach them by. Everyone is used to having wild dreams, but a real achiever will keep the practical means in mind while thinking about his desires. At the visualization stage, it is enough to write a couple of sentences on how you're going to reach each of your goals.For example, if for one of your goals you have written ""I would like to act in movies"", something you might write as a method would be: ""I am going to start sending my resume and talent info to agents, take bit parts and get my name out there.""
If you're having trouble finding a specific method to reach a given goal, it's possible your goal isn't specific enough. For instance, writing a goal as vague as ""Be successful!"" is going to leave you in the dust when it comes to thinking up tangible methods. Rather, try to focus it in so that you might better grasp a means of reaching it. Possible changes could be ""Be more successful with musical performance"" or ""Be more successful in my personal relationships.""

, Above all, be realistic about what you're trying to do. Simply willing something to happen isn't going to make your dreams come true. The most successful people are always ambitious, but never set their sights too high to be possibly achieved. Thinking up big goals without making them tangible will make you feel good at first, but you'll quickly lose focus once it becomes clear there is no proper way to reach them.This can be a bit of a tightrope act. Though you want to be realistic with the goals you're setting yourself, you don't want to be so unambitious that the goals fall short of what you actually desire. Goals that don't push you out of your comfort zone are not going to give you a sense of satisfaction when you reach them. Set your sights just out of reach; that way, you'll have to push the envelope to reach them.

, If you really want to manifest your desires, you need to be the best version of yourself first.One thing that most people tend to fall short of is sleep. Sleep as part of a healthy life cannot be underestimated. While sleep is often the first thing that's cut into when big things are happening in our lives, you need to commit to a regular schedule that's going to keep you energized throughout the day.


Somewhere between the 6-8 hour limit is optimal. Anything less starves your body of energy. Anything more eats up after-hours time you should be spending pursuing your dreams.

, If you are getting enough sleep but still somehow feel tired, it's near-certain that diet factors into the equation somehow.Take a good look at the stuff you're eating. Are you giving your body due respect? Depending on your current diet, there may be some obvious things you should be doing without. Sticking to a whole foods-based diet is your best bet, but you should take some time to work out a diet plan that suits you. Strike a balance that sufficiently compromises between your desired food and responsible, healthy eating.Read up on nutritional sciences. Do your research. Don't take fad diets for granted. It's much better to do your own legwork and find out for yourself what works best for you. T. Colin Campbell's The China Study is a good place to start if you're interested in learning about the correlation between health and common food products.
Upping your water consumption is an easy and effective way of boosting energy throughout the day. Buying a refillable water bottle and carrying it around with you will make an instantly recognizable difference in the way you feel.
Cut down on so-called ""empty calories"" such as fast food and soda pop. Go without them completely if you can. These may make you feel good when you're having them, but the immediate impact they have on your mood and energy level take a major toll.

, Even by going running for half an hour in the morning, your body will reward you with clearer thinking and greater energy throughout the day. A lot of the time people feel their 'ideal life' is beyond their reach, physical health and appearance plays a part in it. Giving your body the time and care it deserves will make you look closer to the person you want to be.


To start, light to moderate cardio like running will give you a taste of the benefits exercise can offer you. If you want to up the ante a bit, give regular swimming a try.
A gym membership can be rather costly, but the monthly fee may be enough to keep you coming back and exercising more.
Strength training should not be underrated either. Particularly in the case of men, performing exercises that encourage muscle growth (like weight lifting) will promote testosterone in your system, thus improving your mood and mental clarity.

, The most direct way to circumvent this is by developing a strong sense of self-confidence. With self-confidence, you'll be able to depend on yourself when the going gets tough. Of course, self-confidence is something that takes a lot more than words to truly feel. Though easier said than done, there are lots of exercises you can do to boost your sense of self-worth.


Make a list of ten things you like about yourself. It can be anything-- your hair, your mathematical ability, your taste in music. The ten things can be significant or trivial. It doesn't matter, so long as you truly believe them. Once the list is in place, you should think about each of those things, and acknowledge that there is legitimate worth in having each one of those qualities.
Smiling in the mirror is a proven method of improving mood of feelings of self-worth. Smiling for 60 seconds in the mirror each morning and stretching out your arms will trigger a positive neurological reaction in your head, flooding your brain with feelings of warmth and acceptance. It's not a 'be all end all' approach to self-confidence, but it should get you started.Quash negative thought projections when you notice them brewing. Negative thoughts often become cycles, and part of self-confidence means negating the thoughts that will make you feel otherwise. Even if you think the feelings themselves are rational, acknowledge that there is no point in thinking them in the first place. It's a difficult mental skill to master, but one that will mean a huge difference in your overall self-confidence when done correctly., Unfortunately, you probably won't have enough time in your life to experience everything you want. With that in mind, the most important step towards manifesting your desires is to prioritize the ones you'd like to see manifested the most. Of the things you invest time in most in your life, do any of them currently line up with your biggest dreams? If not, rearrange the time you spend in such a way that it does line up.Certain obligations, like work or school, may get in the way of you investing your full time in things you're interested in. You can still find ways of maximizing these experiences as well, however. If you're unhappy with your current job, you should try to look for something that's at least related to something you're passionate about.

, If your desires are big enough to affect your life in a significant way, there's no way you'll be able to tackle them without breaking them down into easy parts. Much as a novel is divided into chapters, you want to take your goals and approach them one step at a time. For some, this might involve taking things back to the drawing board and slowly working yourself up to the point where the end goal is finally within your reach.Breaking a big goal into smaller pieces will also mean you get to experience the satisfaction of accomplishment earlier on. This will keep you feeling motivated to push forward.
For instance, if one of your goals is ""Become a great musician"", breaking that goal into chunks might entail scheduled practice times, as well as small milestones to guide you along. Practicing an hour a day may be good if it's important enough to you. Smaller goals may include learning a song, writing a song, playing for a small group of friends, and recording a piece of music on the computer.

, Procrastination is a looming curse in the age of distractions. You can probably think of many ways you are distracted throughout the day. Idle chat, social media and excess TV all sap away time that would much rather be put towards working on your goals. At the end of the day, you won't remember any of the idle things you did, but you will remember the time you spent working hard., Set a firm amount of time you'll invest each day in your dreams. Even if it's just an hour or two at the start, the time will add up if you stick to it every day. Something like an hour won't feel like anything on its own, but by the end of a month, thirty hours will have gone by. That is enough time to get you closer towards just about any goal.


Be firm with your persistence, and be hard on yourself if you need to be. Your dreams are worth pursuing, and a day spent idly is another day stuck between you and reaching them.
Keep track of what you've accomplished so far. A long-term effort requires regular affirmation. By keeping track of what you've accomplished so far, you'll have a consistent sense of achievement. This satisfaction will keep you pressing onward.

, Progress will come slowly but it will come. Given the right sort of determination and consistent effort, your goals may eventually come into clear view. Even before you achieve your goals however, you may find that your goals are in need of re-evaluation. By this point, you'll have put far more time and thought into manifesting your desires than you did in the planning stages. With that in mind, you may have a clearer idea of what you actually want now than you did.


Your original goals may have been too safe, too ambitious, or something besides what you really want. Make a point of rechecking your goals. Changing up the end goal once in a while will give a renewed focus to your efforts, and you may find yourself on an even better path than before.

Work out the problem.,
See the issue in a non-emotional manner.,
Collect your thoughts.,
Confront the person.,
Apologize.,
Enjoy your life and know that you did try to do the right thing, you tried to take responsibility for your actions and you dealt with the matter as a considerate and genuine person.,
Learn from how the other person reacts.",How to Live a Life Free from Constraints," What is the problem or issue and why is it bothering you? Try to figure out the core problem of the situation. What is bothering you? Sometimes it is not quite easy to figure this out. It may take hours, days, weeks, or even months in some cases depending on the issue and the relationship with the person you have. But that is why it is important to retrace your steps. What was the initial point that hurt or irritated you? What offended you? It is important to know the exact problem and matter that ignites the emotions of distress, anger, or sadness or combination of all three emotions. The disagreement that you had with someone and why you had it is important for your own knowledge and understanding as well.;
, See the matter from the other person's perspective. Try to see their point of view, be open-minded about their opinions or criticism. Were you really right or wrong? It’s easy for a person’s ego to feel wounded after being told they are wrong about something. It is also easy for a person to be only concerned as to what the other person did or said to them. You have to clarify what you said and did to the person as well. You have to slice through the issue in a logical and strategic manner to fully see why you are still thinking of the issue. If you still feel the same as you did before, you know for a fact that you must resolve the matter, especially if you don’t know why you have an issue with the person, or why the person has an issue with you.

, All the things you want to say good and bad, anything you felt or did not feel, immediately write it down. Vent if you have to. Let it all out, the emotions, the anxiety, and the frustration. Let yourself feel. Don’t restraint yourself or numb yourself. Feel the hate for the person if you have to. Collect all the memories you had with the person, both good and bad. Think of the good things they did for you too, as you don’t want to make it worse when you confront them. You want to confront the person in a civil manner. You want to be able to talk it out without resorting to yelling, fighting, or cursing. But this exercise is to help you release the constraint of the person’s impact on you. Don’t let that person’s opinion control your thoughts or influence your daily routine. Instead just use a moment or a day in collecting your thoughts. Finally, create a sound and simple decision in confronting the person.

, Don’t wait and don’t beat around the bush. Simply discuss the exact matter or situation. Think of yourself as a judge and how a judge has to be unbiased and get through many legal and illegal matters as a job. A judge will try to contemplate who is right or wrong and what the proper form of justice for each individual is. Be straightforward. “You said this or did this. I feel this or think this.” Be honest with yourself and tell the person to be honest with you. Be civil and don’t let your emotions get in the way of the confrontation. As soon as you confront the person you will feel an instant relief in your chest, in your mind, and in your soul. You can finally breathe and stop holding your breath. After the confrontation the only outcomes left are either:


a.) The person will discuss the matter and therefore resolve the issue.  For example: They will talk it out and willing to reconcile. No hard feelings, you will say sorry to each other and all is well in the world again.
b.) The person will discuss the matter and not resolve the issue. For example: They will talk it out with you. But they won’t want to associate with you anymore. They would want to remain distanced and have no interest in keeping in touch and don’t say sorry to you.
c.) The person will refuse to discuss the matter but is willing to resolve the issue. For example: They will not want to talk about it or discuss any of the issues you both had. But they are willing to let it go and move on from it. They will accept the issue as it was not trying to change anything about it.
d.) The person will refuse to discuss the matter and also refuse to resolve the issue. For example: They will not want to talk it out with you, or discuss it, and they don’t want to associate with you or resolve the matter. Basically you are back at where you left off. It is like visiting the past again. No means no and they are strict or holding a grudge about the matter. They want nothing to do with you.
e.) The person still stands by on their beliefs but is willing to resolve the issue by respecting your opinions and differences. For example: They will have more information and opinions on the issue and add more thoughts on the matter, and more thoroughly elaborate their beliefs. They will also give you the chance to state your opinions and beliefs of the matter. They will understand the different point of view and appreciate your perspective. They are willing to move past the issue and want to move on from the matter. There won’t be an apology but they will want to associate with you.
f.) The person will add on to the issue and not resolve, creating more issues than what you started with. For example: They will create a new issue and they will try to argue or fight. They will complain and be stubborn or hold a grudge on you. The person may apologize or may not. At that point, you should proceed to step 5.

, Apologize anyway no matter what the circumstance may be. Make amends on your part. Don’t think about your ego or pride. Don’t feel that you are being weak. In cases that you may not even remember the issue or conflict or to feel frustrated over something from the past is silly to you, you just want to move on and have a clean slate with the other person. Apologize to the person even if you weren’t wrong. As the infamous song from the movie Frozen goes: “Let it go! Let it go!”                  


Do what you have to do on your part in reconciling the issue with the person. If, even after you apologize, the person refuses to budge or to compromise or to resolve the matter, you did all you could. Don’t waste more time or effort and don’t lose your own dignity or self respect.

, That person is probably not worth being in your life if they cannot let the past be the past and move on. People like that are not healthy to have around and will only pull you down with them. 


You cannot please everyone and if you had to think about every single instance that might make the other person uncomfortable then you may never be able to move on from the matter.
Realize that the concern is usually about the jeopardizing of a relationship, it could be a job, a friend, again a family member. But to be honest with oneself is much more important than to have a fake bond with a friend or family member. To stay quiet only will create bitterness or resentment towards the person you had conflict with. The aftermath of what happens with you and that person is the real result of where that person lies in your life. If that person really cares about you, they will be willing to resolve the matter.

, Their reaction will tell you whether the person is worth the trouble of keeping in your circle of friends, or whether to keep trying to get closer to a sibling, or a parent, or trying to prove to a coworker or boss that you’re ambitious. You can put a stop to the efforts and thoughts you put into the relationship once you confront the person. You will be able to decide if you want that person in your life or not. The most important fact is that you can put a stop on the constraints in your life.

Take a deep breath and let your muscles relax.,
Make yourself smile for 10 seconds -- it actually triggers ""happy"" neurochemicals in your brain.,
Let yourself laugh more.,
Stand up straight, keep your chin up, and pull your shoulders back to open your body invitingly.,
Take pride in your appearances.",How to Look Happy1," Remind yourself to let the tension out of your muscles with a deep breath. Just relax, letting the small muscles in your face, neck and shoulders unclench. Are there any parts of your body you have curled or tensed nervously? Let them go. This physical tension is picked up by other people, even unconsciously, and tells them you are stressed or unhappy.


What are your eyebrows and forehead doing? Let them relax -- downturned eyebrows and furrowed brows tell people you are less trustworthy.If you're really stressed, work down your body slowly. Take a breath and relax your face. Then take another and relax your shoulders, then arms, then legs, all the way to your toes.;
, The very act of smiling actually makes you feel happier.So smiling not only makes you look happier, it makes it easier to keep looking happy. Make a habit of smiling more often, such as when greeting people or when you agree with a point someone makes. And, if you're really feeling down, smile at yourself in the mirror. The mental boost is real.


Aim for a big, open-lipped smile. Showing your teeth is a good thing!
In a full, genuine smile, you should feel creases in the skin by your eyes. Your whole face lights up with the smile.

, Go online and learn a couple of jokes. Repeat a semi-embarrassing story about yourself. Let yourself chuckle at an off-color story or a joke a friend is telling. Whatever your strategy, find more excuses to let out a good laugh as much as possible. You'll look happier automatically, and the lingering smile will help you feel happier too.

, Great posture and body positioning is key to appearing happy. Furthermore, good posture actually helps you feel better, making it a lot easier to actually look happy. You want to appear open and inviting to conversation, showing the calm confidence that happy people have.


When standing, ""line up"" you major joints. Your shoulders are above your hips, which are above your knees, which are above your ankles, forming a straight line up.
Pull your shoulders back to puff your chest slightly out. Your spine should be upright, not hunched forward or backward.
Keep your chin parallel to the floor and make eye contact when speaking to others to build trust and confidence

, Wear clothes that make you feel sexy. Shower and spritz on a perfume, cologne, or spray that you enjoy. Get the haircut you've always wanted. When you don't have to think about your outside appearance, you can calm down and focus on your inner ""appearance."" Wearing clothes you love and taking pride in your looks is a great way to exude happiness in any situation.


Clothes don't buy happiness, and you don't need new outfits to look happy. Rather, just spend an extra 5 minutes in the morning to look fresh, providing confidence all day long.

Check email at scheduled times.,
File emails.,
Employ other forms of communication when more efficient.,
Limit interruptions.,
Utilize the cloud.,
Use bookmarks online.",How to Be Organized at Work2," Not all of us have to be glued to our inbox, as many messages aren’t actually as time sensitive as we may think. If you work in a job that doesn’t require immediate email follow-up, check your email at scheduled times only about three to four times per day.

, Use filing folders and flags to your advantage instead of letting messages pile up in your inbox.Folders and subfolders in Outlook, for example, or Gmail’s labels and multiple inboxes can be an asset.If you’re a journalist, for example, your folders might be called Current Stories, Future Stories, Old Stories, Interviews & Sources, and Pitches & Ideas.


Delete and archive. Archive important, old correspondence, and delete the rest. In the example above, ""Old Stories"" is the journalist's archive folder. Once you start deleting old emails, you’ll be surprised at how many emails are more worthy of the trashcan than the filing cabinet. Some people also swear by “inbox zero,” which means having zero unread emails (or zero emails in your inbox, period). In addition to using folders and labels, you can achieve inbox zero by using your archive feature, deleting old emails during downtime, and using email decluttering apps., Sometimes a quick phone call can do the work of 10 back-and-forth emails. If so, make the call! If you know an email exchange merits a discussion or will involve considerable back-and-forth, sometimes it’s better to have a phone call. You will often get more detail over the phone, while you and the other party to the discussion avoid drafting lengthy, time-consuming emails. You might even email a colleague and say, “I have a lot of questions for you on this. Maybe a call would be easier. Can I ring you in 5?”

, While strategic breaks are helpful, interruptions during your work times are not. Interruptions can slow you down, break up your work rhythm, and make you lose your train of thought. So, try using away messages and voicemail when you know you’ll be too busy. These tools aren’t just for when you’re not physically in the office; they can be used when you’re just too swamped. Many people also have an “open door policy,” but you don’t actually have to keep your door open at all times. You might even leave a friendly note on the door saying, “Conference Call in Progress” or “Occupied. Drop back later or email please.”

, Cloud computing is worth considering because it can be cheaper, scalable, more efficient, and more easily updated.Content available in the cloud is particularly useful because you can access it across your devices: computers, tablets, smartphones, etc. Cloud storage also serves as a useful primary or secondary form of digital backup. Check with your IT manager or software provider because you might already have a certain amount of free disk space available in the cloud or available for a small annual fee.

, The major browsers all have bookmarking capabilities where you can save and organize your favorite or most frequently visited web addresses for quick and easy access. Take advantage of them so you don’t forget important sites to check for news or industry updates.

Avoid multitasking.,
Create a schedule or timetable for yourself.,
Use a timer app, stopwatch, or alarm clock.,
Avoid postponing activities.",How to Be Organized at Work3," All the experts seem to agree on this one.While it may sound speedy or look cool on TV, multitasking is not efficient and can actually hurt your organizational effectiveness.Instead, devote your full attention to one task at a time, handle it, and move on to the next item on your list.

, Thankfully, most jobs don’t require scheduling everything in your day down to the minute. However, keeping a basic schedule of the highlights and most important tasks and events of your day can help keep you on task.


Set time limits for certain activities. Some tasks do not require set time limits, but others should have time parameters to boost your productivity. Think of tasks throughout your day that tend to take more time than necessary, and give them time limits in the future.
Budget extra time for other activities. Some tasks, as you’ve learned from experience, wind up usually taking more time than expected, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. For these types of activities, and for particularly important events and meetings, for example, budget extra time before and after.

, These can be effective tools when used sparingly. Some people like to set their alarms 10, 15, or 30 minutes ahead of time to give them advance warning or buffer time before an activity. You can also set reminder alerts.

, Ask yourself if postponing is absolutely necessary or if this urge is just an example of procrastination. If you sense the latter, don’t postpone—power through! However, in cases when postponing all or part of an activity is unavoidable, be sure to make note of where you left off, and reschedule with concrete plans. Alternatively, you might come up with a contingency plan. For example, if you have to cancel an in-person meeting, perhaps you can hold a conference call or web conference instead.

Take breaks.,
Sleep Better.,
Don’t compare yourself to co-workers.,
Accept that organization is an ongoing process.",How to Be Organized at Work4," Mental downtime is important to our productivity and healthy for the mind.We get so caught up in our work sometimes that we don’t stop to take much-needed breaks. Taking breaks gives us needed rest that improves our productivity, but it also gives us the opportunity to take a step back and ask whether or not what we’ve been doing is the most efficient use of our time.

, Without proper sleep, you might feel groggy, tired, or lethargic the next day, which can harm your schedule and efficiency at work. Aim for seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night.

, Most of our coworkers’ jobs are different from our own, and everyone has different methods of organization that work for them. A method that makes sense and is efficient to a colleague might not be the best method for you and vice versa.

, Don’t expect to be perfect. Organization is ongoing and requires ongoing attention. You won’t be optimally organized every day, but a little organization goes a long way to boosting your efficiency.

Use happy, affirmative words when talking to people whenever possible.,
Find and vocalize the positives of a bad or upsetting situation first.,
Eliminate criticism for your internal monologue, especially about yourself.,
Be your own best advocate -- don't put yourself down to appear ""modest.""'",How to Look Happy2," Pay compliments instead of offering critiques. Talk about the things your ""love"" instead of the things you ""hate."" Whenever possible, think of your words as an extension of your expression. Constantly saying negative or degrading words will make you appear much less happy and much more bitter.

, This takes some training, but is the instant hallmark of happy people. To appear, and feel, in control of sticky situations, start with all the positives you can find, making note of the good before the bad. This doesn't mean smiling disingenuously -- rather, it means avoiding the sink into sad, angry, or negative thoughts and expressions. Let these negative thoughts drift off by replacing them with positive ones.


Pepper your conversation with more words like ""do-able,"" ""silver-lining,"" and ""challenging,"" instead of ""too hard,"" ""painful,"" or ""unfortunate obligations."" The way you frame arguments is important.
When faced with tough decisions or moments, talk more about possible solutions and less about causes. Happy-looking people aim for the future instead of dwelling on the past., If you are making yourself feel unhappy on the inside, then you're going to show it on the out. Happy-looking people don't dwell on self-doubt and criticism, instead replacing these thoughts with more realistic thoughts. This, of course, is easier said than done. But the first step -- simply noting these critical thoughts and ignoring them -- is a powerful first step to looking happier.


Remember that people pay less attention to you than you think. If you believe, ""everyone thinks I'm dumb,"" or ""everyone is looking at me,"" you'll look stressed. But the honest truth is ""everyone"" is not even thinking about you. Like yourself, they are only thinking of them!
Harping past mistakes doesn't change them. Laughing about the mistake and thinking about how not to repeat it will help you appear happier., Talking about your accomplishments a little bit, or your moments of pride, is not being a braggart. Some people only feel comfortable making mean comments about themselves or diminishing their successes, thinking it makes the modest. What it really does is make you feel insecure, and let's other people know that you don't value your own deeds.


Happy people take compliments with a smile and sincere thank you, not a deflected put-down.
Happy people mention their successes when appropriate, keeping it short without glossing over the personal pride in their work."
"
Take action to remedy the things making you look and feel unhappy.,
Slow down and take your time, avoiding busywork or rushing.,
Remember that happiness isn't tied to outside events -- it comes completely from you.,
Turn to the people you can trust to share important or stressful emotions.,
Help other people regularly, through charity or daily acts of kindness.,
Take care of your body to take care of your mind.",How to Look Happy3," Sitting around and feeling down will show on your face. But getting up and doing something about it will wipe the unhappy look right off your face. If you're feeling unhappy, go do something about it. Just moving around will clear the unhappy look from your face as you concentrate on actions, not emotions., When you feel like you must move a mile a minute or fall behind everything. While happy people are often busy and productive, they don't let work or deadlines take up all of their mental energy. Stop, take a deep breath, and move a little bit slower.


If you're constantly feeling overwhelmed, trim away 1-2 responsibilities. Feeling productive is good -- feeling overworked isn't., The outside world, of course, affects our happiness. But you'll have a much harder time looking happy if you are fixated on good grades, a new bonus, a winning sports team, or any other external ""source"" of happiness. Remind yourself that happiness is an internal emotion, as much a choice as any other look or feeling, whenever the outside world wants to rain on your parade.


Keep in mind the things you can actually change or improve, and the bad things that happen that are completely out of your control. If you can't change or fix something (like a losing sports team), you can't be unhappy about it. Unhappiness fixes nothing on its own.

, Everyone should have a few people they can tell almost anything. They can be family, friends, or even a mental health professional -- what is most important is feeling like these people have your back. When you get stressed or feel unhappy, seek out these people. They'll help you get your mojo back.

, Helping other people, and making other people happy, is one of the most powerful ways to take control of your own happiness as well.When you're feeling unhappy, find someone to do a small favor for, even if it is just holding the door. The boost in happiness will spread to your face and posture, helping you to look happy even after the moment is long over.

, Some signs of happy people, such as the ""glow"" they emit or their carefree posture, are the result of total body health, not a mental switch is thrown on and off. Increasingly, studies show that your mental and physical health are deeply related, so taking care of one will always benefit the other. Looking happy is a lifetime goal, not a simple box to check off, so make an effort to incorporate the following into your life:


Exercise for at least 30-60 minutes 4-5 times a week.
Well-balanced meals, high in fruits and vegetables.
Taking dedicated time each week away from work to relax.
Keeping a clean and reasonably organized living space."

Think about your life.,
List your Qualities.,
Think and list your Weaknesses.,
Enjoy becoming a better person.,
Remember that you are one & only.",How to Know Your Qualities," What good things do you do for yourself and the people around you? Do you volunteer for your neighborhood? Then you would be known as a helpful person. Do you listen and help people about their problems? Then you are an understanding person.;
, Write down onto paper the good things about yourself. Some ideas are ""I am creative"" or ""I can lead"" or ""I am organised"". This way you can look at all those fantastic things about yourself and be proud of them. When you know what you are good at, you can improve yourself from there.

, Do you have low self-confidence? Are you bad at trying new things because you are scared? Now that you know what your weaknesses are, you can improve yourself from there. If you have low self-confidence, present in front of an audience about something you are good at and ask them to tell you what you need to do better, for example eye contact with the audience, interact with people more.

, If you have any spare time, take on a sport or hobby that you are bad at and make yourself better at it. If you can't swim, go to swimming classes or just watch videos and learn. Remember, Practice Makes Perfect!

, Don't copy other people and be fake. Do what you think is best because you are the best at being YOU.

Take some time alone to allow your thoughts to arise without any judgments.,
Discover what messages you've been telling yourself.,
Listen to your emotions.,
Allow your own emotions to flow freely.,
Identify when you begin to absorb another person's emotional energies.,
Another way to recognize other people's emotional states is to observe the person's behavior around others.,
Listen to the things this person talks about.,
Watch this person's behaviors.,
When you recognize yourself getting nervous because the person beside you is emitting this energy, immediately tell yourself that you don't identify with their emotions anymore.,
Try to imagine a steel wall around your heart, which only allows positive energy inside.,
Imagine other's emotions floating around like little orbs.,
Sometimes you need to remove yourself from the person or situation.,
If you are unable to leave the situation, for example, you live with negative family members, then imagine the steel walls from your heart expanding to infinity.",How to Live As a Spiritual Empath," If you think, ""I hate X because they are rude,"" don't judge it. Just recognize the thought and trace back, why it is that you feel that X is rude.;
, Going back to X being rude, what have they done to you recently that you found to be rude? Are these things truly rude, or have you just thought them rude because it spoke a truth to you? Remember that no matter what anyone says or does to you, it is not a reflection of you, but of their consciousness. You are the person in control of the messages repeating in your head.

, If you walk into a room and feel a nervous energy, take note of it, and then look at the messages you've been telling yourself. If you were happy going into the room and then sank suddenly when you walked in, then its possible those energies are coming from elsewhere. This isn't to say that you didn't play a part in them. Just being aware is the key here.

, If you bash yourself for feeling angry then you aren't doing your responses any good. They are there for a reason–learn to accept them, and you'll begin to understand them more fully. This is a tough one but it gets easier the more you practice full acceptance of your emotions, with no strings attached.

, Most Empaths are confused about their own emotional energies and the energies deriving from others. If you are around someone who has an angry emotional field being emitted often, then you must learn how to disassociate from that state. The best way to do this is to look at your own emotional state before you were around this person. If you were happy and feeling light, and then when they came into the picture, all of a sudden you felt a throbbing pulse ignite, then likely it's not coming from you. (Now keep in mind if you constantly think angry thoughts about this person while you're not around them, then don't be surprised if you feel angry when they come onto the scene. In this case you likely need to work within your own self to figure out the source of anger first, and then work out what you've absorbed from them.)

, If they often act anxious around other people, not just you, then it's becoming clearer that this person is the one emitting the nervous energy, not you. (This point may seem like common sense but often we absorb other's energies as our own, leading us to mistake them for our own.)

, As well as behaviour, the talk can be very telling within the messages as to what this person thinks regularly. People with repressed emotions often spill out their true feelings in unconscious ways. Do you feel guilty around a person who always seems to be criticizing others?

, If they seem composed all day long and smile at everyone they meet, but then you always hear them slamming their mug on a table or shuffling things aggressively, then be sure to note that.  So often these little mannerisms are the telltale signs of what lies beneath their presented exterior.  (This step can be difficult to recognize but soon you'll pick up on things you've been aware of for some time, yet never put into conscious thought about. One day you'll see a friend’s habit in a completely different light. For example they always clear their throat and you feel a nervous twinge inside, but never thought about the connection.)

, Recognition is the first key to moving away from their state of being.

, Inside that steel wall, know that you understand your emotions and why you feel what you do right now, and that you don't have to feel what others are feeling. This is coming from a place of love; if someone is nervous about flying, you won't be much help to them if you act nervous too. So, keep your emotions barred off from others (unless they're positive and you'd like to share in that).

, Watch the orbs floating around and each time one gets near you, see a force field surrounding you that causes these orbs to bounce right off. From here, feel free to expand the force field as far as you like.

, This is never a bad thing, nor is it a sign of being a coward (in fact, it takes courage to extricate yourself). Just leave, your well-being is more important.

, This will help to keep you from interacting with negative energy more often than you need to, until you can leave.

It can start in different ways, from different reasons. Being aware starts with understanding that the present is the only tense which really counts, and here is the only place where we are. The past made us what we are today, and the future may give us the time to put our skills at the service of our beloved ones, but it is only here and now that we can do and make what we want to. Being aware also means considering the needs and wants of ourselves, the people who are dear to us, the people who we are not close with, and the ones who we would rather not see.;
, Praying is a form of meditation, and it may also be a way to relax the mind. Contemplate loving kindness in your meditation. It can be done standing, sitting, or walking; it has also been said that sleeping may be the most effective form of meditation.

, That shows us if we are motivated enough, and provides a loop of thinking-acting-rethinking, which is the key to progress. Holistic living is a state of mind, but also a state of action. A simple example of how important it is to be active is that we can find thousands of tasty recipes online, but even if we learn them by heart, knowing them does not feed us. We can also find lots of advice about empowering people and solving the world's challenges, but words and speeches are only as important as the actions they inspire.

, By being objective and loving about who we are, we build the start for improving relationships with the ones we care for, and the world. Being respectful with ourselves can be as simple as listening to our body when it sends signals that it is uncomfortable or in need of a rest, etc. We must listen to our feelings, needs, and wants, and communicate them in a respectful way to our beloved ones.

, Even if we heard it many times, we need to remind it to ourselves when we sit at the table. Eating properly is a form of respect towards our body; and also towards the generations which preceded us, and to whom we owe our nativity. Keep meals regular, and avoid snacking. The content of our meal is of course important: eat organic when possible, eat fresh, and keep processed food at a minimum.

Find a job.,
Create a budget.,
Live below your means.,
Save.",How to Learn to Live Independently1," You will need to find a way to support yourself before you can live independently. This involves finding a job that pays you enough to cover all of the bills.


Create good chances of promotion and steady growth within your job by keeping your work skills sharp and making yourself valuable to the company. Continually making more money means you’ll be able to live more comfortably on your own.;
, A budget allows you to determine how much money you will need for bills and what you will have leftover for yourself. Start by figuring out your income, then deduct your monthly expenses from that.


This will include your phone bill, car payment, groceries, and the like. Look at how much money you have after that. The number will help you determine what you can spend on rent or mortgage.
You will likely need to readjust your budget after you move in. You won’t get an accurate idea of how much your utility bills and other expenses are until you’ve spent some time in your new place., Spending less money than you make sounds easy enough, but it can be quite difficult. This may mean having to spend more nights in and sacrificing having the newest and trendiest gadgets. But, being able to live on your own will be worth it., Having a safety net while living on your own is crucial. This allows you to still pay your bills should something happen that prevents you from being able to work. It also gives you the means to pay for unexpected bills, if they occur.


Having at least three months’ rent or mortgage in your savings account is ideal. This should help you cover expenses should you lose your job or become sick."

Stop punishing yourself for procrastinating.,
Tackle your most important task for 15 minutes.,
Break tasks down into small chunks.,
Start your day with the hardest tasks.,
Give yourself a pep talk for motivation.,
Aim for done over perfect.,
Promise yourself you’ll get a reward when it’s done.",How to Stop Procrastinating1," The more stressed out you are, the harder it’ll be to get your work done. Don’t be mad at yourself. Move on and focus on what you’ve got to do instead.Guilt and regret are draining emotions. Wasting time yelling at yourself for not starting this essay two weeks ago will only make you extra tired and frustrated. This will make it impossible for you to finish your assignment right now.;
, Instead of thinking about the total number of hours you’re about to work for, just start. Tell yourself you’ve only got to do it for 15 minutes. This will deal with the intimidation factor, and you’ll likely spend much longer than 15 minutes on your task before you stop working again.If 15 minutes still sounds too intimidating, do something for 3 minutes.Once you come up for air, take a two-minute break. Then start up on another set of 15 minutes of work.

, It can be overwhelming to think about finishing a whole essay or getting through an entire week’s worth of tasks. Instead of thinking about everything you have to do as one big obstacle, break it all down into really tiny pieces. You’ll be able to get started on the smallest crumb and go forward from there.For example, instead of thinking, “I need to finish this essay by 10PM tonight,” tell yourself, “I’m going to make a short outline, fill that in, and then look for quotes.”

, You’ll be most energized in the morning once you’ve eaten breakfast and woken up fully. Tackle the hardest thing on your docket right then. You’ll feel better once it’s done, and then you can move on to a few easier tasks for the rest of the day., “Self-talking” is a great way to calm yourself down, get focused, and meet your goals. Talk to yourself, using your name. Tell yourself that you can (and will) do this.Self-talk by saying something like, “Jenny, I know this week has been hard and you’re tired. You’ve written a million essays before, and you’re going to rock this.”
You can also ask yourself questions: “Jenny, why are you nervous about this? You know you can handle it.”
Self-talk out loud if you can. It’ll also work in your head if you’re in a public place.

, Imagining the perfect essay, assignment, or project could be what’s holding you back. It’s nothing at all if it’s not finished, so abandon your vision (or fears) of the perfect product. You also can’t fix what doesn’t exist yet., You’re probably dreading the next however many hours you need to finish this task. Just tell yourself that when it’s over, you get to celebrate with one of your favorite things. Use that anticipation to push yourself through the pain."

Think about who you’re around.,

Be positive.,
Think about where you are going.,
Always have good hygiene.,
Ask someone else’s opinion.",How to Learn to Behave Socially," An “audience” doesn’t necessarily mean a group of people watching you perform (literally), but in many ways, our social interactions are a type of performance.


You may find that you act differently around close family members or friends than you do around people you don’t know very well. You may act differently around co-workers alone than when your boss is around. Or, you may act differently around kids than around elderly people. Consider the reasons for this.
Be sensitive toward those around you. Take into consideration who you’re talking to before you say something. Watch for vague statements that could be taken the wrong way by certain people.;
, This is especially helpful in new environments, like a new job or a new social circle. By hanging back and observing for a bit, you can get an idea of appropriate ways people interact in different types of situations.

, This may be especially helpful if you are young or if you have not been around many differences in your lifetime yet. Be accepting of unfamiliar cultures and of differing levels of abilities.


Be friendly and respectful toward all people, regardless of how they are different from you. If they seem uncomfortable at first, it may be because you are just as different to them as they are to you. Take the first step and be polite. You may end up learning much about the many differences in the world.
In the words of Dale Carnegie (author of How to Win Friends and Influence People) try to, “Focus outward, not inward.”, For instance, statements that generalize all women or men, all people of various races or sexual orientations, or all people of an age group.


Stereotyping, or making racist or sexist comments, can be quite offensive, even if you’re talking to a group that doesn’t include the people you’re commenting on.

, Social cues are things we pick up on from others that they haven’t directly told us.


Example: You are busily working on a project and someone approaches you to talk. You quickly acknowledge them but then continue working. If they continue trying to have a conversation with you, they have not read your social cue, which is that you are too busy right now to talk.
Another example: You’re at a party, or a bar. A person you don’t know approaches you and starts flirting. You turn away and continue talking to your friends. The person who approached doesn’t leave, and instead repeatedly tries to get your attention. This person has not read your social cue, which is that you’re not interested.
The importance of reading social cues is that it can be frustrating for the person who has given the cue if it is not interpreted. Reading social cues is often something that we learn as children.
Cultural differences can sometimes interfere with the reading of social cues, as can certain disabilities such as autism, ADHD, and depression.

, Regardless of who you’re around, saying basic words like “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me,” shows the respect that everyone deserves when you are talking to them., If you’re not sure what to say in a certain situation, saying as little as possible in a polite manner is best. Making small talk is fine, especially with people you don’t know very well., Lean in slightly toward the person you are talking with. Slouching back and/or crossing your arms sends out a signal that you are bored or perhaps upset by a conversation., When you’re talking to someone, or they are talking to you, looking in their eyes shows confidence and that you are fully engaged in talking with them.


If someone isn’t making eye contact with you, don’t jump to conclusions. Cultural differences sometimes deem eye contact inappropriate, or it could be a sign that someone is intimidated by you. Give it time and see if you can figure out the cause., There is a difference between making eye contact and staring at someone. You definitely don’t want to watch what someone else is doing if you are not directly having a conversation with that person at that time. It may be intimidating to that person, and is considered rude and sometimes creepy by most people.

, People feel much more at ease around someone who smiles. We don’t mean plaster a fake smile on your face at all times, but during a conversation, it helps to smile occasionally – especially if someone said something interesting or funny., This is also covered in the first section, but it’s always good to think about what you’re going to say before you say it.


Avoid statements that are heavy with value-judgments.
For example, instead of saying, “The mayor sure is a moron, huh?” say, “What do you think of the mayor’s rebuilding proposals (or whatever the topic is)?”, Getting too loud or high in pitch can be startling to others, or they can easily misread your emotions.

, Listen and don’t interrupt others. This can be difficult if you suddenly get really excited to say something, or if there is one person in a group dominating a whole conversation, but try to resist the urge to cut someone off mid-sentence., Everyone gets angry sometimes, and if you’re angry with someone the best way to handle it is to calmly explain to them why you are angry, or to walk away from the situation and discuss it when you are less angry.


No one, neither close friends and relatives nor casual acquaintances, responds well to being yelled at. It is frightening and most likely will only make the conflict worse.

, If someone tells you something, ask them more about it. For instance, your friend says he was out of town last week. Ask where he went and if he had fun. Questions also go really well together with compliments. If you compliment someone, follow it with a question. Examples:


Those are cool shoes! Are they new? Or, Where did you get them?
He’s such a cute dog! What’s his name? What kind of dog is he?
It’s easier to keep conversation rolling with someone if you contribute, ask questions, are interested in the answers, and then add more it., Sometimes people who are naturally funny or good at many things are tempted to dominate conversations with jokes or stories of their own achievements. Don’t be that person! Many people may be turned off by it.


Again, the more interested you act in the other person, the more likely that person is to want to have more conversations with you. Even if you don’t care about having more conversations with that person, you probably want to avoid making them think you are self-centered and vain.
Some types of humor or jokes are not appropriate for most situations. Making others feel bad, or jokes at the expense of others, will most likely make others uncomfortable, especially if you don’t know them very well., People naturally gravitate toward those with a positive outlook and upbeat personality. Instead of always just complaining or criticizing, think of the positive things about a situation or about constructive ways to help solve a problem. Look at that glass as half full!, Are you going to a nice restaurant? To a ball game or a picnic? To a wedding or holiday party?


The type of clothes you wear to a certain event tells others that you care about your appearance and will help you feel more confident.
If you’re going to a restaurant, try looking it up online to see if you can tell how fancy it is.
For casual places, and for picnics or ball games, jeans and t-shirts or business casual clothes are just fine.
For fancier restaurants, weddings, or holiday parties, you’ll want to dress up a bit more (a nice dress or skirt and blouse for women; a suit or dress shirt and dress pants for men) keeping in mind the exact location of the event to determine how “dressy” to be. , Wear clothes that are clean and ironed, regardless of where you’re going. Shower each day, wash your hair, brush your teeth, and wear deodorant.


Keeping up with hygiene may sound obvious, but letting it slack can be pretty detrimental to your social interactions, as well as put you at higher risk for getting sick., If you’re unsure, it never hurts to ask a trusted friend or relative what they think regarding an outfit you’re deciding on.


You can get some helpful advice, especially if you’re going to a new place and your friend has been somewhere like it before. Or, if you’re just unsure how formal a certain occasion is (ex. weddings can be either extremely formal or quite informal) it’s a good idea to ask someone."

Know that you in essence are consciousness.,

Know your essence.,
Recognize and dissolve the Ego.,
Understand that it's like a dream.,
Be in the space of present moment.,

Understand relative truth.,

""The scientist's religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural laws, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that in comparison with it all systematic thinking of human being is an utterly insignificant reflection.,
Understand that these words are just pointers.",How to Know Your True Self," Ask yourself what doesn't change? Your thoughts change, your emotions change, your body changes, people around you change, your environment changes, weather changes; every ""form"" changes, except for the ever present formless space where these things occur. You are that space of consciousness where every form comes and goes.


Its very nature of forms or content to be unstable and fleeting as they are bound by law of impermanence . Take analogy of a room; a room is made up of walls but its the inner space of the room that we use, where people and things come and go, events occur and end, etc.
""We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use."" Tao Te Ching.
In the same way, you are that space of consciousness where thoughts and other forms(internally and externally) come and go.
""Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go"" Tao Te Ching.
You, the consciousness, are so lost in contentthat you don't even notice the space of awareness where every form comes and disappears. Subsequently you think of yourself as a finite form and forms around you seem more rigid.
On a Macroscopic level of universe, even if you consider Big Bang, once it was all formless space and with the passage of time, different forms like stars, galaxies, planets, nebulas, etc. came into existence and disappeared, but it's the space where everything came and went that remained unchanged. To get a glimpse of the space of awareness in yourself, read Practice 'Wheel of Awareness' Meditation.
""There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe. For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao."" Tao Te Ching.;
, It has been hypothesized that if the mass of the universe became greater than the critical density then it will begin to collapse and it would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started . Can you see this on a level of your own form's birth and death?


Considering the miracle of birth, its the consciousness or the life that first comes in the womb and then human form begins to develop. Human form grows stronger with time and as we become old it becomes weak and ultimately there is physical death of the form. Does it seem similar to universe or objects in the universe?
Can you also see the same pattern in breathing? Inhaling (expansion) and exhaling(contraction). All ""things"" follow the same pattern because all things are bound and interconnected through the space in which they come and dissolve. Read Understand the Interconnectedness of All Things for more insight.

, Death is stripping away of who you are notStillness Speaks, Eckhart Tolle, Pg 109</ref>. While in the forest or park, have you notice broken trees, leaves, dead animals etc. facilitating the birth of new plants, grass and other organisms. What can you learn from this? Death is not the opposite of life. Life has no opposite. Death is the most natural thing there is; the journey home. The secret of life is to die before you die as death is only a form dissolving. Once you realize this truth, you realize there is no death. Its ok to die., It is a fact that atoms consist of 99.999999 percent empty space, consecutively molecules are more than 99 percent empty space. Scientists have confirmed that on a molecular level its a pulsating energy frequency.Consecutively our own human form, earth and universe are more than 95 percent space. Less than 5% of the Universe is ordinary matter, a relatively small contribution. Its the illusion created by limited view of our sense perceptions and thinking that make the forms seem more rigid and firm.

Space consciousness. Most people pay attention to the forms in the space but who pays attention to the space itself, which is the essence of all?Perhaps space is not interesting and mind looks for interesting 'things'.
Inner equivalent of external forms is thoughts and emotions in you. The more your life is cluttered with external forms(tasks, noise, jobs, etc), the more likely your inner self will be cluttered with thoughts and emotions and vice versa. It's cause world is just a reflection of your inner self. Here's a practice to realize this: Just look at the sky or listen to the silence, without adding any stories, and observe how mind activity stops or slows down. That's the inner equivalent of space and silence within you. Even if its noisy, you can still be aware of the underlying silence that enable the sounds to be.
So make a habit of becoming aware of the space from time to time, especially when you feel that you are getting lost in forms. For example: Become aware of inner body, sky, breath, silence etc. It is highly recommended that you read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth on this.
When you are in touch with inner spaciousness within you, things lose their seriousness and rigidness, and that's when you truly enjoy life.







, Ego is our identification with mind, emotions and form. A false sense of self we try to get from the things in our life. It's a dysfunction that most of the humanity is suffering from, to varying degrees. Plus, it is so common that people think that it's normal. We are so lost in forms(mental, emotional, material) that we are unaware of our essence, the consciousness that we are.. It is highly recommended that you read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth.

, Have you ever asked yourself if you could be in a dream right now? We, the consciousness, have been in the grip of ego for so long that we think this is our reality. Experiencing this world through limited view of sense perceptions and thinking. While in true reality we could be trapped in some kind of a Matrix or pseudo reality. Confusing?


Try this: recall something what you did or experienced in reality. Now recall something you did or experienced in a dream. When you recalled both of the scenarios, did you notice any difference in the way the images or sounds from the experiences came? Most probably not; contextually they were both the same. Some images and sounds. For example: try to recall what you ate this morning? Now notice the representation of an image of the food that came up in your consciousness. Was it an image or motion? Now recall what you ate in any of the dream. How was the representation of the food in a dream? Meditate on this for sometime.
Have you noticed that normal ups and downs in a dream do not affect you that much and keep you asleep but its the nightmare that has the potential to wake you up? Same in reality. Its the normal ups and downs that keep you in the grip of ego but when you face something which cannot be conceptualized and the world doesn't make sense anymore then you go through a living nightmare and you strive hard to wake up or get out of it. Recognize the interconnection between inner and external world?
Space of awareness. What you are experiencing right now is the projection of the external world in your space of consciousness. A collective dream experienced by people.. It's an illusion that what you are seeing or experiencing is 'outside'. Doesn't make sense? While you are dreaming your mind populates the space of consciousness with content, sounds, people, environment, etc. Have you experienced that in your dreams the events occur in a world created by your mind and these events seem like a real world? Its the space of consciousness, the substratum, that gets populated by mind. Are you sure the world you are experiencing is exactly how you see and perceive through the limited view of your sense perceptions and thinking?

, Your true self is inseparable from this present moment, that is timeless. Often ask yourself questions like, ""Who am I?"", ""What at this moment is lacking?"", ""What's the problem now?"". Read Live in the Present (Spiritual Way) and Surrender to the Present Moment to learn more.


Before the time was measured in seconds, hours or minutes, the time was always now. Research has proven, that a 2-3 year old can identify the time as 'now' or 'not now' but as they grow up in this ego driven world, they get more lost in the construct of time and hence become farther from their true self.
Have you heard people or yourself saying ""the day I achieve that I will be at peace and my future will be secure"", and that day usually never comes. It's a mind made concept, which says happiness or peace lies in the future but of course future comes as present moment and whatever happened in the past happened in the present moment. Consider this, if you are thinking of the past or future, you are thinking of it now.
“Time isn’t precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now. That is precious indeed. The more you are focused on time—past and future—the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.” Eckhart Tolle .

, If your introceptive and extroceptive sense perceptions(smell, sight, touch, taste, hearing) and thoughts were turned off, what would you be left with? Timeless space.

Meditate upon this by closing your eyes. Can you feel the space inside and outside your body? Can you feel that body is an illusion created by sense perceptionsand all that there is just space?
Can you observe that thoughts and emotions are no more than energy movements in the space of your body?, So far our evolution has been unconscious as we have been ego or mind driven. We have learned enough from the ego, now we must take the next step to ensure our survival. We are talking about a quantum leap into the futureas if we voluntarily relinquished the mental resistance and surrenderto what is, then we will get connected to the higher intelligence, our true self. Far more intelligent than human mind.


Voluntary surrender or acceptance is like a shortcut as we wouldn't have to go through the phase of pain and suffering, which is a very slow way to become conscious. However, do not doubt its efficacy, it still works

, You may have this notion that your primary purpose is to get a good job or start a business, become a musician, get a partner, build a house etc.... No, this is all secondary. Your primary purpose is to reconnect with your true self, the formless consciousness that wants to manifest itself through you. Every other primary purpose is of the ego. Even if it is to create heaven on earth, it's still of the ego. ""For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed."" Romans 8:19""

How to reconnect with your true self? By realizing your essence, disguised as a person. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth.






""Only one thing is of absolute importance that is your connectedness with being"" Eckhart tolle.

, Despite being quite powerful, human mind's capabilities are limited. It only sees the relative truth or one aspect of the truth. For example: Sun sets and rises everyday. Its true but relatively. As an absolute truth, Sun is there all the time, it never sets or rises, This feeling is the guiding principle of my work"" Albert Einstein.

, These words are pointing to the absolute truth that we in essence are formless consciousness or stillness. The moment you tried to turn it into something, you will lose it. You can talk about these pointers, teach others about it, write things about it but if you didn't realize what they point to, then what's the point?

Figure out what you like and don't like.,
Examine your strengths and challenges.,

Evaluate those around you.,
Think about the things you do when you're alone.",How to Know Who You Are," People often concentrate the hardest on what they like. While figuring out what brings you joy or pleasure is important, it is also helpful to know what causes you unhappiness or dissatisfaction. One of the first steps of self-reflection is sitting down and developing a list of all the things you like and all those you dislike.Your likes and dislikes are often how you describe yourself to others. These are things that may separate us or relate us to those around us. Understanding these things helps you to know what you want to move toward in life and what you want to stay away from. Knowing your likes and dislikes can guide your career choices, where you live, your hobbies, and what kind of people you surround yourself with.
Use this activity to see if your likes and dislikes are too rigid. Have you been placing yourself in a box? Is there something that you would like to do or try that is outside of what you think you should be on paper? Build up the courage to try something totally new. You might unveil a different side of yourself.;
, Just as likes and dislikes can give you incredible insight into who you are, so can understanding the things you're good at and not-so-good at. On a separate piece of paper, create a list of strengths and challenges.


For most people, strengths or talents may also overlap with their likes, and challenges may overlap with their dislikes. Let's say you like cupcakes, cookies, and pastries and a strength of yours is baking - the two are aligned. On the other hand, you might dislike sports and a challenge of yours is physical coordination or endurance.
In many cases, the things that are challenges may become things you dislike because you are not naturally good at them. This tells the why of what you do or don't like.
Simply knowing these things is meaningful in itself. However, you can dig deeper and decide if you want to work to improve on any of the things you find challenging, or if you want to focus your energy on things you are already good at.

, We can learn much about ourselves when we are at our best, but we can also glean significant understanding from when we are feeling low. Think hard about the last time(s) you were feeling down or stressed. What kind of comfort did you seek during this time? What made you feel better?


Knowing what soothes you tells you a lot about yourself as a person. It could be that you always reach out to a certain person to lift you back up or take your mind off things. You might watch your favorite movies or escape into the pages of a favorite novel. The source of comfort for you could be food, which is common in people who eat emotionally., Do this for a week or more to get a bigger picture of the topics that constantly come to your mind or identify mood states that you frequently experience. Are your thoughts positive? Negative?A review of your journal might reveal several subtle statements about a direction you'd like to take your life that you may not be consciously aware of. You might write over and over again about wanting to travel, about a certain person you like, or a new hobby you want to pick up.
After finding reoccurring themes in your journal, take a moment to think about what these thoughts and feelings mean - and whether you want to act on them.

, Another method to learn more about yourself is by completing a personality assessment online. Some people don't like being categorized, while, for some, placing labels on themselves and their behaviors brings order to life. If you are a person who enjoys understanding yourself by examining how you relate to (or differ from) others, taking a free online personality test might be helpful.


Websites such as HumanMetrics.com require you to answer a series of questions about your preferences and how you view the world or yourself. The tool then analyzes your responses to provide you with a personality type that can help you understand which interests or occupations you might thrive in as well as how you communicate with those around you.
Keep in mind that any free online assessment you take cannot be considered completely valid. These tests can offer you a general understanding of who you are. However, if you want an in-depth analysis of your personality, you will need to see a clinical psychologist.

, Your values are basic standards you hold dear that influence your decisions, behaviors, and attitudes. These are beliefs or principles that you will stand for or fight for: family, equality, justice, peace, gratitude, dependability, fairness, financial stability, integrity, etc. If you don't know your core values, you can't verify whether you are making choices that align with them. You can discover your core values by:Thinking of two people you admire. What traits do you admire in these people?
Thinking of a time when you felt really proud. What happened? Did you help someone? Achieve a goal? Stand up for your rights or those of someone else?
Thinking about what issues you are most passionate about in your community or the world. These may include, but are not limited to government, the environment, education, feminism, crime, etc.
Considering what three items you would save if your house were on fire (assuming all the living beings were already safe). Why would you save these three things?

, As F. Scott Fitzgerald famously puts it, ""I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."" If you were to pass away today, do you think you have left behind the legacy you hoped for?

, When we're children we often have lofty dreams for ourselves. As we get older, and more influenced by society, we alter those dreams. Go back to a time when you had an undeniable dream to do something, a dream you shut out because it wasn't the right time or your money wasn't sufficient. Write down how you would spend your day if you didn't have to consider your financial status. How would you live your life?

, We often miss out on amazing opportunities or don't take chances because we worry that we will fall flat on our faces. Self-doubt can define your whole life, if you don't work to overcome it. Sadly, it can also strongly impact the amount of ""what if's"" you have as you age. Here are a few ways to overcome your fear of failure, if you think it's holding you back from being the person you want to be:Know that failure is necessary. When we make mistakes, we are able to evaluate our actions and refine our methods. We grow and learn through failure.
Visualize success. One way to brush off a fear of failure is to constantly imagine yourself accomplishing your goals.
Stay persistent. Keep moving towards your goals despite setbacks. It is often that we achieve our wildest dreams right when we were about to give up. Don't let small failures cause you to lose sight of the bigger goal.

, Once you have asked these other questions of yourself, reach out to a few people dear to you and ask them who they think you are. Their assessment can be a list of characteristics or an example of a specific moment that, in their opinion, summarized you as a person.


After you have asked the opinions of several relatives or friends, ponder their answers. How did others describe you? Were you surprised by their assessments? Were you upset? Do these interpretations fit with the person you want to be or how you view yourself?
If you value the opinions of these people, then you can ask yourself what you need to do to create more harmony with how they view you and how you view yourself. Maybe you have a skewed view of yourself and need to reevaluate your actions., If you took an online personality assessment, one of the factors you may have been assessed on was introversion-extraversion. These are terms used by Carl Jung which describe where you get your energy from in life - either the internal or external world.Introvert describes a person who gets energy from examining an inner world of thoughts, ideas, memories, and reactions. These people enjoy solitude and may prefer to spend time with one or two people with whom they share a connection. They may be reflective or reserved. Extrovert describes a person who gets energy from interacting in the external world. They enjoy being involved in a variety of activities and engaging with all sorts of people. They get excited when they are around others. They may take action before thinking a decision all the way through.
Many popular interpretations describe introverts as being shy and withdrawn, while extroverts are said to be sociable and outgoing. These interpretations are faulty as most researchers have come to understand these traits as existing on a spectrum. No one is 100% introvert or extrovert, but rather leans on one or the other under certain circumstances.

, Knowing who you are also encompasses knowing your expectations, feelings, and actions relating to friendship. Reflect on your past friendships. Do you like to talk to your friends every day or every blue moon? Do you often organize get-togethers or are you just the person who gets invited? Do you value spending quality time with friends? Do you share intimate details about yourself with your friends or are you very guarded with what you share? Do you uplift/encourage your friends when they are feeling down? Do you drop everything for a friend in need? Do you place reasonable demands on friendships (i.e. don't expect your friends to always be available or only be friends with you)?Once you've asked yourself these question, decide if you are content with the kind of friend you are. If not, talk to your closest friends and see if they have advice on how you could be a better friend in the future.

, It is said that you are the average of the five people closest to you. The idea is based on the law of averages: the outcome of a particular event will be based on the average of all possible outcomes. Relationships are not exempt from this rule. The people you spend the most time with strongly impact you - whether you want them to or not. Look closely at your closest relationships, because these people define who you are, too.Of course, you are your own person, capable of making your own choices and forming your own conclusions. Still, those around you subtly impact your life in numerous ways. They may introduce you to new foods, fashion, books, and music. They may give you referrals for jobs. They may stay out late partying with you. They may cry on your shoulder after a break up.
Can you see portions of yourself that were derived from those closest to you? Are you happy with what has rubbed off on you? Simply put, if you are surrounded by positive, hopeful people, you will feel and act similarly. If you are mostly around negative, toxic people, these attitudes may also cloud your life. If you want to know who you are, look around you for the answer.

, What you do with others says a lot about you, but what you do on your own does, too. Oftentimes, we are heavily influenced by our social groups to think, act, and feel a certain way. When we are completely alone, however, we are closest to our truest selves - mostly untouched by society.


When you are alone how do you spend your time? Are you unhappy when you are alone? Are you pleased? Do you read quietly? Do you play loud music and dance in the mirror? Do you fantasize about your wildest dreams?
Think about these things and what they say about you.

Use a program or browser add-on to avoid internet distraction.,
Remove your phone from the space if you need to.,
Listen to music without lyrics.",How to Stop Procrastinating2," Figure out where you’ll be doing most of your work, and make it the best environment for limited distraction. It’s especially important to have a dedicated space for work that’s different from the one where you relax.


This may be the library, a coffee shop, your local bookstore, or a home office.

, Smartphones are usually the black holes that suck up all of our time and attention. Of course, there’s an app for that! Quickly download whichever app sounds like it will best address your particular procrastination problem.AppDetox is the best choice for quick fixes.
Yelling Mom allows you to set a time for the app to start nagging you to start something.
Procraster prompts you to identify the source of your procrastination and then gives you advice about the problem.

, If constant browsing is your biggest issue, download an application to address your internet addiction. There are a variety of programs available for both Windows and Mac operating systems.For all devices and operating systems, try Freedom.
For Mac, Self-Control allows you to block a list of websites during times you’re supposed to be working. And it’s free!
For Windows, go with Cold Turkey. Unfortunately, it costs about $20 per month for a subscription.
For free options, choose StayFocused for Chrome browsers or LeechBlock for Firefox.

, If you can’t handle being in the same space as something that’s going to tempt you, address that problem by keeping it in another room or turning it off. This also goes for other screens, including iPads, kindles, or even computers.If you need to keep your phone on for family or work-related reasons, turn off all your notifications except for texts and/or calls.

, Many people struggle to work and stay focused in a completely silent room. But if you are listening to music with lyrics, you’ll almost certainly get distracted by the words. Switch to a white-noise machine or instrumental music."

Write a to-do list to set goals.,
Prioritize different goals with set deadlines.,
Avoid multitasking to focus on one goal at a time.,
Get a buddy to keep you honest.",How to Stop Procrastinating3," Make a record of all the tasks you need to accomplish. The list should include both short-term tasks you need to finish daily and weekly, as well as long-term goals that may take months or even years to accomplish. Seeing it written down will help you plan out the various actions needed to meet all your goals.Put this list on paper. Even if you use your phone for all of your other lists, from groceries to birthday wishes, don’t put this list on there. The act of writing out your tasks is key to thinking through how to finish them.

, Use a planner to schedule your time. Write short-term tasks in daily or weekly lists that include deadlines for each item. Set deadlines for long-term goals by listing them in monthly entries.Include everything you need to get done in your planner. Say that on Friday your final biology project is due. Set aside at least three nights to finish it. You’ve also got to go to the pharmacy and pick up a new toothbrush and vitamins before you leave for vacation. Do this on Thursday night. You’re also taking the SAT in a month, so spend at least three hours this week practicing vocab.

, Multitasking makes you feel like you’re accomplishing a lot, but it actually prevents you from finishing tasks quickly and effectively. Keep your attention on one goal at a time, and give it your all. This will also help you avoid getting overwhelmed by your busy schedule., It’s hard to stay away from distractions and do your work on time when you’re doing it alone. Luckily (or unluckily), everyone struggles with procrastination. Ask a friend or family member if they’d be willing to partner up with you to check in on each other’s work habits and accomplishments.


You can plan fun outings with your buddy to reward both of you when you meet your goals. If you keep procrastinating, cancel these events as a little bit of punishment.

Just do it!",How to Stop Being Lazy," You should ideally be getting eight hours of sleep and trying to get on a regular sleep cycle. Irregular sleep patterns or sleepless nights can lead to low energy and lazy tendencies.;
, As soon as you wake up in the morning, just wash your face and freshen up. It's a very easy way to wake yourself up a bit more and start the day off right.

, Even something as simple as a brisk walk gives you natural energy and also releases endorphins that improve your overall mood, making you feel more inclined to go out and accomplish something that day.

, If you're not getting enough vegetables or healthy foods into your body, it can also affect your overall energy. Try to cut out excess junk food and eat regular meals per day. Also, if you feel hungry in between meals and want a snack, try to make it something healthy (for example, pick a fruit over a bag of chips.)

, If none of the above methods help, your feelings of laziness could possibly be linked to depression, or more rarely another mental health issue such as attention deficit disorder. It may be worth seeking professional help.

, Having an environment free of clutter can often remove some of the clutter from your mind, and make you feel more motivated and productive.

, For example, ""Today, I will go for a run.""

, Workout songs or exercise jams that get you ""pumped up"" and feeling active will help set up a positive tone to your day.

, Different environments have different impacts on our productivity. For example, if you're trying to work on something in your bedroom, does it make you want to work or just snuggle and sleep? You may want to consider a different space if you're trying to accomplish a certain task.

, Who you surround yourself with inspires your behavior. Hang out with people who are successful and motivated, and their energy will likely rub off on you.

, Have you always wanted a new job or to run a marathon? Tell people about it! Whenever people see you, they will now ask you about how things are going with those goals. It's a great way to hold yourself accountable for your actions.

, Are you waiting for a perfect time to accomplish something? There usually isn't one. Unfortunately, perfectionism can be one of the biggest reasons for procrastination.

, If you have several things to do in a given day, prioritize them into ""have-to's,"" ""need-to's"" and ""get-to's"". Do the have-to's first. Having things written out on paper often makes it easier to see what is most important.

, While you haven't expanded any energy yet, do the most unpleasant tasks of the day later. If you focus on the easier tasks first, you will have more time to work on the worst things later. Things that you don't like to do will obviously take more time than the usual. This creates an extra barrier in your mind as you have other works that you like to do or can easily get done with and yet, not doing them, as you are stuck with something that you don't like.

, Again, you don't want to overwhelm yourself into lethargy. Pick one or two things to focus on and fully devote yourself to those tasks. You don't want to spread yourself too thin.

, Another way to avoid having work seem too overwhelming is to break a task down into individual parts, then focus on each part.

, If you have a project and all you've given yourself is the due date, it's very easy to put things off until the last second. Make a timeline that lists all the steps you will need to take leading up to that due date and give yourself a reasonable time frame to accomplish them.

, Take up a new interest or hobby. Try a structured activity: that way, it's not up to you whether or not to be productive. This will keep you busy and productive, and you will expand your interests and skills.

, If you get a homework assignment, don't put it off until the weekend. Start working on it now while everything is fresh in your mind.

, Know what you spend time procrastinating with and take action to remove it. If you waste time surfing the web, work in a place that doesn't have internet access. If texting friends is your vice, move your phone into a different room or have a friend hold on to it for the afternoon.

, If you say you're going to start working on something at noon, start at noon. Don't make it acceptable to start 30 or 40 minutes later than what you committed to.

, It's natural that you will need to take a break from working, but make sure that time is limited. For example, you could commit to working for the first 50 minutes of every hour and then take a break for 10 minutes.

, There isn't any cure for being lazy. The only way to overcome this is by setting your mind to the task and completing it. Have self-discipline.

Identify your important task(s);

,
Start on the easiest of your tasks, if there are several tasks you must complete.,
After you complete a task, scratch it off your list, it'll make you feel like you accomplished something.,

Don't be a perfectionist.,
Stay encouraged and motivated to do the work.,
Maintain intensity and endurance throughout your work experience, whatever the case may be.",How to Stop Postponing Important Tasks,",, It'll get you more ""into the mindset"" of work, and you'll be ready to roll.

, It'll spark up motivation to continue and work harder.

, Drink water, stretch, go outside, breathe in and out, do something. As soon as those ten minutes are up, continue to work.

, Don't procrastinate. Start now. Now. Now. Now. Emphasize the importance of now. Now or never, so start now.

, Never leave ""half-way done"" work for another day, unless it's very necessary. If you can do it right now without having to post pone it for later, then do so.

, Or chicken out and go to sleep. Mind you, if you don't have a lot of time you might have to toughen it out and do it before your time runs out. But, if you can sleep on it, then it might be beneficial to you since the following day you'll have a fresher mind. If you have to pull an all-nighter, make sure to keep ice cubes around to put on your face when you feel like dosing off. Also, drink plenty of water, run for 5 minutes or so every hour of work to keep your body stimulated so you won't fall asleep. But as soon as you can, after you complete your work, go to sleep.

, Be a realist. If its complete, its complete. Some of the best things in life aren't pretty. Think of the wall, it might be ugly as can be but if it prevents your home from having leaks and the rain coming on top of your forehead while you sleep, then it must indeed be a beautiful wall!

, I cannot emphasize how important it is to maintain having fun. If the work you must handle isn't fun for you, make it fun. If you don't like working on your Resume that's due 6 AM tomorrow, while you're up 3 hours before trying to prepare it, you really have no choice, so make the best of your situation and make it fun. Ask yourself how many people are doing what you're doing? Probably not many. It's also a good way to learn things about yourself, and you enhance your ""toughness"" because you stayed awake for work! The more you do it, the easier it'll become. Make a game out of your work. If you have a limited time to complete the said homework, pretend that you must complete five pages within every 20 minutes because if you don't you'll be forced to drink one cup of vinegar. Make it fun.

, If you stick in with it all the way through the end and you worked hard all the way through, without slacking off, you'll be sure to be a great success and most indefinitely have something worthwhile.

Identify the biggest culprits.,
Find a place to be alone.,
Wear headphones.,
Organize your workspace.,
Work offline.,
Limit the time you spend on email.,
Manage social interactions.",How to Stop Getting Distracted when Trying to Get Things Done1," The initial step towards staying on-task is figuring out what is making you deviate from your work in the first place. Write down all the causes you can think of - from your office setup to your social media notifications - so that you know what needs to be addressed in order to get you back on track.Think about what exactly happens when you’re distracted. It’s likely that there are multiple culprits. For instance, it may be that you are drowsy due to lack of sleep or feel the need to constantly check your inbox and respond to emails. Maybe you spend 20 minutes searching for a file that you need or are regularly interrupted by visits from coworkers.;
, If you really need to get something done, it’s probably easiest to eliminate the chance of any social distractions. Find an empty office, classroom, conference room, or other quiet place to set up shop in. If you’re able, working from home can also help give you the space you need to complete the task at hand., If you’re frequently distracted by noises, music, or conversations, try wearing noise-cancelling headphones so that you can tune them out. This is a great option for people who work in busy offices with open floor plans.If music helps you work, you can also listen to it with headphones to help tune out distractions. Just make sure that your soundtrack is motivating rather than distracting.
For example, many people find that instrumentals are better than songs with lyrics since the words can divert your attention away from the task at hand.

, Limit your desktop to only the things that are required for what you’re immediately working on, so that there are no extraneous materials to distract you.

If your workspace tends to be cluttered, take time to come up with an organizational system to keep it clear. For instance, you could create a filing system for papers and keep a tray for incoming work on your desk.

, These days, emails, websites, social networks, and cell phones account for the majority of disruptions and distractions. If you don’t need to use the internet or a particular device for the task at hand, turn them off.If you can, put your phone on silent mode. Even if you have to keep it on most of time, consider carving out a phone-free hour or two each day in which you can completely focus on the task at hand.
If your willpower is not up to snuff, get a little help from an app. Apps like Freedom, Anti Social, Cold Turkey, SelfControl, and Track Time will block you from using the internet or accessing specific sites for set amounts of time.Even if you need the internet for what you’re doing, you can limit its potential distractions by keeping your email closed, only using as many windows or tabs as you require, and blocking those websites that are the biggest distractions for you, like Twitter or Facebook.

, Many of us rely on emails for important daily communications, but that doesn’t mean that you need to see every email as soon as it arrives. Try to limit the number of times that you check your inbox throughout the day by scheduling set sessions to deal with emails.Even if your work requires you to regularly check your email or other forms of digital communications, you can still limit the time you spend attending to them. Schedule a set time each hour or two when you will check your email, and don’t look at your inbox in-between.
If you can, it’s also a good idea to turn off your message alerts.
Keeping your inbox clear and well-organized will also make it easier to manage and therefore less distracting from other tasks. Be sure to delete emails that you don’t need and archive the ones you want to keep in clearly labeled folders.

, It’s great to chat with a fellow student or coworker during a break, but if people are constantly bombarding you, it can severely limit your productivity. Be proactive about informing people when you’d like to left alone.The easiest way to do this is to establish signals for when you’re approachable and not. For instance, if you have an office, you could tell people that they are free to stop in when the door is open but not when the door is closed. If you’re working in an open space or floorplan, you can tell people that you would not like to be interrupted when you have your headphones on.
You can also encourage people to stay away from your workspace by taking away additional chairs that they could sit in or by standing up whenever someone interrupts you to silently communicate that they’re distracting you from your work.

Make a list of your short and long-term goals.,
Track your time.,
Identify the time of day when you perform best.,
Pay attention to where you’re losing time.,
Be realistic.,
Get inspired.",How to Schedule Your Life1," Look ahead to the next day, month, and year. Ask yourself what you want to get done during that time. Set both short-term and long-term goals, so you’ll know how to allocate your time and measure your progress.Take your personal goals into account, as well as external responsibilities like your career or your schoolwork.
For example, your long-term goal might be to finish your degree, while your goals for today might be to attend class and finish writing a report.;
, For one or two weeks, carry a notebook or daily planner with you, and write down everything you do. Make note of how much time you spend on work, homework, entertainment, and daily tasks like sleeping and eating. Don’t try to change your habits yet. The purpose of this step is just to give you an idea of how you’re using your time right now.
Be honest with yourself about how you spend your time – you can always improve your habits later.

, After you’ve tracked your activities for several days, look over your notes and see when you are most productive. If you are consistently able to focus best at a certain time of day, that’s probably your peak productivity window.For instance, you might find that you focus best in the morning, or you might only hit your stride when the sun is going down.

, Look over your notes again and ask yourself if any consistent time-wasters appear. If an activity is unnecessary, doesn’t enrich your life, and doesn’t move you closer to your goals, it’s probably a time-waster. Think about how you can cut back on these activities or get rid of them completely.For example, you might realize that you procrastinate on the internet too much. To fix this, you could install an app that blocks distracting sites, or you could give yourself a shorter window for web-surfing every day.

, Keep your needs and limitations in mind as you plan your schedule. Just because something works on paper doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to stick with it in real life. Ask yourself how you’ll keep your energy levels up throughout the day, and remember that you’ll need to leave small gaps in your schedule for things like eating and going to the bathroom., Search the internet for articles on how successful people structure their days. Notice how much time they devote to work, play, and rest. Consider borrowing parts of your schedule from somebody you admire.

For example, you might be inspired by someone like Benjamin Franklin, who got up at five o’clock every morning to plan the day ahead."

Take small steps forward.,
Focus on specific, actionable processes.,
Eliminate waste and excess.,
Take action.,
Draw on your mental resources.",How to Practice Kaizen1," The most basic premise of kaizen philosophy is to institute incremental improvements over time. It calls for an ongoing, collaborative process of gradual enhancements to optimize productivity, efficiency, and/or quality.This means that you need to respect the process and commit to it in the long-term. Kaizen functions best when it’s adopted as a lifestyle or culture.;
, You may be overwhelmed by the big-picture and the scale of overall changes that you’d like to make. Kaizen makes the big-picture whole manageable by breaking it down into measurable, targeted improvements. Doing so enhances your chances of succeeding in the short-run and long-term as well as your ability to measure your successes along the way.For example, instead of trying to do a complete overhaul of your sales strategy, you might focus on improving one thing at a time through a specific method, like boosting sales to a particular demographic through retargeting applications or special offers.
Change can feel risky and generate resistance. This approach can be especially helpful in collective settings because it allows everyone to get “on board” with changes since they’re not alarming or drastic.
This philosophy also requires people to hone in on processes instead of dwelling on results. While the ultimate goal is to improve results, you’re more likely to get there when you focus on how to improve the process.

, One of the best ways to improve a given process, according to kaizen, is to figure out which steps you can take to reduce any wasted time or resources associated with it.For example, if you’re trying to improve your personal time management, you might identify the things that you spend the most time on and evaluate how much value each activity adds to your life and/or career. If you find that managing your emails is taking up too much time in comparison to the value that they offer, you can take steps to ensure you spend less time in your inbox.

, Following kaizen principles, you should devote your mental energy towards thinking about how to do something, not towards making excuses about why it can’t be accomplished. The principles call on you to do what you can do now and to come up with new solutions for those things that have traditionally been seen as impossible to change.When you’re taking action to make positive changes, kaizen asks people to disregard the limitations of conventional or status-quo thinking. Instead, you should approach each problem or goal on its own terms.

, According to kaizen philosophy, your most important resource to create good changes should be wisdom rather than money. As a strategy, it focuses on tapping collective wisdom versus deploying a big budget to fix things.The easiest way to do this is to gather your peers or coworkers to brainstorm solutions for particular problems that could be implemented immediately.
For instance, if you’re trying to improve your in-house communications, you could work together to come up with internal listservs, filters, tagging systems, and/or protocols that would solve many of your issues without relying on buying new software or hiring a consultant.
In the long run, you may need to make some monetary investments, but kaizen offers you the opportunity to make the best use of the resources that you already have available.

You may also use an empty cubicle or a desk that is further away from others in the office. Finding an environment that is quiet and private can help you stay focused.You may also adjust your existing work environment to make it more quiet. This may mean making sure your door is closed when you are working or adjusting your cubicle so it is more secluded and away from others.
You may also move your space to an area that is more quiet and private, such as an office space in your home or apartment.;
, You should establish a work space that is conducive to focusing and getting things done. Set up a solid work surface, such as a desk or a table, in your chosen work environment. Make sure you have a partition around your work space or a door so you can block out any outside noise.You should also keep all your books, pens, and paper in your work space. Have your computer set up in the space and a chair that is comfortable for you to sit in.

, Once you have set up a quiet, distraction-free space, you should adjust it over time so it remains comfortable and suitable to your needs. You may end up repositioning your work desk so it is facing away from a window if you find you get distracted by looking out the window. Or you may move your computer so you can see the screen properly and focus on the tasks at hand.You may add an ergonomic feature to your work space, such as a support pad for your hands while you type on the computer or an ergonomic mouse. You can also get a chair that supports your lower back so you are not distracted by any back or spine issues while you work.

, One big distraction in our lives is our technology, especially our phones. Block out this distraction by turning off your phone or putting it on mute so you can focus. You may turn off your phone for at least one hour a day so you can focus on a specific task or put it on mute throughout the day so you only pick it up and look at it a few times during the day. Try to get in the habit of checking your phone less and focusing on your work or the tasks at hand more.You may also try setting a timer on your phone and putting it somewhere you can’t see it. Once the timer is up, you are then allowed to check your phone. This can help you avoid checking your phone too often.

, Another big distraction is the internet. If you don’t need the internet to get your work done, try turning off your wifi connection in your workspace for a period of time. You may set aside one hour in the day of internet-free time where you catch up on reading, study, or get other errands done. Turning off your wifi can make it easier to avoid getting distracted by the internet.When you switch off your wifi connection, you may let others know around you and advise them to communicate with you in person if they need something. This will signal to others that you are going to be offline and focused on other things for a period of time.

, You should also try to cut down on how often you use social media and email throughout the day. If you notice you check your email several times in an hour, you may try to reduce this to only several times a day. You may also try limiting how often you check social media. If you tend to check social media every hour, try only checking it every other hour.If you cannot seem to control your use of social media and email, you may try shutting off your wifi connection completely for several hours in the day. Or you may give your smartphone to a friend to prevent you from checking it too often while you are working.

, You should let those around you know that you are trying to stay focused and avoid getting distracted. Tell your roommates, your partner, or your family members that you are going to be busy for a certain period of time and need to be left alone. You may also let coworkers know that you are trying to stay focused and to talk to you another time.Try putting up a “Do Not Disturb” sign on your door or keep your door closed. You can also instruct others around you that if your door is closed, they should knock first before entering so you are not disturbed.
You may text your friends and let them know you are busy doing school work or work at the office so they leave you alone for a period of time. Or you may send out an email to others letting them know that you will not be checking email for a specific period of time so you can focus.

, Spend some time doing self-exploration and identify what it is you really want from your particular tasks or goals, and not what others may expect from you. Sometime, people do tasks, set goals, or pick a particular path in life out of desperation to free themselves from the anxiety of not knowing where to go or what to do. People also try to make others happy by following their expectations and desires, rather than one’s own.

Ensure that what you are focusing on matches what you truly desire in regards to your life purpose and goals, as this can help to foster passion and drive to continue on.

, To stay focused and organized, you should create a list of tasks and goals. Write down the tasks for the day as well as goals or things you need to get done. Post the list somewhere you can see it and mark things down as you complete them. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting distracted from the tasks at hand.You may order the list based on the most important tasks to the least important tasks. Or you may try ordering the list based on the smallest task to the largest task. This way, you can get the smaller tasks out of the way quickly and have enough time to get to the larger ones.
For example, you may have the task ""do homework"" at the top of your list of tasks, followed by ""clean room."" Or you may put ""get emails done"" at the top of your list, followed by ""organize desk.""
Block out time in your calendar to complete each task as if it were a scheduled meeting or other appointment. This could be as simple as when you will return phone calls, or respond to emails, rather than responding to them immediately as they come in.

, It can be easy to get overwhelmed by your to-do list, especially when you are prone to distraction. Rather than try to do everything at once, try tackling one thing at a time. Focus on one task, complete it, and then move on to the next task. This way, you do not get overwhelmed and you can feel a sense of accomplishment with every task completed.For example, you may have “finish book report” and “do chores” on your list. Start by focusing on finishing your book report first. Once that’s done, shift your focus to doing your chores.

, Make sure you allot yourself some breaks between tasks or goals. Having a few minutes of downtime can help you feel less stressed and overwhelmed. You may schedule in ten minutes of downtime between tasks if you have a very busy day or allow yourself an hour of downtime after dinner before tackling more work.


You may use your breaks to surfing the internet, go on social media, or chat with a friend. Once the downtime is up, make sure you shift your focus back to your list of tasks.

, To stay motivated and focused, it may help to visualize your success for the day. You may do this at the start of the day, where you visualize yourself completing all of your tasks and achieving your goals. You may also do this in bed before you go to sleep, visualizing your day and your ability to stay focused.For example, you may visualize yourself in your work space, checking off the tasks on your list and avoiding distractions. Or you may visualize yourself completing a particular task, such as typing up a paper on your computer or completing your household chores on time.

Set manageable goals.,
Break work up into small, achievable tasks.,
Plan the most difficult work at your most productive time.,
Set deadlines.,
Create a rewards system.",How to Stop Getting Distracted when Trying to Get Things Done2," It will be easier to stay focused on what you need to accomplish if you take time to make a to-do list for each day or work session. For instance, your list might include handling correspondence, writing a client-facing report, working on an internal presentation, and arranging a meeting.If your to-do list isn’t accomplishable in the time allotted, select the most important or high-priority tasks to focus on. For example, if your report is due to your client immediately, you should prioritize completing it over correspondence.

, It can be daunting to face a huge project, which can lead to procrastination. It will seem much more manageable if you approach your work as a series of finite tasks.For instance, if you’re planning an event, list all the individual tasks involved, from booking a venue to sending an invitation to arranging speakers. Prioritize them according to their time-sensitivity, and tackle one thing at a time.
This approach will help you see that you’re making progress against a big goal while feeling the satisfaction of being able to check things off your list as accomplished.

, Take time to notice when you feel most alert during the day and when you have the fewest outside distractions. Set aside those times to tackle the tasks that require the most concentration.For instance, if you’re sharpest at the beginning of the day or have the fewest emails to attend to, do your hardest work then. Take on the tough tasks like drafting original case studies when you’re on-point and save daily correspondence for the end of the day.

, If you’re not aware of how much time you’re spending on a project, it can take more hours than it should. When you’re starting a task, decide how long you’d like to devote to it, and try to stick to that limit.If you’ve got an ongoing project, consider dedicating a set amount of time to it each day but no more. For example, you might decide to work on it for the first two hours of your day and then move on to other things.

, If you’re finding it difficult to motivate yourself, determine a reward that you will get if you accomplish a given task. It could be anything from going to a movie to getting yourself your favorite smoothie.

Eat a good breakfast.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take breaks.,
Get enough sleep.,
Meditate and reflect.",How to Stop Getting Distracted when Trying to Get Things Done3," Many people skip their first meal of the day, but eating a healthy breakfast can elevate your concentration and performance during the day. Opt for foods with protein and fiber, like yogurt, eggs, whole-grain cereals, and nuts, to give yourself the best chance of maintaining your focus., Even mild dehydration can negatively affect your mood, focus, and performance. Be sure to drink water regularly throughout the day, especially when you’re consuming lots of diuretics, like caffeinated beverages.The average person should drink about two liters of water per day. An easy way to ensure that you’re getting this amount is to carry a liter-sized water bottle with you throughout the day, and be sure to refill it once.

, No one can maintain their attention for hours at a time. While constant distractions can cripple your productivity, regular diversions can actually help you recharge and stay on schedule. Avoid burnout by taking quick, frequent breaks.For instance, if you’re going to be working on something for many hours, take a ten-minute break each hour to give yourself a chance to reactivate your concentration.
It also helps to move around during your breaks to help recharge your body.

, Being tired seriously undermines your concentration and performance. Try to give yourself at least eight uninterrupted hours of shuteye a night. Doing so will ensure that you’re mentally and physically prepared for the tasks at hand.Try setting a sleep schedule to keep yourself on track. Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day will establish a healthy cycle that your body can depend on.If you have trouble getting to sleep, establish a relaxing ritual to ease yourself into it. For instance, you may spend time in dim light meditating, reading, or listening to relaxing music before bed. Whatever you do, it’s best to make sure that it doesn’t involve any lit screens, which can make it harder to fall asleep.Avoid things that will disrupt your sleep, like eating or drinking within three hours of your bedtime. It’s also best to sleep in total darkness (or with an eye mask) and keep your devices away from your bed and in sleep-mode.

, Short sessions of meditation and mindful reflection can significantly improve your concentration. Taking time out to perform these exercises is likely to save you time in the long run.To practice simple meditation, relax and sit still while you focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale slowly out of your mouth. With each exhalation, imagine that you are expelling stress and tension from your body.
Meditating for as little as 5-15 minutes a day can make a difference.
Consider taking a few minutes at the end of your work to reflect on what you’ve accomplished, and make a list of the things that you’d like to focus on the next day. This can help you leave your work behind so that you’re better able to give your full concentration to it during your next work session.

Make to-do lists.,
Use a planner.,
Do your most important work when you feel sharpest.,
Focus on one thing at a time.,
Create routines.",How to Schedule Your Life2," To-do lists help you keep track of all the tasks you have on your plate. It’s a good idea to have several lists: one for today, one for the week or month, and one for the whole year. This will help you maintain a big-picture view of your responsibilities without getting overwhelmed.Be thoughtful about what you put on your to-do list. Only include tasks that matter to you and that you’re prepared to actually do.
Three to five items is a good length for a daily to-do list.

, You can get organized and reduce your stress levels by deciding ahead of time when you’ll do specific tasks. Break your day into blocks of time, and assign activities like doing homework, answering emails, and cooking meals to certain blocks.When you write your plan down, you won’t have to expend energy trying to remember it.

, Arrange your schedule so that you can tackle the most important things on your to-do list during your peak productivity time. For many people, this window occurs a few hours after waking up.Obligations like classes and meetings might prevent you from working during your most productive time of day. If you can’t change your schedule, look for the second-best time of day to do your important work.

, Commit all your attention to one task before you move on to another. Multitasking might make you feel productive, but it actually makes you less efficient overall.If you tend to get sidetracked, look for ways to block out distractions. Close your door, put on noise-canceling headphones, or go somewhere without Wi-Fi to get your work done.

, Identify the basic tasks you need to do over and over again, like cooking or getting your kids ready for school. Come up with some efficient methods for doing these tasks, and repeat these methods until they’re a daily habit.For instance, you might want to create a new morning routine or a weekend meal prep routine.
When you can do simple tasks on autopilot, you free your mind to focus on more challenging things.

Set aside time for your loved ones.,
Give yourself a technology curfew.,
Work relaxation into your schedule.,
Make time for your health.",How to Schedule Your Life3," Go over your daily or weekly schedule and decide when you’ll connect with your family and catch up with friends. If you’re busy, you may find it helpful to incorporate social time into your ordinary routines.


For example, you could catch up with your family every day over dinner., It’s all too easy to waste your evening free time on gadgets like your phone or tablet, and using electronics close to bedtime can actually prevent you from getting a good night’s rest. Save time and sleep better by turning off your gadgets at least an hour before bed., Personal time is important to your overall health and happiness, so prioritize it just like you would work or school. Think about what you need to feel refreshed and recharged every day. Then block off time for it in your planner.For instance, you could get up twenty minutes earlier every morning to meditate, or you could set aside Sunday evenings to work on a hobby.

, Give yourself at least seven hours to sleep every night, as well as a few hours a week to exercise and prepare nutritious food. Staying healthy helps you function better in every area of life. You’ll also enjoy a better quality of life years down the road if you take care of your health now."

Select a personal area for improvement.,
Identify small, specific tasks that will contribute towards your goal.,
Prioritize your actions.,
Create a timeline for each task.,
Keep track of your progress.,
Add steps until you reach your objective.",How to Practice Kaizen2," This could be anything from a bad habit that you want to address to a good behavior that you want to cultivate, a skill that you want to develop to something that you want to achieve. Once you have an objective in mind, you can start applying kaizen to achieve it.For example, you may want to improve your fitness, stop smoking, enrich your social life, or spend your free time more meaningfully or productively.

, Again, you want to approach your objective one step at a time, so start by planning your first step. Don’t try to tackle everything you want to change at once; focus on breaking your goal down into targeted, measurable actions that you can take to improve., After you’ve listed all the possible actions that you could take, it’s time to decide on the order in which you’ll pursue them. How you choose to prioritize the tasks is up to you.If you’re feeling overwhelmed, start with the action that will be easiest to implement and go from there. If you’re feeling motivated, start with the action that will make the biggest difference.

, You want each step to be an action that you gradually develop into a habit. Thus, as you plan, you should determine a timeline for each step or action that lays out your incremental improvements.For instance, if you’re trying to stop smoking, create a plan for how much you will reduce your consumption of cigarettes each week.
If you want to improve your fitness, start small by taking the staircase up to your office each day instead of the elevator. Once you’ve made that routine, you might start exercising for 20 minutes two times a week and gradually increase the duration, frequency, and/or intensity of your workouts.

, You want to be able to review your improvement over time, so you need to create a system for recording it.Since kaizen is a daily practice, a calendar is a good tool for recording and checking your progress. Simply write down what you do towards your goal each day. Other options include charts or checklists, so that you can see if you’re sticking to your plan.
Keeping track of your progress will also allow you to make adjustments as needed. Remember, kaizen is an ongoing process, so you will need to keep planning, acting, and adjusting as you go. If you’re not getting the results that you want, it’s time to change the method.

, Once you’ve optimized one process or successfully integrated one practice into your life, it’s time to move on to the next step that will help improve the whole."
"
Identify areas for improvement.,
Evaluate current-state processes.,
Set the vision for the future state.,
Brainstorm possible solutions.,
Plan targeted, measurable actions to create improvements.,
Deploy the “5S method.” One of the traditional kaizen action plans for optimizing workplace processes is called the “5S method” - “seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, shisuke” in Japanese.,
Make the planning process as inclusive as possible.,
Implement the action plan and monitor results.",How to Practice Kaizen3," You may want to focus on customer or employee satisfaction, quality, efficiency, or productivity in specific departments, products, or services. Make a list of all the areas in which you’d like to see positive changes, and then pick one to start with.


If you don’t know where to start, work out a way to prioritize your objectives. For instance, you may want to begin with the areas that affect your customers the most or with an area that has the most opportunity for immediate improvement.

, To focus your application of kaizen principles, you will need to take time to document and assess existing work processes. This should include recording the steps currently involved, the time and resources required for each, and the overall results of the process.For instance, if you’re evaluating a design process, you would need to document each stage of the process as well as the personnel, time, equipment, and costs involved in each stage. You would also need to have the figures for how much is produced and how much profit is generated from the current process.
Many businesses do this through “value stream mapping,” which charts each step in a process and assesses the value and/or waste generated by that step. Once you know how well each step is functioning, it’s easier to identify places for improvement.The more information, input, and data that you have about how a process presently works and the results that it produces, the better positioned you’ll be to change it for the better.

, When you’re trying to make changes in a specific area, it’s good to have an idea of where you’d like go. That way, you can identify gaps between where you’re at and where you’d like to be. Those gaps are precisely where you should implement kaizen principles.For instance, if you’re trying to improve customer service, you may notice that your current state for an average response time to an online inquiry is 72 hours while your future state calls for a response time under 24 hours.

, Once you have laid out the information and vision for a target process, it’s time to tap everyone associated with that process to come up with potential actions that you could take to improve it. Having many people with diverse perspectives involved in your brainstorming session will increase your chances of generating a robust array of solutions.

, Break down your improvement plans into a series of small changes or steps. Decide on a reasonable timeframe for implementing each incremental change.For example, if you’re trying to improve the quality of a particular product, you might start by enhancing the processing of its core materials, then work on honing the manufacturing equipment, and then improving the procedures for quality control.

, The steps are: sort, straighten, shine, standardize, and sustain. That is, sort out what’s not necessary, organize what’s left, keep the process clean and waste-free, standardize how it operates, and continue to maintain and improve the standards you've set.For instance, if you’re applying this to a manufacturing process, you might start by eliminating unnecessary equipment from your work site, making sure that the remaining equipment is arranged in a logical manner for the workers, and ensuring that there is a maintenance policy in place to keep your newly organized space clean and high-functioning. Then, you can use your improvements to designate a new manufacturing protocol that you continuously evaluate for possible tweaks to make it more efficient.

, Everyone who is involved in a process, regardless of their rank, should be involved with kaizen planning and decision-making. This ensures that the people who know the process best are on-hand to offer possible improvements. It also means that everyone is already “on board” when it comes to implementing incremental changes., Keep the process on track by ensuring that everyone has an updated working plan or a list of the required activities and timeframe for each step. Measure improvements as you go to check that the process is working.For example, if you’re applying kaizen to make a manufacturing process more efficient, you should record how much time is being saved and how many more units are being produced per hour. That way, you can check to see that the changes being implemented are actually leading to the expected improvements.
Kaizen calls for continual evaluation of a process. Once you’ve made the first round of improvements, it’s time to check back to make adjustments or see what other actions can be taken to improve.

Remove all distractions.,
Organise your stuff and get rid of clutter.,
Decorate efficiently.,
Stick to your working hours.,
Have the right chairs for your home office.,
Get a good desk and other office essentials.",How to Optimize Productivity in a Home Office," It doesn’t matter whether your distraction is your television or your children – you need to remove them when you’re working. Send your kids to a day care, or encourage them to play outside of your office space. If you find it hard to resist the allure of the TV or games consoles, then you should ensure that these are not present in your home office space.;
, Organisation is key to a clear mind and a productive day. If you want to be able to organise your work flow and daily tasks then you need to be in an organised environment. Ensure that you have shelves for your books and folders for your paperwork and notes. Find space for all of your work related items. As for the rest of your stuff, if it isn’t required for work then it shouldn’t be there – move it to another part of the house or get rid of it altogether.

, It doesn’t matter what sort of work you do in your home office, there are going to be times when you just want to look at something pretty for a little while – and doing so is actually really good for your productivity. Your home office should use bright colours, because these help you to feel more alert and awake during the day, but they shouldn’t be so bright or contrasting that they create a distraction. You should get as much natural light as possible, have a few plants around, and perhaps decorate with artwork or photography to make the space more enjoyable.

, Even if you can choose your own working hours, be sure to set and keep to them as much as possible. This provides you with more structure and helps you stick to your deadlines a little more easily. It also makes it harder for you to over or under work yourself, making you a more reliable employee. Decide on a time to start, perhaps giving yourself time to clean around the house beforehand so that you aren’t thinking about doing it when you’re procrastinating later, and set yourself a time for lunch and a time to end. Though it can be best to leave your breaks a little more flexible, make sure you monitor the amount of time you use for your breaks and keep it reasonable.

, This includes a functional office/desk chair that should provide you with the standard adjustments and be comfortable to sit in for long periods of time. Those that encourage a good posture are particularly good, as they will reduce slouching and encourage further productivity.You'll also want an armchair or other such comfortable chair away from your workstation where you can read and think comfortably. This helps you to feel like you’ve have a good break from work, and can encourage a more creative thought process.

, A good desk that offers you a comfortable and efficient working experience is essential. This should be large enough for all of your equipment and offer drawers for storage of items you need regular and easy access to. Also have storage space for paperwork, reading resources, and various other items that are important, but perhaps not used too frequently. Having filing cabinets, shelves, cupboards, drawers and so on to handle your everyday office storage requirements is essential.

, Make it interesting! Some tips on various tasks are in the ""Tips"" section below.


Don't get so involved in whatever distraction or diversion you choose that you forget to do the task at hand.

, If you're not looking forward to doing something, chances are that you're not getting it done any faster. Stop procrastinating, and get it over with.

, Upbeat music will help keep your energy level up, while an audio book or radio program will give your mind something to focus on while your hands focus on something repetitive.


If you find that the music or story slows you down or distracts you from performing your task safely or well.

, If you have a lot of something to do, divide it into pieces that are more manageable. Clean for fifteen or thirty minutes, or clean one room, or clean just an area of that room. Sometimes the momentum of getting started will keep you going. Other times, the promise of a break and an end in sight will make the task more palatable. Find out what works for you.

, See how many or how much you can finish in five minutes. Pretend you are showing off your superior laundry-folding skills to a talent scout.

, Did you know it's possible to fold a t-shirt in two seconds?


Make sure you're doing the task correctly. The right way may be the easiest way, and it may save you the trouble of redoing it or redoing it sooner than is necessary.
Don't work so fast that you will have to redo any of your work.
Don't do more than is necessary. Does it really matter if your underwear is neatly folded, or could you just dump it in a drawer? Don't scrub the floor on your hands and knees if a mop will do. And don't aim for perfection if it's not needed.

, Having someone with you will reduce your work, keep you company, keep you on task, and in some cases, help you to perform the task more efficiently (such as if parts of it require carrying large or bulky objects or using more than two hands).


Get the family involved, if the task is at home.
Ask neighbors or colleagues. Be sure to return the favor when it's their turn with a project or chore.
Hire help if you need to. It's more costly, but the phone book is an option to keep in mind if you find yourself overwhelmed or discover that a task is too difficult or time-consuming to perform on your own. There are services out there that will do all sorts of things for you, if you choose.

, Could you take your shoes off at the door or put down good mats? If so, you might not have to sweep or vacuum your floors as often. Is it really necessary to scrub every inch of grout, or would a wide brush or mop do the job?

, Do you look forward to having a clean house or pleasant garden? Do you look forward to having the task completed and getting on to something fun?

, How many or how much have you done? How much do you need to do?


Try counting down to zero instead of up. It'll feel like you're getting their faster.
Measure your work in an unusual or fun way. Walking to keep fit? Aim to walk far enough (over months or years) to get to someplace exotic that you'd like to visit. Clearing out clutter? Weigh the bags; you could lose 20 pounds in ten minutes. Lifting weights? How many Volkswagens does that come to?

Decide that you really want to stop being ""that person who's always late"" and that you really want to improve the social/economic aspects of your life that suffer from your inability to be early.,
Decide how early you would like to be, normally 5 minutes is a good time for when you have a good habit at being early.,
Get your alarm clock and put it in the position where you will look often while getting ready to leave.,
Set this clock 10-15 minutes ahead of the actual time.,
If you have children or other people who depend on you in the morning this is where you have to bring your best attitude.,
When you know you have to be someplace on time, imagine quickly what you have to do to get ready for this place.,
Start getting ready with extra time in advance.,
Go to your place that you have kept the things you need to take with you grab them and go.,
Write down on a piece of paper or pad each place that you have to be on time.",How to Be Early," First you must decide, and this is where you fully commit, that you really want to be early. Not that it would be nice if you were an early person, but that YOU want to be actively engaged in becoming a person who is always early. You can be that person.;
, For starters try a number more like 15 or even 20 minutes to allow yourself time for learning your new habits. (Remember you have established your habit of being late over years, even possibly learned it as a child from habitually late parents, it will take effort to correct this behavior.)

, Some examples would be on the kitchen counter if you are late often from being in the kitchen, the bedroom if you are late often because of not getting ready on time. This clock is going to be your stimulus. You want this clock to become a part of your daily routine.

, Although you know the clock is fast try to refrain from thinking of it as the ""wrong time"", think of it as the time that it is for you. This is the right time, if you want to change your habits.

, If your children have a problem getting ready on time you must set strict guidelines, not only on what time they wake up and get ready, but also on the time they go to bed. No one wants to deal with a child in the morning when he/she has not had enough sleep the night before. Now setting a new inflexible schedule for your loved ones is not an easy task and this is where you need to bring your best attitude. Instead of being controlling and trying to force them, instead make them a part, tell your partner how much you appreciate them and how much you appreciate how they are going to help you with this. It's a psychological fact that you get more ants with honey than you do trying to beat them into submission. You want to get everyone to buy-in. If you're a parent your kids are learning your bad habits from you while they are young, when they become teenagers and are constantly late to class, remember it was you who taught them this habit.

, Make sure to include any family members that you must make sure are ready. You have to start doing these tasks early. This of some of the tasks that you can do earlier in the day or even a night before. Pick out clothes, prepare snacks (on the dishes you are taking them in) get the car packed, anything that can be done should be done hours in advance to getting ready to leave. Make it part of a new habit/ritual. Tell yourself, that you are not going to be ""that person who is always late"" and for you, ""I have to be early."" Remember you don't have a choice, this is just something you have kidded yourself into believing. Being early is the only choice that is positive, being late is not a choice, it's a failure to do what society deems correct.

, Keep looking at your clock that you set 15 minutes fast if you are looking at a clock to see how much time you have. On that clock you should be planning to leave with enough time to get where you are going plus a few minutes for extra problems. Time your driving trips, or use Google maps to give you a drive time, add a few minutes to be safe and leave with enough time to get there. While you are getting ready to leave don't do anything that can sidetrack you. Turn off the television, check anything that needs to be locked, feed your animals etc. BEFORE you are getting ready to go. Keep the things that you are taking with you all together in one place. This includes your keys and any bags or items you don't want to forget. If you have trouble with always feeling like you are forgetting something, jot down a short list of the things that you need to bring with you so you can check them before you start getting ready.

, This should include directions, keys, phone, and anything really that you'll need wherever you are headed. You won't have to take time to check all the things that can normally cause you to be distracted and late, because you did them in advance. You won't have to run around looking for last minute items because they are all together.

, Make a happy face when you make it EARLY and a X when you did not. Each week add up the number of time that you did not make it to someplace early. If the number of times is reduced from the last week, reward yourself. Remember if your family is involved in this too it's important to reward them. Even if they don't know about it you can reward them and shape their behavior as well. If your wife or husband (or boyfriend/girlfriend) is being especially supportive think of what they like/want very much and do that thing. It will reinforce their actions also. Ask them to reinforce you if they notice you doing a great job of being early places, especially if they weren't happy with your tardiness in the past.


As you reduce the number of times you are not early places and practice doing things ahead of time, you will be shaping your behavior. Once you have reduced the number of times you are not early to 0 then remember to keep track still because the being late behavior will reoccur on occasion and you need to extinguish it any time it happens! Don't even let yourself be late one more time again, always be early!

Ask for help.",How to Adjust when Things Don't Go to Plan," Take a moment to breathe and calm yourself. We all experience roadblocks in life, and things don't always go according to plan. Avoid being hard on yourself or others. Getting upset will like not make the situation any easier. Take a step back for a moment.Consider getting some distance from the situation for 30 minutes, 1 hour, or a day. Take a walk. Get a drink of water. Distract yourself with something positive.
Try using some self-soothing activities to help you calm down, such as listening to your favorite album, reading a book, or engaging with a favorite hobby, such as knitting, playing guitar, or baking.
Come back to the situation when you're able to be patient and calm.;
, Once you have calmed down, you can begin to address the disappointment. The first thing you will need to do is to acknowledge that you are feeling disappointed.


Try saying something like, “I am disappointed that this did not go my way.”
You can also try writing about the disappointment. What did not go your way? Why is it upsetting you? How can you move forward from this disappointment?

, Think about the situation from an objective standpoint. Avoid blaming yourself or others. Try to clearly see what happened.


Your judgment may be clouded by negative emotions or stress. Instead listen to others that have a more objective view. Take a neutral approach.
Your assessment should be based on the pros and cons of the situation. Evaluate both the good and the bad. Consider writing down the pros and cons of the event.

, Some things are simply out of our control. For example, if you made plans to travel for the weekend, and a storm hits, things may not go as planned. There are forces outside of yourself that influence and shape outcomes.Avoid dwelling on things that you can't change, and focus on what you can.
Think about how you can be a solution to a problem.

, Adaptation is key when things go awry. It is part of our evolution as people to learn to adapt to our environments. The more flexible you are in your plans the more likely your expectations of what you wanted will be met.Life is not a straight and easy path. It is filled with twists and turns. Each day we are learning how to adapt to our daily lives and challenges.
For example, imagine how you get to school or work. While there may be one specific way you do this, imagine the other possibilities available. Some routes may be easier and shorter, others may be longer or harder. But they still arrive at the same destination.

, Sometimes we get frustrated when things don't go according to plan because they don't meet our expectations. Think about the expectations you had for the situation. Think about if your expectations may have been too strict or rigid.One plan or goal is not a measure of your worth. Just because things didn't work out this time, that doesn't mean they will never work out in the future.
For example, you and your friends wanted to go to a special restaurant, and you find out it's closed. You may be disappointed or upset because you were expecting a nice meal there. Instead of thinking that the only good meal is at this one restaurant, evaluate the other places available.

, Since your original plan hasn't come through, return to your original mission or goal for the situation. You likely had a brainstorming phases about your goals and expectations. Go back to that moment.Talk about your goal again with those involved.
Consider writing down your original goal. Putting the situation in writing, particularly for bigger plans, can help to solidify what your goal is.
Use this goal as a framework to restate and reimagine your alternative plans.

, So your original plan hasn't worked out? Now is the time to think about the other options available. What is your Plan B or Plan C? If you don't have an alternative plan in place, then evaluate other options to consider.Gather information about other options available. Consider writing down the other options available, and making a list of pros and cons.
Reassess the strategies and possible outcomes to your plans. Talk with others involved in the process--friends, family, co-workers. See if they may have additional ideas.
While these alternatives may not be your original plan, one or more of them may turn out as good as the original.

, Take action. Be clear about next steps you're taking. Avoid feeling defeated, as if the original plan was the best or only one available. Approach this next phase feeling positive and hopeful rather than negative.Be confident in your decision once you've evaluated the different options available.

, Having resilience means that you can keep working toward your goals even if things do not go your way. Building this skill takes time and practice, but it can help you to overcome disappointment more easily. To build resilience, you can:Put things into perspective. When something does not go your way, consider if it is something that is worth spending time and energy on. For example, if you had hoped to get a job that you interviewed for and did not get it, then your time and energy might be better spent applying for different jobs. Take a moment to put your situation into perspective to help you build up your resilience.

Maintain good relationships. If you have good relationships, then you will probably feel more secure when something does not go your way. Try to maintain healthy relationships with your friends and family to feel more secure during difficult times.

Challenge unhelpful thoughts. Resilient people can alter their thinking to help themselves stay motivated and to continue working towards their goals. You can do this too by challenging thoughts that are untrue or unhelpful. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I will always fail,” then you can challenge this untrue and unhelpful thought. Try telling yourself something like, “Things might not always go my way, but if I keep working towards my goals then I will achieve them.”

, The past is just that, the past. While you can't take back what has happened, you can use this experience as a helpful tool. Think about how the best and the worst of the situation for you or others you care about. What can you or others learn from this?For example, let's say you're working an important project with a small team. Maybe the project is bigger than expected, and more time consuming than you thought? So the team ends up rushing to complete the project and it seems to you like the project is failing.
This could be an opportunity to understand when to ask for additional help. Maybe you and the team could take a different approach to the project? Maybe the project isn't as bad as it seems because you had too high expectations?
While this is all in hindsight, it's important to see what happens next as a way to grow.

, When something doesn't go the way you'd like, you may feel like you've failed. Avoid seeing yourself with hate, and instead focus on what you are thankful for. Resilience is key to keeping yourself motivated..


Giving up means giving into your own self-doubts.
Reframe your negative thoughts by thinking about the good things that have happened. Even if they are small things.
For example, if you were hoping to get an A on an exam and instead got a C, think about how you can look at the bigger picture. Maybe this is your only C on an exam this semester? Maybe this isn't the only test for the class so you can study harder on the other exams? Maybe the other students all got Cs on the exam too?

, Life is trial and error. Some mistakes are our own, and some are those of others or simply forces beyond our control. Own up to your mistakes, but avoid dwelling in them. When you are honest with yourself, then you can learn to grow and become better.


Mistakes are learning opportunities. They can push you to the invisible boundaries of what's possible and what's not.
When you try new things, it's possible you'll make mistakes. This is part of life. It can make you stronger and more prepared for the next time.
Consider saying to yourself, ""I know that I messed up, but it's not the end of the world"" or ""I can learn from this. I can be better. I can be ready for the next time.""

, There's no shame in asking for input. Talk with people that you trust about what they think about the situation. Get advice from a variety of people.Seeking advice can help you feel less alone with your thoughts or concerns.
People on the outside might have a better vantage point about what's going on.

Understand the value of getting a boring task done well.,
Adjust your mindset.,
Organize the task.,
Divide the job into manageable sections.,
Gather your materials together.,
Listen to music as you work.,
Stay loose.,
Quality check every detail.",How to Get Monotonous Jobs Done Accurately and Quickly," A boring job is a job that still needs to be done. If you do the boring jobs carefully and with an eye to quality, your boss will notice. If your work is shoddy and apathetic, you'd better believe your boss will notice that, too. You're hired to do that boring job so your boss doesn't have to - but if you don't do it right, he or she will have to clean up your mess and that will create tension. Even the most tedious job is important, otherwise, you wouldn't have been hired to do it.;
, Boring jobs are not all bad. Look at it this way: at least you don't have to take the job home with you, or worry about how the company's bills are being paid. You can go to work, do your job, and go home - free of worry or care and knowing that there will be more boring work for you to do tomorrow!

, Let's set up an actual job scenario. The job is to take a whole bunch of blueprints rolled in brown paper, organize and label them so they can be found later. You are given a job name, a reference number, and a job description, and you're told to make a sheet (from a form they have) so the prints can be checked out later on. Until they're checked out, you have to store them, so you will need to tag them with the labels. Let's organize the task:


Alphabetize: Sort the rolls out from A to Z.
Create the sign-out sheet: Write down the name and reference number on the sheet, and figure out how many rolls go with this job. If you get, say, 6 copies of each, and there are 6 rolls, you know that each set is contained in one roll. If you have 12 rolls, noting that on the sheet will tell anyone checking them out later that they need two rolls to make one complete set.

Make the labels: Neatly copy the information from the sign-out sheet. And here's a tip: Let's say each set of blueprints needs two rolls, as stated above. Instead of trying to remember how many labels you just made, count the blanks that you will need first and set them aside. You will need 12 for this example. If you set them aside, you can just copy until you run out. That way, you don't need to stop and recount, wasting time.

, A long, monotonous job goes along much easier if you divvy it up into smaller chunks that you can finish a bit at a time. Not only does this give you the feeling of making progress faster, but it also prevents mistakes or missed details. Once each part of the job is complete, stop and check it over for accuracy before moving on.

, Look over the entire scope of the job you've been given. If dividing it into portions, divide the materials accordingly. Pull everything you will need for each part of the job together as you get to the corresponding part of the job. This includes your tools - have what you need ready. Note: Only have what you need. Don't clutter your workspace with stuff you don't need until later - for example, if you're stuffing envelopes, you don't need stamps right now. Put the stamps aside, out of your way. Stuff the envelopes. Seal the envelopes. Turn them over. Now go and get the stamps. ... Oh, and don't leave clutter from the previous part of the job.


As each part is complete, strike and re-stage; in other words, clear out and put away all tools that are no longer needed, and any surplus materials. Once your work area is clear, gather tools and supplies for the next phase of the job.

, Sometimes, putting on some motivational music can really help ""unfocus"" you from distractions so that you can truly focus on the job at hand. If the music is rhythmic and upbeat, you will work ""to the beat"" - that means, don't use sleepy, plaintive, ambient, or atmospheric stuff; instead, use dance music or energetic pop, or whatever will get you moving.

, Take breaks once per hour or hour and a half. Stand up, stretch, get a glass of water, clear your head. Don't waste a lot of time, just loosen up so you can get back to the task with fresher eyes and an un cramped body.

, Before you consider your job finished, get up, take the aforementioned break, loosen up, and get re-focused and ready to check the final product. If the job is complex or has many fine details, get a co-worker to check it for you before you turn it in. This final check is critical to assuring that even the most tedious of jobs is done with accuracy and care.

Keep all your clocks as correct as you can make them.,
Stabilize your circadian rhythm.,
Every time you think of it, guess to yourself what time it is.,
Whenever you get a chance, check a clock and make note of the time.,
When you start a task with a defined beginning and end (reading a chapter of a book, driving to a friend's house, taking a shower) guess how long it will take you.,
When you start a task that has a specified time frame (like when cooking), set a timer for the upper end of the range given.,
Record your progress in a time sense journal.",How to Develop Your Sense of Time," Remember to check the ones on your computer, car, and cell phone. When you enter a new environment, check any clocks and note whether or not they match yours. While you are training yourself, wear a watch or carry a phone or other clock with you at all times. The more accurate your clocks, the better you'll be able to fine-tune your sense of time.;
, Humans have a natural internal clock that regulates biological processes. If this rhythm is disrupted, not only will you have difficulty judging time, but it can also have negative effects on your health and productivity.To keep your circadian rhythm optimized, develop a routine in which you eat, sleep, and expose yourself to natural light at about the same times each day.

, Check a clock or watch. Make a point of correcting yourself. Think or say to yourself something like ""I thought it was 10:20, but it's actually 10:34. I was 14 minutes slow."" This is your time sense gap.


You can make it a habit to do this every time you encounter a certain landmark or object, such as a stop sign, traffic light or mirror.
You may want to try guessing the time when you awaken, if you do not wake to an alarm.

, Go about your regular life, attempting to guess when it has been one hour. Check a clock on your guess and make note of your time sense gap. As you get better, vary the time intervals you try to guess.

, When you finish, guess how long it actually took you. Check the time. How far off was your initial guess? How far off was your second guess?

, For example, if you're to cook oatmeal for 3-5 minutes, set a timer for 5 minutes. Assign yourself the task of guessing when 3 or 4 minutes have passed. If you make a mistake, the timer will save you from having burnt oatmeal. But with practice, you'll develop a sense for how long to leave the oatmeal cooking, as many chefs learn to do with various dishes they cook often.

, Whenever you observe a time sense gap, write it down. You might notice a pattern, like that you tend to be about 15 minutes slow in the morning, and 30 minutes fast in the afternoon. Or, like most people, time will seem to pass slowly when you're doing something monotonous or boring, and pass quickly when you're keeping busy or having fun. As you continue matching your guesses with reality, your sense of time will noticeably improve.

Keep a to-do list.,
Reward yourself for staying organized.,

Delegate tasks to others, when needed.",How to Be Organized," To keep your space organized, start by focusing on your bedroom. Go through each item in your bedroom and determine if you can get rid of any items you no longer use or need. Reduce clutter in your bedroom and clean it out so you feel more organized and keep only items you use in your bedroom.For example, you may have a bookshelf in your bedroom that is stuffed full of books. Go through your books and put ones you no longer read or need in a box. Try to get rid of any books you honestly do not think you will read again. You can then donate the books in the box to charity so they are out of your room.;
, If you have a home office or a desk, tackle this area and keep it organized. Go through all papers and bills on your desk. Put these items in folders or in a filing cabinet. Get rid of any papers you do not need to keep as hard copies. Put office supplies in drawers or cabinets. Place pens and pencils in a pen holder.








You should also position items that you use often closer to your workspace so they are within reach. For example, if you often use a stapler in your office, keep it in the top drawer of your desk so it’s within reach and you know where it is at all times.

Organize electrical cords in your office by using zip ties to keep cords wrapped. This will prevent them from getting tangled and messy.

, Your kitchen will likely be one of the most used areas in your home. Keep it organized by going through each item and donating any items you no longer use or are broken, such as broken kitchen tools or old utensils. Clear out these items and then assess the items you are keeping.








Place items together in drawers or cupboards, such as all coffee mugs together or all utensils together. Keep your kitchen counters free of items when possible and only leave out items you use often, such as a large cutting board or a kettle.
Some items need layout or ordering rather than just grouping. Frequently used unique items, like spices, should be kept handy and accessible, such as on a spice rack on the counter.
Perishable items, like food, should be consumed on a first-in, first-out basis. Load stacks of perishable items, such as canned food, starting with the oldest first in a cupboard or a pantry.

, Another spot that tends to get messy is your closet, especially if you have a lot of clothing. Organize your closet by going through your clothing and getting rid of any items you no longer wear. Often, if you haven’t worn the item in one year, you can get rid of it. Group items of clothing together, such as all jeans on one shelf or all jackets hung in the same spot in your closet.








Rotate items that are within reach in your closet so you wear different items and get the most out of each item.
Keep all shoes together, preferably on a shoe rack or in labeled bins. This way you can view each pair and know exactly what you have in your closet.

, To maintain your organization, do regular cleanings of your bedroom, your home office, your desk, your kitchen, and your closet. Designate one day a week as cleaning day and do a good clean of these spots. This will ensure you reduce any clutter that accumulates in each area of your home. It will also make it easier for you to maintain the system you have in place in each area to keep them organized.









You can also clean each space periodically throughout the week to maintain them. Do a light dusting of your home once a day. Throw out any papers or bills you don’t need right away, rather than let them clutter up your space.
It is good to clean your place every week. If you place become untidy very quickly, then you can use

, Get a calendar and hang it in a spot where you can look at it everyday, such as in your kitchen, by your bed, or in your home office. You can also put a calendar on your computer desktop or use the Calendar App on your iPhone. Put all important dates in the calendar, such as due dates, appointments, and meetings. Keep it updated regularly to help you organize your time.








Make it habit to check the calendar daily, such as first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night.
Color code items in your calendar by priority. For example, you may highlight important dates in red and less important dates in yellow.
If you are using a Calendar App on your phone, you can set reminders days or a few hours in advance so you don’t forget an important date. You can also use other organizing Apps on your phone like 24me, Quip, and Wanderlust., A day planner is another great way to keep your time organized. It will break down the week by day, allowing you to put in appointments or meeting down for each day. It is especially useful if you have a lot of commitments throughout the day. Write down all of your commitments by hour in the day planner. Check the planner at the start of your day so you know what you have scheduled and can stay organized.








For example, you may write down a meeting in the morning, a phone call with a client in the afternoon, and a deadline in the evening.

, To stay organized, make a to-do list. You may have one list for short term things you have to do and one list for long term things you have to do. Write the to-do list on a whiteboard and keep it somewhere you can see it, such as in your kitchen or your bedroom. Cross out items as you complete them so you feel productive and motivated to tackle more items on the list.








If you’d prefer to keep the to-do list on your computer, make a spreadsheet and use it as a to-do list. Keep the spreadsheet on your desktop so you can look at it and cross off items as you complete them.
For example, you may have a list of short term to-do items like complete assignment for tomorrow, clean room, and order supplies for the week. You can then keep a list of long term to-do items like apply for college in one month, learn Arabic, and plan a trip.

, To help motivate you to stay organized, use a rewards system. You may treat yourself to a baked good or lunch at your favorite restaurant when you check an item off your to-do list. Or you may give yourself a five minute break and go for a walk if you complete the items in your calendar or day planner early.








You can also reward yourself with fun activities or relaxing activities, such as playing your favorite video game or watching your favorite show. Only give yourself these rewards when you have completed the necessary tasks for the day.

, To stay organized while you work, create a daily schedule of tasks. List each task by importance and check them off as you complete them. Put the most important tasks first, followed by the least important. Doing this can help you feel organized on a daily basis, whether you are at work or at school.








For example, you may list tasks like completing an assignment or preparing lunch for your children first. Then, you may schedule in time to read emails or catch up on the news, followed by other tasks in the afternoon and evening.

, Though it is important that you get all of the necessary tasks done, you should also set aside time for short breaks. You may schedule in five minute breaks after every few tasks so you can stretch your legs, go for a short walk, or do a few light exercises. You may also use the breaks to get coffee or a snack.








Having breaks will ensure you do not get too worn out or overworked, especially if you have a lot of tasks to complete for the day. If you are really busy, try to schedule at least one break in the day so you are not working too many hours straight.

, Another way you can work in a more organized way is to multitask, where you switch between several tasks at once. Multitasking can allow you to get multiple things done within a short period of time. It can also help you be more organized, as you will feel less overwhelmed or stressed about the things you need to get done if you complete them all at once.








For example, you may put the kettle on for your tea and fold towels, send emails, and load the washing machine while the water boils. Or you may set a download on your computer at work and do paperwork or other tasks in the office while you wait for the download to finish.
Just keep in mind that some studies have shown that multitasking may diminish one's ability to focus on one thing at a time.

, If you have a lot to get done, try to delegate tasks to others when you can. You may delegate tasks to workers in your office or to other family members in your home. Delegating tasks can make your day run more efficiently and allow you to stay organized.









For example, you may delegate chores in your home to your children or your family members so you are not the only one cleaning and maintaining the house. Or you may delegate tasks to coworkers who have free time or an hour to spare so you can ensure all your tasks get done for the day.

Live a creative lifestyle.,
Involve creativity in your everyday life.

,
Learn to think open-minded.,
Add your own personal touch.,
Create your own items.,
Take opportunities to be creative.,
Expose yourself to creative forms!,
Learn how to apply it.

,
Write your thoughts on a pad.,
Hang around creative influences.,
Don't let criticism discourage you.,
Know about colors and their effect.",How to Think Creatively,";
,, Whenever you receive an assignment or task, don't underestimate yourself! Brainstorm. Think and write down the first things that come to your mind. You may find some interesting things. Foster those ideas. Don't just write them off as silly, stupid, or irrational. Think, ""Could I actually do this?"". If the answer is yes, go for it. You never know what can come out of a simple idea.

, Everything you do should be in your own way. If you're going to a meeting, you probably don't want to overdo it and wear bright, distracting colors. However, you could add an extra accessory to your outfit to make it less dull. You shouldn't be afraid to try new things.

, Things not bought in stores are very creative and noticeable. People stop and think ""Where did she get that?"", or ""Wow that looks cool! I've never seen that before!"" There are also plenty of DIY websites. Find one that looks interesting, and try it out! You can even put your own spin on things.

, It will sharpen your skills so you're creative when you're not even trying to be. If you're given a PowerPoint project make your graph look cool and add some funky symbols!

, Cultivate an appreciation for art, listen to music, and read! All of those things involve some measure of creativity to make them. Look at surrealism in art, listen to non-mainstream bands, or read fantasy books. All of the above will fuel your mind with mystical ideas and force it to begin to think of things in other ways.

,, When you look at it at the end of the day you will be surprised at just how much you have thought. And use these ideas! Don't hush them just because they seem stupid! The man who said ""I think it would be cool if people rode around in big metal tins fueled by oil that were on wheels."" probably sounded crazy to his friends but now just about every American owns a car! If you find something cool in your ideas, work on it. Do it start to finish!

, You will get a lot of exposure and ideas will float around. In the end you will have shaped and molded the raw idea until it is a masterpiece ready for showing to the world.

, Criticism is a great way to learn and improve. However, don't let it make you think you're not worth doing what you love. There are many critics that will bluntly tell you that you're not good at something. And then again, many may praise you a bit too much. Either way, keep that head held high! You can still achieve your goals. Remember, critics are people too with many, many flaws.

, Certain colors inspire certain emotions; learn to use them! For example:


Black – authority, discipline, strength and promoting independence.
Blue – cool, calming, relaxing, and promotes feelings of tranquility and peace.
Green – balance, refreshing, normalizing, and promotes emotional growth.
Orange – cheerful, commanding, and stimulates goodwill, conversation and appetites.
Pink – calming, accepting, and encourages affection and socialization.
Purple – comforting, spiritual, and generates mystery and a good sense of intuition.
Red – empowerment, stimulation, drama, competition and passion.
White – purification, energy, unity, and gives vigor to other colors it is used in combination with.
Yellow – cheerful, expanding, and increases energy.

Find out if you've already been evaluated.,
Tap into your resources.,
Take the test.",How to Test Your IQ1," It's very possible that at some point in your life, you were tested. The numbers aren't necessarily given to you if it was part of peripheral research into your psyche. There are a number of times it may have been given to you:


If you enlisted in the army, you're often given an IQ test to see what you can handle and are capable of. If this could be you, contact your higher-ups to gain the results.
If you had experience with depression or other psychological issues, your psychiatrist may have given you the test. This is especially common if medications are part of your regimen.
If you were noted as ""gifted"" in school, you may have been given an IQ test. If it was when you were a child and you are an adult, you'll have to take it again; the test for children is different.;
, If you haven't taken it before, seek out all the available resources. It can be as free or as expensive as you'd like it to be. Know however, that free testing online is not accurate. A psychologist does testing that can't be done online.


A local counseling center may be able to test you. Grab your phone book or search the online yellow pages for a center in your area.
A psychologist can offer you the test. This is the better alternative, both for accuracy and money-wise. If you're testing because of a medical reason, like maybe you had a really bad concussion your insurance will cover the fees.
There are a plethora of online tests available. However, this is mainly for fun. This is not a legitimate way to fully test for IQ.

, There are actually a number of variations; you'll want to consult an expert or do some thorough research to find out which one appeals most to you. Each test could give slightly different results as there is a standard deviation.


For adults, common options are Raven's Progressive Matrices, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Stanford-Binet, and the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Adult evaluation can be obtained starting at age 17. Your IQ at that age will not change much over the years. It measures potential rather than actual education.All tests will measure your spatial, mathematical, vocabulary, analytical skills, problem solving skills, and short term memory. This is how they get their feel for a ""general"" intellect.These tests are regarded as having high statistical reliability. That is to say, your true IQ is 95% likely to lie 3 points above or below the score you are given due to accepted deviation. Clinical psychologists generally regard them as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes."
"
Know what your number means.,
Take another test if you took your test on-line.",How to Test Your IQ2," The average person's IQ is 100. On most tests, a score between 85 and 115, with the median deviation, indicates average intelligence. Even though humans have shown a pattern of rising 3 IQ points per decade, the scale is set so that the average is 100.However, this is not a percentile and certain factors should be known.


Standard deviation is normally 15 points. 95% of the population lies with two SDs of the average, meaning that the vast, vast majority of people have an IQ between 70 and 130 always assuming SD=15 (think of your standard bell curve). 98% of people lie below 131.IQ scales are not just a number -- they are ordinarily scaled. Therefore, an IQ of 50 is not half as much as an IQ of 100. These numbers are representative of cognitive ability -- cognitive ability is not linear.Parents' IQ scores are often within 10 points of their children's. And there are other factors, too, like social status and environment., If you are tested professionally twice, your number will be close, and your true IQ is somewhere between the two numbers. If you were particularly tired or frustrated, you may want to take it again.


Your IQ will vary from time to time, test to test, but only +- 1 SD. All the tests place you on a very similar level, much like scale you use to weigh yourself. Though weight scales may vary from scale to scale, you'll get a pretty good idea no matter which one you use (especially if it's been endorsed by a group of scientists).

"
"
Prepare ahead of time.,
Know your audience.,
Remain calm.,
Ask questions.,
Mirror the other person.,
Don’t assume you know what the other person’s arguments are.,
Distract your opponent from their position.",How to Outsmart People1," If you know that Grandpa Joe always likes to get on your case about ""kids these days"" make sure that you attend the family reunion with a pocketful of facts about the good your generation is doing, the hardships your generation faces compared to his, and so on.You can't always count on being fully prepared for an argument ahead of time, but there are some things you can do to make it more likely that you come out on top in an on-the-spot argument.
If there are certain subjects that are important to you make sure you know as much about them as possible. This way, even if you're not prepared for a specific argument, should one arise, you'll have the facts to back up your side of things.
Make sure that you understand how to set up a compelling argument (see the section about making your case). You want to avoid falling into certain argument fallacies.;
, Your argument is going to be different based on the people who are participating in the argument and the people who are listening to it. The fewer people to deal with, the easier you'll have it, because you won't have to try to figure in so many different argument types.


For example: to go back to your Grandpa Joe, you wouldn't want to engage in a loud and angry argument with him in front of all your relatives. This will make him less likely to back down no matter how asinine his side of the argument is. Instead, you might talk to him in a more private setting without all the family members around watching you.

, The person who loses their temper or their hold on their emotions first is the person who loses the argument. It doesn't matter how good your facts are, because you're out of control and more likely to make a mistake.Take deep breaths when you feel your temper or emotions rising.
This is also why it's important to listen carefully when the other person is talking. If you can focus on what they're saying and take a moment to consider your rebuttal, you're less likely to respond with an immediate knee-jerk emotional reaction.

, This was a favorite tactic of philosophers like Socrates. Asking questions does a number of sneaky things in an argument: it allows you to remain in control of an argument (because you're directing where it goes and keeping the pressure on the other person's argument), and it exposes any discrepancies or weaknesses in your opponent's argument.Ask for proof, or for sources to support the claims that they make. For example: if you're in an argument with someone about the debacle in Gaza, and they make all sorts of wild claims, ask them to back up those claims with proof and sources.

, You want to create a sort of camaraderie between yourself and the other person, or persons. This will help them lower their guard, because they will feel more comfortable and less attacked, but it will make them more open to listening to you.Try to subtly mimic their speech patterns. You're not doing this because you want to make fun of them for how they talk, but because you want to connect with them on the same level. So, for example, when you're talking with Grandpa Joe it's better to fall into the ""good-ole-boy"" speech patterns than your super academic, ""lots of big obnoxious words"" speech pattern.
You should also try to subtly mirror their body language. Make sure that you are a slower, imperfect mirror. Follow too closely and your opponent will catch on. For example, if Grandpa Joe puts on leg over the other and leans forward, wait a couple seconds, and then do the same.

, Assuming you know what your opponent is going to argue is a surefire way to be caught without an effective counter-argument. Prepare as much as you can based on what you think your opponent might argue, but leave room for surprises.


Make sure that you're listening closely to what the other person is saying. If you miss something or are distracted ask them to repeat what they said.

, If you can off-balance your opponent, then it almost doesn't matter whether their argument makes more sense than yours. Always act with confidence in your argument.


Throw in a punchy one-liner: ""You're being defensive"" or ""That is beside the point"" or ""What are your parameters?"" These types of phrases are sure to irritate people and can have the added benefit of actually making them defensive, even if they weren't previously.
You want to be careful with this step, because you don't want this to turn into attacks on the other person's character (which is called an ad hominem attack and should be avoided).
Focus on only a few of their arguments, especially ones that you know you can defeat. Confidently assume that you've won once you've defeated those ones.

A license agreement is when the inventor (licensor) agrees to let a third party (licensee) commercially use his invention for a period of time.",How to Manufacture an Invention1," Typically, the inventor would receive either an ongoing payment called a “royalty”, (calculated as a percentage of sales of the invention) or a one-time lump-sum payment. The company/licensee normally proceeds with developing, manufacturing and marketing the invention, which allows the inventor to shift these cost and risks to the licensee. Also with licensing, the inventor can rely on the company’s experience and established business to boost the product’s chance of success.;

The first thing you need to do is realize that inspiration is art.,

Research the different types of art there are.,

Figure out your ""niche"" in art.,

Go to art shows, museums, or even just the art rooms at your school and look at all the art that people create.,

Realize that art is not relegated only to plastic arts (art in which material is used to create a tangible thing).",How to Increase Your Artistic Abilities," So, get inspired! Take note of things and people around you that inspire you or make you think deeply. Use these things and people as inspiration for your art.
, There is an exhaustive list of things that are considered art, some mainstream, most not. Try your hand at any of them that you are interested in., You could be multi-talented, and with practice anyone can become great at what they do. A lot of the time though, someone will have a ""niche,"" one specific way of creating art that they're good with and tend to stick with. For some it's drawing, for some it's painting, for some it's sculpture, for some it's photography. Some of us do more modern takes on art like collage or even graffiti. You can figure out your niche by experimenting with different areas of art that you're interested in and finding out which ones you're naturally talented with., Other art may inspire you, but the main point of this exercise is to get an idea of just how vast of an area the simple word ""art"" covers., Art can also mean the performing arts - music, dance, theatre, etc. Art can even mean cooking, as in culinary arts! Technology is your friend. If you find you have some abilities with graphic design, that can be your art. As I said, art can be just about anything, as long as it means something. Experiment with them ALL!

You can make art out of just about anything. You don't have to spend a lot of money to create good art. A pencil and a sheet of paper can yield a fantastic poem, story, or drawing. A cheap set of watercolors and a cheap watercolor pad can make a beautiful painting. Opening up your mouth and singing something a cappella can lead to a wonderful song. Buy a can of spray paint and try your hand at graffiti. Print pictures off of the Internet, cut pictures out of magazines, and get a stick of glue and a piece of cardboard and try making a collage. Grab your digital camera and snap some pictures, it may lead to a great piece of photography. Do anything, as long as you are giving it some sort of meaning.
The most important thing to realize when you're trying to be artistic is that art is making something tangible out of the intangible, and it is not always easy. You're trying to take yourself, your own feelings, another person, their feelings, etc., and create something that can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, tasted - something that can be experienced on a whole other level.

"
Use logos in your argument.,
Employ ethos.,
Have at least some emotional appeal.,
Stick to only a few, strong points.,
Avoid ad hominem attacks in your arguments.,
Avoid making hasty generalizations.",How to Outsmart People2," This is the type of argument that appeals to and rests on logic and reason. It tends to have facts and sources to back it up and tends also to be made up of inductive and deductive reasoning.Inductive means that it takes a specific representation of a case or facts and then draws conclusions based on those facts. You have to base this type of reasoning on a fair amount of reliable and supported evidence.
Deductive reasoning tends to begin with a generalization or conclusion and then applies it to a specific case. You have to base your generalization on a lot of reliable evidence, however. Twisting facts to support a hasty claim is not going to help you.

, This is the ethical appeal that tends to be based on character, credibility, or reliability of the source or the person. Ways to establish credibility or to check for the credibility of your sources include:


Double-check and triple-check the sources with other sources to make sure that the argument is supported by multiple claims.
Make sure that the author or yourself are using actual, factually-backed claims, rather than information that is backed only by non-authorities, and so on.
Make sure that you understand your position and the position of your sources. These should be clear and obvious from the start.

, This is called ""pathos"" and it tends to appeal to an audience or opponent's needs, values, and emotional sensibilities. There is a place for emotion in an argument as long as that isn't what you're basing your argument on.


It's particularly useful to use emotional appeals to make a persuasive argument. For example: if you're arguing about the situation in Gaza you might pair facts about the Palestinian death toll with an emotional description of an individual's story.
Don't base your argument on emotional appeal and only use if it really supports the claim you're making. You don't want to use emotional appeal to distract from the actual issue of the argument or debate.

, If you have too many points it will be difficult for you to keep track of them all. You want to have a few points that you feel are incredibly strong and that you have sources to back them up.

, An ad hominem attack is when you attack someone based on their appearance or their character, rather than on their opinion. While this can anger someone to the point that they lose track of their argument, it's going to make you look bad.These types of attacks are also more likely to make your opponent less likely to hear your side of the argument.
If the other person attacks you in this way, call their attention to what they're doing and let them know that your appearance or character has nothing to do with the argument at hand. If they have to resort to these types of attacks, then their argument must not be very good.

, This is when you draw a conclusion that is based on very little, faulty, or biased information. This is what happens when you rush to a conclusion, or into an argument, without gathering all your facts and considering all sides beforehand.


If someone does this to you, probe them on it. Ask questions. Have them cite their sources, where they got their information and so on.

"
"
Pick the right time.,
Soften them up.,
Give them a reason why something benefits them.,
Meet them halfway.,
Tell an obvious lie to hide a non-obvious lie.",How to Outsmart People3," There is no way, unfortunately, to outsmart an authority figure like a parent or a teacher every single time. There are, however, times when they'll be more susceptible to persuasion.


If you're trying to wheedle something out of a parent when they've just gotten home from a difficult day at the office you are not going to have luck getting them to agree to something. In fact, you may make it so that you'll never actually get that thing.
Likewise, asking your teacher for an extension on that project you didn't complete in front of the rest of your classmates is going to make them less likely to give it to you than if you discussed it with them privately.

, There are very few people who aren't susceptible to a little bit of flattery or appreciation. It's important that you don't only do this when you want something, however, otherwise they'll be able to see through your machinations.


Thank them for something. For example: if you're trying to convince your mom to buy you a new phone, say something like ""Mom, I really appreciate how hard you work at your job.""
Compliment them in a way that isn't terribly obvious, or directly related to what you're trying to get them to do. Say something like ""Ms. Harding, you're my favorite teacher, because you're always willing to go the extra mile and help me out.""

, People are so much more likely to help you do something or give you something if it also benefits them. Authority figures are just as likely to fall for that as anyone else.


For example: if you're trying to get a new phone, you might say something like ""mom, I really want to make sure that you can reach me anytime you need to.""

, If you demonstrate that you're mature enough to meet your authority figure halfway on something, you're much more likely to get something from them. It's good to prepare ahead of time so that you know exactly what you're going to offer them in return.


For example, you might tell your mom that you have saved up half of what it would cost to get a new phone, and that you were wondering if you could split the cost with her.

, This is slightly different than the steps above, but if you need to lie about something, then a fantastic way to cover up a misdeed is to tell a really obvious lie at the same time as a less-obvious lie. People will focus on the obvious lie and the non-obvious lie will be more likely to go unnoticed.


Make yourself seem like a really bad liar. Tell some really obvious lies with all the signs of a liar (not meeting anyone's gaze, giggling nervously, acting really nervous, etc.).
It's also better if the lie you're hiding is less a total lie than a half-truth. It's easier to lie by omission or with a lie that has it's basis in truth.

Make a “to do” list before taking action.,
Stick to high priority items first.,
Avoid taking on too much yourself.,
Avoid saying ""yes"" when you shouldn't.",How to Avoid Common Time Management Mistakes1," You may want to just start working, thinking that making a list will slow you down. However, lists are key for most people when they have a lot to get done. Make a list and create a system to know what each item’s level of priority is. Some people use a “A – F” system similar to a school grading system. Choose a system that will work for you.Your system may want to include the amount of time you think each task will take. For example, if one item will take half an hour but another will take several months, there should be a way to notate that on the list. Break down the big, long-term tasks into steps and make lists for the coming days/weeks.;
, Don't get off-track by doing easy things first, or things that are more appealing first. There is a difference between importance and urgency. Most people who are great at time management are able to make this distinction and act accordingly. When you do things based on a sense of urgency, you allow your time to be controlled by the needs of others rather than by your own needs. Instead, assess how important a given task is, based on your personal goals.Remember that the carelessness of others does not constitute an emergency on your part. They will need to learn to stay on top of their own responsibilities.
Urgency is sometimes used as an excuse to put off doing something that’s more important but also more difficult.
If you see yourself prioritizing something unimportant, ask yourself if the current task is bringing you closer to your actual goal and vision.

, Don’t get bogged down by trying to do every single thing yourself. Find aspects of a project or task that you can outsource or delegate to coworkers or employees whom you trust. The more you delegate, the more time you’ll have for other things.Delegate tasks that can easily be done without your involvement. Think about what your skills and gifts are and how they’re best used. For example, can you send someone else out to pick up the copies while you do the skilled work of editing the presentation?
If you have a hard time letting go, create systems so that you can maintain oversight. For example, make sure you’re cc’ed on emails or have a weekly meeting to check in on work that was done in your absence.

, It’s great to challenge yourself and to take on things that feel like healthy stretches. However, many people say yes to things when they don’t actually have the capacity to complete them to the best of their ability. Learn to say no when you need to.Also, if able, learn to say no to things you don't like. Being passionate about your responsibilities makes you more likely to get them done, and done on time and well.

Setting boundaries is important because it shows others that you can’t simply become their safety net when they’ve taken on too much themselves.
If you fail to set boundaries, others will likely keep piling work onto you, which will make keeping on top of time management even more difficult.

When the inventor assigns his rights, he is permanently transferring or selling ownership in the invention/patent.",How to Manufacture an Invention2," The inventor may receive a lump sum payment or a series of payments. The difference between a “license” and “assignment” is in the transfer of rights. With a license, the inventor can retain patent rights (like “renting” the patent), and with an assignment they transfer their rights (i.e., sell it).

"
"
Typically, entrepreneurs with aspirations of turning their inventions into a business where they would sell their product would be the best candidates for manufacturing.,
If you choose the path of developing and manufacturing your invention on your own, you maintain far more control of your invention.,
For some inventions, little development and setup is required, which can simplify the manufacturing process.",How to Manufacture an Invention3," Manufacturing and marketing an invention can be an exciting and rewarding approach for some inventors but the process should be looked at more as a business venture, as it requires the inventor to have substantial capital and a well thought out plan on how to develop, manufacture and market their idea. Manufacturing is very different than finding a company to license the invention, and should not be jumped into without examining the risks and carefully planning the best route for success.

, But you also assume the various risks and costs associated, such as: research, engineering, tooling, molds, inventory, warehousing, freight expense, distribution, etc. You also assume the investment of your own time, which for many inventors who hold full-time jobs, is difficult.

, Other, more complex inventions may require far more investment. Minimum order requirements can also present inventors with a challenge, both financially and in terms of storage space. For the inventor who finds these aspects of manufacturing to be too costly, too difficult or too much of a hassle, seeking a licensing agreement could be a more suitable solution.

Try not to lose track of time.,
Learn how much time things take.,
Avoid multitasking.",How to Avoid Common Time Management Mistakes2," A very common mistake is losing track of time. Your time is valuable. You want to know where it goes so that you can spend it more wisely. Once you know the ways that your time is spent, you may be surprised to see what you can afford to cut from your day and how much extra time you can make for yourself.Keep a large clock visible, unless this causes you significant anxiety. Visual prompts can be very effective. Also, are you more likely to look at and respond to a digital or analog clock?
You can use your computer or phone to “clock in” and “clock out” of certain tasks.
Write down the hours and minutes that you spend on a given task. This alone is likely to improve your focus and time management because you’ll be aware that you’re being timed.

, Many people repeatedly fail to plan by not knowing how much time things take. Tracking your time is a great way to learn how much time tasks actually take. You can also look back on past projects and consider whether or not you had enough time to complete things based on the amount of time you’d set aside in the past.People who are considered overachievers are especially likely to underestimate how much time things take.
Always budget in time for breaks. They are key to staying fresh and effective.
Always remember to account for travel time! A lot of people calculate from the time they need to be somewhere, not the time they need to leave for somewhere.
Budget in extra time as a contingency. What if the supplier can’t deliver a rush order? What if a team member is sick and someone has to pick up the slack?

, The results are in: multitasking doesn’t work. Unfortunately, humans are really designed to focus on and complete one task at a time. Don’t think that you’re going to save time by doing multiple things at once.Multitasking will most likely lead to a lack of focus and poor performance all around.
Do not leave your email open or your cell phone out. Alerts from these will derail you. Focus on the task at hand and set aside another time to respond to emails, texts, etc. Set up a system for emergencies that need to get through to you.
If you have a hard time not multitasking, repeat the mantra, “Right now, I’m focusing on___.”

Set goals.,
Don't lose sight of the big picture.,
Avoid distractions.",How to Avoid Common Time Management Mistakes3," Many people start out with a goal, but lose track of their goal sometime in the process. This is a common time management mistake. Having strong personal goals is essential to managing your time well. Goals give you a destination to work toward and help you keep track of your vision. If something isn’t directly in line with your goal, it’s a distraction.You can have goals for the hour, the day, the week, the month, or the year.
Use visual prompts. Have a place where you post that day's goal and see it frequently to help keep you on track throughout the day.
Write down long term goals, too. These can be goals of where you’d like to be in five or ten years. Check in periodically to see if what you’re doing is helping drive you toward those goals.

, The big picture is the larger set of visions and goals. It will help you keep perspective so that you don’t get bogged down in details or distractions.Sometimes perfectionism is important and sometimes it’s not. Look at the big picture to help you determine whether “good enough” is alright for a given task or whether you should be focusing on minutia at any given moment.
Check in with others if you see yourself losing perspective.

, Get rid of clutter around your desk or workplace. Cleanup your computer’s desktop. Do what you can to create a focused, harmonious workplace. This may mean turning off your phone or email alerts during designated work times.Don’t check personal email or social media sites when you’re working.
Throw garbage away immediately, shred old documents when they’re no longer used, and file past projects out of sight.
Turn off music or other background sounds to help you stay focused.

For example, being able to read emotions very accurately is a very useful talent.;
, As you reflect on yourself in search of your talents, start by looking at your past. Look at the things that you've done. Look at the things you've enjoyed. Look at the times when you really excelled. Ask yourself questions like ""What am I most proud of that I've done?"" or ""When was I so proud that I didn't care what anyone thought?""


One good thing to think about was what your childhood was like. What did you do a lot as a kid? What did you enjoy? What were you known for? Sometimes this can reveal some of our deepest talents and certainly will reveal interests that can be probed further.Think about your hobbies as your personality is made by them they are the things you do regularly and your hidden talent is that which you can do better than everyone so focus on your hobbies and how you do them every single step.
Another thing you can think about are the times in your life that you've been challenged. Think about the tough situations that you've had to deal with. Times of trial can often reveal our hidden skills. For example, when your dad had a heart attack, maybe you kept your head and called 911. Staying alert and calm in an emergency is a really useful talent.

, The things that make you happy can also reveal your talents. Think about the things that you love to do. Do people ever give you compliments on it? Do they ever ask for your help with it? You might not think of it as a talent but it probably is.


Do you ever completely lose track of time? You start doing something and you just don't even notice time passing? This might hint at your talent.For example, maybe you get lost when you're modding your favorite video game. This might be one of your talents.
Listen to how you talk. Do you ever find yourself rambling to your family or your best friend about this subject that means so much to you? This might be another hint at a talent you have.

, Now, there's a big difference between what you enjoy and what you're good at. You might think of your talents only being things that you love doing, but it's important to remember that our talents are often things we don't enjoy or things we don't even think about. This is why it's important to take a long hard look at what you're actually good at.


Think about things that come naturally to you. Things you don't struggle with. Do you ever find yourself telling someone, ""Nevermind, it's easier if I do it"" or ""Here, let me help you with that""? Do you find yourself correcting people? These behaviors usually indicate something that you're good at and know a lot about.

, Look back on your life and think about times where you really succeeded, times where you felt about to burst with the pride of your success. This can indicate a talent you possess.


For example, maybe you helped your boss rearrange and reorganize his office and helped things at your work run so much more smoothly. Organization is a very useful talent.

, This exercise can help you reveal not only the talents that you have but also talents that you should consider developing. Write about what you were like as a kid, what you liked to do before and after school, what your favorite subjects were. Write about growing up. Write about where you're at in your life now. Now, write about your future. Write about where you want to go. Write about what you want people to say at your funeral.


This exercise reveals your priorities and what you really think is important about yourself.
It can also reveal what you want for your life, helping you focus on talents you should cultivate if you want to achieve your dreams.

, Having an outside perspective, other people may find it easier to see what you're good at. Ask around and people will usually be happy to tell you what they see as your strengths. Be sure to talk to people that know you well but also people that barely know you. Both will see you in different ways and the differences that they see can tell you even more about yourself.

, Your life needs to have room for discovering your talents! If you spend all day on the couch after school or work or you spend all of your waking weekend hours at parties, then you're going to have very little time for self discovery. Your talents will often lie in activities that you've not tried yet and if you don't make time for those things, then you'll never expand beyond what you are now.


Think about how you spend your time right now. Consider your priorities and then find things that you can cut to make more time for new experiences.

, While other people can help you find your talents, it's also important to take some time that's just for you. Self discovery does require a lot of self reflection and if you're spending all of your time watching movies with your friends, you probably won't get the time you need to really understand yourself. Take some quiet days that are just for you and spend them doing new activities.

, You probably already have some basic skills. Any skill that you possess can be turned into a real talent, but you need to take the time to develop it and really work on experiencing all of the different activities that go in to that talent. You might have experienced only a small aspect of a possible talent and you will need to experience much more if you really want to cultivate it.


For example, let's say that you're pretty good at interior design. You certainly made your room looks pretty nice. Well, try developing that skill into a full talent. Study up on interior design, mess around with computer programs for interior design, and cultivate an awesome Pinterest. By investing in this skill and exploring it further, you can develop your minor skill into a talent.

, Sometimes we tell ourselves that we can't do things. Maybe we think we're not good enough or not smart enough. Most often we see ourselves as ""not that kind of person"". But the thing is that you don't know you're that kind of person until you start becoming that person. You have to give life a chance to surprise you. You're much more incredible and interesting than you give yourself credit for. Take a risk and try something totally different than anything you've ever tried before.


For example, try rock climbing. Try scuba diving. Write a book. Start a business. These kinds of things take work but for many, they are at the very essence of who they are.
It's a good idea to try to factor in things you already know you can do well. For example, you know that you like hanging out with little kids. From this you can say that you probably have a fun, easy-going nature. This means you might excel at work with animals, which is similar and requires some of the same underlying traits.

, If there's a subject that interests you and you think you might want to develop it into a talent, consider taking a class. Getting more information and finding out what the experience would really be like can tell you if it's really something you could have a talent for. It also will help you get the basic skills needed to start developing your talent if you decide it's something that you want to do.


You can take online classes for free from websites like Coursera and University of the the People, if you don't have access to education resources. If you do have money and time to devote to a class though, try your local community and technical colleges, as well as your local community center.

, Traveling is one of the most impactful experiences you can have. It will challenge you and teach you more about yourself than you thought possible. However, you can't just take the easy route and go on a cruise or guided trip. Go on your own. Go somewhere different from anywhere you've ever been. Immerse yourself in the experience. Try new things. You'll find yourself struggling in some areas but you'll also find that there are other activities that you can do with ease or that make you really happy.


Traveling can seem expensive but it really depends on where you go, when, and what you do. It doesn't have to be an expensive experience. You can also travel a little more close to home and get the same sort of benefits. For example, if you're from the US, try going out into the Canadian countryside or a backpacking trip in Mexico.

, When we have to struggle, when we're removed from our usual comfortable environment, is when we learn the most about ourselves. When you shut yourself off to challenges by just sticking to a quiet life and never leaving the house, or even backing out when times get tough or running from your problems, you deny yourself the chance to shine. Let challenges happen, try to tackle your problems, and get out and live life a bit more so that you have the chance to conquer challenges that you encounter.


For example, your grandma might get sick and need help. Try helping her out. You might find that you're really good at connecting with and helping the elderly.

, In experiencing just your own life and your own world, it's easy to have your mind closed to the possibilities: the possibilities of what you are and the possibilities of what you could be. When you help others in significant and impactful ways, you'll find that you see yourself in a new light. Your priorities will change. You might even get the chance to shine in a talent you didn't even know you had, or build a new talent through the work you do.


For example, local parks departments often need help removing invasive plants or in building new structures like playgrounds. You can volunteer and you might find that you're good at identifying plants, woodworking, reading building plans, or organizing or motivating people.

Understand the basics of the mind.,
Understand what your subconscious mind does.,
Know that your mind is flexible.,
Keep yourself occupied and avoid boredom.,
Understand the law of belief.,
Overcome the cognitive biases: Although our mind is very powerful yet like other things, it has many limitations.,
Listen to your intuition.,
Use day dreaming and fantasy.,
Be aware and pay attention.,
Keep the promises you've made to yourself.,
Overcome your fears.,
Think positively.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Expand Your Mind1," It is important to know that your brain and mind are not the same thing. The brain is the physical structure in your head; the mind is a more abstract concept that produces and stores thoughts and feelings. Though separate, the brain and mind are always at work together. When you have positive thoughts, like love, creativity, and joy, your mind remains in a peaceful state. When you have negative thoughts like fear, jealousy, hate, and anger, your mind is disturbed by them. In a disturbed state of mind there is a wastage of energy and we are not usually able to relax.


Understand that positive thoughts generate positive feelings and negative thoughts generate bad feelings. Both positive and negative thoughts are additive. Having many negative thoughts throughout the day will pile up and make you sad; a great amount of negative thoughts can even lead to depression. The opposite is also true. If you have many positive thoughts and feelings, they will add up to make you feel incredible bliss. So for allowing the growth of the mind, you must try to keep the mind in its default stage i.e. peaceful stage. If your mind is in a relaxed and calm state, only then you are able to attain your full potential.
Another rule is that your brain processes information as per your current mood. For example if you are in a good mood , it will be easy for your brain to retrieve positive information (and hence you feel nice and the world looks wonderful to you.) On the other hand if your mood is bad then your brain finds it difficult to process positive information or memories and hence you feel bad. So it is always better to switch your mood rather than go along the negative thought process.;
, Our subconscious mind works behind our conscious mind and is really powerful. Its has many supernatural powers, you won't generally believe but indeed they do exist. If you want your subconscious mind to work for you then you must trust in its power. Our subconscious can be considered as a spirit or God inside us that has all the powers and knowledge which we require at any moment of life. It contains information about our personality which we aren't usually aware of. It also contains a person's belief system which decides how a person will respond in particular situations. The very same act or occurrence - good, bad or otherwise - can produce completely opposite responses in people, based on our beliefs.


By understanding how your subconscious mind works, you can solve your life problems more effectively.
Although your subconscious mind is all powerful, it works under the master ship of your conscious mind. So you should be careful in what you are believing in and what input you are giving to your mind because ultimately your subconscious mind is going to make it true. It always listens to its master and receives the positive as well as negative input blindly.

, Our mind is able to change its belief system, attention and thinking according to the situation. A flexible mind is open to new ideas , change and can act in the best way. Unlike a rigid mind, a flexible mind analyzes the available options for a given situation and chooses the best among them. Whereas a rigid mind will be limited and confined to its belief system and would get frustrated if things don't go in its favor.


Remember that you often see things the way your mind wants to show you. This happens because of your belief system; when things go against your beliefs, you'll feel uneasy, agitated, or upset. But if you can adjust your belief system, you can find opportunity even in a bad situation.
A number of new neural pathways are created in your brain when you become involved in new tasks and these paths become strengthened when you repeat these tasks. This property of the brain is called Neuroplasticity. It means that the brain can be restructured and hence you can acquire new skills.

, Almost everyone gets bored sometimes; dull or tedious work can aggravate even the hardest of workers. However, an excess of boredom can contribute to depression. When you feel the onset of boredom, take a break to refresh your mind with a hobby, a conversation, exercise, or even some TV. These methods can boost your mood and can help you return to your work again. Remember entertainment is also very essential for the normal growth of your mind. One thing to keep in mind is that boredom isn't related with a particular task you are doing rather it is more related with the state of your mind. So if your mood is low then even an interesting task may look boring to you. On the other hand you may take interest in a comparatively uninteresting task when you feel high in mood! More often it has been observed that if you are able to fully concentrate and engage in your work, it will look you more appealing.


Remember, you can't enjoy life by being lazy all the time. However, resting is different from being lazy. If you really want to enjoy life, here is a secret. Become active to take action around the clock (that means 24 hours a day/7 days a week). It will not make you tired. In fact, there will be a chain of tasks which include things which you like most, recreational activities, and your responsibilities. If you take time daily for recreational activities, it will fill you with tremendous energy so you can do less enjoyable tasks without being tired. But all activities should be in a continuous cycle. One complete task will give you the energy and inspiration for another. For following this style you require a lot of guts and a positive attitude towards what you are doing. It is just like saying to yourself that ""yes I am ready to work and take actions around the clock but I would like to enjoy my life fully and not get bored."" In other words, it is a way to expand your mind and life.
Another way to make your work more interesting is to do it wholeheartedly. Just pour your whole attention into your work and you will feel the difference. By doing this you can embrace your work better and the quality of your work will also be improved. Apart from that, when you switch to another task you will feel a sense of positivity and joy. Another benefit of this method is that your mind will remain free from negative vibes and ideas. Give more time to the work which is more important to you and all the things will be balanced automatically.

, Each one of us has various kinds of beliefs about life and stuff around us. These beliefs are actually established in our mind and soon become our reality. We see the world with the frame of our belief system. Any belief takes time to become strong in our mind. Many internal and external stimuli play an important role in the making of our so called belief system. According to the law of belief ""Our reality differs according to our belief system"". Although beliefs are very helpful in strengthening our will power and confidence, they also limit us to see the partial reality. So we must be flexible in our thinking and should ready to change our belief system whenever necessary. #One should remember that their beliefs are just beliefs and can't be put equivalent to reality or truth.


Beliefs become weak when we experience something contradictory to our existing beliefs. And in a similar manner, they become strong when you find things which support your existing beliefs.

, Many times our mind plays tricks on us, and if we are not attentive enough we will fail to observe the truth. Cognitive biases are the patterns in mind which will make you unable to take right and rational decisions. Because of cognitive biases we tend to think in a certain manner and can be deprived of the real truth. Because of biases, our decisions appear as appealing but they become illogical many times. If we can understand these cognitive biases then they can be overcome with some practice. The best way to overcome the biases of mind is to pay attention to your thoughts , feelings and actions. As the time passes your attention will become sharper and you'll be able to observe even the subtlest biases of your mind. Below there are some common examples of cognitive biases.



Self-serving bias: Because of this bias, we tend take more responsibility for successes than failures.

Confirmation bias: We tend to confirm our preconceptions and knowledge by searching and interpreting things in a way that support our conceptions. And we can ignore or reject the information which doesn't support our own views.

Curse of Knowledge: It indicates the inability of more informed individual to think about the problems from the perspective of lesser informed individuals.

Bias blind spot: People tend to think themselves as less biased than other people. It means that by default we remain blind to our own cognitive biases.

Outcome Bias: In this bias we judge a decision based on its outcome rather than how exactly the decision was made in the moment. Just because you win a lottery doesn't mean that buying a lottery ticket was a smart decision. Here you are deciding the value of decision after you have seen the outcome.

Overconfidence : This is one of the most familiar bias. Under this bias we tend to overestimate our capabilities and skills and as a result we tend to take greater risks in our daily lives. In this bias we feel convinced and confident that we are right irrespective of truth.

, Sometimes when you are sitting idle, not doing anything in particular, some ideas will come to your mind unexpectedly. This is called intuition, and it is different from your regular thought processes. Through intuition, knowledge comes to you directly from unknown dimensions. Intuition tells you things like what you should do and what not to do! Many times it seems illogical to you, but never ignore your inner voice. Listen to it and try to analyse what it could mean. Intuition is a deep voice of yours or it may be considered as the deepest mind. Our intuition gives us the signals about various things going to happen in future. Intuition is considered as the power of our spirit. Everybody has different levels of intuition. Some people are very aware of it and others just don't know about it. But the fact is that it remains with us every time and guides us consciously or unconsciously.

, Daydreaming may seem useless to many, but it's helpful in the long run. You must have heard that ""All great people were great day dreamers"". Everything is possible in imagination and a person can visualize beforehand what he want to be!. You must be thinking that how daydreaming can help in attaining our goals. In-fact by daydreaming you can see and imagine various steps and objectives of your goal and hence make it easy to achieve. More you visualize your goal more are the chances to achieve them. Look at Napoleon for an example; he would imagine a whole battle and then used to rehearsal for it, and this made him an great warrior.


Please note that you love to do things which you fantasize about. So if you fantasize about health and fitness then you will naturally be motivated towards going gym and doing exercises. And it is true with anything. For example if you fantasize to become a writer then most probably you will develop the skills of writing. It is because fantasy is an intense process which has a very deep effect on our subconscious. So this tool of fantasy can be used intentionally for your growth and success.
But make it sure that you don't fantasize about negative things because sooner they can become your reality. For example if you fantasize about getting fight with people ,you will actually find yourself amidst fights with people.
Try to explore what do you want to be in life and how do you want to spend your time?

, Human memory has many flaws in it. We usually forget things and keep on getting distracted from tasks at hand. This involves forgetting on the conscious level. However, there is also forgetting at a very subtle level of the mind. We aren't usually able to fully track and remember our own thoughts, feelings and motives. The more subtle a thought or feeling is, the more difficult it is to recall it. It requires a lot of awareness and attention to track all our thoughts and feelings. If you are able to analyse your own thoughts, feelings and intentions, you can solve most of your problems. In the state of full awareness and attention, all the knowledge and wisdom will be available to you. The more you pay attention, the more wisdom and intelligence you will achieve.

, Many times we make conscious and unconscious promises with ourselves. For example you promise yourself to study better, to be fit, to buy a gift for your parents and many others. So the true problem comes when we don't keep these promises. Because of this we feel disconnected with ourselves and our confidence decreases. On the other hand if you work hard to keep these promises , you establish a strong relationship with your inner being and gives a meaning to your life. You will feel connected and get filled with joy.


Remember the promises can be small or big. Take care of every minute promise which you made to you. And you will experience the wonder.

, Fear can easily stop the expansion of your mind. Everybody has some kind of fear. Some have fear of speaking in public, fear of learning new things, or some other type of fears. While some fear is normal, excess of it can affect the whole personality of a person. To overcome your fears you need to understand them. Most of the time our fears are the indication of any coming danger or threat and they are the psychological warning to make us careful. So it is a better idea to understand your fears rather than fighting with them. Remember that you can't overcome your fears by fighting with them because by fighting, you've already accepted its presence.


Whereas fear can be an obstacle in growth of mind the love, happiness and various other positive emotions leads to the expansion of mind. So make love, your strongest emotion and you will be surprised to see its amazing results.

, Life is uncertain and you may undergo severe problems and sufferings but becoming a positive thinker you can remain happy even in odd situations. The only thing you have to do is: Change your attitude towards life. Every pain and suffering is temporary and you are not going to tolerate it for long time. So be happy and don't deflect from bad situations.


On the other hand if you will think negatively then it can spoil your life. In-fact thinking negatively is one our habit and we can get rid of it by proper training. Life is beautiful in its own way but one must have a positive attitude to see its beauty. Time and events aren't constant, they are changing continuously. So one can't complain that his/her life isn't worth living.

, The modern world is always busy, and sleep is often pushed to the side in favor of work. But sleep is absolutely essential if you want your mind and brain to operate and develop at their best. Adults should get eight hours of sleep and children should get nine to ten; if you sleep less than that, you won't be able to reach your full potential.

For mind it is said that ""mind takes the shape on which it rests"". Once you will train your mind to think or work in a particular way then next time it will be easy for mind to follow that path or way. You can train your mind to think positively or to generate innovative ideas. You can train it to solve various problems in a creative manner. However in starting it can be difficult but with time it becomes habitual. For example you can train your thought process to deal with difficult and dangerous situations by imagining all situations in your mind. By imagining you can learn how to remain calm and strong in odd situations.


Start any task that you like and as you go on, your mind will help you to learn it better. If you will practice learning something regularly then mind gets started becoming smarter in it. Remember there are various hidden powers of mind that you don't even imagine.

, Reading books is a very good habit. Books don't only give knowledge but many times tell you how to live the life. Read as many types of books as you can. Good books often shape the mind in a better way. You can read various self improvement books, philosophy books, psychology books, etc. Reading books can help you to generate your own ideas.


It should be noted that any book can't be read in one time. Whenever you read it again,you will find something new. So never drop the idea of reading a book again if you had already read it.

, Writing is a very effective tool for mental growth. Write whatever you want. write about yourself, your feelings and what is happening in your life.

In actual by writing you make your unconscious trouble conscious and then you can better understand them. Our brain works better when it remains stress free, so work on different ways to make it stress free.


Your ideas, decisions and even your thoughts depend on your belief system. Our belief system is developed by our experiences throughout the life. So give time to yourself for analyzing your belief system. It is because of your belief system , some things hurt you and you feel bad about them. By changing your belief system, you can change the quality of your thoughts and life.

, Asking questions leads to increment in knowledge and understanding. Whether you are a student or a professional, asking questions comes in handy everywhere. It has been seen that the child who are more questioning in nature, grasp more knowledge in comparison to other children.


If you can ask good questions then you can understand the things thoroughly. Questions make your thinking precise and more goal oriented.
Questions aren't always meant to ask from others. Many times we should question ourselves to solve a problem. And this is the way how we can become a critical thinker. Because if you can't ask right questions ,you can't get the desired information.
Questions define what information you are trying to find. And more precise your question more are the chances to get the right information.

, So the real experience can't be gained without the experiments. Experimenting means, you are doing something different that you don't usually do. When you will do something different from your usual routine then you will see different results and hence your mind will gain experience by analyzing the new results.


Don't do risky experiments without any guidance.

There can be no alternative to discipline. If you aren't disciplined then you'll surely waste your energies and can't focus them in the right direction. It is also true for our mind. If we'll not focus our mind in the right direction then it can lose its track and can create problems. Set some objectives and decide which dimensions of mind you want to expand.

You can make your mind to learn how to work under pressure. In beginning we can start with less difficult tasks and slowly we can increase the difficulty level. For example when we give a written exam then we have to write and think various things in give finite time. Its the reason that we are able to write more in exams in comparison to normal times. Because in exams our mind remains under pressure.

Do something you love.,
Find your passion.,
Have patience.,
Be a cool person: If you are cool, it means you are broad minded.,
Talk with your friend or someone you like.,
Struggle.",How to Expand Your Mind3," The mind loves creativity and if you will do the things which you love most there are chances that your mind will grow much rapidly than others. You must have seen children doing non serious tasks. For you these tasks can mean nothing but they are really helpful for the mental growth of children. Do some non serious activities and feel free to have fun with them. This mental growth comes as result of the intensity with which you are involved in your task. For being creative you need not to be a very good poet, singer or writer. What you've to do is the tasks which you enjoy doing. You can write a poem, draw a picture, can dance and it doesn't matter how bad they are!!, the only condition is that you are enjoying doing them.


Some of history's great personalities were in fact the most creative people. For example: Einstein, Pablo Picasso, Beethoven, Michelangelo ,'Leonardo da Vinci ,Vincent Van Gogh, Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison and many others. These people did what they wanted to do and attained great peak of success. Try to find about the life of these people and read their biographies and you will probably find the clue of their success.

Vincent Van Gogh was a very ordinary person and belonged to a poor family. The only interest in his life was to draw the pictures. He used to draw pictures whole day and night. It is the fact that Vincent Van Gogh wasn't able to sell even a single artwork in his lifetime. After many years his artwork was recognized by world. And today his artwork is so expensive that even rich people will not be able to buy it. His paintings are of million dollars worth.
Another great personality was Leonardo Da Vinci who made some of world's greatest art work like the Mona Lisa painting. Even today the scientists and various researchers are trying to find the secret of the smile of Mona Lisa painting. The one of great feature of Mona Lisa painting is that if you look from any of side the woman in painting will seem to gaze and smile at you. Leonardo was also an ordinary child and was very curious about world. It is said about him that he wanted to know everything. He was born in fourteen century but he was very ahead of his time. He was first to gave the idea some of the great discoveries e.g. contact lenses, airplane and many other machines. The main motive of telling about him is that Leonardo had done what he loved to do without taking any formal education in school or colleges.

, Notice and analyse carefully what you love doing most. There must be some activity, art or skill which you are master in. Develop those of your skills and talent. It doesn't matter what other people say and like what matters is that what do you like. It is your life and you will only decide what to do with it. But you need to be firm and disciplined in order to develop your passion. Knowing that you are mortal and you will die one day will help you in finding your purpose and goal in life. According to Steve Jobs- “Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.


Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. -Steve Jobs
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”-Steve Jobs

, Patience plays a very important role in your journey to attain success. Sometimes your speed can be fast and sometimes slow. In both the cases you have to maintain your patience. Many a times things can be out of your control then you have to remain cool and calm. If you take decisions impatiently at that time ,the things can go even worse. You have to understand that nature has its own way and you have to respect it. Take gradual steps and wait for the right time. You will surely attain success with flying colors.

, A person's coolness can be measured by how he handles the embarrassment feelings or situations. There are times when the things doesn't happen as we expected. At those times our coolness can be considered. A cool person takes things casually and don't let the situations overwhelm him. He is the one who will not get distracted even in the worst situations.If you are a cool guy then you know how to ignore small things and take enjoy of every moment. A cool person shows maturity in moments where other people usually got hurt or emotional. He is one who know how to deal with the people of all ages. He may not be so intelligent but he is usually smart in his ways.

, This experience is full of joy and it can also help you to expand your mind. Discussion are also very helpful for getting new ideas and to solve our various problems. While discussing we should be careful not to convert the discussion into futile argument. While discussion can be very helpful, argument will take you nowhere!


In a discussion, we can solve problems by sharing our ideas with others, but in arguments we usually forgot the real purpose and we start focusing on proving ourselves right.

, Many situations will not be favorable for you, and you often won't get what you expected. But don't lose hope! Keep fighting and things are far more likely to turn out your way, and you'll also find that the very process of struggling strengthens and enhances your mind.

Don’t assume that you’re right.,
Accept your mistakes.,
Don’t be afraid of failure.,
Be persistent.,
Think positively.,
Build self-esteem outside of your career.,
View aging positively.",How to Embrace Your Intelligence2," Don’t expect to always be correct, and learn to accept the possibility that you’re wrong. Intelligent people grow accustomed to having accurate judgement and may therefore adapt a know-it-all personality. Realize that being wrong is not a personal attack, and being right is not a necessity.Believing that your logic is perfect is actually a weakness, because it creates “blind spots” in your way of thinking. People who are overconfident in their ability to reason are prone to making more mistakes.
Approach every situation with an open mind. Be honest with yourself that you don’t know it all, so that you can let go of trying to have total control over your thoughts. Even if it feels vulnerable, this actually strengthens you so that you can build experiences and more knowledge., Sometimes intelligent people can be unaware of their own errors because they don’t want to acknowledge that they’re capable of making such mistakes. Don’t be in denial or feel shameful – everyone makes careless mistakes! Learn from your mistakes and don’t allow the expectations of others to bring you down.Other people may have high expectations of you because of your intelligence. Don’t take their criticisms to heart; instead, accept feedback and be thankful. It may take someone else to point out that you made a mistake in order for you to realize it!
When it occurs to you that you’ve made a bad assumption, try working backwards from the time you made the mistake. Analyze any contributing factors that led up to the error, and how you could have handled the situation differently.

, Intelligent people may not reach their full potential if they are afraid to fail.Being determined and even enthusiastic about analyzing the causes of failure can teach you great lessons. Furthermore, being unafraid of acknowledging failure will set you apart from the many people – and companies – who neglect to analyze and remedy their failures.Focus on results instead of trying not to fail. People who concentrate on their goals with optimism are more likely to succeed than those who are trying to avoid failure.
When you fail, embrace it as a learning experience. Give an explanation – not excuses – and offer solutions. Don’t give up or let failure make you timid. Congratulate yourself on handling it well and gaining new perspective. Then create a plan to prevent similar obstacles in the future!

, Stick with tasks and apply yourself – that’s how you develop grit. When the going gets tough, resist the urge to move on to something else to affirm your self-worth. Avoid multitasking, which can actually make you less productive. Stay focused on completing the task at hand to the best of your ability, and don’t give up!For example, you’re doing a project at work and it leads to having to deal with someone whose personality you haven’t meshed with in the past. Don’t use this obstacle as an excuse to abandon the project and move on to something that feels more fulfilling in the moment. Challenge yourself – do your best to get along with your difficult colleague. In the end, you will have the satisfaction of having been persistent, and you can pat yourself on the back that you were able to work alongside someone who has been a challenge for you in the past.

, Smart people are more likely to lean towards worrying and pessimism, so it’s important for you to learn how to think positively.Don’t expect to be able to change your mental attitude overnight. Start acknowledging when you’re feeling negative and work on combatting worry and stress. Try to see the good in each situation.Get enough sleep so that you are less inclined to be moody. Aim for 7½-9 hours of sleep each night. Listen to relaxing music and read motivational quotes every day if you can, or at least whenever you’re feeling down. Avoid the company of negative people as much as possible.For example, let’s say that you released a product to a test market and got negative feedback from consumers, when you thought it would be very well accepted. Instead of letting the unexpected feedback get you down, think about the positives! The feedback is a valuable tool for improving your product. Furthermore, you got the feedback before releasing the product to the masses on a wider scale.
Don’t be hard on yourself, but do try to analyze potential areas where you could improve emotionally.If you’re having trouble recognizing your emotions, listen to your body and try writing a journal about your feelings. This will help you assess which feelings are negative, so that you can shift your focus to positivity., Intelligent people tend to see their self-esteem as tied to their careers.The danger in that is you can begin to see things that happen at work as personal, and your real personal life can dwindle as well. Realize that your worth in this world goes far beyond your job, and expand your horizons! Have activities and pursuits that give you a sense of personal accomplishment.Understand and define what makes you who you are, besides what you do for a living.


For example, take classes on topics that broaden your knowledge base. Teach a class or give a speech at a local library or hobby store. Take in foster pets or walk dogs for a local animal shelter.
Socialize outside of work, and for purposes that have nothing to do with work. Consider joining a hobby club, or meeting to play a group sport like tennis. You could also volunteer at a local non-profit organization, get involved in a political cause, or help better the environment. Use your smarts for meaningful causes that can benefit from your intelligence and leadership. For example, get involved in a church group and help rebuild homes for those affected by natural disasters., Intelligent people tend to get more upset by the psychological implications of getting older.However, you can combat this inclination by focusing on the benefits of aging instead. When you expect age to come with positive growth, you are more capable of nurturing that. You become better equipped to realize the potential of your intelligence, talents and emotions.While young people only use one side of their brains to accomplish tasks, older people can use both!
Aging does not mean that you will inevitably lose your memory! The way you choose to view aging can affect the way your mind ages. In other words, convincing yourself of such a negative stereotype can actually seal your fate. If you want to remain sharp as you age, you have to believe that you will, and stop fearing the worst.Your personality, creativity and psychological identity will continue developing throughout your life. You can only acquire wisdom, one of the greatest gifts in life, through age and experience.

"
Humble yourself.,
Be a good listener.,
Don’t be condescending or pushy.",How to Embrace Your Intelligence3," Let your actions speak for themselves. You don’t need to brag for others to perceive you as intelligent. You can be confident in your abilities without boasting about them.Sharing the spotlight with others rather than taking all the credit shows that you’re both humble and confident. For example, if you are an athlete who won a competition, credit the success to your teammates, coaches, and people who supported you along the way rather than boasting about your own hard work.For example, perhaps you are awarded the title of valedictorian. When someone congratulates you, try saying, “I have to give the credit to my teachers and parents, who supported me the whole way through.”

, It can be difficult to be intelligent: for instance, in meetings when you have to listen to a long-winded explanation of a point you easily understand. But remember that the tone of your voice and your body language can relay messages beyond what you say with your words.Be patient. Try your best to be an active listener who is considerate of other people’s feelings during conversations.When someone else is speaking, indicate with your demeanor that you are listening, for example by nodding and making eye contact with the speaker.
Don’t be quick to give your opinion or rush to judgment. When you are listening to someone else talk, focus on the speaker. Learn to quiet the inner voice in your head that wants to interrupt and inject your own opinion. That voice can actually shut down your learning, because you end up focusing on what you already know instead of grasping the entire premise of what the speaker is conveying to you., Be wary of developing an overachieving personality that projects your lofty goals onto others. It’s okay to set the bar high for yourself, but don’t push other people too hard to accomplish more or be faster. Not everyone will have the same abilities as you do – let others work at their own pace.For example, don’t speak to your employees the way a parent would speak to a child. Keep your tone respectful and encouraging rather than disciplinary.
Try saying, “Take your time and work at your own pace. Give it your best shot!”

Don’t define yourself by others’ success.You’ll lose sight of your own goals and merits, and it can promote feelings of bitterness, jealousy, and inferiority.,

, Understand that the road to success will not be unending, continual joy. There will be difficulties, setbacks, and moments where you question your commitment. These will occur whether you’re on the right path or the wrong path, so understand that while it might be hard sometimes, you’ll need to make an effort to re-establish and embrace that positivity you felt at the outset of your endeavor.Positive mental attitude (occasionally abbreviated as “PMA”) is crucial for entrepreneurs., Competition is healthy, but focusing too much on others can lead you to internalize unhealthy attitudes.


Along these same lines: praise your co-workers! When your colleagues, peers, or subordinates knock it out of the park, let them know. People and teams flourish this way., Failure always illuminates a truth about the methods you used, or the particular goals you pursued; interpret failure not as a badge of shame, but as a call for self-reflection. Sometimes it’s only through facing the insurmountable, failing, and then struggling to pull ourselves back together that we develop the tenacity we’ll need to succeed.”Failure,” as Henry Ford put it, “is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.”Failure isn’t always indicative of having the wrong idea—sometimes it’s simply the right idea, pursued ineffectively. Don’t scrap everything you’ve been trying all at once and or totally restructure. When working within a company or partnership, for example, it could be an issue of properly understanding each member’s accountability., The most important goal when beginning a new business, job, or craft is simply to survive.Don’t set your sights too high or wide at the outset, establishing unrealistic goals for your fledgling enterprise.


You will never achieve that goal of, say, providing coffee to all of the homeless in the world through your new coffee shop, if you don’t focus on keeping that coffee shop in business and thriving first. Long-term goals are important, but shouldn’t come at the expense of sustainable short-term ones.

, This doesn’t necessarily mean to pursue something you find fun 24/7, but it should be meaningful to you. The effort you exert should be on something that will make you proud in the end.

, Focus on completing the tasks which will benefit you the most in the long run. Learn to identify the difference between “high-value” tasks (that which will benefit you the most in the long term) versus “low-value” tasks (that which may be easier, but will offer much fewer benefits)., Finishing one project will teach you exponentially more than a dozen fizzled-out attempts, even if you never want to look at that project again.

, Successful innovators are often lauded and idolized, but it can still be terrifying to pursue the unproven idea. Don’t be afraid of venturing into the unknown—great ideas may be a dime a dozen, but actually putting in the work to pursue a great idea can be extremely rewarding.

, Networking can easily feel mercenary and shallow when advertised too overtly. Understand that networking is crucial to success in most industries, but that you should never forget that you’re forging connections with other people. You never know when you might form a true bond on an unexpected occasion, and find your next business partner, investor, or employer.


Studies have shown that the most successful business people excel in both cognitive and social skills.Don’t neglect your interpersonal skills!

Choose to privilege yourself over the “offender”.",How to Keep From Being So Easily Offended," Oftentimes, taking offense is a choice. This means that our reactions to what we consider offensive should be the focus of change.If you’re not sure whether or not you really are easily offended, take this test for a quick answer.


How has taking offense easily shaped you? Do you expect to be offended often, causing you to be very defensive? Do you find it difficult to trust others?
Avoid the trap of thinking that you’re a sensitive person, and that taking offense is a hard-wired part of your personality. You may indeed be very sensitive to outside influence—most people are. But, sensitivity is different from taking others' actions personally.;
, Unless the world really does revolve around you, it is just an assumption that others are acting out of hatred or disdain for you. So, where do these assumptions come from?


Examine your relationship with yourself. The easily bruised egos that result from feeling vulnerable and defensive usually mask fundamental insecurities and mistrust of self.Do you feel insecure about your identity or uncomfortable in your skin? Are you finding what you feel inside out in the world, in the form of an offensive comment or slight?
Just because you have an intense experience of your feelings does not mean that people are being purposely malicious toward you. In fact, others can rarely tell when people around them are highly sensitive even if they wanted to purposely harm sensitive people.

, Another major trigger for taking offense is seeing a behavior or hearing a phrase that reminds us of a negative past experience.We make associations between certain actions and our hurt feelings or discomfort that emerged with them at the time. Even if the person doing it means no harm, just seeing the action may cause us to become defensive and feel victimized.


It is important to remember that while an action may have carried a particular meaning at some other point does not mean that this will always be the same in the future.
For example, say while growing up, a school teacher scolded you for wearing a revealing shirt to school, making you feel frightened and ashamed. Upon a current friend's neutral suggestion that you bring a sweater to wear over your halter top, you could take offense and lash out at her, not quite knowing why.

, As humans, we all have basic emotional needs--to feel connected, safe, purposeful, and attended to.Many of us are lucky enough to grow up with the expectation that other people will be support our needs (just like our parents did). While this expectation helps us feel safe and trusting of others, it can backfire and create unrealistic ideals about how we should be treated.


This is especially problematic since growing older usually involves being increasingly responsible for our own needs.
Often, working on this issue means that the fulfillment of emotional needs requires better balance between yourself and others. Do you work to manage your emotional needs or expect others to conform to your ideal way of being treated?

, Sometimes it's easy to get offended if you see a socially acceptable opportunity to do so. For instance, we know that talking in a library is against the rules. So, even if you are casually reading a magazine, taking offense to the talking can serve the function of getting you attention.If someone says something potentially offensive, question if you really do feel burned because their take is that important to you. You might just be martyring yourself to illuminate a faux pas or rude remark just for the hell of it--out of self-righteousness or a desire to control who says what.

, Since there are appropriate times make issue of something that happened, journal about your values to determine which problems you really consider worthwhile. This will make you better able to know what’s worth raising a fuss about and what can be let go and forgotten about.


Additionally, having a stronger sense of your own values will help you feel less threatened when they are challenged. Trusting your values makes others' opinions less important.

, Breaking habitual ways of acting is extremely difficult. Talking yourself through your own feelings and using yourself as a springboard to consider alternative ways of thinking is an invaluable tool.


You might develop little mantras to tell yourself, like ""Everyone is doing the best they can to be compassionate"" or ""If each person doesn't prioritize her own needs, who will?""

, Allow time to pass before responding to someone you feel is offending you. If you are too easily offended, it has probably become an automatic response for you. This means that there is no time between feeling offended and responding as if you’ve been hurt. So, make time to pause and question whether or not you want to take offense.


If the emotions are running too high to just pause, try counting to ten in your head.
Learning and practicing mindfulness exercises regularly will make this step easy as pie. Mindfulness involves learning how to strategically detach from strong emotions so that more measured responses can be formulated.One mindfulness exercise is to spend time focusing on your breath. When you attend to the sensation of your breath coming and going, you gain a stronger connection to your feelings rather than pesky, automatic thoughts.

, Instead of ignoring what your mind is telling you, listen to it. That way you can determine for yourself whether or not to purse the offense and make a scene.


If someone says that your haircut might not be the best style for you, your head might be screaming “Oh no she didn’t! Give her a piece of your mind!” Hear this anger and feel your urge to lash out in response. This way you can see that as just one of many possible ways that you could respond.
It’s also important to see how angry you feel inside so that you can gauge your next move.For example, if you feel enraged then you may not want to respond humorously (since humor in your state might not be perceived as humor at all).

, Being certain of our interpretation of what a person means or where she is coming from can turn anything into an offense. Consider great works of art; their beauty comes from the possibility of many different interpretations. No interpretation is right, but each one has the power to make us feel differently.


Imagine that an acquaintance just told you that they decided to stay in instead of accepting your invitation to go together to an event. You may be tempted to make the snap judgment that the person could only have done that because he thinks you make bad choices about what events to attend.
Resisting this judgment requires an open mind that is willing to ask ""what might this have been about that I am not taking into consideration at this moment?""

, This can be a helpful exercise to remind yourself that even though you see and experience lots of different things from people, they are not centered on or tailored to you.You may not get to the bottom of why someone did something, but that’s okay. The point is to begin to put yourself in the offender’s shoes to see that taking offense too easily is needlessly detrimental for everyone involved.
If someone refuses an invitation of yours, there are tons of possible reasons why he doesn’t want to leave the house.He could have just received bad news, be feeling down and is too embarrassed to explain that, or just treasure his alone time (which of course has nothing to do with you).

, When we are anxious and full of energy, we tend to be less forgiving of mild offenses.This is simply because we are looking for new material in the world to “pounce on” or to attend to because, well, we can! Don’t let habitual offense taking spring up and drain energy that could be put to better use, say, marveling at how differently different people express their opinions.

, There are many different ways you might respond after someone says or does something that doesn’t sit well with you. Here are some possibilities:


Re-route the conversation. Let the matter drop and find a new focus. This is a good option if you feel that attempting to clear up the matter would just create more opportunities to be offended
Try using your sense of humor. Even if you are not quite at the point of being able to laugh off potential offenses, try throwing your whole self back into the equation.
Calmly ask for clarification.If you hear a comment that you find offensive or rude, think about asking for the person to clarify what they mean. They may have misstated what they meant, or you may have heard incorrectly.

Try saying something like, ""I'm not sure I understood you, can you make that comment another way?""



, Remember that one consequence of taking offense often is that people may begin to walk on eggshells around you or feel a little nervous discussing their thoughts or feelings. What's more, you are keeping yourself in a place of increased tension and anxiety--a harmful state for your body, even if you see other benefits to taking offense.


You are also blocking yourself , Try replacing your negative thoughts with self-affirmations and positive frames of whatever situation you’re going through. Letting unchecked negative thoughts stew in our minds is often the direct cause of flying into offense mode.


This means letting go of situations that you are tempted to take be offended by. Ruminating over negative feelings is like making an investment in sadness.Your time is valuable, and you don’t need to spend it re-living moments of fleeting discomfort.

, To cultivate an ongoing understanding of situations that tend to offend you, try journaling about some of your most memorable moments of victimhood. List 3 or 4 incidents with as much detail as possible.


Push yourself to think deeply about these moments, expressing how you felt and why you took offense. Don't assume that the offense requires no explanation or is ""obviously"" offensive. Write why you were offended, not why anyone would take offense at the same thing.
Then, write these moments down as if you are a journalist reporting an incident. Instead of writing about how you feel, try writing about what an outside observer saw.

, Is there anything you notice across these situations? Does a particular way of being treated frequently make you indignant with consistency? Look for the deeper reasons you were offended.


For example, say you are offended by someone explaining something to you that you already know. Perhaps you are offended because your ego is bruised because the person doesn't see your smarts. Can you reasonably expect that this person should spend their time keeping track of what you know and don't know?
These patterns are your triggers. When something like this happens to you in the future, you will know that the moment is ideal for trying out other responses., We typically justify or ""prop up"" our actions and beliefs with thoughts that rationalize them.What thoughts about what should and shouldn't be the case allow you to claim offense? What makes you think it's a proper response?


Maybe you are offended because someone comes to your house-warming party without bringing a gift. The thoughts that might support taking offense could be ideas like:

""Bringing a gift is the only way to show warmth.""
""A gift for me should be this person's priority regardless of other financial obligations.""
""I need to receive tokens from others to know that I am loved and supported"".



, When it comes down to it, we can either spend our time trying to get others to adjust their behavior or work on our own reactions. Trying to change others is a weighty task because people are always changing, surprising us—not to mention how many there are out there. What’s more, trying to change others amounts to controlling others. Ethical issues abound.


When you work on your reactions, you are making yourself a more flexible and joyous person who can handle more of the world with ease. Taking the “high road” is not just more noble, but actually more beneficial to your ability to cope with everyday life.

Even if you feel you have a pretty good grasp on people, there are always times when a thought like, ""Man, I wish I knew what they were thinking,"" crops up.


Being able to read people like the back of your hand is about as close to reading minds as we feeble humans will ever get. Think Sherlock Holmes or Simon Baker. Useful stuff!;
, The fact of the matter is that if you're a good enough listener, people won't even realize you're not really making conversation. They'll be so wrapped up in their stories and how great they feel because they're getting all the attention they won't even notice how they're dominating the conversation. That and people who stink at listening are terrible to talk to.

, Though being able to read people and listening can get you 99% of the way, why not read the article for that last 1%? Great conversations are hard to come by, but if you know your way around one like a ninja, they won't be so few and far between.

, When you're shy, working your way through social situations can be super daunting. It's not necessarily a lack of confidence, but a lack of comfort. And when people don't really understand, shyness can easily be mistaken for aloofness or for being cold. Not so! If this resonates with you, read up on being more outgoing.


Or maybe you want to be more introverted. Whatever it is, wikiHow's got your back.

, Now there's a quality that can come in handy in pretty much every scenario ever. Making people laugh can turn any situation from awkward or mediocre to memorable and fun. Wit is definitely something you can cultivate. Why not start now?

, Alright, so now you're funny, outgoing, a good conversationalist, and can read people -- but what if you have nothing to talk about? Hmm. There's a problem. Luckily wikiHow has a plethora of articles you can bring up that anybody's bound to have a response to. Here are just a few:


How to Know if You Are Drunk
How to Pierce Your Own Penis
How to Regain Control of a Spooked Camel
How to Get over Your Fear of Slenderman
How to Live on the Street

, That's a tough one, especially if everything seems to be going wrong. But that's when it's the most necessary. And at the end of the day only we have control over our thoughts. So why do we think the bad stuff anyway?


Thinking positively can change your outlook on everything. It's really the first step to change, regardless of how you're trying to improve. If nothing else, take a look at the article to see if you already do the tips it suggest!

, You know what's even better than being cool and awesome and knowing how to do everything? Being yourself. It's only when you're you that you know that people actually like you and that you can be happy doing your own thing. And how many of us are our true selves? Not many.

, Kinda the kicker -- once you are yourself, you gotta love yourself, too. No use being you if you can't stand it, you know? If you thought being yourself sounded like a challenge, try this one on for size!


Curious how loving yourself will improve your personality? You'll be less stressed, feel less pressure to conform, be more comfortable in more situations, and maybe even realize that your personality doesn't need improving.

, Okay, so being yourself and loving yourself are all well and good and the content might be useful, but it's time for real talk: Loving yourself is not something a how-to manual can really resolve. So if you're not looking for abstract ways that will leave you wondering, ""...Do I love myself?"" try for something more tangible, like admitting mistakes. It takes a pretty great person with a pretty great personality to do that.


You know another big one? Apologizing. Not the funnest stuff, but definitely some of the rarest.

, wikiHow has them all. If you want to be something, wikiHow can probably tell you how to do it. And if you don't find it -- well, get to writing! Here's a few to wet your whistle:

Know your values.,
Reach understanding.,
Have and seek respect.,
Learn to be determined.,
Use your actions to guide how others perceive you.,
Practice.",How to Keep Your Values High with Determination," To keep your values high, you need to know about your values first. This can be achieved by giving yourself ample time to reflect over what matters to you. Ask yourself what matters the most to you and what values you consider reflect the things you care about. Think about the values applicable both to yourself and to your interactions with others in the world. Values include:


What you wish to achieve (such as being helpful, useful, revolutionary, conserving, etc.)
The basics for interacting with other people and species on the planet (such as caring, sharing, being responsible, being open and honest, being supportive, etc.)
Your faith or spirituality (such as believing, enlightening, connecting, etc.)
The things that underpin your dealings with people at work (such as ethics, accountability, honesty, etc.).


Values are broad and cannot be confined to what one person or group considers appropriate. You are responsible for discerning the values that matter to you and living by those values you've chosen. To help you focus on naming your own values, it can be useful to check out values lists. For example, Steve Pavlina has a neat summary of values at: http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/list-of-values.htm.





;
, You must have the ability to understand that we all are not the same. This means that our qualities and morals will differ from each other. Therefore, do not compare yourself with others and then just copy them. Don't make the mistake of compromising your values just to fit in or be part of an ""in"" crowd. You can see that those who run after success by copying others often leave their true values behind; eventually, this can lead to breakdowns or loss of a sense of self, and such persons tend to end up regretting allowing themselves be swayed by others', all when it is too late.

, Respect is not something that comes from fear. It is something that is rooted in love. If you love yourself, then you will love your values too and respect will come along naturally. And when you love and respect your values, other people will never be able to let them down, they're already deeply enmeshed within you.

, Determination won't come if you don't know how to attain it. If one day you simply wake up and decide to stay determined, yet the very next morning you give up on it, you'll soon learn that is not how it works. Keep in mind that every day won't come through as a perfect day for you. It's you who has to make it a better day, by having gratitude for what you have, working through challenging issues in a mindset of acceptance, as though you were blessed to be given that day to your life.

, We all know that action speaks much louder than words. So, instead of saying big words about your values, it's always better to prove that they are your priorities too, by actioning them in what you do each day. If you don't put your values on a sacred level by doing whatever it takes to do it, then you certainly can't hope others to honor them either. Have the courage to live your values through your actions.

, Yes, practice makes man perfect. But, hold on, you are missing out on an important point. Regular and proper quality of practice makes a person perfect. So, practice each day to keep your values high, with determination.

Daily practice will also help you to figure out whether you need to broaden your outlook or not. This is because we often confuse our conservative perspectives as our values, when they are actually protecting us a little too much from venturing forth and discovering our greater potential. Through daily practice, you can self-calm, nurture your values and find the courage to live by your values.

Think back on all the times that you have had to work late or even perhaps spend some of your own money on the cause. Consider how easy or how difficult that decision seemed in the moment.For instance, perhaps you have to work weekends often and find yourself working more than the obligatory 40 hours. If you wake up regretful that you have to work or try to put the work off onto others, then perhaps this is not your passion.
Consider also the times that you signed up to do extra work or work that was not in your job description. This is typically indicative of a person who is happy and passionate.;
, You will tend to find that when you have discovered your passion, your values and the things that you believe in strongly will often fall in direct alignment with the work you are doing. Though ethical dilemmas may of course arise at times, you will find that if you are working as you should be, that you won’t have to sellout or give in to things that are immoral or wrong. You cannot live your passion if you are acting out of your character.For instance, if you are an accountant then you may enjoy when the numbers add up and make sense. If you have been asked to change the books illegally or without proper justification, you would not be living your passion because you would have funds that were unaccounted for.

, Though Mondays are typically not fun for anyone, if all of your days feel like Mondays, then perhaps you have not discovered your passion in life. If you find yourself regularly checking the clock and counting down the hours until 5PM, you might want to begin looking for new work or finding ways to make your workday more fulfilling.If, however, you find that the hours pass rather quickly and that you find time getting away from you, you may have found the job you are meant to be doing.

, Though some days might be tough at work and you should always look forward to going home, if you are in a bad mood every day after work, a career change might be something to consider. Many feel so frustrated at work each day that they feel unhappy throughout the day and may even take it out on their families afterwards, and if that is descriptive of you, perhaps your passion lies elsewhere. If however, you feel happy going to and coming from work, this is indicative of a passion for your career.You might also consider whether it is the work environment or the work itself that is contributing to your mood. If you feel happy about the work, but unhappy about the environment, then this may indicate that you have found your passion and that the workplace is the problem.
It might be helpful to journal out your feelings at the end of each work day to assess any patterns.

, In addition to reflecting on your mood and feelings, you should also consider the things that you have done. If the work felt easy or rewarding to you and if you elicited positive feedback, perhaps you have found your passion. If it felt like more of a chore, however, and you were not pleased with the outcome, then you might want to consider other career or project options.

, Doing some thoughtful examination of your work and how you feel about it may help to make it easier for you to determine if you are passionate about it. If the answer to these questions is yes, then you may have found your passion. If it is no, then the work you are doing is probably not your passion. Some questions you might ask yourself include:


Would I still continue to do this work if I only had six months to live?
Would I do this for free?
Do I plan to be doing this work in 10 years?
Do I feel challenged by this work? Do I enjoy the challenges?
Does this type of work make me feel energized?

, Often times, if you are truly doing the work that you should be doing, there will have been moments or experiences from your past that have led you here. For some, their passion might align with the family profession. Others might find their calling through some traumatic or momentous experience that they have had in their life.Consider, for instance, if you have a job in the medical field, whether you had an experience as a child with someone who was ill who you wished you could have helped.

, Often times, when you are in a job that you love and that is very rewarding for you, your health will improve. Stress and sadness are often correlated with jobs that are not in line with what you should be doing, and your health might suffer in those conditions. Make note of the times that you have been sick while in your current position and whether or not it is happening very often or less than the average person.If you are unhappy at work, you might also seek unhealthy ways of coping with the stress, like drugs, alcohol, or overeating which can all cause health problems.
Happy people tend to flock to healthy habits, however, and stay away from detrimental activities.
Compare your health now to how it was before you began working in your current role.

, When you are living your passion, you will find that you will often grow and improve professionally. Those who are not living their passion will often remain stagnant because they are indifferent about the work and unable to fully invest into it. Evaluate where you were when you first started your career and where you are now.Notice also whether your supervisor assigns work to you that is beyond or above your job description. This could mean that they are very confident in your work and level of commitment.
Also, consider whether you are more focused on the work or the money. If you are more focused on the work, then you have likely found your passion.

, Often times, you might be so caught up in the work that you have done very little reflection on it. However, know that others are noticing you and you can assess their comments, too, in determining your passion level. Consider whether you have heard things like “you look happy” or “I’m so proud of you” while you have been in your current role. These statements are indicative of an inward happiness and contentment that is manifested outwardly for all to see.If others regularly say things to you like “you look tired” or if they ask you if you’re happy, then perhaps something in your life should be reassessed or changed.

, When you are living your passion and doing truly good work, you will likely be rewarded for it. Make a note of the times that you have received props, whether formally or informally, from coworkers, supervisors, or upper level administrators.


For instance, your boss might often congratulate you on a job well done.
Perhaps also you have received an award for a certain project you have created.

, Those who are living lives full of passion will tend to attract a few mentees or admirers on the way. If you are doing good work, being an innovator in your field, or are highly respected for what you do, others will naturally hope to emulate you and your process. If you find that others reach out to you often for advice about your career or ask you for letters of recommendation, then you have made a positive impression on them., Just as you will likely attract followers on your path to success, you will likely also attract mentors who are committed to helping you on your journey. When someone who has been in your field for a while notices certain positive traits in you, they will tend to want to support you and help develop your passion.Mentors will want to associate themselves with understudies who have the right characteristics for success, including passion.

, Looking for ways to go above and beyond in your job may also indicate that you are passionate about it. You might also look for ways to improve your skills and knowledge in your field to continue to progress and grow. You may even find that you join a club or engage in work-like activities outside of work simply because you enjoy the work.


For example, if you are an English teacher, then you might find yourself participating in a book club or volunteering to organize a reading event in your community if you are passionate about your job.

, Your family and friends are the people who know and understand you better than anyone. Though they may not have said anything to you about your work, they may have thoughts to share if you’d only ask. These are also the people most likely to be honest with you, even if the truth is uncomfortable.


You might say something like “do you think the work I’m doing is my life’s passion?”

You don't have to jump straight into reading Ulysses if you want to improve your mental strength, and in fact trying to read something too difficult might turn you off reading entirely. Instead, focus on reading things you enjoy. Westerns, romance novels, and long-form magazines are all good ways to read.
Try replacing an hour of television each evening with reading, instead. Invest the time that you might normally spend idling, chatting with friends, or watching the tube in reading a good book.

Get a library card and take advantage of the library in your town for free entertainment. Try to read one new book every two weeks.;
, Ever get the feeling that each day looks a lot the same? As we get older, our mental pathways are more and more defined. Where each summer day seemed to last forever when we were kids, the weeks peel off more quickly as you age. Mental strength requires that you continue building new neural pathways by learning new things.The more regularly you pick up a new skill, or study a new subject, the stronger your mind becomes. Try to pick up one new thing every week, then continue working on it as you learn new things. Build up your mental strength gradually.
wikiHow is a great resource for learning new things. Learn how to play chess, change your oil, or play guitar.

, ""Book smarts"" are important, but it's also important to understand how things play out in the real world. Social intelligence and wit are important parts of all-around mental health and well-being. If you can't carry on a conversation, work on your social skills along with your mental health building skills.


Have complicated conversations instead of gossiping. Talk about things that are important to you, or things that you've been learning. Try starting or joining a book club in your area.
Try to meet lots of different kinds of people. If you're in school, don't stick to just one social group, but move around. If you're an adult, try to meet people from socio-economic situations different from your own. Hang out with your plumber, and hang out with your doctor.

, Try things that you're not sure you'll be able to pull off. Decide that you're not only going to learn guitar, but that you're going to learn to shred a fast solo note-for-note. Decide that you're not only going to play chess, but that you're going to study openings and learn to play like a grandmaster. Keep working on a task until you're at the difficult setting.


Video games are a mixed bag when it comes to mental strength. Some research shows that video games aid in problem solving, fine motor skills, logistics, and analysis.Other research points to the negative effects of violence and social isolation associated with video games, decreasing moral sensitivity and attention span.Nourish yourself with complex entertainment, and avoid click-bait. If you've ever seen a long newsreel and thought, ""Jeez, TLDR"" then it's probably time to unplug a little. Reading Buzzfeed or watching YouTube videos of epic fails is like eating three Skittles at lunch. Reading a book or watching a documentary is like eating a meal.

, Just as you can't build muscle by eating cake for three weeks straight before you start lifting at the gym, so too you can't gain mental strength by goofing off and then focusing only every now and then. Being consistent with brain exercise is more important than the intensity of the workout.


Even just doing a cross-word puzzle or a sudoku every day may decrease your chances of losing mental awareness as you become older while increasing your verbal fluency., Splitting your attention among multiple tasks makes the quality of thought that you're giving to each task less. A recent social and psychological study revealed that chronic multi-tasking in a variety of interactive media makes us poorer students, workers, and less efficient learners.Start prioritizing the most important things you have to do each day, and just focus your attention there. Write out a list to start the day, and work through it.
Finish one thing before starting another. Even if you find something challenging, stick with it until you're done. Switching between tasks is often more difficult than finishing something you've started.

, Recent studies show that as short a break as five minutes every hour results in more efficiency than a single long break in the middle of a workday.Let your brain rest and refresh, to give yourself the best chance of staying mentally strong throughout a difficult task.

, For lots of people, the chatter of the radio in the background, or the noise of the television is part of almost every minute. If you have a lot of white noise and static in your life, try replacing it with soft relaxing music. Let yourself focus on doing one thing only, instead of trying to entertain yourself while you work.


Focusing more on what you're doing will have the added benefit of letting you finish your work more quickly. If you're trying to watch a show at the same time, it'll take longer.
Want to really eliminate distraction? Get off the Internet. When you're trying to study and Facebook is only a click away, it's awfully tempting to mess around. Use a web-blocker or a site-blocker if you can't unplug yourself.

, It may sound overly simple, but one excellent way of focusing your attention back to a task when you find your mind wandering is to remind yourself, ""Be here now."" Don't think about what you're eating for lunch, or what you're doing later tonight, or what's going to happen his weekend. Just be here now and do what you're doing.Try using a keyword mantra, if you don't like ""Be here now."" Pick a password or a keyword from what you're doing. If you're doing math homework, make it ""math"" or another related vocab word. When you notice your attention waning, repeat the keyword until you can re-focus.

, Go into each task you perform assuming that you will succeed. Having the right attitude will ensure that your mind is focused in the right places, staying clear of the negative thoughts that can drag you down.Emotional support and strength starts within.


Practice visualization to help with positive thinking. Try actually closing your eyes and ""watching"" yourself succeed in the task before you. Whatever it is, try to picture yourself doing it correctly and finishing.

, To stay calm and positive, try to let go of petty ego-driven thoughts and concerns, and focus on what's most important. Is what you're wearing important? Is where you're going for dinner? Is what you're going to do this weekend critical to your well-being and mental health? Probably not.


Stop comparing yourself to other people. It's not good to do better than someone else, or to beat someone else, it's just good to improve your own abilities. Focus on improving yourself, not winning.

, Don't go looking for something to make you angry or frustrated. Take things at face value and don't over-think your interactions. Your boss probably isn't singling you out and picking on you irrationally. Your friends probably aren't spreading rumors about you behind your back. Stay strong and be confident. You've got this.


Stay out of other people's business as much as possible. Don't spread gossip or be a collector of gossipy stories. Focus on yourself.

, Taking a bit of time in your day to slow down and focus your thoughts can help you build a strong and calm mind. Meditation doesn't have to be a strange or mystical experience, either. Just find a quiet place and sit for 15-45 minutes each day. That's it.


Sit comfortably and focus on your breathing. Feel your breath going in and nourishing your body. Feel it leaving your body and entering the world.
Watch your thoughts come and go without identifying with them. Just let them happen. Stay unattached from them. Focus on your breath.

, Recent studies have shown that baroque music has the amazing ability to attain a state of deep concentration and focus by preparing alpha brain state in your mind which helps you to boost your learning vocabulary, memorizing facts or reading.

Select some good baroque music tracks and make a habit of listening to them regularly in your free times or while your working or studying.

, Exercise releases endorphins in your brain, which help to calm and strengthen your brain.Getting 30 minutes of exercise a few days a week will help you to stay calmer and more mentally strong. Additionally, one form of exercise that helps the mind relax and can greatly improve mental toughness, is yoga.

When given an assignment with a deadline, do not wait until the day before to complete it. Instead, structure your days so that you are completing bits of the assignment each day. This will ensure that you do not feel overwhelmed in the days leading up to the due date, and make it easier if something unexpected comes up that prevents you from working on the project when you planned to. This also ensures that you are turning in your best and most thorough work.Put your deadlines on your calendar as well as all of the task necessary to complete it. Set reminders for yourself so that you keep track of your progress. Make sure to give yourself more time to complete the project than you think you will need.
You can use a physical calendar or an online one like Google.;
, Another necessary executive function skill is time management. Sometimes, you may find yourself becoming so consumed with a task or hobby that you forget to attend to your other responsibilities. Set alarms for yourself so that you remind mindful of the other things that you need to do. Wear a watch to help you keep track of time or check the time on your phone regularly.However, you should avoid checking the time on your phone if it is a common distraction for you. Use a watch or clock instead.


Make sure that you arrive at least five minutes early to a meeting or to class. Be sure to account for travel time plus any setbacks you may encounter along the way.
Wake yourself up in time to be able to get ready, have breakfast, and prepare for your day and allot for a few minutes of spare time.
Keep yourself on a schedule daily so that you become accustomed to the routine.

, Another helpful organization skill is to create a to-do list each day or week to help yourself remember the things that you must complete for that day. It can be particularly useful to create the list the night before so that you do not enter into the day blind, but instead prepared and aware.Consider prioritizing the tasks using numbers. For instance, the most important and pressing task could be labeled as “#1”. Transfer anything that does not get done onto your list for the following day.

, Clutter can drastically and negatively affect your ability to be organized. Take some time to throw away items that you no longer have a use for. Clean up your space and consider donating any items that you no longer want. Don’t purchase new items for your space without clearing out all clutter first., After you have decluttered your space, begin to organize it. Keep any files that are alike in the same space. Consider color coding you planner or notebooks and labeling your materials.Digitize any paperwork that you are looking to get rid of. In many cases, you will need to have an original copy of certain paperwork, but some things can be scanned and kept on an online file so that you can free up some of your space.
If you are organizing your office space at work, do this on a day off of work so that it will not interfere with your work responsibilities. You may even bring a friend along for help and company.

, Perhaps the most important critical thinking skill that exists is being able to think and make decisions independently of others. Though you should certainly heed the advice of others that are wiser than you, at the end of the day, it is your life to live and you have to make peace with that. Don’t allow your friends to tell you how to feel or what to do.Keep in mind that you will receive lots of unsolicited advice in your lifetime. Consider the source of the advice to determine if it is someone you might want to listen to. For example, if they have lots of experience with the matter or have given you good advice in the past, then it might be worth listening to them.
Make sure that you take your parent’s advice into consideration, but also note that you don’t have to do everything they say. You should keep your grades up and your room clean, but they can’t tell you where to go to college or where to work after graduation. You can be respectful while still making major decisions about your life.

, Another skill necessary in critical thinking is to think beyond yourself. If in developing a plan that will affect other people and you do not consider those people, then you are not thinking critically about the issue. When making a decision that will not affect only you, put yourself in the shoes of others so that you can identify a plan that will work for all. It can also be helpful to talk with them directly about what you are considering, or at least talk with a trusted advisor.


For instance, if you are considering quitting your part time job because you don’t get along with a coworker, think about how this will affect your family and your other coworkers, as well. Though you may be happy temporarily, you may also have to ask your parents or friends for money, which will likely stress them out.

, Remember that every action, even a small one, has a reaction. It is imperative that you consider the potential effects of any decisions that you plan to make so that you make the decision that will be best for you. Consider making a pros and cons list before making major decisions. You may even want to enlist the help of a trusted friend. Ask them to look over your pros and cons list and to add to it if possible.

, A major part of developing this critical thinking skills is by doing your research on any topic or issue that you are interested in. In this age of technology, information is literally at your fingertips. Take advantage of it and expand your knowledge by researching topics of importance to you. The more you know about something, the better able you will be to make decisions and develop your opinion.One way to do this is to simply google information you are interested in. For instance, if you want to know more about a certain war or country, google it and read a few articles about it.
Read the news in as unbiased a way as possible. Rather than relying on one news source, consider reading several different ones on the same topic so you don’t gather a biased perspective.

, Another way to develop your critical thinking skills is by problem solving. If you are accustomed to asking your parents or friends for help with certain things, try to instead solve the problem yourself sans advice. Take some time to first identify the issue, consider several possible solutions, and then select and execute the solution that you think is best.


For instance, as a very basic example, if you typically ask someone else for help getting something off of a top shelf that you can’t reach, consider ways that you could get the item yourself, like using a chair to elevate yourself.
After making a decision and carrying it out, be sure to reflect on the outcome. See what you can take away from the experience to help you in the future.

, In order to make sure your mind is working at maximum capacity, you must exercise it and keep it active just as you would your body. Play board games with your family and friends. Download strategy or logic games to your phone and play them throughout the day to keep your mind going. Journal out your thoughts at the end of each day to keep your mind sharp, as well.Consider also carrying around sudoku or crossword puzzles in your bag.

, A key starting point in improving your executive functions can be achieved through setting priorities. When making a to do list of your day, assess which tasks should take precedence over others and execute accordingly. Recognize also that you will need a certain degree of mental flexibility as priorities shift. For example, if you are working on a major project for the day, but suddenly become ill, your health should take priority. You cannot work at your optimal level if you are sick or incapacitated., Maintaining self control is much easier when distractions are not present. If you work best when there is no noise, then do not complete tasks when the radio or television is on. Similarly, if you work best alone, then don’t invite friends over to do homework or work on projects together. Work to actively minimize the things that distract you from work when you are in crunch-time or need to focus.Try out some different things to see what works better for you. For example, some people find that soft music or ambient noise helps them focus, while other people might find it distracting. You might also find that you work better in a group or by yourself.

, This can be achieved through establishing a daily routine. The more settled in you become to a routine, the less likely you are to deviate from it. Set aside time each day to complete the tasks that you must complete, while still allowing yourself some free time to indulge in your interests.Reward yourself after completing a task.

, Your peers can be used to help hold your accountable to your various responsibilities and assignments. When you are in crunch time and need to complete an assignment through remaining focused, have a friend call you every hour or so to monitor your progress. You will be driven to have a positive and productive report for them and are more likely to remain focused.You might also invite them over so that they can ensure that you aren’t getting distracted.

, Many distractions and temptations exist that can tend to get you off track from productivity. Deactivate your social media so that you don’t receive notifications. Turn your phone off or put it on do not disturb so that you are not distracted by calls or texts. Let your friends and family know that they should only contact you during working hours if there is an emergency. Then, allow yourself some time later in the day to catch up on texts, calls, and social media.

, Certain tasks may be so mundane or stressful to you that you feel anxiety when preparing to complete them. Try taking a few moments to discover why the task is making you feel anxious and if there is anything you can do to make yourself feel more comfortable. Then, take a few moments to breathe deeply to destress yourself and then push through the assignment. Give yourself short breaks after completing a certain amount of the work or when you begin to feel overwhelmed.Take a short walk outside or have a snack.

New experiences tend to increase neural activity in the brain, which can help improve intelligence over time.Be open in your day-to-day life. If a coworker invites you to see a band you've never heard, go. If you have an opportunity to take a trip to a place you've never been, take it.
Build a new hobby or skill. Teach yourself to crochet. Enroll in an art class at a local community center. Start a sewing project.
Spend time exposing yourself to new information as well. Read an article on a topic that interests you. Go to a museum. Watch a documentary.;
, Intelligent people do not settle. When you've mastered a particular skill, challenge yourself further. Keep pushing to the next level, as this will force your brain to work harder. This can expand your intelligence overall.Brains use a lot of energy during training. While you're attempting to learn something, you are challenging your brain to make connections and learn new things. Once you've mastered a skill, this cognitive growth slows. In order to increase your intelligence, you should keep pushing yourself for a higher level of mastery.
For example, say you play a musical instrument. You work hard for a few weeks to learn a new song, and eventually master it. Do not stop here. Challenge yourself by choosing a new, more difficult song. This will put your brain back into training mode, allowing for cognitive growth.

, While things like GPS and spellcheck are great conveniences, an over reliance on them means you're not pushing yourself to build certain skills. Cutting out GPS for a few weeks can teach you how to find locations by logic and memory. Turning off the spellcheck function on your computer can help you think while you’re writing.Try cutting shortcuts on occasion. There are times, of course, where it makes more sense to use a short cut. A paper you turn in for a grade in school, for example, should be spell checked carefully. However, you could stand to go without spell check when chatting online with a friend.
The brain needs exercise to grow. If you want to increase your intelligence, make efforts to challenge your brain during daily activity by eliminating conveniences and shortcuts. Think of this as the mental equivalent of taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
For an extra brain boost, turn the spellcheck function back on after you have finished your document and use it to go through your document after you have caught everything you can. Then write down the words you didn’t catch so you can learn how to spell the words you missed. This will help you learn, which will help with giving your intelligence a boost.

, Learning through others is a great way to boost your intelligence. The smartest people are open to learning from those around them. Work on reaching out to other people and asking them for their input and thoughts on a variety of subjects.Use social media to your advantage. Post an article on a scientific study and ask people for their thoughts. Chime in when you see a discussion occurring on a topical event on a Facebook thread. Take a sincere interest in other people's responses and input.
Try to look for people outside your immediate field. If you work in tech, for example, go to a poetry reading and chat up the poet afterwards. You can learn a lot, and increase your overall intelligence, by learning about many different fields of interest.

, Creativity, language, math, and analytical skills can improve if you play an instrument. If you already play an instrument, make an effort to practice every day. If you do not play an instrument, look into taking lessons.Instruments can be expensive, but you may be able to find cheap secondhand instruments online. See if you can find an instructor in your area who gives lessons. If that's not within your budget, you may be able to find free or cheap lessons online.
Get on a regular schedule. Incorporate practice into your daily routine, as you incorporate things like brushing your teeth and showering.
You will challenge yourself more if you try to learn new challenging songs than if you play songs that you have already mastered.Try to work on learning new music all of the time in addition to your regular practice sessions.

, Reading is among the best means of increasing your overall intelligence. In addition to gaining higher intelligence overall, you can gain higher emotional intelligence by reading books.Keep a book on you at all times. Read a book on the train on your way to work. Read during your lunch break.
Try to read before bed every night. In addition to helping your intelligence, reading before bed can help you sleep better.

, Studies indicate that puzzles, like Sudoku and crossword puzzles, may have an effect on intelligence. You can also do physical puzzles, like jigsaw puzzles. Think of this as a workout for your brain.However, make sure to challenge yourself. Remember, your intelligence grows the most in training mode. After mastering a certain type of game, move on to the next one.
For example, you can start with crossword puzzles for beginners. If you reach a point where you can easily solve beginner's puzzles, buy a book of higher level crossword puzzles.

, Meditation can help you cultivate a certain state of mind. You can, for example, focus on compassionate thoughts when meditating, which can make you a more compassionate person overall.

Do something nice for another person.,
Keep yourself energized with a snack and water.,
Take a 10-minute break.,
Get your gear for the next day ready.,
Set a cozy bedroom atmosphere.,
Switch into bedtime mode before bed.,
Stick to a fixed bedtime.",How to Have a Good Morning," No one likes getting out of bed. It may even be the hardest part of your day. Playing soothing and cheerful music, such as birds chirping, instead of a blaring alarm can help you wake up in a calm and relaxed manner.Set your alarm time based on what time you need to get to school or work. You’ll also need to figure in your morning routine. For example, if you have to be at school or work at 7:30 and it takes you an ½ hour to get ready and a ½ hour to commute, you need to wake up no later than 6:30am. Try to have a cushion of 15 minutes in the event you want a few minutes to snooze or run late.Avoid listening to any loud, jarring or banging music when you wake up.;
, Instead of hopping right out of bed, give yourself a few minutes to open your eyes and let them get used to the light. Then gradually work yourself into getting out of your comfy bed to start a good day.


Take a few minutes to cuddle with your partner or your kids before getting up.A good hug or cuddle is a great way to protect against stress.Stretch lightly or do some yoga to get your blood flowing.You could also take a few deep breaths by inhaling through your nose and exhaling from your mouth to further relax you.Sit up and put your feet on the floor. Then stand up and do a couple more stretches if you want. Use the bathroom if you need to.

, There is a reason that people continue to use the phrase “breakfast is the most important meal of the day.” A healthy and nutrient-rich breakfast provides the energy and nutrients you need to get through the day.It also minimizes your risk of a mid-morning slump or low blood sugar that may cause you stress or make you cranky.


Choose 2-4 foods as a part of your breakfast. Include at least one item from the following groups: bread and grains, dairy, and fruits or vegetables. For example, you could have a slice of whole wheat toast with avocado, a cup of low fat Greek yogurt with berries, and a cup of coffee for breakfast. Another great breakfast would be a whole grain bagel with a piece of turkey sausage and/ or melted cheese, a cup of fresh berries with banana, and a glass of milk. Putting a small amount of sugar in your coffee or having a small glass of orange juice may also help your memory throughout the day.Set your coffee maker the night before so that you can wake up to the smell of good coffee. It can be like a fishhook to get you out of bed.Consider setting out what you need for breakfast at night to streamline your morning routine. Stock portable options in your kitchen like breakfast bars and fruit in case you’re running late., Let yourself take a short, warm shower either before or after your breakfast. A shower can refresh and rejuvenate you after a night of sleeping, and maybe a little sweating.Consider just rinsing yourself off if you took a shower the night before. Only shower in warm water that is between 36 and 40 degrees Celcius (or 95 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit).Use a thermometer or stick your hand and foot in the water stream for a second to check the temperature.
Alternate the temperature between hot and cold during the last few minutes of your shower. You can have 10 seconds of warm water and 10 seconds of cold water, for example. This can decrease stress and wake you up a bit more.Use an aromatic body wash or scrub in a scent you like such as lemongrass, lavender, or black pepper. The scent can help further refresh you.Conserve water by brushing your teeth as a part of your shower., Once you’ve dried your skin completely, apply any skincare you use as well as deodorant. Lotion or other skincare items can keep your skin soft and smelling nicely throughout the day. Deodorant also helps keep you smelling fresh so that others want to be around you.


Warm any lotions or moisturizers between your fingers or hands before you put them on your body. Not only does this feel better than cold lotion, but it may also absorb more quickly.

, As the last part of your morning routing to get ready for the day, put on your clothes. If you’ve set out your clothes the night before, you will save time and can minimize the risk that you are late because you don’t know what to wear.Release wrinkles if necessary by hanging your clothes in the bathroom while you shower.
Make sure you have a cardigan or light jacket with you in case it is chilly outdoors—or indoors.

, If you are going to school or work, make sure to take anything you need for the day such as your lunch, laptop or phone. If you get them ready the night before, you will save time. Keep a list in a place you can see so that you know exactly what you have to take each day. You might also make the list on your phone.


Gather your stuff the night before so you don’t have any undue stress or forget something.

, Depending on your schedule and family structure, you may be able to squeeze in a few minutes to yourself. You can use this to go to a local coffee shop or take a quick walk. This can reduce your stress and get your work or school day started off on the right foot.

Use your “me” time to do something you love such as reading the paper, catching up on social media, or just being in a quiet space. You could even squeeze in 30 minutes of exercise, which will produce chemicals called endorphins that can boost your mood throughout the day., Doing something nice for another person, such as giving them a small gift like a cup of coffee, can make you happy and help you stay healthy.

Once you’ve had a chance to settle in at school or work, consider doing something small and kind for another person to keep your good feelings going all morning.

Remember you don’t have to do anything grand. Getting a cup of tea or coffee for a friend or colleague who is struggling or offering a compliment can go a long way in making the other person—and you—feel great., You might find that your energy and mood begin to flag as lunch gets closer. Have a mid-morning snack to keep yourself energized and happy. In addition, try and drink about 8 ounces of water every hour you’re at work or school to stay hydrated, which can also keep you alert.Opt for nutritious snacks such as:


Almonds
Fresh or dried fruit
String cheese
Cottage cheese
Cut veggies and hummus
Boiled egg
Yogurt
Apples and peanut butter

, Allow yourself to take a break at some point during the morning. Breaks promote relaxation and can refresh your body and mind. They can also help reduce anxiety and stress.Do something you enjoy during your break. You could lay your head down for a few minutes, eat a snack, or go for a short walk. In fact, a short walk helps circulate your blood and push oxygen to your brain. It also lets your mind wander, and helps you relax.

, Gather anything you might need the next day. Knowing where everything is can help you have a stress-free and good morning.Iron and set out your clothing. Consider having a back up option in case you don’t like your choice the next morning.
Set out breakfast items and get the coffee maker ready. Pack your lunch and any snacks you want.
Make sure anything else you want to take, such as a laptop or books, is in one place so that you can pick it up and leave.

, The key to starting off the morning right is a good night’s sleep. Creating a comfortable and cozy room helps you sleep throughout the night.Check to make sure the temperature in your bedroom is between 60-75 degrees, which is the optimal temperature range for sleeping. Consider opening a window or using a fan to circulate air.Remove or turn off electronics because they can stimulate your brain and cause stress.Block out any sources of light. If you need a nightlight, consider a not very bright white night light.If you are able to sleep with minor light, consider leaving curtains and blinds halfway open. As the sun rises, it will signal your brain to wake up., A long day at school or work can wear you out a lot. Most people need time to relax and wind down after a hard day down before going to sleep. Take at least an hour before your set bedtime to start winding down, which can help you fall asleep more easily.

Avoid or limit use of electronics or devices. They can stimulate your brain, which makes it difficult to relax and fall asleep.Dim the lights in your home to signal your brain and body it’s time to sleep., Go to bed at about the same time every night if you can. Sticking to the same bedtime can regulate your body clock, or circadian rhythms. It can also promote more restful sleep, which may help you have a good morning.Set your bedtime so that you have a solid 7-9 hours of sleep. Remember to account for any time you need to wind down and switch into bedtime mode. For example, if you need to be up at 7, you should be in bed no later than midnight.

Identify what attitude needs changing.,
Assess why you want to improve your attitude.,
Try journaling to facilitate self-reflection.,
Visualize how an improved attitude will affect your life.,
Gather more information.,
Take into account things you have ignored.,
Believe in change.",How to Improve Your Attitude1," Have a clear understanding what needs changing. Setting goals is the key to success in any venture. You need to do an honest and in-depth self-evaluation. This will help you point out exactly which of your traits need improvement or change., Your motivation for change directly impacts your ability to change. Thus, you need to want to change your attitude to improve it and must prepare to play an active role in this process.


Ask yourself why you want to improve your attitude about a certain person, object or event. Is your decision to do so externally influenced? For example, has your boss come to you and asked for an attitude change? Or has a friend said that your attitude is bumming them out? Thus, having your own motivation to improve your attitude is important . Drawing upon internal motivation produces more excitement and creativity, leading to better results., When trying to improve your attitude about a person, object, situation, or event, you need to examine what is influencing your attitude. What you are basing your value judgment on? What do you hope to accomplish by adjusting your attitude. Journaling is important for self-reflection. It can help you understand yourself with greater clarity, make stronger and more thoughtful decisions, and help you engage in self-care. It is deeply connected to improving your mental well-being and mood.Here are some good questions to get you started on this path of self reflection:Will improving my attitude make me feel better about this person or event? Will it alleviate uncomfortable emotions?
Will improving my attitude ensure better communication with others? Or will people look upon me more favorably? Will it allow me to work more effectively with this group or person?
Will improving my attitude help me accomplish a goal or change something about the event?
What is influencing my judgment about this person, event, or object?
Have I had a similar experience in the past? What was it? What about the experience was negative?
What emotions do I have surrounding my judgment? Am I resentful, angry, jealous, etc.? What are the reasons for these feelings?
Is there a specific belief that is influencing my attitude (judgment)? If so, what is it? How does this belief connect to my attitude about this specific person, event, or object? Is my belief being challenged? Is this belief open to evaluation or augmentation?

, Visualization techniques are a way of imagining or seeing your goals realized. They can help bolster your commitment to those goals. Athletes, like Usain Bolt, top businessmen, and career educators endorse visualization techniques. Visualization techniques help to activate your creative subconscious. This can assist you in developing strategies to help you reach your goals. It also helps keep you focused, motivated, and programs your brain to realize the resources you will need to succeed. So, if you want to improve your attitude, imagine what it would be like if you were successful. What would happen if you began to have a positive attitude towards a specific person? Or if you started to embrace your job more?To engage in visualization, sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Then imagine, with as much detail as you can (like a very vivid dream) what you would be seeing if you successfully changed your attitude. Imagine that you're seeing the results with your own eyes.
Maybe during this technique, you see yourself actually becoming friendly and even having lunch with this person you had previously held a negative attitude about. Or perhaps you envision yourself getting a promotion once you start thinking more positively about your job and finding ways to be more efficient.
You could also add some positive affirmations to support your visualization techniques. An affirmation evokes the experience of already having what you want, yet it is in the present tense. For example, ""I get up in the morning and look forward to going to work. I'm excited about the new project I started up with support from my boss."" Repeat these affirmations several times a day and you'll feel more goal-directed and motivated.

, To improve your attitude, you will need to challenge your current judgements of people, events, or objects. To do so, you will need additional information. Improving your attitude requires you to seek out alternative information that will favorably influence your judgment. Information gathering may involve talking to people, reflecting on what you already know with a closer eye to the details or doing additional research.For example, if you are required to attend a work dinner and now understand you are resentful because you have to miss your son’s baseball game, you can seek out additional information about the work dinner. Think about why the dinner is important and what the company believes they are accomplishing with a mandatory dinner.
To gather this information, you may talk to your colleagues or manager, do research on your company, or use resources, such as a memo about the dinner. Seeking out new sources of information like this may inform you that the dinner functions as a mentoring program for young associates and it can provide career boosts and promotions. Knowing this information may help you feel more positive about the dinner., Another aspect of information gathering means considering things that you may have ignored or missed in the past. Sometimes we experience tunnel vision and can only focus on the one thing that we see or that is rousing a particular response from us. However, take a step back and look at the bigger context. This can help you identify new information that you may have overlooked and that can aid you in reshaping your attitude.For example, if you have a negative attitude about a certain person because you had an uncomfortable first meeting, you can expand your view of the person by seeking information that may not have mattered to you previously. Understanding more about the person can give you a bigger picture of who he or she is, which may change your original negative judgment of her, thus effectively changing and improving your attitude.

, One of the most important factors in changing your attitude is believing that you can in fact make the change needed. A lot of times we just assume our attitudes are natural and an essential part of ourselves and thus unchangeable. However, if you don't believe that you can change your attitude, then you won't be be able to. You either won't start in the first place, give up quickly, or only every make the attempt half-heartedly.One way to believe in the possibility of change and improvement is to recall other instances where you've improved your life. Perhaps when you were in school, you decided that you were going to have a better attitude about your education and put more effort in. And the result was an increased GPA (grade point average). Try to come up with as many experiences or times when you made a goal to change and were successful. This is the best way to instill belief in yourself.

Create the right environment to work.,
List your tasks in terms of importance.,
Do important tasks first.,
Keep some work with you at all times.,
Do not multitask.",How to Manage Your Time1," The environment you work in can help with your overall productivity. There are no strict rules about a work environment, so pick what feels right for you. Surround yourself with inspiring decorations that help you feel enthusiastic and passionate. These feelings will help you stay on task and be productive.For example, maybe a particular artist inspires you. Invest in a few prints of their paintings and hang these up on your walls.
If you can choose a particular space to work, choose a space free of distractions. Working in front of your television may be a bad idea, but maybe you can push a desk into the corner of your bedroom and work there.;
, Before you begin your work load for the day, prioritize. To-do lists are a great tool, but organize them a little rather than just writing down everything that needs to get done. Group tasks in terms of importance.Before making your list, write down categories in terms of important. For example, tasks labeled ""urgent"" must be done today. Tasks labeled ""important, but not urgent"" are important to do, but can wait. Tasks with labels like ""low-priority"" can be put off if necessary.
List task sunder each category. For example, if you need to finish a report for work, that would be an urgent task. If you need to begin another work project, but the deadline is not for another two weeks, that would be an ""important, but not urgent"" task. If you would like to go for a run after work, but it's not vital, that would be a ""low-priority"" task.

, Finishing crucial tasks first thing in the morning will leave you with a sense of accomplishment. The day will already feel like a success and a great deal of your stress will be eliminated. Start off each day by knocking out the most important tasks on your list.For example, if you have five e-mails you need to respond to and a report that must be proofread, do that as soon as you get into the office.

, Take advantage of your downtime by keeping work with you at all times. If you have a few stray minutes on the bus, use that to read something for school or work. If you're waiting in line at the grocery store, return some work e-mails on your phone. If you always have work on you, you can always be making the most of your time.If you're a student, think about investing in some audiobooks or recording your lectures. While waiting in line or walking to class, you can listen to material for your courses.

, Many people assume multitasking is a great way to get more done each day and manage time wisely. However, focusing on multiple tasks at once actually makes you less productive. Things will take longer to do, as you're not giving anything your full attention. Focus completely on one task at a time instead. You will get your work done quicker this way, allowing you to make the most of your time.For example, return all your emails. Then, log out of your email account and move on to another task. Do not worry about your email for now. If you need to return more emails later in the day, you can do that after you complete the task at hand.

Let things go.,
Identify your strongest qualities and accomplishments.,
Do things you enjoy.,
Pause and reflect on the good things.,
Show gratitude.,
Reframe negative moments and attitudes.,
Don't compare yourself to others.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Improve Your Attitude2," Holding on, worrying, and fretting can help contribute to negative attitudes and have adverse affects on your mental health. Instead, recognize that you can't control everything. You can't control that someone else got a promotion over you. What you can control is how those events affect your attitude and how you respond. Minimize the room for negativity by letting go of what you can't control. Move on and try not to let those things sour your general outlook on life.One way to let things go is to try to avoid thinking that you have been personally singled out for suffering, pain, sadness, etc. Most of the time, life amounts to a series of circumstances and events that have little to do with us individually. Try to avoid thinking of yourself as a victim. Seeing yourself as a victim will cause you to think repeatedly about the negative emotions you have experienced.
Remember that life is for living, not dwelling.

, Focus on your strengths to help create more positive emotional experiences and attitudes. It also provides you with a reservoir of positivity during moments when you may be experiencing more negative attitudes. In turn, this will make handling adversity easier.Consider writing down your achievements and positive attributes in your diary or journal. You can write in a freestyle manner or create a list of different categories. See this exercise as never-ending. Always add to the list as you do new things, such as graduate from school, rescue a puppy, or get your first job.

, Another way to build up a reserve of positive experiences is to make time to do things that you make you happy. If you like music, set aside time to listen to your favorite albums. Other people like to have time to read each evening in a relaxed environment. You can also do your favorite physical activity, whether that is going for an evening walk, doing yoga, or playing a team sport.


Stay active doing the things that bring you pleasure. This is a great way to maintain a positive and healthy attitude.

, Every day devote 10 minutes to writing in your journal about any positive experiences that you had. This gives you a chance to review and reflect on the day and to seek out the positives, even if they may be small things. These can include things that made you happy, proud, awestruck, grateful, calm, content or pleased. Re-experiencing positive emotions can help you adjust your perspective on the negative moments.For example, reflect on your morning routine to identify if there were moments where you felt noticeably happy. Perhaps you enjoyed the sunrise or had a friendly interaction with a bus driver or maybe it was the first sip of your cup of coffee.

, Be sure to also take time to acknowledge your gratitude for all the things you have in your life. Gratitude correlates strongly with optimism. Maybe someone did something nice for you, such as paying for your coffee or making the bed. These can be small things, such as gratitude for your partner making the bed. You might also take pride in the way you accomplished a task.You could even keep a ""gratitude journal"". That is a notebook specifically designated for things you are happy and grateful for every day. Writing things down often helps solidify them more into our consciousness. Having a written record means that you will have something to consult when you need a gratitude boost!

, Consider negative thoughts or experiences that you have had. Then, try to re-frame them in a way where you can get positive (or at least neutral) emotions out of these experiences. This re-framing action is one of the cornerstones of a positive attitude.For example, a new co-worker may have spilled coffee on you. Instead of getting angry and passing a judgment that she was clumsy or stupid, think of it from her point of view. It was an accident and she was likely embarrassed. Instead of developing a negative attitude towards her, pass the incident off as one-off. Maybe even make a joke about what a great ""ice-breaker"" that was for her first day.
Re-framing your thoughts and experiences doesn't mean assuming everything is fine. Instead, it means not letting negativity overtake you. This will help you find a more positive approach to life in general.

, Our competitive nature as humans means that we have a tendency to compare ourselves to others. You may compare your looks, lifestyle or general attitude to those qualities in others. When we compare ourselves to other people, we tend to see only the negative of ourselves and only the positives in the person we are comparing ourselves to. It's far healthier and more realistic to acknowledge our strengths. The key is not to compare and just accept who you are. Accepting yourself gives you the power to control your own thoughts, attitudes and life more generally. This will aid you in making less subjective inferences about other people’s behavior.Every single person is different. So, there’s little reason to judge yourself based on other people’s standards. You may enjoy things that other people don’t enjoy and take different life path.

, If you want to improve your attitude, then you need to surround yourself with people who will encourage a more positive attitude. The people you spend your time with - your family, friends, spouses, co-workers - have an impact on how you view the things that happen in your everyday life. So always make sure that these people share your positive vibe, and lift you up rather than bring you down. This social support can help bolster you when you do feel yourself experiencing negative attitudes.


Research has shown that people who experience major life stresses can navigate the ordeal more easily with a network of friends and family upon whom they can rely.Spend your time with people who are positive forces in your life. Surround yourself with people who make you feel appreciated, valued, and confident. Allow these people to encourage you to be your best possible self.
Avoid individuals who are negative and who feed your negative thoughts and judgments. Remember, negativity breeds negativity. Try minimizing your contact with the negative people in your life. This helps to foster a generally positive attitude."

Assess your current physical state.,
Exercise every morning.,
Increase your social interactions.,
Get more sunlight.,
Improve your eating habits.,
Spend more time around animals.,
Engage in meditation or relaxation techniques.,
Get the recommended amount of sleep.",How to Improve Your Attitude3," Your physical condition has an impact your mental state and emotional attitude.Take a long look at your day-to-day routine. Decide if adjusting your daily patterns of sleep, physical activity, or dietary habits could be beneficial for your improving your attitude.

, Daily exercise and physical activity, when carried out each morning, can help you expend excess energy. This will make you less edgy and more agreeable throughout the day. Exercise releases endorphins, which lead to feelings of happiness and overall well-being. Also, daily exercise can help you improve your body-image. This also leads to higher levels of self-esteem and self-worth.Walking, jogging or running in the morning are all great ways to engage in physical activities and lower your overall stress.

, Even minor or mundane social interactions have a positive impact on people’s mental health. Try to engage with other people throughout the day. This will improve your attitude and mental outlook.Social interactions naturally impact the release of serotonin in the human brain. Serotonin will affect an improvement in your mood and overall happiness., Humans derive vitamin D from exposure to sunlight. A lack of vitamin D can cause fatigue, negativity and poor mental attitude in some people. Even 15 minutes a day in the sun or under a sun-lamp can have positive effects on your mental state., It is hard to stay positive and have a cheery disposition if you are not eating right. Studies show that people with better dietary habits tend to see improvements in their overall mental attitude. Conversely, individuals who have poor dietary habits tend to be quicker to anger, less approachable and more irritable. Try eating healthier to see if it has any impact on your mental or emotional attitude.Make sure you include a wide variety of foods from all the relevant food groups in your diet, including meats, fish, vegetables, fruits, dairy and wheats.
B-12, which is in a variety of red meats and leafy green vegetables, has shown a positive relationship to overall happiness and mental health., Studies have affirmed that spending time around animals can lower your overall stress levels. This can improve your emotional and mental state. Even brief periods of interaction with animals can improve your attitude.

, Stress can build throughout the day, negatively impacting your mental attitude towards the world around you. As such, it can be helpful to engage in meditation or relaxation practices each evening to help you unwind., Too much sleep or a lack of sleep has the ability to negatively impact your mental state and emotional outlook. Set a daily sleep routine and try to stick to it. Most researchers agree that 7 to 8 hours of sleep a night is ideal for an average adult. You should see positive improvements in your attitude if you keep a stable and healthy sleeping routine each night."

Shut off your phone.,
Close unnecessary browsers.,
Block social media.,
Avoid interruptions as much as possible.",How to Manage Your Time2," When possible, turn your phone off. Phones can take up a lot of time throughout the day that you could be using more productively. When it's easy to log on to Facebook or take a peak at your email, you're more likely to do it. Do yourself a favor and turn your phone off while you're trying to do other things. If you find yourself impulsively reaching for the phone to procrastinate, you'll be met with a blank screen instead.If it's necessary for you to have your phone on for work, place it across the room. If it's not as easy to access your phone, you're less likely to do it. You can also turn off any notifications on your phone that are not necessary to work.

, These days, many people rely on their computers or the internet to get work done. Working with Facebook, Twitter, or other distracting sites in the background will adversely affect your time management skills. You also may become distracted if tabs are opened from old projects or irrelevant internet searches. Make a habit of closing tabs as soon as you're done on the site. Place all your focus on the sites that are necessary for your work.Challenge yourself to only have one or two tabs opened at a time.

, Sometimes, the temptation to log onto Facebook or Twitter is too great to avoid. If you have a problem with social media, there are many applications and websites you can use to temporarily block distracting sites.SelfControl is an app for Mac users that blocks access to any sites you choose for a set period of time. It is free to download.
If you need to get offline altogether, the app Freedom allows you to block your access to the internet for up to eight hours at a time.
The Firefox add-on Leechblock allows you to limit your use of certain sites to a set period per day.

, Interruptions disrupt your workflow. If you're in the middle of a task and stop to do something else, it can be hard to get back into work mode. When you're working on a task, try to complete it before getting up to do something else. Other things can wait while you strive to complete something.For example, if you realize you need to return an e-mail while you're in the middle of something else, do not stop to return the e-mail. Instead, jot down somewhere that you need to send the e-mail and get to it after you finish the task at hand.
Keep in mind, sometimes disruptions are inevitable. If you receive an urgent phone call during a task, for example, you should definitely take the call. Do your best to avoid interruptions, but do not beat yourself up over the occasional distraction during your work.

Use a digital calendar.,
Identify times when you're most productive.,
Spend the first 30 minutes of the morning planning your day.,
Schedule breaks and interruptions.,
Get some work done on the weekends.,
Stick to a sleep schedule.",How to Manage Your Time3," Technology is a great way to manage your time and keep track of deadlines, appointments, and more. Make use of calendars in your phone and computer. Write down daily tasks, like appointments and your work or school schedule. Set reminders for yourself. For example, have your phone send you a reminder a week before a paper is due. Schedule in time for things like studying and working on projects.In addition to a digital calendar, it can help to have a physical calendar as a backup. You can keep this at your desk or carry it with you in a planner. Sometimes, physically jotting things down can help you remember them.

, Different people are productive at different points during the day. It can help to know when you're most able to use your time wisely and plan to work during those times. For example, if you find yourself energetic during the mornings, try to get the bulk of your work done then. During the night, you can wind down and do relaxing things you enjoy.It can take awhile to identify your energy peaks. Try tracking your energy level and overall focus throughout the day for a week or so. This should help you figure out when you would be the most productive.

, It can help to make a game plan for the day in the morning. As soon as you get up, think about what you need to do and sketch a rough outline of when to do it. Keep work obligations as well as social obligations and errands in mind.For example, say you work from eight to four and need to call your grandmother for her birthday and pick up your dry cleaning after work. In the morning, figure out what order you should do those activities.
If your grandmother is in a later timezone, plan to call her after work so it's not too late where she is. Then, plan on picking up your dry cleaning.

, No one can work continuously without a break or an interruption. It's okay to invite interruptions and distractions into your day on occasion. It can help to schedule these kinds of deviations from necessary tasks. This way, interruptions are less likely to take over and derail your day.Schedule large breaks or interruptions in addition to tiny deviations from your work throughout the day.
For example, plan to have an hour long lunch at one in the afternoon each day and to watch half an hour of television to unwind after returning from work.
You can also plan tiny interruptions during daily tasks. For example, say you're writing a paper. Allow yourself five minutes to check Facebook per 500 words you write.

, Weekends are important for unwinding and relaxing, so don't go overboard. However, it can help to do a little work on the weekend. Think about the kind of the small tasks that pile up over the weekend, making Mondays difficult. For example, maybe you could send out a few e-mails Saturday morning so you'll have less e-mails piled up by Monday.Remember, breaks are important. Do some work on the weekend, but also give yourself a chance to unwind and enjoy yourself.

, If you want to manage your time, a solid sleep schedule is vital. A good sleep schedule ensures you'll wake up early in the morning and be ready for the day. To maintain a sleep schedule, go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, even on the weekends. Your body will adapt to your sleep/wake cycle, and you'll begin to feel tired at your bedtime and energetic in the mornings."

Be engaging.",How to Get Famous While Young," Uniqueness stands out in a crowd, especially when everyone else is trying to follow the crowd. Therefore, try to be your own unique person, doing something unusual in whatever field you choose.For instance, McKayla Maroney, though famous for gymnastics, became even more famous for her a particular scowling look she sometimes had. She let herself be unique, rather than pasting a smile on her face through the whole competition.Another person who became famous this way was Bobak Ferdowsi. As a member of the team who helped land a rover on Mars, he was already a standout in his field. However, when people saw his mohawk in a livestream of the event, he became famous all over the internet.;
, Some people become famous for the things that they invent. The best way to invent something is to start with a problem. What everyday problem bothers you or your family? What kind of solution could you come up with to solve it? If you come up with a new solution for an old problem, you could easily become famous.For instance, Mark Zuckerberg is famous for beginning Facebook at a young age. He saw a need for an online social network based on college campuses (originally), and he worked to make it happen., Some people have become famous by being generous. Here's the kicker, though--it has to be you doing something generous in an unusual or outrageous way.For instance, maybe you raise money for a charity by swimming the Mississippi and get people to donate for every mile you swim.

, While some reality shows require particular talents (cooking or singing, for example), others require very little talent at all. Watch some of the more recent reality shows to get an idea of what you'd like, then find their audition times on their website. Many people have become famous on reality television shows., This method could take a little time as you do have to work on some talent or task. The easiest way to figure out what you could do is to look through the Guinness Book of World Records. Find one you think you could break, and then work on making it happen. When you finally do try to break it, you'll likely need an official there from Guinness to verify it., Of course, many people become famous just by being very talented in one area. If you've got innate talent, you could spend some time developing it while you are still very young. In fact, very talented kids often become famous for awhile because people are fascinated by someone so young being so talented. If you're under 18, try asking your parents if you can post videos of you performing your talent on a site like YouTube, which you can then share with your friends., That is, when you're building a brand, you have to decide what you want people to think when they hear your name. You don't have to be fake, but you do need to decide what parts of yourself you will present to the public. In other words, you want some consistency.One example of a YouTuber who created a personal brand is Hannah Hart of My Drunk Kitchen. Her personal brand relies on a pinch of silliness with a side of compassion, as she encourages people to get involved in their communities., When building your brand, you do need to offer something to the world. You know about things, and you can use what you know. In other words, your brand can be about what you are an expert on, whether it's robots, cooking, or painting pretty nails.For instance, certain bloggers rely on their expertise to build their brand, such as Joy the Baker, who began a baking blog to share her love of baking with others. She's gained a number of followers due to her precision in cooking, her imaginative recipes, and her honest writing style., With all the social media platforms out there, it's easy to start sharing content with users. You can write blogs, tweet, make videos, or take photographs. Some people do all of the above. Basically, you want to start showing off what you know about by sharing expert content.If you're serious about creating a brand for yourself, you should consider creating your own website. That way, your fan base will have one landing place to find out all about you., Being famous is a business. That means you need to continually be on top of putting yourself out there. On the internet, networking is done through bonding with other content creators. In other words, you need to comment and share other people's content to help push yourself ahead as well.You can also try techniques such as blog tours, where you ask certain blogs (relevant to what you do) to host you as a guest. The host could interview you, or you could write a guest blog post.

, Take a critical eye to all of your social media. Whatever content doesn't fit your prescribed brand should be taken down. You can also set up a Google Alert for your name to see what is being said about you out there.For instance, if you are trying to portray yourself as family-friendly, you might want to take down pictures of you out partying.

, That is, don't post everything that comes into your hand. Every time you think about posting an update, a blog post, or a photograph, think about whether it fits into your brand or not.For instance, if you're trying to portray yourself as silly and fun, posting serious posts about recent events may not fit your brand.

, If you have a book or album to promote, you can try contacting producers directly. Look on the websites for the shows you think are a good fit, and find the contact emails for the producers. You can then pitch your idea directly to the producer. If you're a good fit, she may bring you on the show.Don't just try one and stop. You have to be persistent. Keep trying producers from different shows., Don't jump to the national shows first. Start with local television shows or local news. Once you prove you can handle yourself on television, bigger shows will be willing to pick you up.Shows are looking for people who are polite and engaging and who have something to say.

, If you can find people who produce similar content but who are more famous, try to befriend them. By associating with other popular brands, your brand can become more popular.You're likely to run across people who have similar brands just by reading other blogs, watching videos, and engaging in social media. Once you find other people like you, start engaging with their content, by replying to their posts and commenting on videos. You can also meet people at blogging and vlogging conferences.

, That is, whatever you do post on social media should not be bland. It can be mundane in nature, such as an update about your daily life, but it should have a spark of you in it, something that makes it engaging to your readers."

Learn about types of wit.,
Observe witty people.,
Be curious.,
Immerse yourself in wit.",How to Improve Your Wit1," There are a couple related but different ways to think about the idea of wit, and many different ways to express it. Before you get started, consider what ""improving your wit"" means to you.



A manner of speaking that is amusing because it is surprising and clever: Probably the most common use of the word today, this is what people generally mean when they speak of, “being witty.”One’s general intellectual faculties; ability to reason; mental capacity: As in, “to keep one’s wits about one,” “natural wit,” “to have the wit to,” or “dim-witted.”Facility with words; deft use of language: As in, ""witty banter.""Aphorism: A short saying that seem to encapsulates a general truth.Examples include, “Wise men don't need advice; fools don't take it” (Benjamin Franklin), and “Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes to the bone” (Dorothy Parker).Epigram: A short, clever, usually barbed statement; a short poem about a single subject, often ending with an unexpected or clever twist of thought.A famous Dorothy Parker epigram about Oscar Wilde is, “If, with the literate, I am/Impelled to try an epigram,/I never seek to take the credit;/We all assume that Oscar said it.”Repartee: A quick, droll response or comeback; witty banter. For example, in response to a witty comment made by the painter James McNeill Whistler, Oscar Wilde once remarked, “I wish I’d said that”; Whistler replied, “You will, Oscar, you will.”Quip: A general word for any witty remark; see “witticism.”;
, Think of people you know who are particularly witty, and try to dissect why. What characteristics do they have that you find interesting or amusing? Be as specific as possible; when you’re learning something new, the first step is to break it down into smaller chunks in order to understand and replicate it.

, Witty people are constantly asking questions and learning—if you accept everything at face value without engaging your curiosity, you won’t have much to quip about. As Dorothy Parker wrote, “Wit has truth in it; wise-cracking is simply calisthenics with words.""To say interesting things, one must be both interested and interesting.


Indulge your obsessions. Find something about which you are passionate, and dive into it. Learn as much as you can. The more you know about something, the better equipped you are to say clever things about it.
Listen to and take genuine interest in the people around you. You’ve probably known someone who was so preoccupied with thinking of his next joke that he never seemed fully present in conversation. Did this person seem particularly witty? Probably not. Most funny people are keen observers of the world around them. The people you talk to are like partners in an improve scene—if you’re not paying genuine attention to them, you won’t be able to respond in an engaging way.
Think critically and creatively. Aristotle called wit “educated insolence,”and if you consider people like Louis C.K., George Carlin, Sarah Silverman, and Richard Pryor, you may find yourself in agreement. These iconoclastic comedians use unexpected barbed critiques of the status quo as a vital part of their humor. Think of an injustice in the world that rankles you, and try to find an original way to frame the problem.

, Oscar Wilde once quipped, “Quotation is a serviceable substitute for wit.” Ideally, exposing yourself to a wide array of witty media will help you learn about wit through osmosis; failing that, though, you can always follow Wilde’s advice, and store up some witty quotations as a substitute.


Read books. A lot of history’s best examples of wit come from literature. Good places to start include Dorothy Parker, Vladimir Nabokov, P.G. Wodehouse, William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Kurt Vonnegut, James Joyce, Voltaire, Gertrude Stein, George Elliot, Mae West, and Oscar Wilde.
Watch standup comedy. Comedians make a living off being witty, and lots can be learned from observing them. Some particularly witty comics include George Carlin, Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, Sarah Silverman, Jerry Seinfeld, Mitch Hedberg, Maria Bamford, Ellen Degeneres, and Greg Proops.
Watch movies and television. There is much to be learned about wit from watching funny television shows and movies. Some great examples are Anchorman, The Princess Bride, Monty Python, 30 Rock, Frasier, The Office, The Colbert Report, The Daily Show, Last Week Tonight, Dr. Strangelove, Strangers with Candy, The Importance of Being Earnest, In The Loop, and anything by Woody Allen.

Set priorities with efficiency in mind.,
Take frequent, short breaks.,
Schedule your time.,
Motivate yourself with rewards.,
Avoid creating project bloat.",How to Increase Productivity1," The key to increasing productivity is working efficiently. If you have several tasks on your plate, prioritize them in a way that will keep you active and working hard. Different people work in different ways, but this advice should give you a significant productivity boost:


It's usually best to start with tasks you dislike. If you get through the fun work early in the day, you'll be tired when you get to the less pleasant work, and more likely to put it off.
Avoid jumping from task to task. Whenever possible, put all of your energy toward completing one task. When you have to divide your attention, spend at least an hour at a time on each task. Squeezing in five or ten minutes between other projects is an inefficient way to work.;
, If you continue without any breaks, you'll burn out more quickly. Your brain needs to rest to stay alert and focused. Take a few minutes off whenever you feel tired, or whenever you've reached a good stopping point. Walk around, drink some water, or have a conversation.


Avoid break activities that could distract you from your work. ""Screen time"" on the computer or television is especially likely to lead to a long procrastination session.
If burning out is a problem for you, set an alarm to go off every hour or two as a break reminder.

, Set up a realistic schedule for your work, using a physical or electronic calendar. Turning your plans into concrete, visible reminders can motivate you to push onward.


Include break times and longer meal breaks in the schedule.
Just schedule one day at a time, especially when starting out. At the end of every workday, take a few minutes to draft the next day's list.

, Set short and long term goals for a project, and give yourself rewards after each accomplished goal. For small goals, such as cleaning the kitchen or finishing a day's project, reward yourself with an ice cream cone or half an hour of pampering. For large goals, such as earning a degree or a promotion, give yourself a vacation or a weekend adventure.

, Give your work your best effort, but avoid unnecessary extensions. Quick, professional results are more efficient and often more appreciated than an extra week of optional additions. Save your ""above and beyond"" moments for the truly important projects.

"
Limit the number of your plans.,
Focus hard on one thing only and don’t give up easily.,
List your progress and reflect on it at the end of the week.,
If you feel stuck, communicate the problem.,
Say no.,
Plan your next week on Friday.,
Focus on outcomes and results, not on process or actions.,
Share plans with others and let them know what you’re working on.,
Divide your week into regular functional area days.,
Don’t overload others with information.",How to Have a Productive Workweek," Start by planning your weekly activities. While planning, limit the number of items you need to achieve. It’s crucial to focus on what’s important and to do those selected things really well.;
, Too much choice is bad, since it will make you choose the small and easy-to-accomplish tasks, not important strategic ones. What is more, achieving many small goals gives us an illusion of progress. At the same time multitasking lowers IQ by 10 points and kills productivity by 40%, according to Harvard Business Review. Therefore, focus hard on one task and don't finish until it's done.

, Each week list your progress by asking: Was what you did important and worth one full week of work? During the week, whenever something gets done, don’t just delete it or tick it as done, but write it down as progress. On Friday, look at your progress list and study each item.

, If you get stuck, don't procrastinate, but communicate the problem. Ask for help from your manager, your team mates, advisors or anyone else.

, You need to picky, rather than nice. Just because you can do something, doesn't automatically mean you have to do it. Leave out unimportant things. Do only the big things.

, Planning your next week on Friday reduces stress level on Mondays and keeps your mind clear and focused during the weekend.

, Whenever possible, focus on results and measurable data. This will reflect what is working and what might not be worth the while. This way it will be much easier to declare a goal accomplished and move on to next big weekly objective.

, When working in a team, try to keep everyone in the loop with your progress. Expect the others to do the same. Whenever a challenge comes up, share that as well. It helps both with getting feedback from others as well as keeping the team on the same page.

, People who have different responsibilities can divide their week into 5 days of different work areas. Then stick to them each week. Communicate your days’ focus to your co-workers as well.

, You would not want others to disturb you and waste your time. Being interrupted, be it via e-mail or meetings, is an annoying waste of time in any team. Be nice to others and whenever possible, do not e-mail or IM them, do not call for another meeting. Use a team collaboration software to get the process going.

"
"
Have respect for others.,
Present the appearance of confidence.,
Be brief.,
Study vocabulary.",How to Improve Your Wit2," Some people think wit means being mean and sarcastic. While it’s true that there are plenty of examples of witty remarks made at the expense of others, being witty doesn’t have to mean being cruel.That said, there is a time and a place for backhanded comments and cutting rejoinders. A good rule to follow if you’re going to take shots at other people is to take at least as many shots at yourself. Tempering sarcastic comments about others with self-deprecating jokes will make you seem more fair, and less like an insult-machine. After all, if you alienate people, there will be no one to appreciate your wit.

, Of course, genuine confidence is always preferable to feigned confidence, but there are plenty of witty people who are plagued by self-doubt. If you fade into the background, however, or seem not to believe in your own jokes, it will be hard for other people to relax and appreciate your wit. It is certainly possible to be off-puttingly over-confident as well, and there are a number of witty people (like Woody Allen, Mitch Hedberg, and David Sedaris) who cultivate a persona that takes advantage of their neuroses for comedic effect. Even these people, however, know how to present their jokes with enough confidence that their audience is not too worried for them to laugh, or made uncomfortable by their discomfort. If you are not a very confident person, don’t fear. There is a lot to be said for faking it till you make it; if you present the appearance of confidence, you may find yourself becoming more genuinely confident with time. Stand up straight, speak slowly and clearly, and smile. This can go a long way toward making people receptive of your jokes.

, Perhaps history’s most famous quote about wit comes from Shakespeare’s Hamlet: “Brevity is the soul of wit.”The contemporary writer George Saunders elaborated slightly on this theme when he wrote, “Humor is what happens when we’re told the truth quicker and more directly than we’re used to.”The best witty quips are short and pithy; don’t belabor the point. Your wit should be a pleasant addition to a conversation, not its primary focus.

, A large part of being witty is the appearance of cleverness; improving your vocabulary can only help in this regard. There are a number of “word a day” style apps for your phone that can help with this. Alternatively, flip through a dictionary and make a list of words you would like to add to your active vocabulary (“active vocabulary” refers to words you use in your day-to-day speech, as opposed to “passive vocabulary,” which refers to words you recognize upon reading or hearing, but do not personally use) and make flashcards to quiz yourself.

Play lateral thinking games.,
Do lateral thinking puzzles.,
Play improv games.,
Pour yourself a drink: This is certainly not a requirement, and you don’t want it to become a crutch, but drinking a little alcohol can help you relax, making it easier to think creatively.",How to Improve Your Wit3," Lateral thinking is the ability to solve problems by making connections between seemingly disparate things, and is essentially what fuels creativity. Not everyone is comfortable thinking laterally, but it is a skill that can be strengthened with practice.


Grab a pen and paper, and think of five random, unrelated nouns. Spend 30 seconds or so generating a list of things you can do with each object. Be creative; don’t just list their most obvious uses. Now pick two of the items on your list, and use the list of uses for them you brainstormed as a jumping-off point to write an original joke. An example of a joke written this way by comedian Max Matterson is, “In what way are pencils and judges the same? They pass sentences, always have the last word, and are wright all the time.”Don’t worry if you struggle at first; with practice it will become easier.
With a friend, brainstorm a list of random objects. Write each one down on a piece of paper, fold them up, and put them in a bowl. Draw a piece of paper at random, and set a timer for 1 minute. Come up with as many uses for that object as you can before the timer goes off. Read them aloud, crossing out the uses that the other person also listed. Whoever has the longest list at the end of this process wins. Think of a random word, and have a friend do the same. On the count of three, both of you say the word you are thinking of, at the same time. Count to three again, and this time both of you try to say a word that is somehow between the two words you said in the first round. Continue doing this, with the goal of eventually both saying the same word. This will strengthen your ability to draw connections between things that are not obviously related., These are designed to improve your ability to connect seemingly unconnected ideas, and will help you learn to be creative on the spot. Generally lateral thinking puzzles take place as a dialogue of yes-or-no questions between a quizzer and a solver, but you can try to puzzle these classics out on your own, and then follow the links provided to find the answers when you think you’ve got it. Take your time; these are designed to be ambiguous, and may take you a while to puzzle out. Try reading one in the morning, and then turning it over in your mind over the course of the day. If you come up with an answer that works but is different than the canonical answers provided, give yourself a pat on the back! You are definitely thinking creatively. (If you enjoy these puzzles, there are many more like them on the internet—just Google “lateral thinking puzzles.”)


A man lives on the tenth floor of a building. Every day he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work, or to go shopping.

The man hanged himself. How did he do it? Click here for the answer.

, These are designed to force you to think on your feet without judging your ideas or getting in your own way. If you don’t have friends who are interested in playing improv games with you, check online if there are any improv classes in your area. Remember, the most important rule in improvisation is to say, “yes, and…” If your improv partner starts a scene in which she tries to return something to a store, don’t respond with, “What are you talking about? This isn’t a store!” It may seem like a funny response at first, but it will make your partner feel foolish, and leave you both with nowhere to go. Instead, accept her premise, and build on what she has established.



Park bench: Begin with two chairs side-by-side. Start with one person sitting in one of the chairs. A second person enters, sits on the chair beside the first person, and begins a scene that takes place on a park bench. The goal of the second person is to scare away the person originally sitting on the bench. When he has done so, he moves into their seat, and another person enters and invents a new scene, with the goal of scaring off the person already on the park bench.Questions only: This is a very straightforward game, in which two participants act out a scene using only questions. When someone messes up and fails to speak in the form of a question, they are out, and another member of the group replaces them.Alphabet: Also very straightforward, this game involves two people acting out a scene in which the first word of every sentence begins with the next letter of the alphabet. So the first person might say, “A very fine day we’re having,” to which the second person might say, “Bit chilly for me.” The first person would respond with something like, “Can you go two minutes without complaining?” and the second might reply, “Don’t start with me.” When someone messes up or gets stumped, a new player replaces them, and the game starts over at “A.” Belief to Delusion: Start with an established fact, like “pizza tastes good,” or “dogs are cute,” and then act out a scene where this fact is no longer true. Boring: Start with a boring task, and play out a scene in which this task becomes the goal of an epic quest. , According to Benjamin Errett, author of Elements of Wit: Mastering the Art of Being Interesting, having a couple drinks can help, so long as you don’t overdo it. “To a point I've done some science,” he says, “and decided that people are at their wittiest after two drinks. Any more and you lose perspective on yourself.”"

Organize your workspace.,
Find a private space.,
Minimize electronic distractions.,
Switch from paper to electronic documents.,
Create a reliable filing system.",How to Increase Productivity2," If your desk is a cyclone of papers, spend 15 or 30 minutes a day tidying up. This is a productive activity that adds variety to your workday, and can greatly increase efficiency once you've finished. Here are a few basic tips to guide you:


Anything you use often should be in an obvious place, reachable without standing up.
If you often forget where something is, label drawers and filing cabinets.
Return everything to its proper place right after you use it.

, If you work in a public area with frequent interruptions, find a more private space to work. If this is not possible, try to work around productive, positive people who enjoy getting things done. Avoid people who are not actively working, or who seek distraction.


Even if most of your work is on a desktop computer, think of tasks you can print out and finish by hand in a more quiet location.

, This can be tough if most of your work happens on a computer or phone. Turn off any non-essential electronics, and take additional steps to avoid distraction:



Block distracting websites.
Close all non-essential websites.
If you need your phone on to receive calls, turn off the Wi Fi to slow internet speeds.
If you tend to distract yourself with video games or other software, make a separate work account on your computer.

, If you waste a lot of time searching for the right piece of paper, go electronic. Most banks and other services allow you to sign up for online bills. If you're handling work documents, bring up the idea of electronic copies.


As a last resort, scan the documents yourself as PDFs.

, Whether you're handling electronic files or a physical filing cabinet, create a system that allows intuitive access. Use the same naming convention for all files. Organize electronic files inside clearly labeled folders.


Beginning each file name with the date in YYYYMMDD format is an easy, universal system. Alternatively, start with the client's name, or the name of the project.

Stick to a regular sleep schedule.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Be careful with caffeine.,
Exercise.,
Let yourself relax.,
Pay attention to your emotions.",How to Increase Productivity3," This is vital for staying alert and productive throughout the week. Even on days when you're not working, stick as close to your regular wake up time and bedtime as you can.

, Your diet should contain plenty of protein, vitamins, healthy fats, healthy carbohydrates, and fiber. Eating high-carb foods — including fast food, processed foods, and desserts — will cause a crash in blood sugar that makes it difficult to get through the day.


Keep healthy snacks near your work area, especially if you tend to procrastinate by making yourself snacks.

, Coffee or energy drinks can give you a temporary boost to energy, but they will cause a crash in the end. Take these in moderate amounts, or save them for special circumstances. Consuming caffeine daily can make you reliant on it, forcing you to continue drinking it just to reach a basic level of comfort and alertness. If this happens to you, consider quitting for a more pleasant and efficient workday.

, Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain energy and health. Even just standing while you work or while you're on break can keep you more alert.

, Once you've finished your day's work, give yourself time to wind down. Do whatever it takes to help yourself ""recharge,"" whether that's a night out with friends or a calm evening at home.


Take a personal day once in a while to avoid burning out. Hire someone to watch the kids, or take a day off from work.

, Avoiding relationship issues or problems at home won't make them go away. You bring your emotions to your work, and during tough times you won't be 100% focused. Work to address these issues if possible. In the meantime, free your mind before work with meditation, exercise, or talking to a trusted friend.

Keep a time diary.,
Write down all the ways you waste time.,
Determine why you procrastinate.",How to Improve Time Management Skills1," You may wonder where all of your time goes each day. Carry a notebook around and write down everything you do and for how long. You may be surprised about how you spend your time. Be honest when you do this.


Try keeping a diary for at least a few days to get a good picture of how you typically spend your day. For example, going to a birthday dinner or a doctor’s appointment is not an everyday task for you and could throw your schedule off.;
, There are many ways that you can waste time. Do you spend a lot of time on social media? Do you hang out with your friends when you should be doing other things? Do you spend hours in front of the television?


It is important that you know yourself and your habits so you can make changes.
Look through your time inventory and see areas that you can cut back on.

, Instead of becoming upset that you are putting a task off, try to figure out the reasons for your procrastination. Think of procrastinating as a symptom of a larger problem and try to get to the root cause. Are you scared to do the task? Are you tired? Is the task boring? Is the task too easy or too hard?If the task is too easy, offer yourself little rewards for completing each step.
If the task is too hard, deadlines and small steps are the best way to tackle it.
Take into consideration the amount of time you spend procrastinating as well when you do your time diary.

However, make one that's doable. If you list an onslaught of tasks, this is more likely to stress you out than make you productive. Stick to 3 to 5 big daily goals.If your goals are bigger, stick to a lower number. For example, if you need to finish a report for work, that's going to take a lot of sub-steps. You can write a goal that just says, ""Finish the Henderson report by end of day"" and assume you'll have a lot of sub-steps involved there.
If you don't have any big tasks ahead, reach for 4 or 5 smaller goals. You could write something like, ""Return e-mail to Cindy, rewrite press release, proofread website copy, and return Carter's phone call.""
Remember, you may get more done. In fact, if you work hard and stay productive, there is a good chance you will exceed this list. The point of making your list is to get a sense of what absolutely must be done by the end of the day. Seeing your main goals written down can help you prioritize.;
, Lemon can boost your energy in the morning, which can increase your productivity throughout the day. As soon as you wake up in the morning, have a glass of water with lemon juice squeezed in. Do not drink pure lemon juice, as this is hard on your teeth. It can help to place a pitcher of lemon water in the fridge before bed at night.For best results, you should drink the lemon water on an empty stomach.
Wait 15 to 30 minutes to eat after drinking the water.

, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets can make you lose focus. Do not grab your phone first thing in the morning to check your Facebook. Instead, focus your energy elsewhere.Think of a relaxing, positive way to start the day. Social media can often fuel feelings of inadequacy, making you grumpy at the beginning of the day. Instead, stretch, meditate, watch the birds outside, or listen to a song you like.
Make a rule for yourself about when you can first look at social media. You can promise yourself, for example, you won't check Facebook until after breakfast.

, A good breakfast is vital for a successful day. It's called the most important meal of the day for a reason. Breakfast helps improve your mood and energy and can increase your overall productivity.Go for a real breakfast. Skip the processed foods or sugary snacks like donuts.
Oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, and eggs are all great breakfast choices.
If you're in a rush, try grabbing something small on your way out the door. Even eating a banana on your way to work can help bolster your productivity levels.

, A workout can help regulate your mood and stress level. Also, physical activity bolsters your energy. Get up a little earlier in the mornings so you can fit a workout in before work or school.You don't have to do a long workout. Something as simple as 10 minutes of physical activity can help.
You can go for a brisk 10 minute walk, do 10 minutes of aerobics in your kitchen, or run on the treadmill for 10 minutes. If you like something like yoga or Pilates, try to find a 10 minute routine online.

, A productive day begins with minimal distractions. Going into work or school, remove anything that could get you off track. You want to be able to focus on your work and not other things.If you work on a computer, shut any browsers and close any applications or software that's distracting. Log out of social media accounts. Shut down websites where you're reading news articles. If you have a distracting program in the background, close it.
Get rid of anything on your desk that may distract you. If you have a book you brought to read during downtime, put it away. Put away any electronic devices, like an iPhone or an iPod, that may take away your energy.

, No one can work productively in a messy atmosphere. Before you begin to work, take a few moments to tidy up. Organize any papers and throw out anything you don't need. If there's dirt or dust on your desk, quickly wipe it off. If you notice any garbage, like a can of soda or a candy wrapper, throw it away. A neat workspace can go a long way in terms of making you more productive.Organize papers logically. Papers that you need to review or work on can be in one pile. Papers that have been completed can be in another.
Keep your supplies organized. Have all your basic office supplies (staplers, scissors, pens, etc.) on one part of your desk.

, While you're working on a single task, keep your energy focused there. Do not think about your commute home while you're working on a report, for example. Do not think about the next assignment you need to do while you're working on another assignment. Focusing on one thing at a time will make you more productive, as you'll work more productively when you give a task your full attention.Multitasking is actually bad for productivity. It will take you much longer to try to do three things at once than it will to do one thing at a time.
Instead of bouncing between different tasks, choose one, complete it, and then move on. Avoid things like checking your phone or email while you're trying to complete something.

, If you're not looking forward to a difficult or important task, do it first. This way, important jobs will not fall to the wayside. You will also feel more relaxed after getting a big task done, allowing you to proceed through your day with less stress. This can make you more productive.You can refer to the list you made the night before. What were the three to five things you absolutely needed to do? Start with one of those.
For example, say you're nervous about returning an email to an important client. Rather than putting this off and worrying about it, do it first thing in the morning.

, Part of being productive is cutting yourself some slack on occasion. If you don't take breaks, you'll burn out well before the day is over. Time yourself as you work and grant yourself a small break every 15 to 30 minutes.You can also reward yourself. You may work harder if you know there's a reward coming at the end of a particular task. For example, you can allow yourself to have a piece of candy after finishing one essay. You can grant yourself a 5 minute social media break after you finish planning a presentation.

, At the end of the day, take some time to reflect when you get home. Do not immediately jump into a new task for the day, as this can leave you feeling stressed and burnt out. Instead, sit down and review your day.Think about everything you accomplished. Allow yourself to feel a sense of pride. Congratulate yourself on anything you did right during the day. For example, think something like, ""I'm really glad I spoke up in that meeting today.""
Then, forgive yourself for anything you did wrong. Remind yourself everyone makes mistakes and embrace the fact imperfections and missteps are a normal part of life. For example, ""I know there was a typo in that memo I sent out, but everyone makes mistakes.""

, It's a good idea to have the clothes you're going to wear ready the night before. Choose the outfit you want to wear to work or school the next day. Lay it out near your bed. This way, you won't waste any time scrambling to find clothes when the morning comes around., Doing a little bit of cleaning each day helps you feel more productive at home. Remember, a clean environment helps with a productive mindset. In addition to this, regular cleaning saves you time. If you clean a bit each day, you won't have to spend hours on the weekend doing a big cleanup.If there's a chore you particularly dread, start with that. Once you feel like that's out of the way, you'll free up mental space to handle other chores.
You can separate chores into different days of the week. For example, you can always do laundry on Mondays, dishes on Tuesdays, pay bills on Wednesdays, and so so on.

, You can't be going all the time. It's important to take time each night to give yourself a break. Before bed, do something that keeps you feeling sane and grounded. Choose an activity like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or watching some television. All of this can help you feel more relaxed, preventing burnout which can decrease productivity., Again, make a to-do list. You can keep up the productivity cycle the following day. Remember to write down 3 to 5 tasks you absolutely must do the next day."

Make lists.,
Have deadlines.,
Set reminders.,
Make use of a calendar.,
Plan during your downtime.",How to Improve Time Management Skills2," Make lists of everything you plan on doing that day or that week. Once you're done, cross those things out so that you feel encouraged and motivated. Your list should be realistic and attainable. If you make a list of 20 items but only achieve 5 items on your list, you will feel like you didn’t get anything done.Prioritize your tasks so you know what’s most important and needs to be completed first.
If your list is too long, try having separate lists for different areas of your life such as personal, school/work, and home.
People are typically more productive in the morning. Try to complete a more difficult task from your list in the morning and then handle the other items on your list. You will feel accomplished and can carry that momentum into the rest of your day.

, Your list only works if you actually use it. Setting deadlines will hold you accountable. Do your best to stick to your deadlines. Also be sure to set realistic deadlines that consider your responsibilities and other obligations.For example, if you need to schedule some personal appointments but will be tied up at meetings during work all day, a realistic deadline would be scheduling all of the appointments in the next few days instead of by the end of your busy work day.
Give yourself some room for error when choosing a deadline. The deadline should be a few days before your task has to be finished.

, You can set alarms on your phone, computer, or place visual reminders of the things you have to get done. Use the method that works best for you. It may help to use multiple methods as well. Your reminders should be set for the final deadline and any mini deadlines to keep you on schedule.For example, if you have a task that needs to be completed in 2 weeks, you may have reminders set at day 7, day 10, and day 14.

, Systematize all your daily tasks so you can manage your time efficiently. Always check your calendar at the start of the day and make any necessary changes, so you know all your tasks for the day. Make sure your calendar is easily accessible and highlights all important events.

, You experience downtime throughout your day. You can use that time to make a quick list or set your priorities for the day. Commuting to work/school is an ideal time to get some of this planning done.All of your downtime should not be devoted to planning and organizing. This could become stressful and do more harm than good.
If you have 10 minutes of downtime, start by devoting 2 or 3 minutes to getting organized.

"
Do not multitask.,
Delegate responsibilities if you can.,
Get rid of distractions.,
Take breaks.,
Give yourself incentives.,
Avoid over-scheduling.,
Evaluate your schedule.",How to Improve Time Management Skills3," You may think you are getting more done if you try to juggle a few things at once. However, doing too many things at once, you never give a single task your complete focus and attention. You will be more efficient if you devote all of your energy to complete a task before you move on to the next.For example, instead of answering emails and returning phone calls at the same time; answer all of your emails before you make phone calls.Switching back and forth between tasks is more work for your brain and slows down the process.

, You cannot do everything yourself. Allowing another person to take care of something allows you to devote yourself to another task while still getting everything done. Be sure you delegate to someone that is reliable and trustworthy. You do not want to waste time worrying if the person will get things done.Remember that delegating is a sign of strength and intelligence not weakness.

, You will complete a task more quickly if you can give it your full attention. Turn off any distractions such as email notifications, your phone, television, social media. Set aside time when you do not want to be disturbed and do not address any interruptions unless you have to.For example, if you plan to write or read something for 45 minutes, do not answer your phone or respond to any emails during this time. If you turn off the notifications, you will not even notice that people are trying to get in contact with you. Once the 45 minutes are up, you can check your email.
Social media is a big distraction. Schedule social media time throughout the day and stay away from it unless it is during a scheduled time block.

, You cannot work or be productive 24 hours a day. Schedule breaks throughout your day. A break will allow you to recharge and come back to a task with a fresh perspective.During a scheduled break you may:


Get on social media
Call a friend
Take a walk
Try to do something on your break that is completely unrelated to your task.

, At the start of a task that you don't really feel like doing, promise yourself a reward at the end of it. For example, if you have a writing assignment you need to complete but are in no mood to do, allow yourself to use Instagram for half an hour or less once you're done with the assignment.Make sure your reward is something that you really enjoy.
Your reward should never cause a setback or cause you to get off track.

, It is easy to take on more than you can handle or believe that you can accomplish a task in a shorter amount of time. Try to be realistic and schedule only those things which you think you can achieve in an allocated amount of time. Also, try not to take on a lot of extra work.Learn to say “no” if you are already too busy. If you cannot say no, be honest about your time constraints. For example, if someone asks you to get something done by the end of the day, you may say, “I’m a little overloaded right now, but I can have it to you by the end of tomorrow.”
Over-scheduling can also lead to stress. When you are stressed, you become less productive.

, At the end of each day, take a look at your list. If you did not accomplish everything on your list, what could you have done differently? What things did you do well? Adjust your schedule based on your evaluation.


It will take time to find the best strategies for you. Maybe phone reminders work well, but planning during your downtime makes you super stressed.

Place your alarm clock out of reach.,
Get an advanced alarm clock.,

Don't hit the snooze button.,
Set your alarm clock slightly ahead of your scheduled wake-up time.",How to Get Up on Time1," Whether you need to get up for work or just want to sit down to a nice breakfast with your family in the morning, identifying your reasons for getting up on time can help motivate you to wake up when your alarm clock rings. Take a few minutes before you go to bed to write down your reasons and keep them somewhere immediately visible to you when you wake up. , If you can easily hit snooze in the morning, you will be less likely to get up on time. Set your alarm clock somewhere that you cannot reach it without getting out of bed, like on top of a dresser. , There are all kinds of interesting alarm clocks available that make it more difficult to stay in bed past your wake up time. From blender alarm clocks, to alarm clocks that run away from you, to alarm clock puzzles, to talking alarm clocks, there are plenty of non-traditional alarm clocks to help you get out of bed in the morning.

, Go to bed 30 minutes earlier than you normally would when you need to wake up early. Make sure that you will have enough time to get your recommended amount of sleep. Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep per night, teens need 9-10, and children need 10 or more. , Hitting snooze will not make waking up any easier. In fact, hitting snooze will make you feel groggier and may set the tone for a less productive day overall. Instead, try to get up after the first time your alarm rings. , Although hitting the snooze button has been shown to reduce your overall daily productivity and does not provide you with good quality rest, just in case you do end up hitting the snooze button once or twice, you are better off leaving yourself a little extra time.

, Understand what you need to do. For certain sorts of tasks, you could keep this list in your head


Don't panic or lose your head, even if the list seems long or daunting right now.
Break down larger tasks into manageable parts.

, Is there anything you could delegate? Can you ask for help? Is there anything you can safely do later, perhaps after a deadline? Is there anything you could skip entirely? Are there shortcuts you could take or ways you could speed up the process? Can you ask for more time?


Eliminate any time-wasters or low value activities or leave them on the bottom of the list until you have more time.

, This process can be as formal or as informal as you prefer, but you'll generally have certain tasks that are more important than others, and it's important that you focus on these tasks first.


One way to consider priorities is to consider the impact of each task or sub-task and the consequence of not doing it or letting the deadline slip.

, If there are intermediate goals, give them intermediate deadlines, even if they are approximate.

, Try to state them as a positive (getting a good grade in a class, getting a problem solved) rather than negative (not losing a customer, getting in trouble). Your motivations will fuel your speed and extra effort and determination that you will need to get through the tasks.

, If it's hard to get started, do any little piece that gets you into the task. Generally, any start is better than no start, even if it's not ideal.

, Balance your pace so that you are not working so quickly that you make mistakes that cost you further time.

, As time allows, take short breaks to rest. For a project over many days, this means getting enough sleep that you can stay awake and concentrate. For a one-day project, a couple of minutes every hour will allow you to eat, drink enough water, use the bathroom, stretch (if your task is sedentary) or catch your breath (if it is physically active), etc.


Don't take such long breaks that you lose your momentum. Rather than schedule them strictly, take breaks at natural stopping points in your work.
Breaks can also provide a moment for intermediate planning or discussion if you are working as part of a group. It's a good idea to review your plan along the way and modify either your course or your plan, or both.

, Focus, be persistent, and be consistent. It will help to get through your tasks as efficiently as possible.


If you find yourself losing focus, try to figure out why, and quickly. Are your objectives unclear? Do you need information from others? Are you getting stuck on something? Is your plan inconsistent with your progress or your goals?

,, Let others know you have finished and give them whatever information they need to proceed with the next steps.

, Get ahead of your work

, If you’re stressed, fill your home with blue colors. If you are unmotivated, paper a room with red to inspire your passion.Purchase big sheets of colored paper or cover your area with colored material if you don’t want to make a permanent change.

, Choose an exercise with “flow” like yoga, tai chi, dancing, hiking or boot camp. The bigger the distraction and momentum you gain, the better.


Exercise improves circulation and brain function.

Drink a cup of warm milk.,
Relax your body.,
Don’t watch the clock.,
Turn off your TV, computer, tablet, and other devices with bright screens before you go to bed.,
Take melatonin to help you fall asleep.,
Talk to a sleep specialist.",How to Get Up on Time3," It’s more difficult to wake up on time if you are not getting enough sleep at night. Adults need 7-8 hours of sleep per night, teens need 9-10, and children need 10 or more. Note the time when you go to bed and when you wake up over the course of a week to see how many hours of sleep you get each night. If you are getting considerably less sleep than you should, you will need to make adjustments to your sleep routine. , One reason why you may not be getting enough sleep is that your bedtime is too late. To adjust your bedtime move it back by 15 minutes per night and wake up 15 minutes earlier each day. Do this for as many days as it takes to achieve your desired bedtime. , Chamomile tea is well known for its relaxing qualities. Have a cup before bed to help relax your body and mind. , This well-known technique for making yourself sleepy really does work. About 30 minutes before bedtime, heat up a cup of milk in the microwave for about 60-90 seconds (depending on how powerful your microwave is). , Take a warm shower, do some yoga, or meditate before bed to help relax your body. These relaxing physical activities will also help to calm your mind and prepare you for a restful night’s sleep. , Turn your alarm clock around and avoid checking the time once you have gotten into bed. Constantly watching the clock will make you anxious and also makes it harder for you to fall asleep. , These devices emit light that makes falling asleep and sleeping well more difficult, which is why you should never sleep with these devices on. Ideally, you should shut off these devices at least two hours before your bedtime. If you need a light and/or white noise while you sleep, use a night light and run a fan or play soft music. , If you have a hard time falling and/or staying asleep at night, try taking 0.5-1 milligram of melatonin before you go to bed. Your pineal gland produces melatonin naturally. However, your body’s production of melatonin decreases with age and can also be affected by the seasons, so supplementing with melatonin can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer., If you continue to have sleep issues, you may have a sleep disorder and you should talk to your doctor about possible medications and non-medication treatments.

Don’t drink more than one alcoholic beverage per day and make sure that you allow several hours between consuming an alcoholic beverage and your bedtime. , Regular exercise has been found to increase sleep quality and people who exercise regularly usually sleep longer than those who do not. Studies have also shown that people who exercise regularly are more energetic during their waking hours.Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each day, like taking a brisk walk each morning.

, Complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and heart healthy fats have all been shown to increase serotonin levels and help promote good sleep. Some good choices include whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat bread, whole grain cereal, etc.), fish, chicken, turkey, low fat cheese, and nuts. , Studies have shown that cigarette smoking causes sleep disturbances and makes it more difficult to wake up in the morning. These effects are caused by the nicotine in cigarettes, so other products that contain nicotine(chew, cigars, e-cigarettes, etc.) may also contribute to difficulty falling asleep and waking up. "

Understand the deductive argument.,
Use deductive reasoning to validate your partner’s assumption.,
Apply a deductive argument to a family member’s issue or problem.",How to Use Deductive Reasoning1," When you use a deductive argument, you are trying to prove an argument is valid by showing that the argument’s assumptions are true. The premise of the argument needs to seem strong enough to support a specific conclusion. If the premise of the argument rings true, the argument can be proven as sound or logically correct.For example, you may notice that it’s sunny outside when you wake up. You may then deduce that your husband left the house without an umbrella and not wearing a raincoat. You can then make a deductive argument that your husband will come home without an umbrella and in a sports coat, not a raincoat. Based on an analysis of the premise, you can form a deductive argument and make an assumption that has a high likelihood of being correct.
A deductive argument focuses on making a guaranteed conclusion, where the truth of the conclusion is highly probable. The argument should contain a truth that is implied by the premise. You can conclude your husband is not carrying an umbrella when he gets home, for example, because the premise (sunny skies) implies the truth of your argument or conclusion.;
, There are numerous situations with your spouse or partner where you can use deductive reasoning to validate an assumption. This can vary from smaller assumptions to larger assumptions.For example, your partner may complain that he is always late for work in the morning. He may then make the assumption that he will get to work on time if he leaves the house earlier in the morning. You may then point out that it takes your partner about thirty minutes to get to work every day, regardless of traffic. You can then make a deductive argument: if your partner leaves the house no later than 8:15 am, he can get to work by 8:45 am and not be late for his 9 am day.You have deduced that his thirty minute commute means he must leave by 8:15 am to arrive at work on time. In this way, you are using deductive reasoning to support his assumption.
You may also be in a situation that may have more serious consequences if the deductive argument is not followed. For example, your partner may be allergic to nuts. You can then deduce that he should not eat ice cream that contains nuts, as this could lead to an allergic reaction and serious health issues. The premise, that your partner is allergic to nuts, proves your deductive argument, that your partner should not eat the ice cream that contains nuts.

, Deductive reasoning can also be useful for solving an issue or problem. Often, deductive reasoning comes into play when someone has lost an item or a problem needs to be solved.For example, your sister may tell you she lost her phone charger. Rather than search aimlessly around the house for the charger, you can use deductive reasoning to make an argument for where the charger may be found.
Start by gathering information from your sister in the form of a question and answer. You may ask her, “Who last used the charger?” “When was the last time you used the charger?” “Where do you usually plug in the charger in the house?”
Based on her answers to your questions, you can use deductive reasoning to make an assumption about where the charger can be found. For example, she may answer, “Mom used it yesterday to charge her phone” or “I usually plug it into the bedroom outlet”. If she provides the first answer, you can deduce that your mother may know where the charger is located. If she provides the second answer, you can deduce that the charger is likely in the bedroom outlet.
In both instances, you can use deductive reasoning to reach a conclusion that could be valid and true. It can then lead to recovery of a lost item or the solution to an issue or problem.

Understand deductive reasoning in relation to science and mathematics.,
Apply deductive reasoning to a scientific problem.,
Solve a math problem with a deductive argument.",How to Use Deductive Reasoning2," Deductive reasoning is often used to make inferences in science and math, as you must use formal logic to support a conclusion or a solution. You can use deductive reasoning in a science class or a math class to test an existing theory or hypothesis. In science, you can then support your conclusions with experimental data. In math, you can support your proof with supporting proofs or equations.Deductive reasoning is often represented as the general (X) and the specific (Y). There are three steps to forming a deductive argument.
First: You will note that every X (general) has the characteristic Y (specific). Second: You will note that the thing you are trying to prove is X (the general). Third: You can deduce the thing you are trying to prove has the characteristic Y (the specific).
For example, you may start with the general idea: Every rose has thorns. You may then note: The thing in my hand is a rose. You can then make a deductive argument: Therefore, this thing I am holding can probably prick me.
From this deductive argument, you can do further experiments to find cases where your argument may not be true. For example, you may try to find roses that do not contain thorns or that can be manipulated to not grow thorns. You may also investigate why roses have thorns and what purpose thorns serve on roses.

, You can use deductive reasoning as part of your scientific method in science class. Forming a deductive argument is an important step in a scientific study, as it allows you to make assumptions about your hypothesis and then test those assumptions through experiments. You can then use the data from the experiments to confirm or dispute your hypothesis.Start by observing a phenomenon that forms a problem or question. For example, you may observe in your chemistry class that noble gases are stable.
You may then make a hypothesis by using deductive reasoning. Noble gases are stable. Neon is a noble gas. Therefore, you can deduce that neon is stable.
You can then design an experiment that supports or refutes your hypothesis. This may be an experiment where you test and observe neon’s reaction to certain environments, particularly environments where it is clear when a gas is stable or unstable.
You will then collect the data from the experiment and analyze the data. The data should be given a rigorous analysis to ensure your conclusion is well supported.
Finally, you will make a conclusion using the data. You will need to determine if the experiment refutes or supports your hypothesis, or your deductive argument. If it confirms your hypothesis, you can confirm your deductive argument: Noble gases are stable. Neon is a noble gas. Therefore, neon is stable.

, In mathematics, deductive reasoning can be used to formulate the answer to a mathematical problem. The more complex the mathematical problem is, the more complex your deductive argument (or proof) will need to be.In the most basic form, a deductive argument in mathematics could be represented by: If A=B and B=C, then A=C. This means that you make a general argument: A=B. You then note a more specific argument: B=C. You can then deduce the following argument or proof: A=C.

Use deductive reasoning to solve a company problem.,
Address a client issue with deductive reasoning.,
Settle a dispute between employees with a deductive argument.",How to Use Deductive Reasoning3," You can apply deductive reasoning in your workplace by using it to solve a company wide issue or problem. This logical approach can lead to smarter business practices and higher cost savings, as there will be less guessing and uncertainty around the problem or issue.For example, your company may have difficulty determining how many flats of printer paper to order every month for the office. You may decide to apply deductive reasoning to this issue.
First, you will start by asking several general questions: How often is the printer used each month? How many flats of printer paper did the office use every month for the past four months? Is the amount used consistent every month?
Second, you can use the answers to your general questions to form a deductive argument. If the printer is used every day, fifty times a day, on a constant basis each month, and if the office used an average of 50 flats of paper a month, you can then deduce that there should be an order of 50 flats of paper per month for the office. You have used information to form a premise (50 flats used on average a month) and then formed a deductive argument based on the premise.
You can then place the order and note if the paper lasts for the full month. If so, you can continue to order 50 flats of paper every month. If the paper runs out before the end of the month, you may need to adjust your premise and your deductive argument. However, the logic of your argument is based on a high probability of truth in the premise and will likely be proven true.

, You can apply deductive reasoning in a situation with a client that goes sideways, especially if the client is very logic focused. Deductive reasoning is useful for businesses who are trying to come up with practical solutions to problems or issues. However, it is important that you gather enough supporting information from your client to ensure the solution or deductive argument is based on a solid premise.For example, your client may have an issue with the way you are communicating with her. She may complain that she does not feel she is kept up to date on the status of the project you are both working on.
You can then ask your client several general questions: How can you provide more up to date information? In what ways can you make the client feel more connected? What information would she like to be made aware of in relation to the project?
Your client may note that she would like status reports every week. Based on the client’s answers, you can form a premise: weekly status reports will keep your client happy. You can then deduce that weekly status reports will ensure your client is up to date on the status of the project.
You can apply this deductive argument by providing your client with weekly status reports. The deductive argument has a high probability of being effective, as it is based on a logical and supported premise.

, You can also apply deductive reasoning to a dispute or argument between employees. To do this, you will need to isolate the premise of the dispute and form a deductive argument based on the premise.


For example, you may have one co-worker who claims that his cubicle mate is always forgetting to turn off his computer before he leaves for the day. The cubicle mate may then argue that the co-worker forgets to turn off his computer as well. This could lead to a heated dispute between both employees.
As the mediator, you will need to form a premise that could solve the dispute or the issue. You should ask the employees several questions, including: What tactics could you both use to remember to turn off your computers? How can you both support each other and make sure the computers are always turned off? What tactics are used by other employees to ensure their computers are always turned off?
You can then use the employees’ answers to form a premise. For example, the employees may agree that whoever is the last person in the cubicle will turn off both computers. The premise may then be: the last person in the cubicle is responsible for turning the computers off. You can then deduce that based on this premise, the computers will always be turned off.
Apply this deductive argument as a solution to the dispute between the employees and observe if the argument helps to reduce the dispute. Though it can be difficult to predict human behavior in terms of logic, you can safely assume the solution will work to resolve the dispute, as it is based on a strong premise.

Relax your mind.,
Listen carefully to the question.,
Ask to have the question repeated.,
Repeat the question yourself.,
Stick to the point.",How to Think Fast1," This may sound easier said than done when you need to provide a fast answer on the spot. However, you can calm yourself by using relaxation techniques, such as:



Take deep breaths. You'll slow your heart rate and move more oxygen to your brain.
Repeat a positive and affirming message to yourself. This could be as simple as ""I've got this."" If you often face situations that require quick thinking, you might prepare in advance so a specific phrase comes to mind.

Tense your muscles for a few seconds and then release. The effort will help you concentrate. Choose muscles that cannot be seen such as biceps or thigh muscles -- you don't want to show stress to your questioner.;
, Ensure that you're properly interpreting what the questioner is asking by looking directly at him or her and paying close attention to the question. Remove all distractions, such as by putting away your cell phone, turning off the TV, and closing your laptop.


You can also study your questioner's body language. As the person asks the question, focus on his or her eyes, facial expressions, and body positions. For example, if the person is making eye contact, smiling, and facing towards you, then these are all good indications that he or she is interested in what you have to say. However, keep in mind that facial expressions can be misleading. People are good at masking how they feel with their facial expressions., If you do not understand the question, then politely ask the questioner to repeat the question. It is important to make sure you fully understand what the person is asking. This will give you a little more time to think as well.


Try saying something like, “Can you please repeat the question?”

, You can also repeat the question to yourself to make it easier to understand. Saying it out loud to yourself may help you to understand it better and it will also give you more time come up with an answer.


Don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions. If the question is unclear or uses unfamiliar jargon, a simple clarification could allow you to quickly and competently provide a response. Try saying something like, “Can you please explain what ___ means?” Or, “I don’t quite understand. Can you please rephrase the question?”

, Focusing on one point and one supporting piece of information will help target your initial response. Avoid getting hung up on extraneous detail. If your questioner wants to know more, he or she will ask a follow-up -- and meanwhile, you've demonstrated you can think fast and provide information quickly.For example, if your questioner asks, “How long have you worked in sales?” then your response should be brief. You might respond, “About eight years.” Don’t go into detail about all of the places you have worked in those eight years unless your questioner asks you to do so.

Practice the loving-kindness meditation.",How to Work More Mindfully," Breathing is at the core of mindfulness practice. It’s an easy, free, and always available tool to return to the present moment. Practice mindful breathing by focusing your attention to your breath by counting the number of inhales and exhales you take. Counting your breath helps you to stay present and not be distracted.Use mindful breathing when you feel stressed, overwhelmed, or overcome by intense emotions.Try using an app to help you breathe in a steady rhythm, such as the MyCalmBeat app.;
, Get some time away from your desk and co-workers, especially if you’re feeling tense or stressed. Instead of walking as a function to get somewhere, practice walking by connecting to each step. Focus on how your body feels in movement and what muscles are activated throughout each step. Stay present in observing your movements.Adding movement to your mindfulness practice can help you connect with your body and stay present with how it functions.

, After you send an email, notice how your body feels in your chair. What muscles are activated, what parts of your body are making the most contact? Are you hot, cold, or neutral in temperature? What’s your posture like?


Practice tuning into your senses as often as you can. For example, as you eat your lunch, notice how it tastes and smells, and what it feels like to have a fork in your hand. When you wash your hands, notice the temperature of the water and how it feels on your skin.

, If you’re having an especially busy day and feel overwhelmed by the amount of work to do, take a mindful approach. While many people pride themselves in their multitasking abilities, aim to do one task at a time as a mindfulness practice.When working, minimize your distractions and attend to one task alone. You’ll actually be more productive this way than by multitasking.


For example, if you’re in the middle of writing a report, but suddenly remember you need to send some emails, write a note to remind yourself and stay with your first task. Once you complete it, move on to the emails.

, When someone is speaking, give your full attention to listening. Whether it’s a presentation at a meeting or a co-worker explaining something to you, focus your attention on fully listening without distraction or interruptions.Relate to your co-workers mindfully. Give them your full attention without letting your mind wander or trying to come up with a response. Notice yourself and those around you, paying attention to how you feel and what the person is saying both verbally and nonverbally.This kind of mindfulness practice can help you tune out distractions, improve your attention and help with memory., Humility helps people be successful, work well with others, and not feel superior to those you work with. Having a humble attitude toward work can help you maintain a clear perspective of your role and the roles of others. Practice humility by being grateful, accepting yourself as you are, and listening and learning from others.If someone challenges you, don’t fire back with judgment or criticism. Value the person’s perspective or opinion by withholding judgment and considering what benefits he or she may be pointing out.

, Long before you start your work, do mindfulness first thing in the morning. When you first wake up, don’t reach for your phone, go back to sleep, or start going through your list of to-dos for the day. Instead, practice a mindfulness exercise such as deep breathing. This will help set the tone for the day. By practicing mindfulness first thing when you wake up, you can help remind yourself to stay mindful throughout the day.Don’t allow thoughts or expectations of the day to creep into your mind. If you start to get distracted, gently bring yourself back to the moment.

, If walking into work stresses you out, start your day off with some mindfulness. You may be bombarded with emails, tasks, or questions from co-workers, but tune it out for a few moments and tune into yourself. Take 5-10 minutes at your desk (or in your car) and focus on your breath. Close your eyes and count each exhale. If your mind starts to wander, release the distraction and come back to your breath.By starting your day with mindfulness, you can begin your workday with more ease and focus instead of hectic chaos.

, Pair certain sounds, times, or events with being mindful. For example, every time you are notified of a new email, remind yourself to take a deep breath. Or, place a photo on your desk and each time you look at it, remind yourself to stay present. Having reminders at your workplace can help you stay mindful throughout your day.Set an alarm on your phone every few hours to remind you to take a deep breath and focus on your work mindfully. Take a few moments to reset and approach your work in a mindful manner.

, Apply your mindfulness techniques to even the most mundane tasks throughout your day.For example, mindfully pick up your pen, dial a phone number, or sharpen a pencil. Any task can be done with mindfulness, even waiting in a waiting room!


Give your full attention to whatever task is at hand. Observe yourself performing these tasks. For example, say in your head, “I am picking up my mug. I am drinking coffee. I am placing my mug on my desk.”

, You may endure a difficult meeting or unpleasant run-in with a co-worker. Instead of dwelling on the bad feelings, remind yourself that negative emotions come and go and they do not define you.If you often let a pesky co-worker ruin your day, this is a great practice to free you from your negative thought patterns.


If the copy machine breaks again or someone ate your lunch and it’s affecting your thoughts or emotions, say to yourself, “I’m upset or frustrated right now, but I know the feeling will pass. I can move on with my day and be okay.”

, Acceptance is a core principle of mindfulness. Find ways to accept each moment as it is without judging it or wanting it to be different. A lack of acceptance can lead to denial, avoidance, and aggression. Instead, learn to accept situations quickly, learn from mistakes, and move on.For example, if you miscalculate your expenses and your budget report is off, don’t try to cover it up or pretend it didn’t happen. The mistake has already been made and there’s no going back. Acknowledge your mistake, talk to anyone who may be involved, learn from the experience, and move on. No need to dwell on it.

, If you’re feeling overwhelmed or just needing some time away from your work, take a short break and practice a mindfulness exercise. This can help you focus on the present moment and get away from stress and anxiety. You may want to briefly leave your office or desk.


Take a mindful minute: time one minute and count the number of breaths you take during this time. Do this before a big meeting to help keep your calm.Try the raisin exercise: take a raisin (or other food) and slowly use all of your senses to observe it in detail. See how it feels to touch it and notice the texture, see what it looks like from near and far, notice the smells and how your body reacts to the scent, and lastly, put it in your mouth and savor the flavor., You may worry that your project won’t be well-received or that you didn’t prepare enough for the meeting. Even if you’re having a horrible day, find something that is going well for you. That way you can increase your gratitude and positive thoughts to help you find the silver lining.Try using a gratitude app or record three things that you are grateful for in a journal every day.
By finding things you can be grateful for, you can increase your ability to find things to be grateful for in the future and not dwell on negative events or situations.
For example, you may feel flustered that you will be late to work and will be late to a meeting. In this moment, be grateful that you have transportation and for a way to contact your work to let them know you will be late.

, If a co-worker seems to be getting on your every nerve, don’t act out in anger or frustration. Instead, flip the script and practice kindness instead. Go somewhere you will not be distracted, sit down, and relax. In your head, say these phrases, “May I be healthy. May I be happy. May I benefit others in their day today.” Once you’ve said this, repeat these phrases for a loved one, such as your partner, parent, or friend. Then, say it for the person who is bothering you. Finally, end the meditation for all beings everywhere.It will look something like this: “May I be healthy. May I be happy. May I benefit others in their day today. May my aunt be healthy. May my aunt be happy. May she benefit others in their day today. May my co-worker be healthy. May my co-worker be happy. May he benefit others in their day today.”

Learn the seven techniques.,
Be curious.,
Ask questions.,
Try puzzles.,
Use the IDEAL method of problem solving.,
Tackle practical problems.,
Become a critical thinker.,
Practice creativity.,
Keep a journal.,
Ask ""what if"" questions.,
Find creative solutions.,
Embrace challenges.,
Demonstrate initiative.",How to Think Laterally," Lateral thinking is a term that was coined by author Edward de Bono. Essentially, thinking laterally means to find new perspectives and new ways to address challenges. Many others have adapted and used de Bono's original principles, which were based on these seven techniques:Alternatives: Look for different ways to solve problems
Focus: Train your brain to think more clearly
Challenge: Think in nontraditional ways
Random entry: Be open to different lines of thought
Provocation: Turn a provocative situation into something useful
Harvesting: Choose the best of your new ideas
Treatment of ideas: Alter ideas to fit different scenarios;
, A key component in lateral thinking is curiosity. An inquisitive mind is more likely to be able to adapt to the core principles of lateral thinking. In order to be able to think outside the box, you need to learn to spark your own curiosity.Take time to wonder. Don't just pass by a construction site, for example. Stop and think, ""I wonder what they are building here. I bet you have to have a lot of different permits to build in this neighborhood.""
Try making a list of things you are curious about. You can keep a small notebook on you and jot down thoughts when you are out and about.

, Creative (or lateral) thinking depends on your willingness to ask questions. Train your brain to start questioning information as you process it. You can apply this to things you read, watch, and conversations.For example, if a friend tells you that they are voting for a certain candidate, ask questions. You can say, ""What factors are you basing that on? What is your opinion on climate change?""
You can question things you read, too. For example, if you are reading an article about the decline of the bee population, ask yourself some questions like, ""How could this impact the environment? What are some ways I could be part of a solution?""

, Lateral thinking won't happen over night. It will take time to train your brain. In addition to being curious and questioning, you can help the process by engaging in certain activities, like puzzles.Certain types of puzzles, such as brain teasers, are great for helping hone your problem solving skills.
You can find puzzles online, or buy a book full of them. Logic puzzles are also great!

, Lateral thinking can make a big difference in your everyday life. Once you have started changing your mindset, you will begin to look at everyday issues with a new perspective. Combined with your other new skills, using the IDEAL method to solve problems is useful. IDEAL stands for:Identify the problem
Define the problem
Examine the options
Act on a plan
Look at the consequences

, Once you have learned the IDEAL method, you can apply it to practical problems. For example, maybe you are trying to figure out how to make your dog obey commands. You could apply lateral thinking to solve this issue.First, ask questions. You might say, ""Why is my dog acting this way? Has something in his life changed? When did this start?""
Then, apply the IDEAL method. Make sure to use creativity when brainstorming options!

, Critical thinking is a major component of being able to think laterally. Thinking critically means that you are evaluating information, asking questions, and looking at issues from different perspectives. There are ways to enhance your critical thinking skills.Work on clarifying the problem. For example, maybe you and your partner have not been getting along lately. Clarify the problem by examining what is really going on.
Ask yourself questions such as, ""Is the other person under a lot of stress at work? Is either of us focusing on our relationship?""
Once you clarify the problem, you can further your critical thinking by gathering information and looking at the issue from all sides.

, Creative thinking is essential for applying lateral thinking to your everyday life. It may not come naturally to you. Try to actively train your brain to look for creative solutions for everyday problems.Brainstorm. For example, maybe you want to find money in your budget for a great vacation. Make a list of all of the ways you could save money or make more money.
Be open to alternatives. Be willing to try some of the nontraditional ideas you come up with when you brainstorm.
Ask for input. Have your friends and family help you come up with new ideas. Don't be afraid to try a new solution!

, Learning to think laterally is a process. Some days you may not feel like you are really ""getting it"". Try keeping a journal of your various thoughts each day.Choose a time each day to write in your journal. It could be in the morning, or right before bed.
Make note of any challenges that you faced throughout the day. Write down the different approaches you used to solve the problem.
Once a week, take time to read through your journal. You might be surprised at how much progress you are making!

, Lateral thinking can be a great asset as you work to advance your career or impress your boss. No matter what you job is, you will be more successful if you are able to demonstrate critical thinking and problem solving skills. You can start doing this by asking ""what if"" questions.


Approach with this method. For example, if you are in sales, try asking, ""What if a similar product comes on the market? How will we promote our product?""
You could also try, ""What if our sales drop? How will we adjust our approach?""
By approaching problems with questions, you are opening yourself up to view all possibilities and options.

, Thinking lateral can help you find innovative ways to solve problems. When faced with an issue, tap into your creativity. You can help your team by coming up with new ideas.Maybe your company is growing and you need new office space. You can think outside the box and come up with some great ideas.
Start brainstorming. Write down anything that comes to mind such as, ""New neighborhood? Build our own building? Share space with another company?""
Flesh out the ideas that could work--and remember to be open to change!

, Every job comes with challenges. Your boss will be impressed if you show that you are not intimidated when an issue arises. When problems come up, try saying, ""This is a good opportunity for us to find some new solutions. Let's think creatively and find a way to make this a positive situation.""Maybe you work for a non-profit. If you need to raise more fund, prove that you are up to the challenge.
You could say, ""How can we meet more members of the community? What if we all use our professional networks and reach out to new potential sponsors.""

, Your ability to think laterally will be one of your greatest assets. Don't wait until a problem arises to show off your skills! If you see an area that needs change, go for it.For example, you could try saying to your boss, ""I notice our third quarter numbers are great. Do you have time this week to listen to some ideas I have about how to make them even better?""
Use your meeting to show that you have thought critically and creatively about your plan.

Prepare ""what if"" scenarios.,
Practice speaking and writing clearly.,
Ensure you are well-informed.,
Turn off electronics and other distractions.,
Minimize multitasking.",How to Think Fast2," Chances are that people at your place of work, school, or other commitments make routine requests of you. Take some time when you're not under pressure to consider situations that might call for quick thinking and plan out how you could respond to these questions.


For example, your teacher might ask you a question related to something you read for class, such as, “What was the name of the main character?” or “What did you think of the book?” Consider questions that your teacher might ask and try to prepare your answers in advance so that you do not have to pause for an answer.

, Clear communication will help you quickly share information with others and avoid misinterpretation.


Work to eliminate vocal tics such as excessive ""ums"" and ""uhs.""
Utilize non-verbal cues such as eye contact and well-placed pauses.
Use proper grammar.
Gauge the formality of a given situation and determine how to respond appropriately., Be aware of project details and background information so you aren't caught off-guard. Gain experience in your particular field and you'll have the foundations to quickly draw informed conclusions.For example, if you are a nurse who works with psychiatric patients, then learning as much as you can about psychiatric nursing interventions may help you to respond quickly in different situations.

, If you know a situation will call for fast thinking, eliminate distractions that may draw your focus from the task at hand.


Eliminate extraneous noise such as the radio, television, or music playing through headphones.
Close out of social media accounts and extra tabs in your Internet browser while working., Concentrating on one task at a time will keep your mind focused and allow you to respond more quickly when faced with a question or a problem. Try to stay focused on only one task at a time, even if you are busy.


For example, if you have a line of customers waiting for service and the phone is ringing, then choose one thing to focus on. For example, you might want to focus on the customers in front of you first and allow someone else to get the phone, or even let it go to voicemail. Or, if you have lots of homework to do, then pick one assignment to work on. Complete that assignment, and then move on to the next one.

"
"
Cultivate a growth mindset.,
Undertake activities that promote fast thinking.,
Use all your senses.,
Prioritize the tasks you give your brain.,
Repeat the information you really want to know.",How to Think Fast3," Studies show that learning from your mistakes improves your mental processes. Believe you can get better at thinking fast and you will! Take the time to examine your successes, but even more importantly, examine your failures. View mistakes as a necessary step in gaining knowledge., Your brain is a muscle that responds to training. As an added benefit, partaking in activities that promote quick thinking can actually improve your mood. You'll feel happier and more creative at the same time you are honing your fast-thinking skills.Try reading comprehension games. Read an article or book chapter as quickly as you can, then give yourself 20 seconds to summarize it quickly.
Go through the alphabet and recite words or names for every letter. Do this as quickly as you can, or try and come up with a given number of words for each letter.
Play games that use timers.
Try online quizzes or apps that provide brain-training activities.
Quickly name lists of things you've done or seen recently -- cars, books, movies, etc.Play improvisation games with a friend or colleague.

, The more senses you use, the more parts of your brain will recall the information you'd like to recover quickly. Associate colors, scents, or physical sensations with words or ideas.


For example, while reading a newspaper article, you might be able to remember the information better if you pay attention to the sensory details, such as the way the author describes someone’s appearance or actions.

, Use a calendar to keep track of events so you aren't committing precious brain space to information that is easily recorded for later reference.


For example, you can write down any appointments that you have, bill due dates, or to-do list items.

, Reciting information out loud or writing it down will reinforce the neural pathways that form memory.Try to recite important information to make it easier to recall that information quickly.


For example, you might want to recite the date of an important presentation or recite the names of your new classmates.

"
"
Exercise regularly.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Maintain good emotional health.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Think Fast4," Research shows regular exercise increases the number of tiny blood vessels that carry oxygen to your brain. Exercise also lowers blood pressure and helps you manage stress.When faced with a particularly stressful situation, take a walk. The combination of exercise and an alteration in your physical environment will help refocus your brain and stimulate faster thinking.

, Your brain requires a lot of energy to function properly, so it's important to eat food that will stimulate clear thinking.Some foods are better for your brain while other foods may lead to brain fog.Consume foods such as fortified cereals, whole grains, salmon, flax seeds, blueberries, turmeric, and leafy green vegetables to help keep your brain healthy.
Reduce your consumption of saturated fats and unhealthy cholesterol from animal sources or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.

, People who are anxious or depressed tend to score lower on cognitive tests. Talk to a friend, seek counseling, or consult your doctor if you believe you are suffering from excessive anxiety or depression., Sleep deprivation and exhaustion also tend to cause low results on cognitive tests. Young adults and adults need seven to nine hours of sleep to maintain healthy function. Your brain will not fire quickly if it's tired."

Get out in nature.,
Engage in brain training that is especially rigorous.,
Stop relying on machines for basic brain functions, so that you can exercise your brain.,
