Wash your hands, your nose, and the nose stud!,
Insert your corkscrew-style nose stud.,
Check that it's in properly.,
Remove your corkscrew-style nose stud.",How to Take Your Nose Stud in and out of Your Nose2," Whenever changing any piercing start by washing your hands. You don't want bacteria or infections getting into a piercing. Wash the area around your nose stud, whether you have a stud in or not. Also wash the nose stud itself.


It is really important to clean the piece of metal that you are sticking into your body. Germs on the stud could transfer straight to your nose, so make sure the stud is clean.
It's a good idea to use a saline solution or a mild antiseptic solution to make sure the area is really clean but you can use hydrogen peroxide or plain soap too. Either way, make sure that the cleaner is washed off and the stud is dry before inserting it.

, A corkscrew-style stud is a simple piece of wire with a decorative end that is twisted in a loose spiral towards the other end. It can be a little more difficult to insert than other types of nose studs because it is twisted in an unusual shape.


To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole.
When you're sure that the end of the stud is through to the other side (you can feel the inside of your nose to make sure that it is) slowly push a little bit more of the stud in while simultaneously twisting the stud so the spiral of wire flows into the hole.
The L-shaped nose stud is fully in when the decorative end of the stud is up against the outside of your nose.

, To make sure that you've put in your nose stud correctly, lift up your nostril a bit and look in the mirror. You should be able to see the end of the corkscrew stud inside your nose. The end should be positioned so that you are not able to feel it. If you can feel it poking the inside of your nose, readjust it's position.

, Taking the stud out of your nose is simple if you remember that inside your nose it is shaped like a spiral. Begin pulling it out, holding onto the decorative end, and allow the stud to twist naturally as it comes out. Its easiest if you have a loose grip on the decorative end and allow the stud to move naturally as it comes out. No need to force it, this will only end up hurting.


Like when you put the stud in, remember to have clean hands and a clean area around the nose stud!

, A hoop-style stud is a simple piece of wire that has been shaped into a circle, with a small gap between the ends of the wire. To insert it you will slip the opening in the hoop over your nostril, taking one of the ends of the hoop and putting it in your nose. The goal is to put the end of the wire that is in your nose through the piercing, going from inside out. This may take a little bit of feeling around with the ring but you should be able to push it through the hole, making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. Gently rotate the ring through your piercing until the opening of the circle is at the bottom of your nose.


There are several styles of hoop nose studs, ones that close the gap with a bead and ones that have a ball at one end of the gap that keeps the hoop in your nose. Either way, inserting and removing the hoop is similar.
If you have a bead attachment, this is when you will pop it into place between the two ends of the ring. If you have the other style, just simply keep rotating your nose hoop until the ball at the end is up against the inside of your nose.

, With a hoop nose stud this should be obvious. If it is comfortable and feels secure then you have done it right.

, Taking the stud out of your nose is as simple as moving the ring around until the end of the hoop comes out of the piercing, and then sliding it down and out of your nose. Allow the stud to move naturally as it comes out. No need to force it, this will only end up hurting.


Like when you put the stud in, remember to have clean hands and a clean area around the nose stud!
When purchasing a hoop nose stud, remember that the diameter of the hoop needs to be at lease as long as the distance between your nose piercing and the bottom of your nostril, so that it will fit easily around your nostril.

, A nose bone type nose stud is a straight piece of metal with a decorative piece on one end and a small bulb of metal on the other end. To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the round end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole.


You may need to hold your nostril taught with your other hand to get the small ball to go through the opening. This can definitely be a bit uncomfortable and for a lot of people it is a bit painful.
Feel free to do this slowly, pushing only a little bit at a time. You will know when the end of the stud is through to the other side, as the decorative end of the stud will be up against the outside of your nose.

, To make sure that you've put in your nose stud correctly, lift up your nostril a bit and look in the mirror. You should be able to see the end of the stud inside your nose. Twist it around a little bit to make sure its in well. If you can feel it or its just uncomfortable, readjust it's position.


Nose bone type nose studs are easy to insert but that also means that they can come out of your nose pretty easily. Be aware of this and take care that it doesn't fall out or your piercing might close up. , Taking out your nose stud is simple but a little uncomfortable. Pull it straight out of your nose, while holding onto the decorative end with one hand and pulling your nostril taught with the other hand.


Be sure to do this gently, as getting the bulb through your piercing can be uncomfortable. Remember to take your time because a nose piercing can be sensitive to pressure and force.
Once again, make sure your hands and the area around the piercing are clean before handling your nose stud!

Soil the baselines.,
Anchor your bases.,
Create a pitcher’s mound.,
Anchor your pitcher’s rubber.,
Finish the batter’s area.,
Create two foul lines.,
Erect a backstop.",How to Set up a Baseball Diamond3," Use a sod cutter to remove the marked turf. Slice the turf into strips along each baseline, creating a bare path of earth that is 3 feet wide. Roll the strips up and remove them from the area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt.Use a mix that’s 50-75% sand and 25-50% clay and silt. A mix that’s too sandy will be unstable underfoot, while a mix with too much clay and silt will be too hard and compact.

, For each base, dig a 2’ x 2’ hole, 8.5” deep, where the base will be. Level the bottom and then set your anchor inside. Before burying the anchor, attach the base to the anchor's post. Double-check the anchor's placement by remeasuring the base’s distance from the back tip of home plate. Reposition the anchor if necessary. Then fill the hole back in with soil.Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the base will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more.
Remember that for second base, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the center of second base. For first and third bases, you’re measuring from the back tip of home plate to the foul-side corner of each base.
The top of your anchor post should be roughly a half-inch below the top of your hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the top of the post to double-check the distance before burying the anchor.

, Remove the marked turf within your pitcher’s mound. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. For adults, build your mound until the center rises 10 1/2 inches higher than home plate. For Little League, make your mound 6 inches at its highest.Then create the “slope” in front of the pitcher’s rubber by removing 1 inch of soil from the mound for every foot in front of the rubber, starting one foot out, until the soil reaches ground level at the edge of the mound.For the pitcher’s mound, use a mix that’s 40% sand, 20% silt, and 40% clay.

, Dig a 10” x 23” hole, 9.5” deep, where the rubber will be, with the longer side parallel to the front of home plate. Level the bottom, place the anchor inside, and stake it into position. Press soil along the base of each tube in the anchor to prevent concrete from leaking inside. Then fill the area surrounding the anchor with concrete without covering the anchor itself. Once the concrete has dried, withdraw the stakes and plug the anchor’s tubes. Refill the hole with soil. Then unplug the tubes and attach the rubber.When you first place the anchor into the hole, attach the rubber. Double-check the anchor’s placement by measuring the distance between each of the rubber’s front corners with those of home plate to make sure they’re equidistant. Then gently remove the rubber without moving the anchor out of position.
Compact the soil at the bottom of your hole to make sure your anchor doesn’t settle any farther down over time. Make sure the bottom is level so that the rubber will be, too. Also make sure that the soil you shovel back into the hole is compact by adding only small amounts at a time and packing that in before shoveling in more.
The top of each tube should be 1.5” below the top of the hole. Lay a 2x4 over the hole and measure the distance between its bottom and the tubes’ tops to double-check the distance before pouring concrete.

, Remove the marked turf within your batter’s area. Replace the turf with a mix of sand, clay, and silt. Then outline your batter’s and catcher’s boxes with chalk.Batter’s boxes (for both left-handed and right-handed players) are 4 feet wide and 6 feet long for adults, while those in Little League are 3 feet wide and 6 feet long. Measure the boxes so their midpoints are even with that of home plate. Allow six inches of free space between each box and home plate.The catcher’s box is 43 inches wide and 8 feet long for adults, and 25 inches wide and 8 feet long for Little League. Measure your box so that it’s center is even with that of home plate., For each, begin your measurement from the back corner of home plate. From there, measure a distance of 325 feet along the outside of the square created by the baselines. At that distance, plant a pole marker. Then stretch a lining cord between the back corner of home plate and the pole marker. Chalk directly over the lining cord to create your foul line.Also an install a protective fence that extends 400 feet from home plate behind each foul line to shield spectators.

, Protect spectators behind the batter’s area from missed pitches and stray balls. Install a backstop 60 feet behind home plate for adult players; for Little League, install it 25 feet behind home plate. Failing that, plant hedges instead to catch stray balls.Standard-sized backstops stand 30 to 40 feet high and measure 30 feet wide directly behind home plate, with 40-foot extensions running parallel with the baselines from either end. For a 30-foot height, dig foundation holes 2 feet in diameter and 7.5 feet deep for the supports. For a 40-foot height, make your holes 9.5 feet deep. Once they are placed inside each hole, secure the poles firmly in place by filling the hole with concrete."
"
Get into throwing position.,
Get the right grip.,
Move your joints correctly.",How to Throw a Baseball1," Before you make any throw, your entire body should be shifted into the “ready position” for throwing. Your feet should be shoulder width apart with knees slightly bent, your body should be relaxed, and your hips and shoulders should be lined up.









Start with the ball held in your glove near your chest. This places it in a good location for you to make a quick throw.
Make sure your feet aren’t staggered. You will start your throw with your feet at a level distance, and then take a step away as you throw. You should not take this step before beginning to throw though.
When you throw the ball, you will keep your feet and shoulders in line similar to in the ready position.
Stay alert and focused whenever you are preparing to throw. Even if you are waiting around before practice, avoid dawdling while you stand and practice your throwing stance.;
, Once you’ve gotten into position, the next step is to hold the ball. Although simply holding the ball may seem easy, it is necessary to use the proper grip. Place your index and middle finger across one of the rows of seems, with your thumb forming a third gripping-point directly underneath. Your ring and pinky fingers should curl slightly behind the ball and aid in supporting it.









Holding the ball along the seams correctly positively influences the speed and direction of the throw. When held this way, your throw is more likely to be straight rather than a curved lob.
Keep the ball out on your fingertips and not in the palm of your hand. Palming the ball will cause a slower release time, which worsens your accuracy and speed.
Ideally, your grip should allow you to contact all four seams at once. This is difficult at first, but practicing holding the ball in this fashion from the get-go will give you improved throwing over time.
At first you may have to look at the ball to line up the seams with your correct fingers, but as you practice you should be able to feel the correct finger placement without looking, using only touch.

, One of the most important parts of making a good throw is moving your joints in the correct manner. This includes your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. In good throwing, all three of these should be moved together. If any of these joints is stiff and doesn’t move when you throw, practice actively moving each during every wind-up.









When you wind-up for your throw, your arm should swing loose in your shoulder socket. To practice your ability to move your shoulder freely, do windmill arm exercises. Rotate your arms in wide forward-facing circles around your shoulder.
Make sure you keep a bent elbow during each throw. Although you use a windmill-like motion to bring the ball back and around your body, your elbow should bend in the process. A stiff elbow will limit the distance of your throw.
Think of your wind-up as a cross between making a windmill circle and pulling a bow and arrow. Your elbow should be bent, but will wind-up behind your torso in a circular rotation.
Your wrist should be incredibly flexible and used heavily in each throw. As the saying goes, “it’s all in the wrist.” Just prior to releasing the ball, your wrist should be bent back so that your palm is facing forward. As you throw the ball, you will flick your wrist downwards in a strong motion. This will give your throw momentum and increase its accuracy.\

"
"
Get into position.,
Aim the ball before you throw it.,
Wind up your arm.,
Move your body forward with your throw.,
Maintain eye contact with your target as you throw.,
Have a strong follow through with your throw.,
Check your finished throwing stance.",How to Throw a Baseball2," Once you are sure of your stance, grip, and joint movement, put the three together to throw the ball. Your torso should be turned away from your target, and you should be holding the ball in your throwing hand near your chest.








, If you want your throw to be accurate, you need to be sure of where you want it to go. If you are throwing to a partner, always aim for their chest. Feel free to use your glove to point at your target, as this will help your body to line up into position.








, Bring the ball back and around your body for your wind-up. You should bring your elbow back and around, allowing it to open and close as you rotate your arm. As you bring your arm around in front of you, release the ball when it lines up with your target.








, As you prepare to release the ball, take a step towards your target with your leg opposite your throwing hand. If you are right-handed, you will take a step with your left foot. Simultaneously, rotate your hips towards your target.








, Your throw will follow your eyes, so if you are looking around or not paying attention, you will not hit your target with the ball.








, After you release the ball, your throwing arm should continue downwards and land on your opposite hip. This will give power to your throw and increase your accuracy.








, Your feet should be a bit wider and staggered because of your throw, your hips will be turned, facing your target, and your throwing arm should be diagonally across your body with your hand on your opposite hip.







"
"
Practice flicking your wrist.,
Practice your follow through.,
Practice your aim.",How to Throw a Baseball3," If you find that you have a difficult time getting that extra flick of the wrist in at the release of every throw, try this for practice. Kneel on the ground with a partner, spaced about 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) apart. You don’t need to use your mitt for this, as you won’t be throwing hard enough to cause an injury.









Bend your throwing elbow so that it is vertical, or parallel to your torso. You won’t be winding up your arm for this, so stiffen your shoulder and elbow joints to hinder movement.
Use your non-throwing hand to hold the elbow of your throwing arm. You are doing this to prevent it from moving, so cup the front of your elbow tight enough that you will block your forearm from moving forward.
Throw the ball by flicking your wrist only. You should start with the correct ball grip and your wrist tilted slightly back, and then toss the ball forward by flicking your wrist downwards sharply. You are using your wrist to provide all the momentum of the throw; don’t use any other part of your body.
As you practice this, move a few steps further back. This will strengthen the power of your wrist and help you to use this motion even at a distance. You should never exceed 20 feet (6.1 m) from your partner though, so that you don’t accidentally cause injury to yourself or your partner.

, If you have problems with making strong, fast throws while maintaining accuracy, it may have to do with your follow through. To do this exercise, kneel on one knee (your throwing knee) on the ground about 10 feet (3.0 m) away from your partner. Practice softly throwing the ball, focusing on your form and windup.









As you release the ball, bring your arm completely across your body so that your throwing hand rests on the other side of your opposite thigh. If you were standing, your arm would rest on your hip.
You should not focus on speed or strength for the exercise. Concentrate solely on the accuracy of your throw and your follow through.
Make sure that although you are bringing your arm totally across your body, that you are still releasing the ball when it lines up with the target in front of you. Releasing the ball too early or too late will cause it to go off target.
As you feel more confident in your follow through, slowly move further back while still kneeling. Eventually, use this same practice while standing.

, With good wrist-movement and follow-through, you are on the road to perfect aiming. To practice your aim, stand with a partner a short distance away (10-15 feet). Use the aforementioned exercises to throw the ball to the other person.









Before each throw, stick out your gloved hand to point at the chest of the other person. Simultaneously, take a small step with the same foot.
Practice this without gloves, so that you are focused on aim rather than strength.
As you throw, keep your eyes on your partner’s chest. You should never release eye contact, until they have caught the ball. Pointing, taking a step, and maintaining eye contact should help to perfect your aim.
Move further and further back, and begin using your glove if necessary while practicing your aim.

Find a good place to play wall bat, such as a gym or a tall school.,
Pick your captains by the oldest, second oldest, and youngest.,Organize a batting order that will bring your team the maximum amount of points.,
If you are the batter.,
If you are the catcher.",How to Play Wall Bat," You would need a big open area and a very big wall and make sure that there are no windows in your playing field.;
, Pick two people, then pick one person until all the players are on an even and fair team. Determine who will pitch and who will catch for defense.

The batter should be 20 yards away from the wall and the catchers of the other team 10 yards away from the wall and the pitcher should be 5 yards (4.6 m) away from the wall.

,,

Throw the tennis ball very hard at the bottom of the wall sending the ball back in the way of the batter if you are the pitcher.Calculate where the ball will end up then go there if you are the batter.
Try to smack the ball with the bat so that the ball reaches high up on the wall. The ball will bounce off the wall and it will be the catcher's turn to make a play.

,

You have two options if you are catcher.Catch the ball and get 1 out or drop it and let the player start running.When the player runs, he must be tagged with direct contact from the tennis ball. Remember you cannot throw the ball at the runner unless you are playing with a softball or you are using street rules. Street rules involve horrible pitches and throwing the ball at the runner.
Get 3 outs in order to switch the defense and the offense meaning the offense becomes defense and vice versa.The game ends when there are 6 switches or one team scores 20 points,whichever is earlier.
Get to the starting base, but to do so, he must run all the way around to 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and back to home to score points. This puts 2 points on the board. Stop at the 3rd base to get 1 point. This makes the point process slower, but it is very effective and puts points on the board at least.
Jail an opponent to score on defense. Tag him on the run before he gets to base 2 to jail an opponent. He is a prisoner on your team for the rest of the switch unless he drops a catch. He will go back to the opposing team and the defense scores 2 points and the offense loses 1 point.

Wear a basic color.,
Wear a fun color.,
Play with patterns.,
If you work in a somewhat creative setting, you could also consider wearing a smart t-shirt with your suit.,
Nix the shirt altogether and wear a turtleneck with your suit.",How to Wear the Same Suit All Week1,"


A crisp white shirt always looks good.
A light blue shirt is another common option.;
,


Break out of the usual mold with a shirt in a fun color, like pink.
Try a black shirt to add a little edge to your look.

,


Wear stripes in any color for a professional but fun look.
Novelty prints can come off as unprofessional in a work environment, so leave those for home.

, Vintage tees are a great item to add to a suit to bring out your individuality and personal style.

, A thin turtleneck made of a silk or cashmere blend will add style while allowing you to remain conservative at work.

"
"
Play with your ties.,
Neatly place a handkerchief in your breast pocket that matches either the color of your shirt or your tie; this can pull all the colors of your outfit together.

,
Switch up the shoes


For men, try different colored dress shoes (if that is what is required) or loafers.,
Add jewelry to make your suit look different each time you wear it.",How to Wear the Same Suit All Week2," A tie is the part of an outfit a man can have the most fun with, so experiment with different colors, patterns, or textures. The great thing about a cool tie is that it is playful yet still professional, and shows personality. By looking closely at the fabric of your suit, you’ll also notice that it’s made up of a few colors rather than just one. For example, a gray suit could actually have gray, brown and pink in the tread of the fabric. Identify those colors of your suit and showcase them in your tie selections.

,, This is a little difficult since these shoes don’t come in many colors, but if you rotate between 3 or even 2 pairs (e.g., black, brown and camel), you’ll keep the outfit fresh. You can also have 2 or 3 pairs of the same color shoes (e.g., brown) but they come in different finishes (Patten leather, alligator and suede). The different finishes will all cater to a slightly different look that could further improve the versatility of your suit.
Women could consider rotating colors as well, but also rotating the style. Wear a flat one day, a heel the next, then switch on and off in that same pattern.

,


For men, cufflinks or watches are pretty standard ‘jewelry’ and can be switched fairly often. You don’t need to have a watch for every day of the week, but switching out the bands can be a nice way to change the look just a little. If you wear cufflinks, collect a few pairs you like, and keep them on rotation. You can also experiment with tie clips if you regularly wear ties with your suit.
For women, keep the jewelry classy and not too over the top, but still have fun, show personality, and rotate pieces to ensure a fresh look. If you wear a great bracelet one day, try a statement necklace the next day, and some nice earrings the day after that. You could also take some of the tips on how to accessorize the little black dress and apply them to dressing up your suit.

Strive to get the first out in every inning.,
Always throw to the next base.,
Wait for the right moment to reach third.,
Check the outfielders' positions before running.,
Make sure first is covered.,
Play full out.",How to Win a Baseball Game1," Getting the first out stops the other team from gaining momentum. Additionally, it's harder for the other team to get runs once they have on out on the board., That is, when a runner is rounding the bases, always toss the ball to the base in front of the runner. Throwing ahead makes it easier to get the runner out., Coaches and players know that they should only run to third base on the first and last out if they know they can make it easily. It's not worth running if they aren't sure they can make it., While it's important to check with the base coach and to look at the number of outs, it's also important for the players to note where outfielders are playing. That way, they know when to run when the ball is hit. If it's hit between outfielders, it's time to run hard., When a ball is hit to right field, make sure your first basemen knows to be on the base. If she's not there, your team could be missing out on too many outs., When balls are going towards outfield, players should be attempting to stop them in the infield by hitting them down with their gloves. It's much easier to get an out if the ball is stopped in the infield."
"
Increase players' speed.,
Use fast runners to steal bases.,
Increase speed to beat out infield hits.,
Encourage runners to score from first or second.",How to Win a Baseball Game2," Increasing speed is important, because the faster that players run the bases, the more runs they'll score. One way to increase players' speed is through strength-training exercises.Try squats. With your legs set apart and toes pointed outward, lower yourself towards the floor. You should stop when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Stand back up and repeat. This exercise builds up leg muscles.Try hill sprints. On a slight incline, run up the hill, increasing speed in short bursts. Slow down between bursts. These exercises build up speed over time, as well as strengthen muscles., The player should start by leading off the base. That is, the player should start moving off the bag as the pitcher is getting ready to throw.
Once the pitcher starts throwing, the player should start running to the next base. The idea is to make it to the base before the catcher has a chance to throw the runner out.
If the player goes too far, he or she can be picked off, meaning the pitcher can throw to the baseman before pitching and get the player out.

, With a good defense, the other team can easily get a player out with an infield hit. However, faster runners are more likely to get on base or advance to the next base., By picking up speed, runners are more likely to be able to score from these bases, increasing your chances of winning."
"
Teach rotational hitting.,
Encourage positivity.,
Use bunts.,
Try hit-and-runs.,
Know the pitcher.,
Teach your players to analyze from the dugout.",How to Win a Baseball Game3," Rotational hitting involves putting your whole body behind a swing, as opposed to linear hitting, which focuses on the upper body.In rotational hitting, the batter moves the bat with his or her body, rather than ahead of the hips.Additionally, the swing of a rotational hitter starts low and moves high. On the other hand, the swing of a linear hitter starts high and moves low.Rotational hitters hit the ball right in the center. Linear hitters often hit the bottom of the ball, creating backspin., Be positive, and encourage a player to do his or her best. Similarly, teach your players to think positively about their hitting. For instance, help them learn how to visualize a positive outcome as they step up to the plate. These types of visualizations can help your players swing and hit better, as confidence boosts ability., Sometimes, the best way to score or to advance a runner is for a player to bunt. Bunting is when the ball is hit lightly into the infield so that the pitcher or infield players must run in to pick it up, giving a player time to advance on base.To bunt, the player should grip the bat with the bottom hand as normal but move up the other hand towards the middle. Hold the bat out over the plate, and essentially, allow it do the work by letting the ball hit it as it comes over the plate., Hit-and-runs are when a base runner takes off from the base as soon as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. Obviously, the batter must hit the ball in some way for this to work. Nonetheless, it can make it easier for the runner to advance and get closer to scoring., If possible, study the pitcher prior to the game. By knowing what types of pitches are likely to come across the plate, you can better prepare your players to hit the ball well and win the game., That is, even if you don't have advanced knowledge of the pitcher, your players can learn about the pitcher before they step up to the plate.Look at speed, what types of pitches they're throwing, how their special pitches move, and what side of the plate they're pitching from. All of these can help your players be better prepared when they step up to the plate."
"
Be solid down the middle.,
Know the other team's batters.,
Know your pitchers.,
Teach your players to communicate.,
Try defensive drills.",How to Win a Baseball Game4," As many balls go down the middle of the field, you need especially solid defense in that area, particularly your catcher, center fielder, your shortstop, and second baseman.The catcher is especially important. The catcher will help throw people out on base, catch balls to get people out at home, and even call pitches. Your catcher needs to be steady and consistent., If possible, study how the other team's players bat. For instance, maybe one player always pulls to the left or right. If so, you can compensate by shifting your players that direction, making it easier to field a hit., Certain pitches will lead to certain kinds of hits, such as ground balls. If you're pitcher is inclined to create a certain type of hit, you can adjust your defensive strategy to match., When balls come flying between two fielders, teach them to call who's going to get the ball so you don't have collisions.

, For instance, set all of the players in the outfield, and use a ball thrower at home plate. Designate base runners, then play out different scenarios to help your players prepare for games."
"
Throw strikes.,
Help your pitcher build up pitches.,
Know the other team's batters.,
Find an ace pitcher.,
Have back-up.,
Try finding left-handed pitchers.",How to Win a Baseball Game5," Though a bit obvious, you need pitchers that can throw strikes consistently. That means staying in the strike zone, while still throwing pitches that batters have a hard time hitting., Most great pitchers have a variety of pitches to throw, from curve balls to change-ups. A variety of pitches will help keep the other team from getting hits as often.For instance, a fastball followed by a much slower pitch can confuse batters., By studying what kinds of pitches the other batters can and cannot hit, you can help the pitcher know what pitches to throw to what batter., An ace pitcher can turn things around for your team, especially if you've been losing for a period of time. Ace pitchers can help you win tournaments.The most important trait of an ace pitcher is consistency. Your ace should be able to throw great pitches on a regular basis, even if he or she does not have as fast a pitch as other pitchers., Every pitcher has to be taken out of the game sometime. You need good relief pitchers and closers who can follow up for your star pitchers and help win the game., Because so few pitchers throw left-handed, having one pitch on your team can sometimes bewilder batters, working to your advantage."
"
Spend time together.,
Set rules for the team about respect.,
Talk about strengths.,
Expect commitment.,
Establish team values.",How to Win a Baseball Game6," One of the best ways to create team spirit is to go out of town together. For instance, you can sign your team up for an out-of-town tournament. Being together for an extended period of time helps build up team togetherness.Team spirit is important because a team that gets to know each other off the field will play better on the field.

, That is, create an environment based around respect and encouragement. If you encourage that type of environment, you'll build up your team spirit.One way you can push encouragement and respect is to actually set up guidelines about how your team can talk to each other. For instance, one of the guidelines could be no negative talk about another player during practice.
Lead by example. Though you may need to point out where a player needs to improve, always take time to acknowledge how a player is doing well.

, That is, ask your players to talk about what they bring to the team as individuals. These strengths don't need to just be baseball skills; they can also be personality traits, such as ""always positive."" By talking about what each individual can contribute, you start building up the team as a whole., Establish that you expect your team to show up on time every time you meet, both physically and mentally., You can establish them for your team, but you can also take some time to brainstorm them together. When brainstorming what your team values, also talk about what the words mean to the people on the team.For instance, some values you could establish for your team are honesty, integrity, professionalism, and toughness."

Do not use petroleum jelly on burns.,
Use care when using Vaseline as a personal lubricant.,
Do not use Vaseline on new tattoos.,
Do not use Vaseline as an acne or rosacea cure.,
Do not use Vaseline as a moisturizer.,
Do not use Vaseline as an anti-fungal.",How to Use Vaseline4," It's a common misconception that Vaseline can and should be used as an analgesic or antiseptic, but the truth is that Vaseline has no properties that make it an effective treatment of burns. In fact, the moisture-barrier component of petroleum jelly make it a poor choice to apply to fresh burns, cuts, and abrasions.Vaseline does make a variety of different Intensive Care lotions which would be appropriate to use on burns.Lubriderm and other varieties of lotion would be more appropriate.

Instead, use A&D, Bacitracin, or specialty products like TattooGoo, which help to moisturize the area and promote healing. Always ask your tattoo artist for directions regarding aftercare.

, Vaseline is not water-soluble, making it inadvisable to use as a treatment for acne, or other skin conditions that are the result of oily skin. Vaseline actually seals the skin and dries it out, locking in dirt and suffocating the pores, but creates the appearance of moisturizing because it softens and reduces chaffing.

, If you’ve been recommended to use a moisturizer by a dermatologist, use a moisturizing lotion, not Vaseline. If your skin is cleaned thoroughly before applying some Vaseline, it can be effective at locking in moisture, but it will not moisturize your skin. In fact, Vaseline creates a moisture barrier that keeps your skin from being able to breathe, which can exacerbate your skin problems.

, Vaseline locks in moisture, making it extremely ineffective at battling fungus. Instead, use something that has actual anti-fungal properties, like coconut oil.

Heels tend to develop a layer of hard, calloused skin that can become cracked or scaled. Your elbows are another area that may benefit from exfoliation. Soak the calloused body part in warm water for about five minutes to soften the skin.If you're working on your feet, you may want to fill a bowl with warm water and soak your feet in the bowl.
For other parts of the body, pumicing as part of your shower may be easiest.;
, The skin will be easier to remove if it's soft and supple. Feel your skin after several minutes of soaking. If it still feels tough, wait a few more minutes (giving the water a warm-up if necessary). If it's soft, your skin is ready for the pumice stone.

, Wetting the stone will help it slide more easily across your skin, rather than catching on it. Run the stone under warm water, or dip it in the water where you're soaking your skin, in order to thoroughly wet it.

, Use a circular motion to start sloughing away the dead skin with the pumice stone. If the skin is nice and soft, it should start coming right off. Keep going until you remove the dead skin and get to the fresh, supple skin underneath.


Don't press too hard. Light pressure is all that is needed; let the surface of the stone do the work.
If you're working on your feet, focus on the heels, the sides of your toes, and other areas where dry skin tends to build up.

, Rinse off the dead skin and take a look to see if you need to keep going. If you still see bits of dead skin, go over the area again with the pumice stone. Continue using the stone on the area until you're satisfied with the results.


Since the pumice stone will wear down slightly while you use it, you may need to turn it over to get a fresh surface you can use to exfoliate your skin.
Rinse the pumice stone often to keep its surface clean and effective.

, When you're finished, use a towel to pat your skin dry. Coat the area with an oil or cream to prevent it from drying out too quickly. Your formerly calloused skin should now be soft, supple and gleaming.


Coconut oil, almond oil, or body lotion are all fine to use to condition your skin after pumicing.
Repeat as often as needed to keep your skin in good shape.

, Dead skin will build up in the pores of the stone as you use it, so you'll want to clean the stone after use. Use a scrub brush to scrub the stone while holding it under running water. Add a bit of soap to help clean the stone completely. This way your stone will be clean and ready to use next time you need it.

, Set the pumice stone in a dry place so that it doesn't stay damp in between uses. Some pumice stones come with a string attached that allows you to hang the stone to dry. If you let the stone stay wet, bacteria could grow in the pores, making it unsafe to use.

, Every once in a while, you'll want to give the stone a deep cleaning to make sure it isn't harboring bacteria. Bring a small pot of water to a full boil, drop in the stone, and boil it for five minutes. Use tongs to remove the stone from the water and allow it to dry completely before storing.


If you use the stone frequently, boil it every two weeks to ensure it stays clean.
If you've used the stone on a dirty surface, you can add a capful of bleach to the water to be certain all bacteria get killed.

, Pumice is a soft stone that will eventually wear away after you've used it for awhile. When it gets too small to handle easily, or the surface becomes too smooth to be effective, go ahead and spring for a new one. Pumice stones are inexpensive and can be found at any store that sells beauty supplies.

, The ancient Greeks used pumice to remove body hair, and some still use it for this purpose. Pumice makes a gentle natural hair remover. Soak your skin in the bath or in a shower until it's warm and soft. Wet the pumice stone, then rub your skin using a gentle circular motion. Within about 30 seconds, the area you're rubbing will be free of hair.


The effects of pumicing are similar to the effects of shaving. The hair is removed close to the skin, rather than being pulled out.Pumicing should not be painful. If you feel pain, make sure you aren't pressing too hard.

, The soft, porous surface of pumice is perfect for taking pills and lint off of clothing. If you have a sweater you've been wanting to clean up, lay it on a flat surface. Rub a dry pumice stone over the pills in a circular motion. Don't press too hard, since you don't want to damage the fibers of the garment; a gentle pressure is all that's needed to take the pills right off.

, Pumice can be used to remove copper rings from the inside of a toilet. Put on a pair of nonporous cleaning gloves to start. Then simply rub the pumice stone over the ring using a scrubbing motion. Repeat until the ring is gone.You can use the stone in combination with toilet cleaner for more stubborn stains.
Be sure to use separate stones for toilet cleaning and body use. Do not use the same stone for both purposes.

Make sure your mascara is still viable.,
Purchase a new bottle of eye drops.,
Open mascara bottle and wipe residue from the outer rim.,
Add several drops of eye drops directly into your mascara bottle.",How to Use Eye Drops to Keep Mascara from Drying Out," If you’ve had your mascara for more than 3 months or if you are truly scraping the bottom of the barrel, you may want to spring for a new bottle.


Check the wand for damage. A damaged mascara wand can cause issues regardless of whether you bring it back to life or not. Make sure the wand is still in good shape and/or has not been used by anyone other than you--sharing mascara will afford you a quick trip to the eye doctor (infection)!;
, You may be tempted to use a pre-opened bottle, however a previously used bottle may still harbor germs from an eye infection or may have gathered bacteria since its last use (you don’t want to use any bottle of eye drops older than a year).

, Clumping and old makeup typically bottles up around the top, which can cause further issues. Use a tissue and a little petroleum jelly to remove any residue.

, The number of drops will depend on how dried out the makeup has become. The best approach is to add 2 or 3 drops, shake the bottle (after replacing wand/lid) and then taking the mascara for a test drive. If you like the consistency, stop there. Otherwise add 1 or 2 more drops, shake and repeat until mascara is ready.

Wash off your makeup with a gentle cleanser.,
Moisturize.,
Brush, floss, and use mouthwash regularly.,
Be nice to your hair.,
Be sure to have good overall hygiene.,
Drink lots of water.,
Avoid food and drinks that are bad for your skin.,
Do yoga.,
Meditate.,
Sleep on your back.,
And sleep more!",How to Wake up Beautiful," At the end of the day, your face has been through a lot. Rounds of makeup, sunlight, exposure to dust and dirt -- to make sure all those things to wreak havoc overnight (resulting in breakouts), cleanse your face before bed. Choose one that moisturizes and has a calming scent. It should be gentle and leave your face feeling smooth and clean.


If you're leaving make-up stains (eye or otherwise) on your pillows, use a soft makeup remover, too. It's possible that your cleanser isn't strong enough.
Some women like to cleanse in the morning, too. If you're face is a little on the oily side, this is a good idea. But this cleanse should have a citrusy scent; lemon, orange, mango, or pomegranate-scented cleaners can make you feel more energized.;
, Your skin, especially your face, is very important. After you wash your face, apply a moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out. An unscented lotion is fine, but a cream designed just for your face is better. And if you're nearing that age where wrinkles are on the horizon, invest in a good night cream. Better to start too early!


Really you should be moisturizing everywhere. Take a day every week to slather your hands and feet in lotion or body butter and sleep with socks and mittens on. The 8-hour deep moisturizing session will leave your hands and feet soft as a baby's bottom.

, Your teeth are what everyone sees when you smile, so make the best of them! Always brush your teeth in the morning and night, so as to avoid bad breath and have good oral hygiene. Use a good toothpaste, and change your toothbrush every 3 months, to ensure what you're putting in your mouth is clean.


If yellow teeth are a concern of yours, a quick and easy (and cheap!) option is to dab a bit of baking soda on your toothbrush after you brush your teeth each night and give your pearly whites a quick extra scrub down. Baking soda is a natural bleaching agent and just a bit is enough to wear down those pesky yellow stains.

, 8 hours of tossing and turning on that pillow can quite literally do damage to your tresses. Since you probably can't avoid the unconsciously switching positions part, put your hair up in a high bun or in a loose braid before bed. And you'll wake up with volume and waves naturally!


And when it comes to hair products, splurge for that occasional leave-in treatment. Twice a month or so, deep condition your hair, leaving it overnight. The extra nutrients will be soaked up by your strands, leaving them glossy and beautiful.

, If you sweat a lot or sometimes forget to put deodorant in the morning, use clinical strength deodorant before going to bed. If you forget to add again in the morning it still works throughout the day. That means no deodorant stains on your black shirt in the morning!


In case it needs to be said, make sure to shower on the regular. If you're exercising routinely, that goes double. Use a good body wash and loofah it up!

, By now you've probably heard about the wonder that is water -- it's great for your hair, your nails, and your skin. It can prevent breakouts and give you that natural glow you've been looking for. Oh, and it's great for your organs, too!


8 glasses of water a day is good, but try to do even more. It can even help you lose weight! Up your intake by a liter and you could drop 5 pounds without really even noticing. Cold water can up your metabolism and crush your appetite, too!, If you've ever had a late night that involved nachos, candy bars, and beer, you know exactly where this is going. Oily, fatty, and sugary foods can lead to breakouts. Salty foods and alcohol can lead to bloating and your face being puffy in the morning. These foods are not only bad for you on the outside, but they're bad for you on the inside, too! All the more reason to eat healthily.


You'll be doing your body the most favors if you drink lots of water and don't eat a heavy meal before bed. Keep dinner light and avoid having more than one alcoholic drink and piling on the sugar and salt.

, Simply taking 10 minutes in the morning to do some yoga stretches can get your blood flowing (giving your face a more natural color) and work your synovial fluid (the fluid that lubricates your joints). And it'll wake you up! Nothing like a good, natural wake up call to get that endorphin rush for the rest of the day.

, After saluting the sun, take another 10 minutes to do some meditation, clearing your mind and upping your positive energy. Smiling can make us more beautiful, so set your mind on a positive track to put that pep in your step. Just a few minutes of me time spent with a clear head can make the rest of the day so much easier to tackle.

, 8 hours of supporting your head's weight (up to 10 pounds!) can wreak some serious terror on your face. Because of this, try to condition yourself to sleep on your back. Sleeping on your stomach or your side puts weight on your face, ultimately resulting in lines and puffiness.


Satin or silk pillows will be a great investment, too, and the more the merrier. Softer pillows prevent your hair from breaking and sleeping at a slight incline (propped up, that is) keeps your face from being puffy all over. Gravity helps lymph and blood flow so fluid won't accumulate.

, Try to sleep for at least 8 hours every night. On two pillows! When we don't get enough, even our skin gets tired -- it sags, you get bags, and it loses its glow. Your blood vessels dilate (not a good thing) and you're extra stressed throughout the day, leading to even more problems.So don't risk it! Pile on the beauty sleep -- it's free and it feels darn good.


Your body is actually going into repair mode while you sleep, from your brain to your muscles to your skin. New cells are actually being regenerated. However, too much sleep isn't great, either. Keep it somewhere between 7 and 9."

Take off your panties.",How to Take off Clothes in a Sexy Way1," You can use these tips any time you're taking off clothes, no matter what you're wearing and how far you intend to go. But if you want to give your sexual partner a special striptease, choose your clothing and location in advance. Wear lacy or semi-transparent undergarments, stockings with garters, and a couple layers of sexy, easy-to-remove clothing over this. Consider placing one chair for your partner to sit in, and one for yourself to use during the performance.


Putting on music might help you find a rhythm, especially if you feel self-conscious or awkward.;
, Make the most of it by standing directly in front of your partner with your legs apart, your weight slightly over one leg. Maintain eye contact as you deliberately undo the buttons.

, Don't be in a rush to get naked; the ""tease"" part of a striptease will get your partner excited. Tell your partner to stay seated on a chair, and walk around the chair showing off your body from the front, back, and sides. Tug at the straps on your dress or bra, or the buttons on your shirt, as though you are about to take them off any second.Get creative with your own sexy poses, or include these:


If you're wearing a low-cut shirt, bend forward over your partner briefly.
Face away from your partner and bend forward over a chair or bed.
Touch your partner's crotch briefly, then pull away.
Sit on a chair and slowly part your legs while giving your partner a sexy smile.
Grab and stroke yourself around your breasts, crotch, or any body part your partner finds sexy.

, Either stand with your legs together in a feminine stance with one ball on the foot knee pointing in, or go for a stronger stance with your legs sexily spread apart with your weight slightly to one side. Cross your arms across your chest and suck your stomach in as you lift your hands up over your head.


If you have long hair, shake your head and let your hair flow out as you do this.

, Button-up shirts are perfect for stripping, since you can turn each button into its own mini-performance. Try leaving a couple buttons at the top and bottom undone in advance to make the outfit sexier. Remove the buttons slowly, one by one, as you continue to move around and pose. Once all the buttons are undone, slip the shirt down low over your shoulders, turn your back to your partner, and let the shirt fall to the floor.Unbutton the cuffs first, or undo them in advance before you enter the room.
You can sex this up a bit by only using one hand while having the other on your hip. Practice this in advance if you're going to try it.

, Keep teasing your partner between items of clothing, or ask ""are you ready for more?"" a few times before giving in. Lower the straps of your negligee or similar loose item of clothing over your shoulders and let it fall, or shimmy it down to the floor.

, A zippered skirt is great for beginners, since you can remove it easily and unexpectedly while striking almost any pose. A short, clingy skirt is another good option, and can be pulled up to reveal your butt before shimmying it off., You might want to practice this one in advance, since tight jeans tend to be less sexy when you're falling over with your legs trapped. Try kneeling, then pushing your jeans down to your knees while you stick your butt out at your partner. Sit back on your butt to pull the jeans off the rest of the way., You might want to leave your stockings on, especially with a sexy garter belt. On the other hand, a simple pair of nylon stockings can be a great prop. Put your leg up on a chair and roll them off slowly, then snapping it away slingshot style, or pretend to tie your wrists together. These are great visuals and good methods for adding a bit of cheeky humour to the mood.If you can walk around and pose gracefully with heels, you could leave them on as well as the stockings.
Try wearing a pair of stockings one size too large, with a garter belt to keep them on. This gives you more freedom of movement during your striptease., Tug at the straps of your bra throughout the striptease, to get your partner excited. When you're finally ready to remove it, turn your back to your partner, and unhook the bra. Let it drop to your floor, then turn around to reveal your breasts., If you have an opportunity to prepare in advance, pick a sexy pair or lacy panties or a thong, but don't pick something so tight that it leaves marks.Try slipping them off while standing with your legs straight, or lay on your back and pull them up to your feet, where you can flick them off.


If you're wearing a sexy garter belt, wear your panties over it, so you can keep your garter belt on.

Go on a shopping spree.",How to Take Your Style Out of a Slump," Consider cutting your hair, getting some side swept bangs, or fringing it; this change can get you out of that style slump and change your look. Or, change your hair color. A big change like this may be just what you need to pull yourself out of your slump, but a streak of color may be just enough. Look at different hairstyles, and think carefully about what you want to look like.;
, Try something edgier than you normally do; consider a really red lipstick. Go to a makeup counter and get a shade of red selected to suit your exact skin tone. Or, try a natural look instead. Use minimal eyeliner, and mascara, with a natural lip shade, or even forego makeup altogether.


Choose a brightly colored eyeliner. You may be surprised to discover that colored eyeliner can look good on you, depending on your eye color. Purple has been shown to look good with brown eyes, gold with green or hazel eyes, and orange with blue. However, this style may not be for everyone.

, Get inspired by current or different outfits, hairstyles, or makeup trends. Circle what you could envision yourself wearing, or anything that appeals to you even if you can't imagine yourself wearing it.

, Look at individual items, thinking about whether or not you like them, and why. Think about what would make you confident, what gives out the message you want to send. Don't aim to replace your entire wardrobe, but put aside clothes that you've worn too often, and get something different.


Determine the colors that you like, that you look good in, and that make you feel confident in yourself.

, Scout out a creative bag, or use a bag that you haven't used in a while. Look for ribbons or bows for your hair. Try on a few new or old pieces of jewelry; get creative with rings, necklaces, earrings, watches, or bracelets. Start wearing a hat or a scarf. These simple changes or additions in your accessories can really change the dynamic of your look.

, Walk into a store you've been meaning to check out, try a few things on, and try to purchase one thing. Bring along a friend or enlist in the help of a sales associate, with the goal to look for something different.

If you want something more fun and lighthearted, keep things more brightly lit and put on some music with a beat.Men's clothing options are often less varied than women's. You can strip from an ordinary outfit, but if you want something more unique, try finding props or costumes that fit a masculine theme, such as cowboy or policeman., If you know how to dance sexily, you can show your sexual partner some moves between items of clothing, or even while you're removing one. If you aren't a dance floor god, however, stick with the occasional hip sway, and turn occasionally to give your partner a view from a different angle., Men's shoes and socks don't tend toward the sexy side, so get rid of these before you get into the swing of things. Toss these aside, somewhere out of the way.

, If you're wearing a tie, untie it and toss it away, or at your partner, quickly and aggressively. While you can go for the slow, sensuous striptease if you're comfortable with it, most men may prefer a more energetic, aggressive style.

, Pull the shirt over your head quickly, then yank it off your arms and throw it to the side or at your partner.Alternatively, you can grab the shirt by the lower hem instead of the collar, then use the same motion.

, If you're wearing a button up shirt, unbutton it from top to bottom while keeping eye contact with your partner. Leave it on until after you've removed your trousers, to give your partner something else to look forward to, or keep it on if your partner likes the ""shirt half on"" look.

, Pull off your belt, then step out of them one leg at a time. Take this slowly, to avoid getting your foot caught and reducing the sexiness considerably.


Don't try to shimmy out of trousers sexily; due to mysterious laws of the universe, this only works for women.

, At this point, invite your partner to get the next stage started by removing your boxer briefs, along with your button up shirt if that's still half-on. You may have to remove tighter underpants yourself.


You could also ""go commando,"" with no underpants at all, to surprise your partner.

Even if she is interested in having sex tonight, she'll be more comfortable and likely to do so if she can set the pace her clothes are removed.


If pausing to ask a question every few minutes feels too awkward, try holding a button, zipper, or bra strap, then looking at your partner with a raised eyebrow and questioning look instead.

, Nothing kills the mood like your partner punching you in the face because he yanked your shirt too hard. When you're stripping the clothes from another person, do it slowly and sensuously. Take some time between each item of clothing to kiss your partner's newly exposed skin, or run your hands along his or her body.

, Grab both ends of the belt, then unbuckle and tug them off in one motion. It's fine if you take a couple tugs to get this right. Try this while reaching from behind, if you're feeling extra skilled.

, Pull up the lower hem of the T-shirt until the shirt is pulled partly over your partner's arms, but the collar is still around the neck. Hold your partner playfully in this position while you kiss or nibble his skin, before tugging it off the rest of the way.

, Distract your partner by making out, while you unbutton or unzip his pants and pull them down. Use your foot to pull them the rest of the way. If you're distracting enough, he may not notice what you're doing until the trousers fall at his feet.


This probably won't work on women's trousers, since they tend to be more difficult to remove.

, This often takes a few attempts, so it's best attempted when you're feeling confident, or when you and your partner are in a silly mood. With enough effort, even buttoned shirts can come off, but avoid hurting your teeth on metal zippers.

, Bras are infamously difficult for men to remove, although it's not difficult if you learn how. If you haven't figured it out after a few seconds, just stop and let her do it.

While a pastel pink or a cool patterned pair are great for a workout class, don’t try to dress those up for work. If you want to pull off leggings at work, they need to be black. Black leggings look much more sleek and professional than any other color, and you’re less likely to call attention to the fact that they are, in fact, leisure clothes.;
, You wouldn’t wear a ratty old T-shirt to work, so don’t try to pull off your ratty old leggings. Lower quality leggings often fade and start pilling after a wash or two. If your leggings are covered in loose strings and fuzz, you won’t be able to wear them in a professional environment. Invest in a pair of leggings that hold up in the washing machine, and wash them carefully to ensure they stay in tiptop condition.


Turn your leggings inside out and use a bio detergent when you wash them. This will help to prevent pilling, which makes your leggings look worn out., Thin leggings may look great in the dim lighting of your bedroom as you get ready for work, but be careful. In the bright, unforgiving lights of your office, those same leggings may be completely see-through. Make sure you examine your leggings thoroughly in bright and natural lighting before heading to the office.Use your hands to pull the fabric taut. If you can see skin through the stretched fabric, save those leggings for the comfort of your own home.

, Leggings can certainly cling to your curves, and that’s not exactly the look you should be going for in the workplace. To ensure your outfit is conservative enough, avoid pairing your tight leggings with a tight top. Instead, pair them with a flowing blouse, a longer tunic, or an oversized sweater.Choose tops that hit mid-thigh and cover your rear. Showing too much of the top of your leggings looks less professional and modest.

, Nothing says professional quite like a tailored blazer. By wearing layers on your top half, you’ll attract the eye that way. A crisp blazer will steal the show, allowing you to be happily comfortable on the bottom half. If you wear a blazer or another dressy layer on your top, you don’t have to worry about being underdressed on the bottom.Layer your blazers over a long shirt or dress. Your rear should still be fully covered.
Crisp button-downs, dressy cardigans, and structured, high-quality tops can all be worn to dress up your top half.

, If you have a mini dress that you absolutely adore, try wearing it with opaque leggings. Unlike see-through tights, dark leggings will make the outfit look much more conservative. Think of leggings as thick stockings that can make even the shortest dresses suitable for the office.Keep in mind that this only works if all other elements of the dress are more conservative. For example, adding leggings to a dress with a plunging neckline and skinny spaghetti straps won't automatically make the dress work-appropriate!

, If you’re afraid that your outfit isn’t dressy enough for the office, try throwing on a beautiful piece of jewelry to take it up a notch. For example, leggings paired with an oversized sweater may look too casual alone. Throw on a chunky statement necklace, and you’ve taken it from relaxed to trendy.


When looking for work-appropriate jewelry, consider things like statement necklaces and chunky bracelets. Avoid things like noisy bangles that might be distracting, as well as overly large earrings that may be a bit too flashy for the workplace.
Bangles, watches, flashy earrings, and layered necklaces are all great options to dress up a legging outfit.

, Your leggings should just be part of your outfit, and certainly not the focus point. Accessorizing can add some sophistication and style to an outfit that may be a bit plain on its own. Try adding a fun belt over a dress or oversized cardigan. In the colder months, pop a chic scarf around your neck.When you're selecting accessories for this look, think dressy. For example, choose a silk scarf over a chunky knit scarf. Casual accessories will make your entire outfit look casual, while dressier accessories will elevate your look, and hide the fact that you're wearing leggings!

, Your favorite black leggings will look much different paired with patent leather heels than they do with your running shoes. Knee-high boots and ballet flats can also transform your look, making your leggings look polished and professional.By pairing the typically sporty leggings with fancier, more feminine footwear, you can easily take your leggings from the gym to the office.


Consider grounding your leggings with some tall boots for a preppy and professional look.

, It's not always possible to do a gorgeous full face of makeup with perfectly-styled hair every single day, but it's important that you put a bit more effort into your hair and makeup when you wear leggings to work. Remember, it's all about balance. By taking a bit of time to enhance your features with makeup and make your hair look tidy, you'll look more more formal and work-appropriate.


Throwing your hair up in a messy bun and skipping the makeup is probably fine some days, but if you do this while also wearing leggings, you'll look ready to nap rather than work.

If they hit the first pitch, it will probably be a weak grounder.,
If they hit that last one, it was probably a weak grounder, a solid grounder, or a pop-up.,
After these three pitches early on, you can toy with the batter.",How to Pitch Strategically," This does several things. One, it shows the batter your speed. This may sound like a bad thing, but wait, it will help you.;
, If not, throw it again. Do not sit out here too long because eventually they will sit on it and destroy it.

, If not, throw a fastball as hard as you can inside and up. This gets the batter, who is leaning across the plate, to back off.

, Each subsequent at bat after the other team has batted around can be started with a change-up, curve, you name it. If the batter can catch up with your fastball, it will make your off-speed stuff and your curve ball even more effective.

Field the ball cleanly.",How to Play Shortstop in Baseball2," A shortstop must be able to field the ball cleanly the majority of the time unlike a second baseman. At the higher levels starting in college and maybe high school the runners are faster and the throw across the field takes longer. A dependable out at first on a grounder is expected. Practice.

Be a leader.",How to Play Shortstop in Baseball3," A shortstop also has to have a strong arm to get the ball across the diamond to the first baseman. To do this, play ""long toss"" (throwing over 100-150 feet) for at least five minutes each time you warm up. Start slow and don't hurt your arm by trying to throw that far on a line. A nice arch is fine until you build strength.

, This is where good footwork is a must.

, If a ball is hit to left field the shortstop has to be the cut-off man on the play.

, There is no point in having a fast throw if you cannot release the ball in time.

, Before the pitcher pitches, take a look and remember where the base runners and fielders are positioned. This is so that you know where to throw to when you get the ball, which is extremely important since the ball will go to you most of the time.

, After the catcher, the shortstop directs the infield. Decide who's going to back up the throw back to the pitcher, who will be taking the throw on a pickoff and whether your infield is positioned correctly are some of the shortstops responsibilities.

Run home.",How to Tag Up in Baseball1," Tagging up (or ""tagging"") in baseball is a good way to manufacture runs. If you're on a base with less than two outs, you can tag up and advance to the next base (including home plate) as soon as an outfielder has caught a fly ball.
, If you're at third base with less than two outs, once you recognize that a fly ball is likely to be caught, you should return to the base, tag up, and run to home plate to score a run. First, however, you must decide (with the help of your third-base coach) whether the ball has been hit deeply enough into the outfield to allow you to advance to home plate before the outfielder can throw the ball there. If you think you can do it, touch the bag with either foot and wait., Lean toward home plate while you wait for the outfielder to catch the fly ball. As soon as the ball contacts the fielder's glove (or anything else, for that matter), push off the bag with your foot., Sprint as fast as you can toward home. Don't look back at the ball, because that will slow you down. Let your teammates tell you whether you need to slide or not. Concentrate on touching home plate before the catcher can tag you with the ball."

When in the windup, always start out with both feet on the rubber.,
Pivot the foot on the same side that you throw with (right side or left side) sideways so that the side of your foot is on top or up against the rubber.

Loosen your arm by playing catch.,
Stretch your arm out.,
Talk to your coaches.",How to Pitch in a Baseball Game1," A teammate, coach, or parent/guardian can catch with you. All you need is a mitt and ball. Start close together, but eventually spread out until you are far away from each other. Long toss helps warm up your arm. When your arm feels like it is at its best, stop throwing, because your arm has been warmed up.;
, Pull it across your chest and hold for 10 seconds. Then pull it over your shoulder for 10 seconds. Do any other stretches that will make your arm feel less tense, but if you feel a pain, stop immediately.

, Chances are you won't be pitching the whole game, depending how old you are. Know when in the game you will pitch (starter, middle, closer) and get ready in the coming innings.

Read the ball.,
Get ready to run.,
Sprint to third.",How to Tag Up in Baseball2," If the ball is not hit very deeply, you may decide not to advance, especially if it's hit to left field. If it goes deep to center or right, your chances of making it to third are pretty good (unless you know the outfielder has a very strong arm)., Step on second base with one foot, and lean toward third, waiting for the fly ball to contact the outfielder., The instant the ball touches the outfielder (or the ground), sprint toward third base. Don't look at the ball. Look at your third-base coach, who will tell you in words or signals whether to slide or not. Because third base is a shorter throw from left or center field than home plate is, tagging from second can be more dangerous than tagging from third."
"
Read the ball.,
Know your chances.",How to Tag Up in Baseball3," Tagging from first is done rarely, because second base is so close to all three outfielders. It's easier for them to complete the throw before a runner can make it to second., Unless the ball has been hit quite deeply (to or near the warning track if there is one), don't try to tag from first. Let your first-base coach help you make that decision."
"
Focus on your mechanics.,
Keep calm.,
Be aware of come-backers.",How to Pitch in a Baseball Game2," If you are pitching properly, then you will not have control issues. Remember these steps:


Keep your head straight towards the catcher's mitt, do not pull it.
Aim with your glove hand. Point it directly at the catcher and tuck it while throwing.
Step straight. The ball goes where your foot goes.
Follow through. Make sure your arm touches the opposite knee to keep the ball low. Also try to carry enough momentum to make your throwing side foot come forward.

, Unless you are in the College World Series, the minors, or the MLB, baseball is just a relaxing sport with no consequences if you fail. If you cannot hit the strike zone, then take deep breaths and walk around the mound until you have regained your composure.

, If you can't field a ball coming at you, use your reflexes to try to get out of the way. If you keep calm and follow your mechanics, you will pitch fine, but tell your coach to take you out if your arm is hurting.

Ice your arm.,
If you did not pitch as well as you may have liked, do not reflect too much on it.,
If you pitched well, celebrate!",How to Pitch in a Baseball Game3," This will reduce pain, swelling, and risk of injury. Keep the ice on until it gets too cold to bear.

, Everyone makes mistakes, and you have a chance to make up for it the next time you pitch. If you have pitched badly multiple games in a row, then try changing your mechanics until you pitch consistently.

, You helped your team, and pitching is not easy work! Great job!

Practice catching far fly balls off a baseball bat.,
(If you have nobody/no bat to practice with) Throw it high in the air above you until you start to catch 9 out of 10 of them.,
The first step you should take is back.,
Because fly balls have backspin once you get under it be prepared to move forward.

,
Once you get under the ball make sure that when you catch the ball the ball hits the ""web"" or the pouch of the glove and use your hands to squeeze the ball into the glove so that the ball can't come out.

,
For grounders, make sure you get your glove down to the ground so the ball will roll into your glove.

,
Firmly squeeze the ball in place so that you won't drop the ball.

Focus on the glove work.,
Don't forget to work on your batting!",How to Play Left Field in Baseball," A left fielder will need an outfielder's glove. The typical outfielder's glove is long with deep pockets. This helps with reaching fly balls on the run. Most are labeled appropriately and are available in a variety of styles and in a wide range of prices.;
, Take some time throwing pop flies with a friend or coach. Playing long toss can also help you get comfortable with catching the ball at long distances and warming up your arm. The left fielder, like center fielders and right fielders, will need to make very deep throws from time to time.

, A left fielder is not just an outfielder. Like the other two positions, there are specific jobs that a left fielder is responsible for.


Backing up third. On throws to third base by the catcher, the left fielder is always responsible for backing up the play and being prepared in case the throw is off target.
Covering for other positions. On plays to center field, be nearby in case the center fielder is unable to make the play. One such example is a fly ball to left-center that the CF unsuccessfully dives for. Since the CF will be unable to recover quickly, it becomes the responsibility of the LF to handle the play and respond accordingly.
Know where to throw. Always focus on the game. It can be challenging since more often than not the LF is far away from the action. However, when the ball does come your way it is very important to know where to go with it. If the play is deep, throw to your cutoff man (almost always the SS). If players are on base, it is required for the LF to know where to throw to hold the runners. Never attempt a throw from LF to first base, for example. Also if there are runners on base, be aware that the throw to home should be avoided if there are other runners on besides the one going home. Hitting the cutoff man as an alternative can help keep runners in their places.

, The left fielder often has the weakest arm of the three outfielders because they need to throw shorter distances to hold runners. This is not an excuse to have a weak throwing arm, however. A left fielder who can make bullet throws is always a plus. Build up arm strength by playing long toss and catch often, and exercising the muscles in your arm. On sacrifice flies to left, a strong arm is needed to throw out a runner. If the play is to home, it can also be quite a far throw.

, Being an outfield position, speed is key to being successful. The left fielder will need to be able to react quickly and make long runs to reach deep hits. The area covered by the left fielder is smaller than the center fielder, but still a vast territory. Do sprints and take runs to help with speed and endurance. Challenging teammates to races can also be a fun way to motivate yourself to get faster, but be sure you are warmed up and avoid injury.

, In addition to a decent arm and speed, a good left fielder also needs to be able to handle the ball. Errors in left field are rare in Major League baseball, and constantly dropping and muffing routine catches is not a good way to impress your coach. Practice fielding pop flies from and actual hitter to get a feel for what playing the outfield is like. Make sure you also get a chance to try to catch some pop flies on the run. Also, diving plays may look fancy, but be sure you know when to attempt a dive and when it's best to let a tough catch land in front of you. Do not attempt dives with runners on base, because if you miss they will likely advance. Learn to take good routes to the ball both for hits in the air and on the ground. Doing so can help you ready yourself for throws, help you run down flies, and make a base runner think twice before taking off.

, The corner outfield positions (left and right field) are often occupied by normal or powerful hitters. Since it is less of a finesse and speed position than center, a left fielder is expected to produce at the plate and hit for at least satisfactory power and average. It is possible to be a left fielder without possessing a good bat, but it is fairly rare in competitive and professional baseball.

Get your glove, uniform, and get ready to play.,
 Position yourself in right center most of the time, because the majority of hitters in little league through college level bat right handed.,
Be on your toes, never wander around, be alert, and don't daydream.

,
Know the situation.,
When the ball is hit to center, back the center fielder up just in case he misses.,
If the ball is hit to you don't panic!,
If there are men on base, try to get behind the ball so you can charge in and have momentum for your crow hop, and throw to the cutoff man.

,
When you run, treat your glove like a hand.,
Use two hands to squeeze once the ball hits your glove, your throwing hand trapping the ball in the glove pocket for the catch.,
If you catch it, then throw it back to the cut off man.,
If you miss, that's okay.,
You will get more ground balls than fly balls at most levels of baseball.,
On a ground ball, charge the ball until you are ready to field it.",How to Play Right Fielder in Baseball," Outfielders usually have gloves a little on the longer side, as the extra extension helps with the tough catches.;
, So they will usually hit it into left to center field.

,, Know where to throw the ball in every situation, if you don't, ask a teammate or coach. This will help you execute more smoothly. (If the first baseman wants to cutoff your throw to the plate on a tagging runner and you know you can throw at a good line to the plate, ignore him.)

, Likewise, if the ball is thrown to second base, back up the second baseman, just in case he doesn't field the throw correctly.

, Call for the ball, relax, and try to follow the flight of the ball. At first back up a couple of steps. It is easier to come in on a ball than try to run backwards.

,, Don't have your arm extended the entire time. Put your glove out when you are positioned under the ball or when you are ready to extend for the catch.

, Try to position yourself so that you merely have to pull your arm back to throw, rather than having to turn your body.

, If you miss, retrieve it, and throw it to the cutoff man near second base.

, Everyone misses once in a while, including the pros. Never give up. (Remember, too, when you see others make mistakes that the same thing will happen to you sometimes. Respect others, and cheer others on.)

, Be prepared for a ground ball, and know what to do with it in every situation.

, Depending on how many runners are on base you will field differently. If there are no runners, field it like an infielder would. If there are runners and you might throw someone out, either charge and field it while running or kneel and field it between your legs to prevent it from getting by.

Use proper finger positioning.,
Build consistency.,
Practice with long toss.,
Use your entire body.,
Rotate your torso and hips when throwing.,
Keep the force behind the ball.",How to Increase Pitching Velocity1," During a pitch you will need to fully utilize your motion to produce as much power behind the ball as possible. Part of keeping the full force behind the ball involves properly positioning your fingers during the pitch. Keep some of these tips in mind when pitching:Keep fingers behind the ball at all times. Avoid curling your hand or fingers in front of or to the side of the ball as you throw it.
Hold the ball using your thumb, pointer, and index fingers.
Your fingers should be placed across the horseshoe stitching, running parallel with it.
This grip can also help with accuracy and consistency when throwing pitches.;
, Even though you may train often enough and have adequate strength, pitching the ball without any consistency will prevent you from developing more pitching velocity. Consistent training is a key element of your practice that will help you develop faster pitching velocity.Try recording your practice sessions and analyzing your technique.
Coaches will often be able to help you analyze and improve your consistency.

, Long toss will train your pitching skills by gradually increasing the amount of distance you are throwing the ball. It's a good technique to drill your throwing mechanics at different levels of intensity, improve power and velocity, and grant you familiarity with the motion of pitching in many circumstances. Follow this basic long toss training routine to start improving the power and technique of your pitches:Warm up by simply playing catch or other light activity.
Throw the ball around 60' feet for about four minutes.
Move up to throwing the ball at 90' feet for three minutes.
For two minutes, throw the ball at 130'.
Maximize the distance by throwing the ball between 160-180' for two minutes.
Bring it back down to throwing at 45' for one minute as a cool down.

, It may be tempting to think of pitching as solely and upper body motion or technique. However, proper pitching that yields high velocity throws will require your entire body to work together in one fluid motion. This concept is know as the kinetic chain and it's something you should keep in mind when practicing technique.Inefficiency or weakness in one motion or body part can weaken the entire pitch.
The entire body must work together in order to generate more effective and powerful pitches.

, When you are pitching you will be using your entire body. This movement will require you to fully commit to the motion and use your maximum effort to throw the ball as fast as you can. Make sure you are using the full motion and torso rotation to maximize the velocity of your pitches.Higher speeds of torso, hip and shoulder rotation will increase pitching velocity.
Commit to improving and training your technique and mechanics.

, The main source of velocity in a pitch will come from keeping your arm and hand directly behind the ball. Only at the very end of the pitching motion should you use your wrist to snap the ball. Always remember to keep your arm and hand directly behind the ball to build more velocity behind your pitches.Rotating your wrist too early will take away some of the force behind the ball.
Keep your hand, wrist, and arm straight when pitching.

Improve your strength and flexibility.,
Use lunges to build stronger legs.,
Build upper body power with push-ups.,
Target your core with planks.,
Maintain flexibility.",How to Increase Pitching Velocity2," Beyond practicing your pitching technique you can also add certain exercises to your training plan, yielding even greater results. Building a stronger body and increasing the levels of flexibility will help improve your pitching velocity. Think about adding some of the following basic exercises to your workout routine:Push-ups
Pull ups
Squats
Lunges
Hamstring curls
Crunches
Full body stretching routines

, Although training your upper body and core is important, strengthening your legs is just as important when increasing your pitching velocity. By strength training your legs you can help build a solid pitching stance and generate more power behind your pitches. Try some of these motions to do a proper lunge and strengthen your legs:Stand straight with your feet apart at shoulder width.
Take a long step forward with one leg.
Drop your rear leg to the ground, straightening it out.
Bend your front leg at the knee. Never let your knee go in front of your toes to prevent injury.
Stand up straight again and repeat the motion, leading with the other leg.
You can hold dumbbells in your hands to increase the difficulty.

, Push-ups are a simple maneuver that uses your own body weight to strengthen muscles and build power. The push-up will mainly target your upper body but will also work your core and legs. Use the following push-up technique to stay safe and build pitching power:Go into a plank position, resting on your hands and toes.
Your hands should be even with and just a bit wider than your shoulders.
Keep your body and torso straight.
Lower your body down to the ground by bending at the elbows.
Your entire upper body and arms should be supporting your weight as you lower yourself down.
At the bottom of the motion push yourself back up to the starting position.

, Planks are a static exercise that will target and fully engage your core. The exercise itself is simple but will still require you to use proper form to stay safe and get the most from it. Keep the following tips in mind when you are building core strength with the plank exercise:Get into a push-up position. For a plank however, you will be resting on your elbows instead of your hands.
Keep your back as flat as you can.
Engage your core muscles to keep your torso straight and your hips up.
Hold the position until you are unable to continue doing so.

, Strength training and consistent practice sessions can be beneficial. However, these training methods can also reduce flexibility. Reduced flexibility will result in lower pitching velocity. Always maintain range of motion and flexibility by regularly stretching your muscles before and after practices or training.Maintaining flexibility can also prevent injury.

Angle your body to field it more easily.,
Bend your knees and drop your behind to the ground.,
Extend your glove in front of you.,
Keep your other hand close.,
Watch the ball into your glove.,
Trap it with your other hand.,
Transfer the ball to your throwing hand.,
Rise and move to adjust your footing.,
Throw the ball in one fluid motion.",How to Field a Ground Ball," Before the pitch is even thrown, you should be standing a ready position. Stand on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent and your glove in front of you. Focus on your attention on the batter. As the batter strikes the ball, keep your eye on it the entire time.;
, You'll only have a few seconds to react once the ball is hit, so you've got to be able to reflexively move toward the ball if its yours to field. Some fielders find it helpful to sway from side to side a bit as they wait for the hit. Shifting your weight back and forth can help you feel ready to spring toward the ball quickly.

, When the ball is hit, run as fast as you can to get in front of it. The angle at which you run is dependent on how fast the ball is moving. Here are a few different scenarios:


If it's a slow moving ball, you might want to charge it. This means running toward the ball at an angle that will help you reach it as quickly as possible.
If the ball is hit hard and low, it will respond violently to imperfections on the ground. Reaching the ball as quickly as possible is a good way to prevent it from bouncing away from you or at you in a harmful, unexpected way.
If it's a very fast moving ball, it's more important to run at an angle that will give you time to field the ball with ease, rather than having to dive or stretch your glove at an odd angle. Instead of running toward the ball, run to one side or the other so you can get in position to have the ball coming right at your glove.
With practice, you'll be able to discern what approach is right for what grounder speed. Timing is everything when it comes to fielding grounders.

, Grounders can be difficult to field because each hop they take can make them bounce in an unpredictable direction. Your best bet is to try to field a grounder on as long a hop as possible, because you'll know just where to position your glove to catch it. Fielding a grounder on a short hop is more difficult, because you have less time to react to the ball's bounce. If you let it bounce right in front of your glove, it could easily hop over your shoulder or to your left or right, forcing you to fumble.


Try to time your fielding so that the ball won't hop right in front of your glove. Catch it after it has hopped several feet away, so you have time to move toward it and catch it.
If the ball does hop right in front of you, you'll need to have very quick reflexes to catch it. Keep your body in front of the ball. If it skips off your glove, you might be able to stop it with your foot or another body part - anything to keep it from getting past you!

, It's most comfortable to field the ball on the same side of your body as your glove hand. If your right hand is your glove hand, try to position yourself so that the ball is moving slightly toward your right side. If your left hand is your glove hand, position yourself so you can catch it on that side.


You should still be fairly square with the ball, however. Try to not to put yourself in the position of needing to dive or stretch your arm to catch it.
If the ball is traveling extremely fast, you won't always have time to get in the ideal fielding position. You may need to dive, stretch, or backhand it to make the catch.

, When the ball is nigh, it's time to get low. If you don't, you stand a very good chance of having it fly between your legs - the most embarrassing fielder's error. Drop into a crouch that'll let you move quickly if you need to catch the ball on a short bounce.

, Here's where hand-eye coordination comes into play. Extend your glove toward the ball, keeping your elbow slightly bent. Position your glove so that the ball will roll or hop right into it.


A common mistake fielders make is not keeping their glove down. It is easier to bring the glove up than to get it down quickly, so keeping your glove in a low position provides better coverage., Make sure it's not in the path of the ball, but it should be close enough that you can easily employ it if need be. Two hands are better than one, so your other hand should be ready to trap the ball when it meets your glove.

, The number one rule in baseball, keep your eye on the ball, applies as much to fielding as it does to hitting. Make sure to watch the ball until it's safely nestled in your glove, and be ready to move if it does something unexpected.

, When the ball is in your glove, close your glove tight and immediately trap the ball with your opposite hand. This puts you in the perfect position to throw the ball where it needs to go as quickly as possible.

, When the ball is secure, immediately transfer it to your throwing hand. If you used your throwing hand to trap the ball, you can simply grasp the ball using the right grip to quickly throw it. If you fielded the ball with your glove stretched to one side or if you caught it backhanded, bring your glove to your throwing hand and grab the ball.Practice getting a good grip on the ball. Without looking, practice quickly gripping the ball by the seams. Developing this reflex means your throw will more likely be on-target and easy to catch.
The ball transfer should be done deliberately and quickly. There's still room for fumbling after you've successfully fielded the ball, so the transfer needs to be practiced just as much. Work on your ball transfer. Practice transferring your ball from your glove to your throwing hand. In the dugout when there's nothing to do, or anytime you have a ball handy, practice.

, Now it's time to quickly get in position to throw the ball. Rise up and step forward with your throwing foot, then with your non-throwing foot, then again with your throwing foot as you throw the ball. Doing these steps quickly results in a quick sequence that looks like skipping. It allows you to get your body in the right position to make an effective throw.

, After the flurry of fielding the ball, make sure you stay focused enough to make a good throw. A wild throw will completely negate your good fielding efforts. Throw a solid line drive to the appropriate fielder to make a good play.


You can also practice throwing from a crouched position, for times when you don't have enough time to rise and do a proper through.
In other cases you may need to toss or flick the ball to another fielder.

Plan the defense.",How to Be A Catcher In Baseball," Your normal position is squatting behind home. When doing this, your left foot should be a little bit in front of your right foot (an inch or two). Your left arm (catching arm) should be bent a little at the elbow. Avoid holding your elbow on the inside of your left knee.


Straddle the plate, but do not block it. You should allow an open lane to the plate. The only time you can block the plate is when you have the ball in hand.;
, It is very important that you keep your glove as still as possible from the time the ball hits your glove until the umpire makes the call. Moving your glove even slightly can cause a good strike to be a ball., At all times during the game, you need to keep your eyes on the ball. Without watching the ball, you won’t be able to position yourself appropriately to catch the ball. In addition, you could put yourself in danger of being struck by the ball or the bat.

, Before catching a ball, you need to relax your arm. If your arm isn't relaxed, the impact of the ball could hurt you. After you relax your arm, focus on where the ball is headed.

, Once you've identified the height at which the ball is approaching, you should position your arm appropriately and open your mitt. In addition:

If you know the pitcher is pitching high, position your arm and glove high.
You’ll want to move your whole body to receive the pitch (not just your glove). This will help you better catch it. This tactic is known as swaying.
Don’t move while the pitcher is throwing. You’ll distract them.
If the ball is a definite strike, make sure to extend your arm and catch it with a straight elbow., To best throw out runners, you’ll need to practice quickly moving from the squatting position to your feet. Practice quickly bouncing from a squatting or kneeling position to a standing position. To do this, use your legs to spring upward.

When trying to throw out a runner, make sure to use proper footwork. You should catch the ball and crow hop in place. Catching the ball and then taking a step and throwing it gives the runner an extra second., After catching a ball, you’ll have to hone your skills at transferring it to your throwing hand so you can out runners. This is because you’ll need to quickly deliver a ball you’ve caught to the first, second, or third basemen (or others).

While transferring the ball from glove to throwing hand, make sure not to bring your glove all the way back to your shoulder. You should catch the ball, make a quarter turn, and take the ball out. If you bring the glove all the way back it makes the transfer a lot harder and you'll frequently have to double clutch.

, Framing the ball is a tactic of making it so the umpire can see the ball from a certain angle. Framing is often used when it might be ambiguous as to whether the ball is a strike or is not. There are several keys to framing a pitch:


Give the umpire a view of the ball from the angle that makes it look like a strike. Do this by moving your body and hands slightly. For example, if the pitch could be a ball or strike, try to catch the outside of the ball and slightly twist your wrist as you move your arm outward.
Move your arm and glove forward a couple inches after you catch it., If you think a ball will hit the dirt and bounce, you need to quickly position yourself to get the ball. Try to move yourself slightly toward the ball. In addition, position your legs so you can quickly spring toward the ball.


You may need to drop to your knees so you can better lean in toward the ball.
Depending on the trajectory of the ball, you may need to duck your chin down to protect your neck.
Don’t move too much. You could wind up getting hit by the ball or the bat., Much like with catching dirt balls, acquiring a ball that falls a little short of you is very important. The quicker you get the ball, the quicker you can stop your opponents from advancing. To scoop the ball, move toward it and scoop downward with your glove and use your throwing hand to direct the ball into your glove., When it comes to catching pop ups and fouls, you’ll have to quickly remove your helmet, stand up, and catch the ball. This is important, as it will give you the mobility and the ability to see the ball.

, As a catcher, you’ll have provide hand signs to the rest of your team about possible defensive plays. Signs may vary, as you don’t want the opposite team to know what you’re going to do. Some signs include:


One finger for a fast ball, two fingers for a curve ball, three fingers for a slider, and four fingers or wiggle fingers for a changeup., You and the pitcher are fundamentally a team within the larger team. To properly collaborate, you’ll need to forge real communication with the pitcher. Be sure they know your hand signs. In addition, know which type of balls your pitcher can throw the best.

, In many ways, the pitcher is a defensive coordinator for the team. As a pitcher, you’ll need to be able to effectively communicate with your team mates and to send them signals during the game. You’ll also have to be supportive and mentor weaker players.

Talk to your teammates before the game.
Avoid making defensive success or failure about any one person. Encourage everything to work together as a team.

, To be a successful leader and catcher, you’ll need to observe and talk to your teammates to find out their strengths and weaknesses. Without knowing these, you won’t be able to mount a proper defense.


Focus your attention on pitchers and basemen., As catcher, you’ll have a large responsibility in planning your team’s defense. You’ll have a say in which players are on the bases, you’ll be able to give your basemen a sense of where and who they should throw balls to, and more. As a result, take the time to reflect on your overall defense.

Get the grip sorted first.,
For an adjusted sinker grip, go for a four-seam grip.",How to Throw a Sinker1," Place your middle and index finger between two inside seams, like you're throwing a two-seam fastball. Lay or tuck your thumb under the ball lightly.

, Hold both index and middle fingers so that they run perpendicular to the U-shaped seams.


This gives you more of a cut on your sinker, so you have to be careful to keep both fingers on top of the ball until it's released. If your hand ends up closes to the side of the ball, this will pronounce the cutting action of the pitch and turn it more into a cutter.
Move your thumb from the 6 o'clock position to about the 7 or 8 o'clock position. This grip with your thumb will force you to throw the pitch in a certain way, creating sink.

Understand the risks.",How to Throw a Spitball," The object is to create resistance and a change in the uniform weight of the ball to make its motion more unpredictable and difficult to hit. There's no ""right place"" to put it, since the object is unpredictability, as with a knuckleball.








Alternatively, scratching the ball with a file or sandpaper can be a similarly-effective way of messing with the weight and the trajectory. It's still illegal, but it's a possibility.
Since the friction between your fingers and the ball gives the ball its spin, you can also keep the goop on your finger while you throw. Something slippery, like spit, will reduce the friction of the pitch, achieving a similar effect. It's not illegal to lick your fingers before throwing a pitch.;
, There's no specific technique to the spitball that's different than a regular fastball. Throw a fastball as you normally would, using the same grip and technique, though the result should have action similar to that of a knuckleball.









If you've just got some wetness on your fingers when you pitch, it might be somewhat more difficult to control, slipping out of your hand as opposed to rolling out as with a normal fastball. It may take some practice to get used to the feeling.

, A forkball or a split-finger fastball are legal pitches that behave in much the same way, looking at first like traditional fastballs but then behaving unpredictably, often slowing and sinking at the last minute when thrown correctly. In a forkball, the ball is seated more deeply between the forked fingers, whereas the split-finger fastball is a more modern and comfortable version of the same pitch.









With the great diversity of off-speed pitches available to the pitching repertoire, it's recommended to always favor some other pitch, as opposed to relying upon an illegal spitball to strike out your opponents. It's a fun thing to learn for novelty's sake, but you can't and shouldn't use it in a game.

, Sometimes called a ""spitball from God,"" the ball will behave somewhat differently, offering sharper breaking trajectories for the pitcher in damp conditions. Pitching in areas with a high humidity will offer a similar effect, as well as pitches in slightly drizzly rain conditions. If it's wet out, you'll be throwing spitball whether you like it or not.








, Historically, one of the most popular ways to get away with applying an illegal substance to the ball was to dab a little bit of vaseline or personal lubricant on the inside brim of your hat in the dugout. Before pitching, readjust your cap slightly and take a little of the substance off with your thumb and apply it to the ball before pitching.








, Less common, but still effective is the technique of rubbing a little vaseline on the inside lip of your glove and dabbing it on when you've got the ball in your mitt. Be sure to only use as small an amount as possible and use your spitball judiciously if you decide to do it.








, It's possible to ""accidentally"" rub up against some vaseline in the dugout and end up with a small amount on the back of your leg. If you, say, scratched the back of your leg and ended up with some on your fingers before a pitch, well, that wouldn't be your fault. Right?








, Nail files, emery boards, or even small pieces of sandpaper are sometimes hidden in the glove, or cupped in the finger during a pitch to scratch the ball and affect the trajectory like a spitball. ""Double Duty"" Radcliffe, a pitcher in the '30s, used to hide a nail file in his belt buckle during games to scratch the ball on as he prepared for a pitch.








, In the gray area of legality is the greasy-hair pitch. If you've got some dirty locks, you can get your head a little damp with a small amount of water before heading to the mound, then take off your cap and run the fingers of your pitching hand through your hair before pitching. The grease from your hair will be wet enough to come off easily and can affect the ball significantly.








, The penalty for throwing a single spitball can be expulsion from the game, and even the league. As recently as the '80s, MLB pitches have been suspended and fined after being caught with scuffing objects on their person while on the field. Again, it's a fun thing to try in the backyard or in the sandlot, but don't try it in a game.

Keep your fingers on top of the ball until you release it.,
Try to get topspin or pronation on your sinker as you release it.,
Try throwing the sinker ball from a lower arm-angle than your top-and-down fastball.,
Pay attention to these other tricks.",How to Throw a Sinker2," If you drop your finger over to the side before you release the ball, expect to get more cut than sink on your ball.;
, This will give the pitch a little clockwise rotational spin, causing it to move into a right-handed batter if thrown as a right-handed pitch.

, lowering your arm-angle will make the pronation you apply to the ball more natural, in addition to putting less pressure on your arm.

, You can adjust the sinker in the following ways to get a different movement to it:


The lower you throw it in the strike zone the more it will drop.
The faster your (arm) speed, the more break you tend to get.
If you flick your wrist, it could help with the drop. This, however, will put more strain on your wrist. See if it feels comfortable.

Pay attention to arm motion.,
The key to throwing an accurate strike to the base is to make sure you don't get distracted by things you can't control.",How to Throw out a Runner Trying to Steal a Base," Read the situation presented before you. A catcher must know how many runners are in position, how many are out, and if possible, what the likelihood is that the baserunners will steal. This will change how you set up your footwork, what kind of pitch you will call, or whether or not you should call for your pitcher to pick-off.;
, Before the pitch is thrown in a throwdown situation, you must be in position to make sure you can get a quick throw off. Your throwing foot should be half a foot further ahead than your back foot, to help reduce time in getting your footwork together. Depending on the situation, you should determine how close or far your should be to the plate. In a situation where there is a right-handed batter and a man possibly stealing third, it is best to line up slightly further from the plate in order to throw behind the batter. This would give you a clear target to third base to get the best possible throw off.

, There are several different ways to learn how to set up your feet for a throw down. I suggest setting up as shown earlier, and then proceeding as such. The first step is to make sure that you secure the ball in your glove before you worry about the throw to second. From here, make sure you cut down the amount of steps you take with the ball. As you receive the ball plant your front foot towards the base your throwing to and release as quickly as possible. Avoid shuffling at all costs, as the longer you are holding the ball, the more time the runner has to get to the base.

, Getting the ball out of your hand quickly is more important than how hard you actually throw the ball. As the ball is about to make impact with your glove, place your throwing hand directly behind your glove to create the fastest possible transfer time. Once you've caught the ball, bring the ball straight behind you and time your throw with your footwork. Follow through with your throw to throw as hard as possible and to reduce the chance of injury.

, If the man covering the base isn't at the base yet, he will be, so get your throw off and let him worry about his job. Most commonly, runners are trying to steal second, so we will focus on the primary targets there. A common mistake is to try to hit the glove of the man covering the base, which is difficult because it's a moving target. Common places to aim where your throwing is at the pitchers head or directly at the base. Keep your throw low and on your right side of the base to help apply an easy tag on the runner.

Hide your grip.,
Wind up and throw.,
Keep your wrist loose as you release the ball.,
Snap your wrist when releasing a slider.,
Think fastball as you release the pitch.,
Aim for the slider to break on the inside or outside of the plate.",How to Throw a Slider," Grip the baseball with your index and middle fingers placed tightly together across an outer seam of the ball located at the horseshoe or U-shape seam. For right-handers, place your middle finger across the right half of the seam. Left-handers should do the opposite: place your middle finger across the left half of the seam. This should position your fingers towards the outside of the ball (off-center).;
, Place your thumb under the opposite inside seam of the ball. The further your thumb is from your other 2 fingers, the more the pitch will drop. The closer your thumb is to your other two fingers, the more it will slide. If your index and middle fingers are at a 10 or 11 o'clock position, your thumb should be at a 4 or 5 o'clock position.

, Hold the pitch so that the most pressure comes from the thumb-side of your index finger.The key to gripping a slider is holding the outer third of the ball.


Putting pressure on your both your index and middle fingers will cause the pitch to balance out, or become a cutter.

, Most pitchers do this to ensure that the ball releases on the thumb-side of your index finger. The movement of this pitch comes from the ball spinning off your fingers.









Avoid twisting your wrist. Twisting your wrist can cause injury over time.

, If the batter can see your grip before the pitch, chances are they will be more prepared for what you are about to throw at them. Hide your grip in your glove to keep players on the other team unaware of the slider you are about to throw., Pivot and shift your body weight from the back foot forward toward home plate. Follow through with your motion. Your feet should be parallel at the end of the pitch and your throwing arm should come across the front of your body.








, Remember to have it cocked slightly, but resist the urge to twist it (side to side) it when you release the pitch. As you release, apply pressure with just your index finger to ensure a late break.








Try not to drive your wrist forward with more than an adequate amount of force.

, Snap your wrist (up to down) to make the ball drop as it crosses the plate. Remember to let the spin of the slider come from your index finger releasing from the ball, not a twisting of your wrist. Snapping is an up and down motion, while twisting is a side to side motion.








, Prepare to come right down through with your wrist, just like you would with a fastball. The greater the angle created by turning the fingers, the wider the break on the slider







, The slider is an effective pitch whether thrown to same side or opposite side hitters. However, the slider looses its effectiveness if it's thrown directly over the plate. The success of the slider is its ability to break at the last minute and catch the batter off guard.








A left-handed pitcher's slider should break down and away from left-handed hitters, and down and in on right-handed hitters.
A right-handed pitcher's slider should break down and away from right-handed hitters, and down and in on left-handed hitters.

Dig your four fingernails into the middle of the seams behind the horseshoe. Use enough pressure so that the ball is firmly grasped with injuring your fingertips.
Keep your thumb off to the side of the ball, slightly underneath it. This is your only stability point so you may need to grip harder to control the ball.

, Avoid digging your knuckles into the ball. Although the knuckleball was originally thrown with the knuckles pointing into the ball rather than the finger tips, this is not as effective. You're trying to reduce the amount of spin you put on the ball. Grabbing the ball with your knuckles may cause the ball to rotate more than necessary. This can create more spin, less movement, and the pitch will be easier to hit.

Most players will take a jab step backwards while anticipating the pitch, and then cross over with the left foot when entering the swing. Practice this motion without a bat before trying to slap bunt in practice.;
, Position your feet slightly open towards right field, as this will make for an easier transition when you start running towards first base.

, Move your hands a few inches up the bat handle in order to get a better feel.

, When the ball is pitched, slide your front foot back towards the rear foot and the rear foot crosses over and becomes the first step towards first base.

, It is important to keep the lower body opened up towards the left side of the infield through the swing.

, Make sure your shoulders are still square to the pitcher, even while swinging. This is an important step to master, as many ballplayers have trouble getting the hang of this.

, Don't chop at the ball. Chopping reduces the time the bat stays in the plane of the pitch and so reduces the chance of contact.

, Let the barrel of the bat trail your hands slightly so that you hit the inside of the ball which will result in a hit to the left side of the infield. #Start running. When the pitch comes, already start running to first with your bat out. Watch film of stars like Ichiro Suzuki begin striding even as they make contact.

, Drop the bat as quickly as possible, as the added weight will slow you down.

, Focus on keeping your head from bobbing when running. This will lower your time from home to first.

Keep a fast arm motion.,
Keep your wrist up as you release the pitch.,
Perfect your release.",How to Throw a Knuckleball2," Go through your windup normally, with a normal fastball motion until you reach your release point. The knuckleball should look like a fastball until the pitcher reveals the ball right before his release. You don't want to tip your pitches to the batter.








Don't alter your arm slot or anything else. This can reduce the chance your knuckleball will knuckle and end up as a soft lob.

, This is essential to getting minimal amount of spin. Throwing a fastball, you usually move your wrist down as you release the ball, creating steady spin on the ball and causing it to travel straight, more or less. Throwing a knuckleball, you try to do the opposite, because you don't want spin.








Extend your fingertips out as you release the ball. This will minimize spin.
Try to let your knuckles be the topmost point of your hand as you release. Having your knuckles at the very top of your hand will ensure that less spin is created when you release the ball.

, Let the ball slip through your hands by releasing your thumb from the grip. Follow through and end as if you are throwing any other pitch.

Know who to use it against.,
Known when to use it.,

Practice by throwing straight up.,
Practice by playing hot potato.",How to Throw a Knuckleball3," Batters that prefer to hit fastballs over breaking pitches are more likely struggle with the knuckleball. Ask your teammates what they know about the batter or watch them playing other teams.


Batters who are generally impatient and swing a lot are also good targets for the knuckleball., Your knuckleball may become predictable if you use it too often, especially when you’re new to it and still perfecting your technique. Start out using it as a strikeout and change-of-pace pitch.








Use your strikeout pitches when you have a two-strike count except when the count is full.
If you’re using it as an occasional change-of-pace pitch, try to only use it once per inning or less.

, It's harder to throw a knuckleball out of the windup than it is when you're playing catch. After warming up, line up about 30 feet away from your throwing partner and practice mastering the grip and the motion before you combine it all in a pitch.







, Lie down and practice throwing the knuckler upwards instead of out. Practice getting the right grip and release. Throwing the ball vertically will help your muscle memory remember to keep your wrist up as you release.







, Try zero-rotation hot potato with some friends or teammates. For an added challenge, try to get all involved in the game to throw knuckleballs.

Follow through.,
Change your aim.,
Keep practicing.,
Decide when to use the slurve.",How to Throw a Slurve," Don't attempt this until you have mastered the fastball and changeup.You can learn the slurve without knowing the curveball or slider, but many people consider the slurve less useful to master than those two pitches.Curveballs and slurves probably cause more injuries than other pitches, although not as many as commonly believed.Most players are told not to try this until they turn fourteen years old.;
, Place your middle finger on the right seam or just outside it. Place your index finger touching your middle finger.If one seam stands higher on the ball than the other, grip that one with your middle finger. This will give you a better grip, since your middle finger is responsible for most of a slurve grip.As usual, keep your fourth and fifth fingers bent at the side of the ball, barely touching it.

, Place your thumb on the left seam at the lower side of the ball. Do not bend your thumb.This is similar to the four seam fastball grip, but with your thumb closer to your index finger.

, Your index finger should barely press against the ball. Put a bit more pressure on the middle finger, but keep it gentle., Throw a hard ¾ pitch, as you would a slider (or a four seam fastball if you don't know how to throw a slider). As you extend your arm, rotate at the elbow. Just before you release the ball, the back of your hand should be facing outward., Snapping your wrist as you throw will create a more significant downward break.Start with your wrist slightly cocked, but not stiff. At the moment you release the ball, snap the wrist downward so the back of your hand turns to face home plate.This variation has a considerable risk of injury. Practice with slow pitches first, and consider wrist-strengthening exercises. Most baseball pitchers do not recommend snapping your wrist until you are at least fourteen years old.
If you decide to practice without the wrist movement, don't try to compensate with faster elbow snapping, which can also cause injury., Keep your hand moving across your body and down to the opposite knee.

, This odd, hybrid pitch can be unpredictable for the pitcher as well. You'll get a better idea of how your slurve breaks as you practice. For now, try aiming behind the batter's back (if the batter is a righty).Keep an eye on where the ball travels, or have a friend stand behind the batter and advise you on how to adjust your aim.

, A successful slurve is faster than a curveball and dips down slightly, but mostly breaks towards the pitcher's glove side like a slider. This won't be as fast as a slider, or break downward as much as a curveball, but it's a compromise that works well for some pitchers.


Because a slurve is a hybrid pitch, fans have trouble agreeing over the exact break. Most agree that a slurve breaks from 2 to 8 o'clock or from 3 to 8 o'clock., The slurve is a controversial pitch, since it's right in the middle of the spectrum. You won't be pitching your best speeds, but you won't get the most dramatic break either. Like all pitches, this is best used when the batter doesn't expect it. Try pitching a few sliders, then switching to a slurve for one pitch.


If a batter isn't used to a slurve, you can sometimes find success pitching it repeatedly. After a certain level, though, players are ready for the slurve and unlikely to be stymied by this tactic.

Keep your body in a straight line.,
Take a small step to increase your power.,
Initiate the swing with your hips.,
Keep your eyes on the ball.,
Turn your shoulders into the swing.,
Follow through to drive it home.",How to Swing a Baseball Bat," Place your feet shoulder width apart or slightly wider. Your feet should be parallel to one another and aligned directly under your shoulders. If you’re right handed, your left side should be facing the pitcher, with your head pointed in the direction the ball will be coming from. If you’re left handed, it will be your right side. Above all, your stance should be comfortable.








Resting on the balls of your feet will make your movements quicker and your stance more reactive.;
, Bend your knees and sink into the balls of your feet. Don’t crouch or stoop too low—make sure there is a little spring in your knees and hips. A lower center of gravity will help you generate force in your swing and stabilize you while you’re batting.








It’s important to adopt a steady, grounded stance to keep from compromising your balance.
Don’t stick out your butt or let your upper body lean too far.

, Keep both feet firmly rooted on the ground until you’re ready to start your swing. The more steady your stance, the more power you’ll be able to produce by driving from the feet up. As you begin the swing, you will take a small step with your front foot and twist the back foot to follow through, but up until you make contact with the ball, both feet should be locked in place.








Your weight should be positioned very slightly over your rear foot to prepare you to step into your swing later on.

, Relax your muscles and prepare to move your body in one fluid motion. If you’re tense, your movements will be erratic and your speed and precision will suffer. Shake out your shoulders, hips and ankles before stepping up to bat. Remind yourself to remain loose and poised rather than bunching up.Sports research has found that athletes move much faster and more smoothly when they are relaxed., To get an effective grip, lay the handle of the bat across the fingers of both hands, then wrap your hands around the bat. Don’t hold the bat in the palms, as this doesn’t allow you to flex and rotate your wrists as well when you swing. Keep a light grip on the bat until the moment you make contact with the ball to maximize your speed and reactivity.Don’t grip too high on the handle of the bat; this can blunt your swing. There should be very little space between the pinky finger of your bottom hand and the bottom knob.
Always think of gripping the bat with the fingers, not the whole hand.

, Keep the tops of your fingers in one long row down the grip of the bat. The bat will shift in your hands as you swing, and both hands will naturally turn on the handle. Use the pressure of your fingers to steady the bat, but don’t grip it too tightly.








If it isn’t comfortable to hold the bat with the tops of your knuckles aligned, try turning your hands inward until your middle knuckles point in the same direction. This is known as a “box grip.”

, Let the bat point upwards at an angle over your shoulder rather than resting it flat across your back. Keep the bat raised off your shoulder, ready to begin the swing. At no point should any part of the bat touch your back, neck or shoulder.








The angle at which you hold the bat should be around or just over 45 degrees.
It’s easier to enter into the swing quickly if there’s already some muscular tension on the bat. Your swing will be much more sluggish if you’re trying to move the bat from a dead stop.

, Situate your center of gravity over your feet and keep your toes, knees, hips and shoulders aligned. Point your chin toward the mound to have an eye on the ball at all times. From this position, you will explode and uncoil once the ball is within hitting distance.








If any part of your body deviates from your linear stance, you will sacrifice speed, power and control.

, Once the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand, step out very slightly with the front foot. Only move the foot 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), and be careful not to come out of alignment or lose tightness in your core as you step. This will increase the power of your swing by adding directional force to the motion of the hips and shoulders.








Be careful not to throw off your balance as you step. The step should be quick, short and leave you in a position with a solid base to hit the ball.

, With one quick motion, rotate the hips to create momentum for the swing. Don’t let the hips sway or move out of alignment with the rest of your body as you swivel. If you’re right handed, you should turn your hips counterclockwise, and clockwise for left handed batters. Most of the power of a good swing originates at the hips.The swing should begin with the hips, with the shoulders following closely behind. A lot of injuries occur when players try to “muscle” the ball with a wrenching motion of the shoulders.
Try to stay upright as you rotate so you don’t come off your axis.

, Drop your chin and keep your head held low throughout your swing. Your line of sight should be locked onto the ball at all times, from the beginning of the pitch to the moment that either the bat touches the ball or you strike out. Stay focused and get ready to time your swing. Lowering your chin will help keep your head in alignment with the rest of your body, as you will be hunched over and bent at the waist slightly while preparing to bat.Don't tilt your head too much when dropping your chin. If your eyes are not level, it may throw off your perspective and compromise your ability to zero in on the ball.During batting practice, pay close attention to the path that the ball takes to get better at tracking it as it moves toward you.

, Bring your shoulders across your body, following the hips. Remain relaxed until just before the bat strikes the ball. The entire body should uncoil like a spring, from the feet up through the hips, ending with the turn of the shoulders.








The shaft of the bat should stay in tight during the first part of the swing. As a rule, the further the tip of the bat is from the body, the less leverage you have., After you’ve struck the ball, continue driving through the swing until the bat is extended over your opposite shoulder. At the end of your rotation your upper body should be facing the pitcher. A good follow through will put extra heat on the ball to smash it out of the park.








Following through makes the most of the momentum of rotation, stopping the forward movement of the ball and sending it back with as much power as possible.
Some players prefer to keep both hands on the bat as they follow through, while others release their top hand and let the bat continue swinging like a backhand. Try out both methods, but do whatever feels most comfortable to you."

To steal a base, one must possess three traits: fast reflexes, a keen eye and a little speed.,
Now speed has to be developed.,
Develop a keen eye.,
Develop patience.,
Now is the actual part where you put the good skills you learned to use.,
Now practice all of this with a couple of friends and you will get the hang of it.

,
Game time.,SLIDE INTO THE BASE

,Call time dust yourself off

",How to Steal a Base," These traits don't always come naturally, so they have to be developed. The most important thing to remember is to keep practicing. Practice makes perfection.;
, To get faster, simply run track every weekend. The reason not to run everyday is because it will burn out one's body. So running everyday is not a good idea. Also, time the speed of the laps you run. See if it improves.

, A keen eye is another thing. This needs serious brain work and physical work. To obtain a keen eye, have a friend throw a ball at you as fast as he/she can. Make sure he/she throw it at your feet. Simply dodge these. There are two reasons one would want to dodge these. 1 is to practice moving your feet the instance it's needed. The 2nd reason is because if that ball hits you, it's going to hurt!

, To develop patience is easier than developing a keen eye. All one has to do is meditate. Just sit down for 10 minutes in a quiet area and think. This will help you to develop patience.

, Practice this beforehand so you don't have to be put on the spot during a game where you need to steal a base. Pretend the pitcher just released the ball. Sprint to the next base as fast as you possibly can. Don't look at the ball, just run to the base. If you want, you can have a friend throw the ball toward you for a better idea. Realize that often, catchers and basemen have very quick reflexes. If you're too sluggish, they may tag you out.

,, On first when the pitcher first gets set face second and take a step with your left foot pivot to face the infield grass and home plate shuffle about 4-5 steps. More or less depending on your reflexes. NEVER TAKE YOUR EYE OFF THE PITCHER'S FEET. On right hander as soon as that front foot goes up take off. If the back foot comes up first GET BACK NOW. Timing is everything. A good jump can beat a lot of catchers. On a lefty if you commit when that front foot comes up do not stop no matter what. Do not get in a run down unless there is a runner on 3rd. If you are not running when that foot comes up wait. When it goes forward take your secondary lead.

,,"

If you are just starting out, you don't want to try to place the ball, the most important thing is to make good contact,and the hits will come.,
Learn how to adjust your swing,not by changing the actual speed of your swing, but the starting moment of your swing.

,
If you are trying to hit a ball to the opposite field, do not change anything about your swing.,
To pull the ball, start your swing slightly sooner with your trigger than you would normally, allowing the bat head to get through the strike zone quickly and out in front of the ball.",How to Place the Ball You Hit in Baseball,";
,, Start your swing with a slightly later trigger to keep the bat head from crossing all of the way through the strike zone. Close off your hips by placing the foot closest to the pitcher a few inches closer to the plate. This will allow you to make contact with the pitch later in the zone and drive it to the opposite field.

, Open up your hips by taking the foot closest to the pitcher and moving it farther away from home plate.

Grip the bat with both hands near the bottom of the grip.,
Hold the bat up and in front of you.,
Plant your legs slightly more than shoulder-width apart.,
Rest on the balls of your feet and keep your weight back.,
Relax your elbows and knees.,
Point your eyes and head directly at the pitcher.,
Time your step with the pitcher, if you take a step.,
Turn your back knee towards the ball as your front heel touches down.,
Start your swing through your hips, transferring your power from your legs to your torso.,
Use your lower arm to guide the bat to the ball.,
Bring the elbow of your upper arm close to your chest.,
Swing your hands through the ball, not at it.,
Hit the ball with backspin.",How to Hit a Home Run1," Your dominant hand will go on top. The middle knuckles of your upper hand should line up with the bottom of your fingers on the lower hand (part of the finger between your palm and middle knuckle).


Gripping the bat 1-2 inches above the bottom is called “choking up.” You can get more power the lower your hands are, but choking up improves bat speed. Find a comfortable spot for you.;
, You elbows should be roughly nipple height and the bat will be 8-12 inches away from your chest. Make sure you're comfortable, relaxed, and can swing the bat with ease.


Keep the bat high – shoulder height or higher – in order to come down on the ball with power.

, Your toes should point towards the plate and your legs will be spread apart.


Your feet should face in front of you. Do not splay your toes out to the side or in towards the plate.

, The ball of your foot is the small area in between your toes and your arches. Keeping your weight on the balls of your feet lets your move quickly. Rest roughly 60% of your weight on your back foot, towards the catcher.You should be able to quickly pick up your front foot and step it towards the pitcher’s mound.

, You want a slight bend in your elbows and knees, allowing you to move quickly and smoothly when the pitch comes. This is a small point, but an essential one if you want to catch up to a fast pitch., You need to be able to see the pitcher and the ball the entire time it is coming at you. If it helps, turn your front foot slightly towards the pitcher to open up your body.


Keep your eye on the ball the entire time you are swinging.

, If you are a batter who steps with the front foot, time your step to end when the pitcher’s leg touches down. Your front foot should be planted on the ground when the ball is released.








, This initiates a strong, powerful swing. As you start your swing your front foot must be planted firmly on the ground or you will lose balance and power.

, Your back foot will pivot on the toe and your hips will turn towards the pitcher as your bat approaches the ball. You will feel your weight start to transfer towards your front foot. Your hips are where your develop your power – think of your hips as a tightly wrapped rubber band uncoiling as your turn towards the ball.


Make sure you are turning your hips before your hands. Remember the adage: “your hips lead your hands.”, Your lower hand is the one that puts the bat on the ball, so try to match your lower hand with the trajectory of the ball. Think of taking the knob at the end of the bat and swinging it on the same path as the ball.


Your lower hand also helps you get speed, but do no try to “pull” the bat forward. Your hips are driving the bat forward and your hands are helping guide it.

, Your top arm keeps your swing quick and compact. Begin to tuck your elbow in towards your chest to shorten your swing, driving the bat quickly through the ball.Make sure your elbow stays behind your hands as you tuck it in. You want your hands to lead the bat.

, You want to keep swinging through the ball, not stopping after making contact, to get real power. As you make contact, imagine that there are two more balls right behind it that you need to hit as well. Your momentum will take the bat around your body as your weight shifts forward.

, Home run balls need backspin to help them fly longer. There are two good ways to get backspin:


Stay on the inside of the ball. Keep your swing compact and think of hitting the half of the ball closer to your body.
Hit down on the lower two-thirds of the ball. This lifts the ball and spins it backwards off the bat, allowing it to cruise towards the bleacher seats. You might feel like you are almost “chopping” at the ball, but the trick is to catch the bottom two-thirds of the ball to get power."
"
Place your index and middle finger on the inside seam of the horseshoe, as you would with a curveball grip.,
Wind up and start your throwing motion as you would throw a fastball.,
When throwing the pitch, pronate your wrist in the opposite direction you would throwing a curveball.,
Finish off the pitch by putting pressure on your pointer finger until you release the ball.,
Throw the screwball sparingly.",How to Throw a Screwball," This is a two-seam screwball grip; countless other grips can be used to throw the screwball, but this is probably what beginners should start off with. Be sure to hold both index and middle fingers together in your grip.


Put your pointer finger on the seams. This way, it has more traction or grip on the ball, creating a bigger break when you actually throw the pitch.






Grip the baseball so that your two fingers cross the bottom part of the horseshoe. Again, the more traction you create when the baseball leaves your hand, the more likely it is to dip to curve if thrown with the proper mechanics.





;
, Mimicking the motion of the fastball is important here. You want to disguise your pitch until the last possible second so that the batter doesn't know in advance what kind of a pitch you are throwing.

, The screwball is the reverse-curveball. If thrown by a rightie, it breaks down and away from lefties. To get this kind of spin on the ball, you want to turn your wrist counter-clockwise if you're a right handed pitcher.

, Think of pulling down the ball with your pointer finger as you release it. This should give the ball better curve and slice.

, The screwball may be a devastating pitch to batters, but it's also gained a reputation for being a devastating pitch for pitchers. That's because the wrist action that pitchers need to perform in order to throw it can be difficult to repeat and puts undue stress on the wrist and arm. Pitchers who specialize in the screwball often find that the torque generated by throwing it is uncomfortable, especially after having had surgery."

;
, Be sure to hold the ball like you would handle an egg: firmly, but not too tight.








, Make sure your wrist is not stiff because it will need to be able to snap quickly.








, Any baseball pitch requires the pitcher to shift weight in order to gain momentum for the pitch. The dominant leg will step back before sweeping forward across the body as the hands come up and then down in preparation for the throw.









You may want to look up video that shows you a standard pitch before you attempt to try it: , Start by standing with your feet shoulder width apart.








, Take a small step backwards with the same foot as your pitching hand. You’re pitching hand is usually called your stride hand.









As you do that bring your pitching hand and glove to your head.

, Bring your stride leg up and over across your body, bending the knee as it rises parallel to the ground.









Tip: Keep your back knee slightly bent to improve balance.

, Make sure your hips are facing to the side.









If you are pitching with your right hand, your hips will be rotated to the left.
If you are pitching with your left hand, your hips will be rotated to the right.

, As you lower your stride leg, lunge forward with the stride leg toward the target.








, As you lunge forward, pull your pitch arm behind you and above your shoulder. Your glove hand should be pulling your shoulder toward the target.









Rotate the arm counter-clockwise behind you. Your arm should be making a circular motion.

, The Secret of the Demon Miracle Pitch emphasizes the importance of hip and shoulder unison. Practice the unwinding motion several times before throwing the ball.








, Rotate your arm away from the body. After you have pulled the arm back, rotate your arm forward and away from the body with your palm facing third base for a right-handed pitcher and first base for a left-handed pitcher.









The pitching arm will come forward and down so that the back of your hand will face you.

, Make sure that the palm of your hand faces away from you with the thumb toward the ground. This begins before the release to create the side-over-side spin.








, Snap your wrist as you release the ball and turn your hand away from your body as though it were a football.









Allow the ball to roll off of your pointer finger.
The gyroball does spin not backward (like a fastball) or forward (like a curveball) but in a spiral (like a well-thrown football).

, Do not let the arm drift back in toward the body, as per normal American baseball customary motion. Your arms should be totally across the body.

Watch videos of baseball players.",How to Throw a Palmball," A palmball differs from a fastball largely due to its placement in the hand which is why learning the correct form is so important.You want to begin by holding the ball with the horseshoe curve facing toward the plate.


If you are right-handed, grasp the ball with the middle finger on the top left part of the ball and with your ring finger on the top right.
If you are left-handed, grasp the ball with the middle finger on the top right part of the ball and with your ring finger on the top left.;
, You want to be sure that the ball is firmly gripped in the palm of your hand to create the maximum off-speed effect., You want to evenly distribute your fingers around the ball so that they are not touching any of the seams. Place your thumb directly on the bottom of the ball while still avoiding the seam.Apply pressure on the ball using your thumb to keep it firmly in your palm.

, Applying even pressure on the ball is a vital aspect of throwing a palmball correctly. If the pressure is evenly distributed and the ball remains tightly lodged into your palm, you will likely have more control of the speed and direction the ball goes in.

, Use the same rotation as you do for a fastball motion to increase the likelihood of fooling the batter. Though you will be using the same throwing motion as you do for a fastball, your grip will take a lot of velocity off of the pitch.When releasing the ball, be sure to open your hand as wide as possible. This will ensure that you don’t accidentally brush any of the seams, which could interfere with the trajectory of the ball.Be sure not to snap your wrist as you release the ball.

, Following through involves letting the natural momentum of your hand movement take its complete course. After pitching the ball, allow your arm to follow through until it comes back to your waist.


Though this step seems like a minor detail, failure to follow through on your pitch could interfere with the trajectory of your palmball., This is the most obvious way to perfect your palmball technique. Find a buddy who is willing to play catch with you and get out there and throw palmballs until the technique becomes second nature to you.


If you have any friends who play baseball or a coach, ask them to observe and give you feedback. If they have a lot of experience in throwing palmballs, they may also be able to demonstrate in person and you can follow along.

, Pitching drills are important for improving your accuracy. After all, throwing a palmball isn’t much use if you can’t get the ball to go towards the precise location you are aiming for.


There are a variety of pitching drills you can practice to improve your skills. For example, you can do kneeling partner pitches (if you have someone to practice with). For this drill, both players kneel on the ground with gloves but only one ball.
Start by standing about 10 feet apart from each other and simply pitch back and forth. The goal is to pitch with such accuracy that the catcher does not have to extend his arms out to his sides to catch the ball.You can also make this drill more challenging by standing further apart from each other.

, Recording and then watching you practice throwing palmballs will allow you to study and refine your technique. Oftentimes we don’t notice small mistakes in our posture, gripping, or pitching and all of these are crucial to throwing excellent palmballs.


Next time you practice, set up a recorder or have someone record you on their phone to study your own technique and modify accordingly.

, There are many famous pitchers who use the palmball technique during games, such as Trevor Hoffman, Steve Farr, and Roy Halladay. Try looking up videos online of professional baseball players who have used this technique and watch closely.


You can watch for specific details or styles that the different baseball players employ and then emulate them later in your own practice.

Choose the right bat.,
Relax your swing.,
Hit off of the tee.,
Lift weights to get stronger.,
Videotape your swing to find mistakes.,
Practice hitting off a variety of pitchers.",How to Hit a Home Run2," While there a lot of different ways to choose a bat, the most important criteria is comfort. You should, first and foremost, feel natural when swinging. To find the correct bat you should take your dominant hand and hold the bat parallel to the ground. It should feel slightly heavy and difficult to hold up. Choose a bat a 1/3 of an ounce lighter than this weight.Check out this table of bat lengths by body type to get a good idea where to start shopping.

, This is the best thing you can do to get more power on the ball quickly. You want your arms and knees to be slightly bent and loose, not tensed. Work on swinging naturally and smoothly, avoiding jerky movements meant to hit the ball hard.








Remember, good mechanics and a smooth swing are more important than trying to force as much power on your swing as you can.

, Despite its reputation as a little-league tool, the tee is great way to practice your swing mechanics and work on hitting the bottom 2/3 of the ball. Take 20-30 reps every day your practice, practicing not only how you hit the ball but where.


Focus on hitting the lower two-thirds of the ball to get the best height and distance on the ball you can. You can tell when you hit it well by comparing distances.

, While even smaller players can hit the ball out of the park with good mechanics, it is easier to hit the ball farther when you are stronger. Remember, however, that swinging a bat requires your whole body, not just your arms. Areas to focus on include:



Abs and Core: A strong core helps you transfer energy from your legs through your torso, and is essential for bat speed and power. Incorporate sit-ups, crunches, planks, and medicine ball throws into every workout.

Legs: Most of your power comes through your legs, so you can often make the most dramatic gains through squats, leg presses, and box jumps.

Arms: Of course, you have to have strong arms to hit the ball hard. Practice swings and hitting off the tee should be a part of every workout, but you can also incorporate barbell rows, bench-press, and forearm curls to gain the bat speed needed for home runs.

, This is one of the best ways to diagnose problems with your swing and get more power. Set up a camera and take 10-20 swings from a pitcher and 10-20 off of a tee. There are several common problems to note:


Dropping your or hands before your swing.Moving your lower body frequently before and during the swing.
Forgetting to turn your hips.
Opening the feet away from the plate., The best way to hit home runs is to keep practicing. You need to work hard to get used to different pitches, hone your mechanics, and build strength with the bat. Practice makes perfect, so take as many chances you can to hit pitches. Having a coach or trusted friend to point out mistakes or tweak your form often helps.

"
"
Find the pitcher’s release point.,
Watch a pitcher’s wrist to determine how the ball is thrown.,
Look for pitches on the inside and middle of the plate.,
Know that lower pitches are easier to hit out of the park.",How to Hit a Home Run3," This is the point in the throw where the pitcher releases the ball and is usually when his arm is highest. For softball, the ball is usually released just past the pitcher’s thigh. Start your swing shortly after the ball is released.


This is the best way to time your swing. If you know when the ball is released, you know when to start your swing.

, Other than grip, which is often impossible to tell, the way a pitcher follows through often determines a pitch’s movement. This applies for softball pitchers too, except their wrists snap up, not down.


If the pitcher snaps his wrist down then they are throwing a fast-ball or change up, which only moves vertically. These pitches are usually faster, so swing earlier.
If the pitcher torques their wrist to the side they are likely throwing a change-up or slider, forcing the pitch to move side to side. These pitches are usually slower, so hold your swing a half second.
If the pitcher does not move their wrists, they are throwing an unpredictable knuckleball pitch. These are frequently slow and difficult to predict

, When a ball is thrown closer to your body you can get all of your power behind the ball. As you swing, your body will turn and catch the ball on the inside, “pulling” it and making contact with the “sweet spot” of the bat.

, According to statisticians, the optimal height to hit a home run is between 2 and 3 feet off of the ground, usually in between your knees and waist. While everyone has their preferences, lower pitches are easier to get under and drive up and out of the park."

Perfect your grip.,
Perfect your stride.,
Follow through with your motion.,
Command the pitch, don’t aim.,
Focus on your triceps and forearm muscles.,
Build rotator cuff flexibility.,
Strengthen your core.",How to Throw a Faster Fastball," There are two primary grips for the fastball: the four-seam and the two-seam. The four-seam generally gathers more velocity but some pitchers find the two-seam more comfortable and easier to command.Many experienced pitchers will switch between the two options when they want to emphasize velocity or movement respectively but you should stick with one until you’re fully comfortable with it.


For the four-seam grip, place your index and middle fingers across the seams where they form a horse-shoe shape with a comfortable amount of space between them. Have your ring and pinky fingers close together and your thumb gently resting underneath the ball.The two-seam grip involves the same general configuration of your fingers but with the index and middle finger following along the seams where they are close together. Once you’ve mastered the two-seam grip, your fastball should have some movement toward your pitching hand’s side of the plate (i.e. a right handed pitcher’s two-seam fastball with break inside on a right-handed hitter).;
, You should be generating the majority of your power from your lunging motion toward the plate.


The pitching mound is elevated for a reason. After you lift your step leg, use the momentum of your body falling forward to generate power for your pitch.Determine the ideal spot for your step foot to land so that you’re maximizing your forward momentum without overextending. Practice hitting that spot with your foot until it’s second nature. You may even want to practice your lunge motion without actually pitching the ball so you can focus on it.

, If you rigidly stop your pitching motion as soon as you release the ball, you’ll lose some velocity and accuracy.Your pitching hand should end up near your hip on the opposite side of your body.

, One of the most ubiquitous and confusing pieces of advice you’ll hear from baseball coaches is that you shouldn’t aim your pitches. This is not meant to imply that you shouldn’t care about where your pitch lands. However, if you’re overly focused on guiding the pitch to a specific spot in the zone, it will compromise the velocity and general effectiveness of the pitch.Pitchers use the term ‘command’ to describe the approach of using your delivery motion to locate pitches rather than simply aiming the ball. This may sound vague if you’re new to pitching but will make more sense as you work on your technique.
Point your step foot toward the inner or outer part of the plate when you’re trying to command the ball to those locations.As you’re developing your delivery, visualize the ball landing in a specific spot and keep practicing until it works. Use the muscle memory of that delivery motion to build your command.Commanding without aiming is one of the more difficult aspects of pitching and even major leaguers can struggle with it. You’ll need a lot of patience and practice.

, While most people associate biceps with arm strength, the most important pitching muscles in your arm are actually the flexor muscles in your forearm and your triceps. Focus on strength-building and flexibility exercises in these areas to build pitching velocity and reduce the risk of injury.Try some reverse barbell curls. Face away from the barbell and grip it with both hands shoulder-length apart from behind your back. Bend your elbows slightly and let your wrists do the work when you curl the barbell up toward your back. Start with a light-weight barbell and a limited number of repetitions before until you’re comfortable increasing. This will build forearm and wrist strength.Try some tricep extensions. You’ll need a cable pulley which is available at most commercial gyms. Grip the rope or handle-bar attachment in front of you and pull it down with your elbows ending up straightened and by your sides. Raise your hands back to the starting position slowly. Start with a light-weight pulley and a small number of repetitions until you’re comfortable increasing., The majority of pitching injuries take place in the shoulder region so building strength and flexibility in this area is essential as you try to ramp up your fastball velocity.Try some shoulder flexions. You’ll need some anchored tubing which is available at most commercial gyms. Stand facing away from the anchor with the tubing in your hands resting at your sides. Extend your arms out in front of your face with your elbows and wrists straight and then return to your starting position. Start with a limited number of repetitions until you’re comfortable increasing., Your arms aren’t the only part of your body you work when pitching. A lot of your power will be derived from your legs, hips and abdomen. Strengthen these areas, collectively known as your ‘core,’ to maximize your pitching ability.Try some medicine ball rotational throws. You’ll need a medicine ball and a workout partner. Sit on the floor and hold the ball close to your chest with your elbows pointing outward. Keep your legs and lower body still during the exercise and start with your upper body rotated away from your partner. Rotate toward your partner and pass the ball by extending both elbows forward like a basketball pass. Start with a light-weight ball and a limited number of repetitions until you’re comfortable increasing.Try some bicycle crunches. Lay flat on your back with one leg out and both hands on your head. Crunch your opposite knee into your opposite elbow. Start with slow movements and limited repetitions until you’re comfortable increasing.

Don't overdo it.",How to Throw a Forkball," The forkball is gripped between your middle and index fingers. Start by placing these fingers on the seams in the same way you would if you were throwing a two-seam fast ball., For a forkball you need a very wide grip. So once you have your fingers on the seams you need to try to spread them out even further so they go outside the seams. This will help you grip the ball more deeply between your index and middle finger than an ordinary split-fingered fast ball., With a forkball grip, most of the work is being done by the index and middle fingers. Your thumb should be bent and held under the ball. Your thumb is supporting the ball more than gripping it.

, The two main differences to a split-seam fastball grip are how wide you spread your fingers, and how deep into your grip you hold the ball.When you are holding the ball you will feel how the wider your grip, the further the ball will be pushed into your fingers. You want to jam the ball as deep into your grip as you can comfortably.

, The forkball requires an especially wide grip and as such is easier to pull off if you have long fingers. This is one of the reasons why younger players will find it very difficult to do, and it is generally seen as a pitch to learn once you are fully grown. Some major league teams even actively discourage young players learning it due to the risk of injury.A grip with fingers so far apart puts added stress on the elbow., A forkball is pitched with basically the same arm action as a regular fastball. The wide finger grip is the main factor in producing the forkball's distinctive action which sees it tail off or drop down right at the last minute. Starting with feet shoulder width apart and facing your catcher, get into your wind-up position. When you're ready to pitch bring your arm back as you would for a split-fingered fastball.Shift your weight a little to your left (for right handers), and pivot your right foot so it is beside the rubber and the outside of your foot is pressing against the mound.
Raise your left leg so your thigh is parallel to the ground or higher. As you do this your body will turn to the right to face third base.
Bring back your throwing arm, while you hold your left arm in front of you with the elbow bent.

, Now it's time to pitch. Keep your grip nice and wide with your thumb beneath the ball for support. You should be using the same action as with a fastball, but with just a slightly stiffer wrist.To keep your wrist stiff, hold it firmly in place and don't allow it to flex or rotate until the snap as you release it.


Begin to lower your front leg without allowing it to touch the ground.
As you do this, stride out with this leg and begin to swing up your throwing arm.
Land your front foot at a 75 degree angle to the plate.
Push off your back foot, and pivot your front foot so it is at a 90 degree angle from the plate.
As you do this extend your pitching arm as far as you can.

, When you come to release the ball, it should come out of your hand at the same point and height as a fastball would, with your elbow in a straight line above your shoulder. This makes it harder for the batter to tell that it is a forkball as it leaves your hand. If you manage to get this right, hiding what kind of pitch you are throwing will give the batter less of a chance to react to the pitch's unusual trajectory.


Aim to have your pitching elbow aligned with your shoulders as you release the ball.
Follow through with your pitching arm and raise your back leg for more power.
Forkballs are normally thrown hard, just like a fastball, but the changed grip will mean it comes out of the hand at a lower speed., After the wide grip, the second crucial factor for a successful forkball is imparting topspin on the ball as it leaves your hand. You do this by snapping your wrist at the moment you release the ball. If this is done well, it causes the ball to have some topspin, or forward spin, rather than any backspin. The topspin causes the ball to fall downwards as it reaches the batter.Snapping the wrist like this can lead to injury.

, Although a good pitch requires your whole body to work fluidly, you can train specific parts with particular drills. A good drill to do that focuses on your arm action during a pitch are knee throwing drills. If you are right hander, kneel down on your right knee and pitch the ball to a friend from this position.


For lefties do the opposite side.

, A stiff wrist is an important part of what it takes to throw a good forkball, but this can be a tricky thing to practice on its own. A good way to focus on the wrist is to hold up your pitching arm so it is bent at the elbow and the forearm is vertical. Hold it just below the wrist with your glove hand. Keeping your arm in this position, practice throwing the ball with just your wrist and fingers., To try to put it all together, you can practice pitching against a wall. If you mark a target to aim for you will be able to see how much you are managing to get your pitch to bottom out late on. If you have the equipment, you can film your practice pitches to observe in slow motion how your action looks and what sort of movement is being produced on the ball.


If you are struggling with balance, practice holding your balance position, with your front leg raised and your pitching arm back, for a few seconds before pitching.

, Probably the most fun way to do any pitching drill is with friends. Play catch, and throw in some forkballs to try to catch each other out. If your friend is deceived by the ball as it drops down at the last second, you know it is coming along nicely. It's good to practice with a catcher as they will be able to give you good feedback on the flight of the ball.


You can ask a friend, parent or coach to observe your pitch to see if they spot any problems that might be holding you back.

, Remember, this is a pitch that is very hard to master and can lead to injuries. Take it easy with your practices and stop if you start to feel pain in your elbow, wrist or fingers.

Release the ball with your arm fully extended.,
Make small adjustments to your form as needed.",How to Throw a Great Two Seam Fastball," Find the part of the seams where the gap between them is narrowest. Lay each finger so it runs parallel with one of the seams. The horseshoe shape of the seams should be opened upward.Experiment with your fingers resting just inside the seams as opposed to directly on top of them. Some pitchers prefer this technique.;
, Use your thumb to cradle the ball in your hand. Your thumb should run perpendicular across the seams on the bottom of the ball. The fleshy part of your thumb should be in the smooth part between the seams.The exact thumb placement will depend on the size of your hand. If you have large hands, your thumb will extend farther forward than this.

, Use your ring finger to provide balance on the side of the ball. Let your ring finger touch the side of the ball gently and avoid putting too much pressure on this finger. If you press your ring finger against the ball, your throw will be off.


Your ring finger mainly provides stability for the ball and can assist in putting spin on the ball.

, As you get your fingers and thumb in place, be sure to situate the ball so it is deep in your hand. Part of the ball should be touching the knuckles closest to your palm and also touching the palm itself.The deeper grip on the ball gives it added power and control. This is different than a four-seam fastball, which tends to be held farther forward in your hand.

, As you hold the ball preparing for the pitch, apply pressure on top with your fingers and under the ball with your thumb. Distribute the pressure equally between your fingers and your thumb.Increase the power of your grip by squeezing a stress ball or a grip-strengthening workout tool when you are finished with pitching practice.

, When you throw a two-seam fastball, wind up in the same way you always do. Be sure to hide the ball in the pocket of your glove so no one sees how you are holding it. A standard baseball wind up means standing with your glove side to the plate, lifting your front leg, and stretching it toward the plate as you throw., One way to work on the spin of the ball is to have your arm angled slightly outward. Imagine a clock is facing toward the plate. Your arm comes right between the 10:00 and 11:00 positions.This is different than other pitches that require your arm to go through the pitch from a straight up position or a side arm position.

, Just before the point of release, press down slightly hard with your index finger. This pressure makes that side of the ball spin faster. Spin is also aided by the way you flip your wrist at the end of the throw.


Applying more pressure to the middle finger will cause the ball to spin in the opposite direction.
This added pressure differs from the four-seam and other fastball techniques.

, When your arm reaches the point of full extension, release the ball. Snap your wrist down towards the ground and out away from your body. This wrist motion will put spin on the ball cause it to move in a curve toward the plate.If you apply pressure with your middle finger to reverse the spin, you should also snap your wrist inward rather than outward.
This is different than a four-seam fastball, in which the wrist flexes forward rather than outward. This flexing motion creates more spin, which gives the ball more curve than a four-seamer.

, The speed of your fastball comes partly from a full extension of your arm. The ball has the greatest possible momentum once your arm reaches its full extension. Be sure to follow through once you release the ball, allowing your arm to fall toward the ground.


The greater curve of a two-seam fastball, as compared to other fastballs, makes it a little hard to control. The flight path is less predictable than a four-seam fastball.

, If you work on the pitch and you can’t get the movement on the ball that you want, adjust one part of the throw at a time. Slide your fingers closer together. Offset the ball a little to the pinky-side or index finger side of your hand. Twist your wrist toward the outside more.


Each small adjustment can majorly affect the pitch, so make sure to only try out one adjustment at a time. If you change too much of the technique, you won’t know what aspect helped.
There’s no rule that you have to use the pitch a specific way. Take the basic technique and adjust it to fit your strengths and weaknesses.

Hold the ball so that you see a ""U"" shape in the seams, then put your index and middle fingers together in the middle of the ""U"".,
Don't hold the ball tightly.,
Keep your thumb on the bottom of the ball, also on the ""U"" opposite the index and middle.,
Begin your windup, starting as though you were going to throw a fastball: going straight over the top, with your hand on the top of the ball.

,
A few moments before you let go of the ball, arch your hand so that your palm faces your left (or vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), then pull straight down.

,
Watch as the hitter misses the ball.

Grip the ball correctly.,
Place your pinkie and thumb directly under the soft leather part of the ball.,
Hold the ball deep in your palm.,
Throw the ball the same as a fastball.",How to Throw a Changeup1," Center your index, middle and ring finger on top of the ball. You'll be moving your pinkie finger and thumb after you get those three fingers positioned correctly.






;
, This will help you get a firm grip on the ball in the palm of your hand. Some pitchers choose to touch their index fingers and thumbs slightly to get a better feel for the ball.








, This will add more friction to the ball. While when you throw a fastball, you'll be pushing the ball with your fingers, making a whipping motion, you won't have that with the changeup. Instead, you'll be using your palm to do most of the work, leaving your fingers limp and avoiding that whipping action.









Grip the ball deep in the base of your fingers and then turn it over and inward when you release it.

, Once you've positioned the ball correctly, you should throw the ball to your batter, following the same technique you'd use for other pitches: lift your arms and elbows over your head, move them forward, toward the shoulder of the pitching arm, move your throwing arm above and behind you, bend your knees, and throw the ball with the knee on the opposite foot bend while the leg on the side of the throwing arm lifts up as you follow through and cross your throwing arm over your body as you finish off the pitch.








Move your pitching arm as quickly as you'd move it while throwing a fastball. The beauty is that it will look like the ball will be coming just as quickly as a fastball while actually traveling 10% slower. This is guaranteed to confuse the batter.
Keep on practicing. Learn to alternate between a changeup and a fastball so the batter doesn't know what's coming.
Keep the same arm speed and arm slot as you would for a fast ball. If your arm speed is slower, then the batter will know that your pitching speed will be slower too. The whole trick is in the illusion that you'll be throwing the ball at the same speed as a fastball.

Throw a circle changeup.,
Turn the ball over.,
Practice the long toss.,
Slightly shorten your stride.",How to Throw a Changeup2," The technique for throwing the circle changeup is the same as the technique for the three-finger changeup; everything except for the grip. For this grip, place the ball in your palm and hold onto the ball with your pinkie, ring, and middle fingers. Your index finger and thumb should touch, or almost touch, forming a circle. In some versions of this grip, the circle is formed on the ball so you're still holding onto the ball somewhat. In others, the circle is formed on the side of the ball, so only the three end fingers are gripping it.








Once you've got the grip down, throw the ball with the same arm speed and arm slot you would use to throw a fastball.
As you throw the ball, the ""circle"" formed by your index finger and thumb should be facing the catcher.

, This is a great added technique if you want to add even more movement to your pitch. All you have to do is to pronate your throwing hand while you throw the pitch. This means that you should turn your hand over as if you were signaling ""thumbs down"" to the catcher.







, If you want to improve your changeup skills, then you should practice throwing your changeup during a long toss, which is anything beyond 90 feet (27.4 m). You can also switch between throwing fastballs and changeups as you long toss for about ten throws for each type of pitch. This will get you used to switching between the two pitching styles.







, This is a great way to take some speed off of your changeup. Just shorten your stride by a few inches only and collapse just a bit on your back leg. This means that you should reduce the normal back-side leg movement that you use during your follow through. When you throw a change-up, that back leg shouldn't be as high as it would be when you're throwing a fast ball.

Grip the pitch.,
Go through your windup.,
Practice makes perfect.,
Directional Break.,
Use it in a game.",How to Throw a Directional Break Slurve," The most important thing about the grip is that either your index finger or middle finger is pushed up against the inside of a seam. (That's the left side of the seam for a righty, right side for a lefty). You can rest your ring finger and/or pinky finger on the side of the ball if it makes it more comfortable.;
, When you throw, DO NOT snap your wrist like you would a normal curve ball. Instead, come through like a normal fastball. Thrown correctly, the ball should be coming off your index finger. You might get some break diagonally down and away from a right hand batter (down and in if you throw lefty). More likely though, on your first try you didn't get much, if any, break. Just keep throwing like this to get used to the grip. Proceed to step 3 when you feel you have control.

, After throwing a few times like a fastball, it's time to start making adjustments. At this point, your ""directional slurve"" probably isn't really breaking. An easy way to add a little more break is to push down with your middle finger on the outside of the ball. Doing so will add more rotation, and therefore more break. If you're having trouble, check the tips section below.

, By this point, hopefully you've worked out any major problems to get a decent pitch working. But what about that ""directional"" part? When I throw this pitch without thinking, it has a diagonal break down and away from a righty. But the angle at which it breaks can be altered. For this next part, grip the ball and just imitate throwing. Imitate a throw holding the ball straight out in front of you. Now with the ball out in front of you, turn your hand SLIGHTLY down and to the left (down and right for a lefty). Throwing like this will put more of a downward movement and less across. Get used to this and then go back to the normal grip. Now try tilting your hand slightly back and to the right (left for lefties). This should break less down and more to the side. Get used to these two other angles and try throwing them. Again see tips if you're having trouble.

, If you've made it this far, you can (hopefully) throw the ""directional slurve"" pretty well. You might even be able to direct the break based on the angle you hold it. So now you're on the mound and you're not sure how to use it. Throw it low in the zone and the batter should start his swing. It should drop out near the end and fall into the dirt. By then it's too late for the batter to stop his swing. Swing and a miss!... we hope. If you direct it to have more of a side to side break, you can throw it ""at the guy"" and let it break into the zone. This is only worth trying if it's unexpected, though. If it's expected, the batter can watch it in and pull it.

Start off by gripping the ball as you would a two-seam fastball.,
Instead of leaving your fingers there, move your two fingers over to the right.,
Move your thumb over so that it's diametrically opposed to your top two fingers.,
Turn in your wrist slightly in the direction of your thumb.,
Lead with the middle finger.",How to Throw a Cut Fastball1," A two-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers on the two narrow seams of the baseball.;
, Make sure your fingers are relatively close together. Your fingers can either be positioned so that your middle finger runs along the seam, or so that the seam runs directly in the middle of both fingers. Experiment with what works best for you.

, Diametrically opposed just means that if you extended both fingers in the same direction, they would eventually form a perfect circle.


Think of the ball like a clock. If your thumb on a normal two-seam grip is at 6 o'clock, your thumb now should be at a 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock position.

, For right-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the left. For left-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the right.

, When throwing a two-seam fastball, put extra pressure on your middle finger. This will create a natural spin on the ball that will help it cut.

Your two fingers should touch the seams of the baseball in four places: the bottom of both fingers and the top.

, This will help create the cut in your fastball, as the last finger that touches the ball will be the middle finger.

, Your thumb and your top fingers may not be exactly diametrically opposed, but they should be pretty comfortable.

"
"
Hide the cut grip in your glove going into the windup.,
Think ""fastball"" all the way.,
Follow through, and snap your wrist down while applying slight pressure with your middle finger for slight spin.",How to Throw a Cut Fastball3," You don't want to telegraph your pitch until the exact moment you release the baseball. Tipping the hitter off early could ruin the surprise of the pitch.

, The cutter is a fastball, after all. You want a simple up-and-down motion with your hand, not delivering any spin with your wrist.


Make sure your arm-speed is similar to your fastball arm-speed.
Extend your arm fully as you deliver the pitch.

, This will cause the ball to move away from a right handed batter and in on a left handed batter.

Lay the bat on the ground.,
Make a ‘V’ shape defined by the thumb and forefinger of both hands.,
Line up your grip with the spine of the bat.,
Make sure your hands are in the middle of the handle.,
Keep a distance of about two fingers between your hands.,
Keep your top hand firm and your bottom hand relaxed.,
Hit a variety of shots with the orthodox grip.",How to Hold a Cricket Bat1," A cricket bat has a flat side for striking the ball, and the back has a ridge, or spine, running down the middle. The spine should be facing up., Hold your hands in front of you, palms down. Your fingers on both hands should be grouped together, but for your thumbs, which extend to the sides to form the ‘V’ shape. The ‘V’s should be upside down – i.e. open end towards the ground. Maintain this ‘V’ shape as you reach for the bat., As you grip the handle, keep your two ‘V’s facing downward (towards the bat handle), so that the inflection point of the ‘V’s (where the base of your thumb and forefinger meet) on both hands is in line with the spine along the backside of the bat blade.If you tilt your hands slightly so that the ‘V’s formed by your thumbs and forefingers are aligned with the part of the bat that lies between the spine and edge of the bat, this will give you more power when cutting or pulling the ball, and by changing the angle of the bat face, help to keep the ball on the ground.Both the cut and pull are cross-bat shots utilizing a horizontal swing to hit the ball on a trajectory perpendicular to the direction of the bowl. The cut shot uses a shorter swing to hit the ball in the direction the batter is facing (the off side).The pull uses a longer swing to hit the ball to the part of the field behind him as he faces the batter (the leg side)., Your dominant (top) hand should be closer to the top of the handle, and your other (bottom) hand should be closer to the bat blade.Putting your hands in the middle of handle gives the best combination of power and control.A high grip (hands towards the end of the handle) will generate more power. This is good for playing vertical shots (when the bat is swung upward at the ball on a vertical plane) that drive the ball.A low grip, or “choking” the bat (hands towards the blade of the bat) will give you more control.This is good for horizontal or cross-bat shots (when the bat is swung horizontally, as in baseball).,

The closer you place your hands, the more power and less control you have. Moving them further apart will give you more control at the expense of power., Imagine you were holding a baby chick with your bottom hand; that is the amount of pressure to apply. You want your grip to be loose so that during your backswing, the bottom three fingers can come away from the bat, which is guided by only the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand. This allows for a fuller swing., This grip allows you to hit cross-batted shots, while also keeping the face of the bat square to the ball when hitting vertical shots, thus minimizing the danger of edging the ball.


Edging is when the ball is struck with the edge of the bat instead of the face. These glancing shots are often caught for an out by the wicket keeper or the slips – fielders who are positioned behind the batter."
"
Start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your bottom hand so your fingers are fully under the bat when the flat side is facing downward.,
Use the ‘O’ shaped grip for more power on cross-batted shots.,
Know that batters often adopt this technique when using bats that are too heavy for them.If you find yourself having a hard time making solid contact on vertical swings, or often edging the ball behind to the keeper or slips, then you may need to try a lighter bat, which allows you to use a more orthodox grip.",How to Hold a Cricket Bat2," In the orthodox grip, only the tips of your fingers will rest under the bat handle when the flat side faces downward. With the ‘O’ shaped grip, your entire fingers will rest under the bat.This means you will rotate the ‘V’ formed by the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand – counterclockwise if your right hand is the bottom one, clockwise if your left – so that the ‘V’ faces the edge of the bat.
If you are holding the flat side of the bat downwards, this means the ‘V’ formed by your bottom hand will now be oriented horizontally to the ground, rather than facing downwards.

,

This grip feels more natural than the orthodox grip, but because it gives the bottom hand more influence, it leads to swinging across the line (laterally to the ball), which makes it harder to hit vertical shots.,"
"
Start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your top hand around the handle.,
Use the Knott grip to better hit fast, short bowling.,
Be aware that the Knott grip makes it difficult to generate power.",How to Hold a Cricket Bat3," Rotate clockwise if your top hand is your left hand, or counterclockwise if it is your right. Keep rotating until the back of your top hand is almost facing the same direction as the back of your bottom hand.

If holding the flat side of the bat towards the ground, the ‘V’ formed by the thumb and forefinger of your top hand should now right side up – i.e. the ‘V’ should open upwards.

, This grip was developed by Alan Knott to deal with fast bowling and high rising balls. It allows for an extremely fast, short swing, perfect for cutting the ball.Fast bowling – Fast bowlers specialize in bowling the ball fast, as opposed to generating spin. Bowling over 87mph (140kmph) is generally considered fast bowling. The fastest bowlers can throw the ball over 96 mph (154 km/h) (155kmph).Short bowling – In cricket, the ball is usually bounced before it reaches the batter. Fast bowlers often bounce the ball well short of the batter, so that it rises to chest or head height as it reaches them. A quick bat helps the batsman to hit shots at waist to shoulder height., Because this grip limits the extension of your arms, it also limits the ability to create power. It is best for working singles or twos (the two batsmen run to each other’s end of the pitch one or two times) as opposed to hitting boundaries (the ball is hit out of the field of play)."

Note any patterns you recognize, including the pitches he favors and your assessment of his curveball. If most of his curves come across the plate as hanging curveballs, you should be prepared to take advantage of this.


A hanging curveball is an off speed pitch in your strike zone. With proper preparation, hanging curveballs are ripe for a punishing hit.
Analyze the pitcher's habits to see if there are any early warning signs for certain pitches, like a twitch of his glove before going into the windup.;
, Some pitchers, especially those with more experience, are better at hiding their tells than others. But a ""tell"" is where you indicate what is going to happen through body language before you do it. These might include:


A change in windup.
A twitch of the glove.
Searching for the seams of the ball for proper curveball finger placement.

, The backspin a pitcher puts on a curveball causes pressure to increase in the air in front of and under the ball, causing it to ""ride"" on this higher pressure air. Curveballs with topspin creates high pressure on top of the ball, deflecting the ball downward.If you are able to identify a curveball from the outset, knowing to prepare yourself for a dropping or floating ball will give you the advantage when trying to hit it.
A downward breaking ball is often referred to as a ""12-6 curve"" due to the fact that the ball is on a straight appearing path down, like the movement from 12 to 6 on the hands of a clock.

, If the pitcher is a right-hander the ball will break away from righty batters and into lefty batters; the opposite is true for left-handed pitcher. Submarine pitches that attempt a curveball will likely sink into the dirt.

, Batters who are out front, unaware, and/or are imbalanced at the time a curveball is thrown will likely have problems hitting it.Think about times you have tried to hit curves in the past and your stance leading up to the hit. Your stance is not ideal for a breaking ball if:


You are pushing forward, out front, or are overextending your knee so that its over or in front of your foot.
You are persistently swinging at balls that are curving outside the strike zone due to over-committal and premature weight transfer.

, If you know you are up against a curveball master, you might have difficulty hitting even his worst breaking ball. But foreknowledge and mentally preparing yourself to face a difficult pitch will keep your focus sharp and your batting average up.


Watch the path of the pitcher's curveballs and visualize the trajectory of the ball as you would see it from the plate. Think of how you might hit the ball and the ideal place for you to begin your swing.

, If you notice that the other team's pitcher has been having an off day with his curveballs, you may be in luck. Poor daily performance or the high pressure of an important game can negatively impact a pitchers ability to throw a good curve consistently.


A pitcher having a bad breaking ball day will be more hesitant to make use of the tricky physics of this pitch.

, Stance is an important factor for hitting any ball that crosses the plate. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet and your knees slightly bent with your back leg holding more of your weight than your front. Foot placement depends largely on your body type, but some who are knowledgeable in baseball recommend that your feet be set a bit wider than shoulder width.Stand at a right angle to the plate and hold your bat off your shoulder and at the top of your strike zone.


Keep an eye on your feet; many players have difficulty regulating their stance. To get the best hit, you'll need to make sure your feet aren't too narrowly or widely placed.
While you wait for the pitcher to begin his pitch, you should be relaxed and keep your feet still as you await the release of the ball., Seeing that a pitcher is using a curveball from the very release will improve your odds of hitting it greatly. The hand position for a classic curve ball orients the seams in the direction of the pitchers fingers, with the tops of his middle finger touching the inside of a seam of the baseball. This will create a U-shape position in the hand of the pitcher., The spin of a curve ball will have a visual effect on it as it approaches you. If you notice an approximately one inch circle or a solid dot where you would normally see the blur of the red stitching, you have a curve ball incoming., Since the most common kind of curve ball sinks as it approaches the plate, pushing forward and being out front will drastically hurt your odds of hitting it. Not only will keeping your body and weight back, you'll increase power and give yourself some additional slivers of a second to react to and crush the curve., Most people who have difficulty with curve balls commit too early with their swing and waste a strike on a ball that was outside their zone. Most knee-high balls will break down out of your strike zone and should be avoided. High curves, however, frequently break into the strike zone., Since a classic 12-6 curve sinks on the approach, rising to meet this ball with your bat is not advised.If the angle of your swing is not spot on, you'll miss the ball or get poor contact.


Many experts argue that this is the most critical part of hitting a breaking ball. If you know the kind of break the pitcher will be using, allow the ball to sink into your swing., A little hesitation can be a good thing when the pitcher is throwing an off-speed pitch. You may feel a kind of tension or hesitation once your stride foot comes down. During this critical moment, you should keep your hands and the majority of your weight (about 70%) back, so that in the event the ball is a hittable curve, you are prepared., Have a practice partner stand behind a screen about 15 ft in front of the plate. Your practice partner should alternate between overhand and underhand techniques, giving an irregular tempo to the pitches coming across the plate. Your goal is to drive all of these right up middle field.The variability of these pitches will help you recognize off-speed pitches and the shifts in posture and body position that accompany off-speed pitches.

, Your practice partner should stand on your open side at about 45° behind your batting position. Have your partner lob an underhand toss into the contact zone while you concentrate on crushing the ball straight into the midfield.The angle of approach for this drill is ideal for giving you the impression that you are on the inside, which is the right habit to have when trying to hit a breaking ball.

, It can be difficult allowing curves to drop and come to you. To practice patience and keep yourself from pushing forward and being out front, have a practice partner set up a screen 10 - 15 ft in front of you. Then have him lob the ball to you over the screen.Wait for the ball to enter your optimal hitting zone.
Stay inside the ball.
Attempt to rocket the ball straight up the middle.

, The more you practice the curveball, the easier it will be for you to notice and manage. You might consider spending one-on-one time with your pitcher to train hitting his curves or even drilling the curveballs from a pitching machine."

If you are left-handed, opt for the right, on the first-base side.Face home plate. Touch the far side of home plate with the end of your bat. Back up until your arm is fully extended.Feel free to experiment with standing on each side of the box. Some right-handed hitters prefer standing on the right side of home plate, and vice versa with left-handed hitters.
Don’t stand too close or too far from the plate. Standing too far away will make it much more difficult to hit outside pitches.Crowding the plate will do the same with inside pitches.
If you are a beginner, start by standing directly across from the plate. After a lot of practice in this position, experiment with moving up toward the front of the box or further back, which may make it easier to hit certain pitches. Hitting from the rear of the box, for example, will provide extra time for you to hit a fastball.;
, Place any object (a batting tee, a fellow player, etc.) roughly 20 feet away from you (6 meters). Stick your arm straight out in front of you.

Right-handed people often have a dominant right eye. Left-handed people typically have a dominant left eye.
Determining which eye is dominant will help you choose the best stance to adopt at the plate.

, Pick between the neutral, open, and closed stances. Base your decision partly on whichever one makes it easier to keep your dominant eye on the ball. Also consider how the placement of your feet in each position affects your swing.Regardless of which one you choose, bend your knees a little. Point your toes toward the plate with your feet spread to shoulder-width or a few inches wider.Neutral stance (also called ""even stance""): Both feet are placed an equal distance from home plate. This is the most popular stance, since it allows you to turn your head over your shoulder without any strain so you can face the pitcher and keep both eyes on the ball.

Open stance: The foot closest to the pitcher is moved slightly back so that the front of your body is a little more “open” to the pitcher. This is the least popular stance because it takes you out of hitting position, thus creating extra steps to get back into position during the pitch.

Closed stance: The foot closest to the pitcher is placed a tiny bit forward. This stance allows you to cover more of the plate with your bat. However, turning your head to keep both eyes on the pitcher may be more of a strain.
If pointing your forward foot toward home plate proves to be uncomfortable, try adjusting it so that your toes point 45 degrees more toward the pitcher.

, Cradle the grip in the middle of your fingers instead of your palms. If you are right-handed, grip the bat with your left fingers an inch or two above the very bottom. Then place your right fingers above your left.Extend your arms in front of you as if you just took a swing. Make sure the palm of your left hand is facing downward and the palm of your right is facing up.If you are left-handed, do the reverse.


Keep a secure grip on the bat, but also keep your grip loose enough so that your muscles are relaxed.Adjust your grip so that the second knuckles of both hands form a perfect line.

, Keep your shoulders in a straight line pointed toward the pitcher.Bend both elbows. Draw your rear elbow up and back until it is level with your rear shoulder and pointing directly behind you. Keep both elbows roughly six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) away from you. Angle the bat 45 degrees over your rear shoulder./images/thumb/4/4d/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg

Resting the bat on your shoulder or holding it horizontally will weaken your swing.Holding the bat vertically can create a more powerful swing, but may be uncomfortable for beginners.

, Turn your head toward the pitcher over your front shoulder. Keep your head still and straight, without cocking it to one side. Focus with both eyes on the ball from the moment it leaves the pitcher’s hand to the instant you make contact with the bat.Practice how to swing a baseball bat as much as you can before going to bat in a game. Train until the swing comes naturally, without you having to think about every little step. This way you are better equipped to concentrate on the ball with your full attention, instead of also having to plot out what to do next.

, Imagine that you are the hammer to a pistol aimed at the pitcher. Now imagine that you are being cocked to fire as the ball approaches. Move your body’s weight to your rear leg until your rear knee and shoulder are aligned (this is the “load”). Now raise your front foot and take a short step toward the pitcher (this is the “stride”)./images/thumb/4/4f/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4f/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg









Keep your stride short so that your body’s weight can shift more easily from your rear leg to your front leg once you begin to swing., Plant your front foot in place and keep it there throughout your swing. Bend your knee a little if keeping it straight proves to be uncomfortable. Use this leg to prevent yourself from spilling forward with the forward momentum created by your swing./images/thumb/f/f5/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f5/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg









Moving your front foot during your swing will cause you to swing a slower bat.
Having an unstable front leg will also make it harder for you to keep your head still.

, As you begin your swing, stand on your back toes. Let the weight of your body shift to your front leg, in the ball’s direction, to add more power to your swing. Ensure that all of your swing’s momentum is aimed directly at the ball./images/thumb/3/31/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/3/31/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg









The position of your feet should ultimately form a triangle, with your head as its point. The sides between your head and each foot should be relatively equal. This gives you near perfect balance.

, Use your whole body to swing the bat, not just your arms. As you begin your swing, lead with your rear hip and then follow through with your arms and hands.Keep your elbows bent and tucked in as close to your sides as you can./images/thumb/c/c1/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c1/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg









Pivot on your back toes as you swing, so they end up pointing toward the pitcher.
The closer you keep the bat to your body, the more power you can deliver with your swing.

, As you bring your bat down from its starting position, aim to keep it parallel to the ground. At the same time, bring it level to the ball’s plane of trajectory.Time your movements so that you hit the ball at the precise moment when your rear hip and shoulder have swung forward to the point that your upper torso is now squarely facing the pitcher./images/thumb/3/30/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/3/30/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg









Aim to hit the ball with your bat’s “sweet spot,” roughly five to seven inches from the top of the bat.Keeping the bat parallel to the ground and level with the ball will better ensure that you still hit the ball even if you miss it with the bat’s sweet spot.

, Aim to hit the ball when your swing is at its most powerful. Ensure this by swinging “through the ball” (also called “following through”). Instead of swinging the bat just far enough to make contact with the ball, wait until you have actually hit it before you quit adding force to your swing. Then let the bat slow down as it crosses in front your chest.Your swing should begin with your chin facing your front shoulder. Without moving your head, your chin should then face your rear shoulder by the end of your swing as you follow through.Think of a sprinter crossing a finish line. They don’t slow down and come to a dead stop right at the finish line. They sprint at full speed straight through it. Only then do they slow down bit by bit until they finally stop well past the finish line.

, Start by learning how to move fluidly from movement to movement while staying balanced throughout. Worry about hitting an actual ball later. For now, follow a four-count drill to learn how to move through your stance, load, stride, and swing effectively.Start with a slow count to better identify mistakes. As you master each step, speed up the count so it becomes more natural and fluid.
/images/thumb/a/a9/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a9/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg









First, adopt your stance.
On the count of “one,” load up.
On “two,” take your stride forward.
On “three,” train your eyes on the imaginary ball.
On “four,” swing.

, Remember that your swing should be led by your rear hip, not your arms or hands. Hold the bat incorrectly during some of your four-count drills in order to force all of your concentration onto your hips. Instead of using both hands to hold it by its grip, hold the bottom of the bat in one hand and its top in the other./images/thumb/d/d0/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d0/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg









Instead of awkwardly drawing the bat up to shoulder-level, draw it behind your rear hip during your stance, load, and stride.

, Before accepting pitches, train with a stationary tee. Learn how to hit a ball with maximum power before worrying about connecting with a ball in motion. Use this time to perfect your movements, as well as following through.Place the tee at different points across the plate to grow accustomed to hitting different pitches.

, Once you are confident in your form, start hitting live balls. But instead of moving on directly to baseballs, start off with a ball that is less heavy. Try tennis balls, whiffle balls, or practice baseballs, since these travel at slower speeds due to their lightness.Train your eyes to follow these slower balls, which are easier to track.

From there, advance to actual baseballs, either thrown by a live pitcher or a pitching machine."
"
Find a batting stance that suits you.,
Watch.,
Some hitters will commonly drop their hands, meaning that instead of going in a diagonal path to the ball with your hands and bat like you should, the hitter will let his hands drop and swing in a straight line, resulting in either a swing and miss or a pop-up.,
As you swing, your head may naturally turn away before the point of contact, ready to see where the ball went.,
If you have followed all of these directions, you have probably made good contact with the ball on the sweet spot of the bat and you are now in a great position to do some damage to the other team.,
As you end your swing, make sure you don't feel like your back foot has to move immediately.,
Done.",How to Hit a Baseball for Both Contact and Power," Make sure you have most of your weight on your back foot,  As the pitch comes in, get ready to hit by ""loading up"", or stepping with your front foot (left foot if you're a right-handed batter, right foot if you're a left-handed batter) straight towards the pitching mound. A common mistake hitters will make is that they will ""step out"", or step behind them. This leads to either totally missing the ball or barely making contact.;
, The pitch is now coming towards the plate - time to make a decision. The strike zone is the length of the front of home plate and from the batter's shoulders to his or her knees. If the ball seems like it won't pass through that area, take the pitch; even if it ends up a strike, you have two more strikes before you're called out.


If the ball is probably going to be a strike, follow it with your eyes and turn your head to see it fully as it comes closer to home plate, not taking your eyes off of it.

, With your bat, practice going diagonally to the ball until you have it perfect.

, That would be great, except you haven't hit the ball yet. It is imperative that you make a conscious effort as you go to hit the ball that you keep your head looking at the ball. Bringing your head out results in foul tips/swings and misses.

, As you swing, make sure to continue just as fast as you were going when you went to hit the ball even after you have felt contact. Keep your hands steady and level the whole way through, and end with them above your front shoulder. Your hips should naturally have made a quick, powerful twist that has transferred the power of your swing to the ball.

, If you do, it means you're probably off-balance and thus your swing won't have much power to it. The way to fix balance in your swing is to become more familiar with it and even adjust if necessary.

, If all steps were followed, you've probably driven the ball a long way and you can start running to first base. Good luck.

"
Decide whether you want to ""show bunt"" or not.,
As the pitcher gets into the stretch, start moving into your bunting stance.,
Turn your back foot towards the pitcher as your square up to bunt.,
Pull your bat back if the pitch isn't a strike.,
Angle your bat in the direction you want to place the bunt.,
Bend at the knees to make contact with the ball instead of dropping your bat.,
Keep your eye on the ball as it comes in to the plate.,
Pull the bat back slightly right before the ball makes contact.,
Try to make contact with the ball on the lower part of the barrel, sending the ball down into the ground instead of up into the air.,
Be careful about bunting with two strikes.,
As soon as you make contact with the ball, explode out of the batter's box toward first base.",How to Bunt a Baseball," ""Showing bunt"" means stepping into the batter's box and immediately getting into bunting position, with two hands on the bat. You show bunt when everyone knows you're going to bunt — if you're a pitcher for example. You may not want to show bunt if you want to lay down a surprise bunt.


As soon as you show bunt, the third and first basemen on the other team should begin to move in towards the batter's box to field the bunt. If you're trying to surprise them and increase your chances of laying down a successful bunt, you probably don't want to show bunt until the pitcher starts his motion.;
, Leave your bottom hand in the same spot as when you usually hit. Slowly slide your top hand to where the bat begins to thicken into the barrel. The barrel of the bat should be tilted upwards slightly so it's at a 30° to 45° angle from the ground. The barrel should rest above the hands at all times.


If clutching onto the barrel of the bat, be sure to keep your thumb and index finger firmly behind the barrel. You don't want any fingers sticking out, and you certainly don't want the front of the bat — the part that's closest to the pitcher — being blocked by overeager fingers.

, You don't want both feet to form a straight line with the plate, as this will leave you very exposed, and won't let you explode out of the batter's box if you happen to lay down the bunt. Instead, turn your back foot towards the pitcher and square off your upper body towards the pitch.If the pitch comes inside, you can quickly turn your body back to avoid being hit.

, In a suicide squeeze situation, you want to bunt any pitch you can make contact with. Otherwise, you only want to bunt strikes. If the pitch is down low, up high, or way outside or inside, simply pull the bat back to indicate to the ump that you're taking the ball, not trying to bunt. If you just keep your bat over the plate, the ump is likely to call a strike.

, Where you place your bunt has a huge impact on whether you beat out the throw. If you want to place your bunt on the third base side, angle your bat so that it squares off with the third baseman. If you want to place your bunt on the first base side, angle your bat so that it squares off with the first baseman.


Take a look at the infield before you get in the batter's box. If the third baseman, for example, is playing close to the grass or is shaded closer to the shortstop than he should be, you probably want to aim your bunt as close to the third baseline as possible.
There's no consensus about where the best place is to place your bunt. Some say that bunting it between the pitcher and the third baseman is ideal, as they might get confused about who's going to field it. Others think that bunting towards the second baseman forces the second baseman to make a really tough throw, across his body.
If there's a runner on first base, try to bunt towards the second baseman. If there's a runner on second base, try to bunt in between the third baseman and the shortstop., Dropping your bat to bunt a low pitch is very difficult and requires amazing hand-eye coordination. Bending your knees is relatively easy — anyone can do it.

, As the pitch comes, look the ball into the bat. You want your eyes focused on the ball as much as possible.

, If you leave your bat rigid when it makes contact with the ball, the ball is more likely to bounce off of it harder, tumbling easily into the mitt of the pitcher, third-, or first baseman. If you pull your bat back slightly right before making contact, the ball should travel just the right amount — equal distance from the catcher, pitcher, and any infielder. This helps you achieve the perfect bunt.

, If you hit the ball on the bottom half of the barrel, the ball will travel down onto the ground, where it will need to be fielded. If you hit the ball on the top half of the barrel, it will travel up into the air, where it can easily be caught.

, If you foul a ball off while bunting with two strikes, you're out. Many batters transition to their hitting stance with two strikes and try to hit. Take cues from the third base coach about whether or not you should try bunting with two strikes.

, If you're a left-handed batter, you can ""pull"" the bat with you towards first base before you've made contact. (This is called a ""pull"" or ""drag"" bunt and it's hard to do!)

Just be calm.,
Dig into the batting box and get into your stance.,
Don't be trying to figure what the pitcher is throwing.,
Watch the pitchers wind up and follow the ball with your eyes to try to detect what pitch he/she is throwing.,
Keep your weight back and swing.

,Don't move your head, keep it on the ball

,Make solid contact and you should be a good hitter

,
If you want, go to the batting cages regularly.,
Lift weights regularly(not for under 13-14).,
When you put the ball in play, always run hard!,
Never slide into first, it has been proven that it is faster to over run a base then to slide into it.

",How to Be a Better Baseball Hitter," Take deep breaths and don't think about striking out.;
, Any stance you feel comfortable with.

, Just be calm. Just watch the pitchers hand and you can tell what he is going to throw at the plate.

, (Exception: if the pitcher is tipping his pitches, pay attention and stay relaxed).

,,,, During season, go on weekends and days when there is no scheduled practice. Ask your coach(es) to accompany you to receive live feedback.

, Don't max out though. Because you don't want to be injured for the season!

, This forces the defense to make a play and increases the chance of an error. Also you could stretch your singles into doubles as well as get more infield hits.

Throw gently with a partner at the beginning of every session.,
Use your full body to get power into your throws.,
Set up in a strong athletic position.,
Take a big, powerful step with your left foot.,
Push off your back foot and begin rotating your hips.,
Cock your arm when your front foot lands.,
Release the ball as you body keeps moving, conserving momentum and power.,
Snap your fingers down on the laces to get a little extra power on release.,
Relax your muscles -- trying to throw fast only gets you hurt.,
Imagine your power flowing up from your feet to keep your form perfect.",How to Throw a Baseball Harder1," Throwing gently will warm up your throwing arm, and throwing too fast too quickly greatly increases the risk of injury. Always warm up for 5-10 minutes of light catch, easy throwing and gentle stretching before trying to throw fast or lift weights.


Warming up loosens your muscles, and this flexibility is key to unlocking your most powerful possible throws.;
, Many people have heard that ""your power comes from your legs,"" and while this is partially true, it doesn't tell the whole story, Your legs generate a lot of power, but it only helps your throw if you can transmit that power through the bottom up. Accordingly, powerful throwers know that they must focus on their entire body to throw well. For a righty, it looks like:


Plant your left foot in front of your body.
Point your shoulders in line with the target
Bring the ball behind you.
Push off the back foot as you start to throw
Rotate your hips and shoulders towards the target.
Release as the ball passes your head.
Follow through with your shoulders and back foot as you release the ball.

, The basics of throwing are likely obvious, as outlined above.. But the little things, when you get the right, will add up to something much more powerful. The natural starting point is your stance. The stance is very similar to a tennis player getting ready to serve, or a basketball player guarding someone. To get maximum power, make sure your:


Hands are in the middle of your body, ready to move.
Knees are slightly bent as if you're ready to spring into action.
Feet are light so that you are balancing near the balls of your feet.
Spine and back are straight., This is for right-handed throwers. If you're a pitcher, this is your step off the mound, but all fielders do this for longer or more powerful throws. As your knee comes up, your throwing arm remains bent at the elbow and the ball near your chest. As your leg kicks forward, you start bringing your arm back.


As you land your foot, you want your arm moving forward. Your goal, as you read the next few steps, is for you arm to be cocked right behind your head, elbow at 90 degrees, as this front foot lands stiff not flexed.
Studies show that the stride is more important for power than the actual throwing motion.This is equally true for an outfielder running up to make a big throw to the infield., This is where you really start getting power. As you are stepping forward with that front foot, your back foot is pushing you forward. As the ball is coming towards your head, your hips are turning towards your target at the same time your throwing arm is rotating your body around., Timing this up is key for powerful throws. As you land on the foot, your elbow should be cocked behind you. It is at 90 degrees, with the ball above your head. Practice getting into this position right as your foot lands.

, As your arm comes over your head and you release the ball, let your back leg and throwing arm keep moving. Because you've been rotating, they'll both come across your body after you let the ball go.

, This puts back spin on the ball, stabilizing it as it flies through the air. Your fingers will pull down on the laces so that the ball spins back towards you as it flies. As the ball leaves your hand, snap your wrist and fingers down.If you haven't already started, make sure you're gripping the ball over the laces. Every time you catch the ball, focus on finding the laces quickly before throwing it back., Ultimately, strength has very little to do with throwing speed. Mechanics are far more important. But most people consciously try to throw fast: they jerk their arms, increase the speed, and mechanics suffer. Loose arms and a relaxed body transmits energy far more effectively.


Imagine your body as a slingshot. A rigid, taut sling would be very difficult to shoot effectively, but a loose, flexible band is quicker to release, prep, and fire., When you push off the ground, you put your body in motion. It is almost like a waterfall -- the power of the water doesn't come from the top of the waterfall, but from the entire distance the water falls. Similarly, the power starts in your feet, but you must rotate your whole body, specifically the hips and torso, to transmit that power into your throwing motion. Focus on the tips above, then do the following to help improve your throws:


Videotape your throwing motion. At what points do you look jerky or weak?
Check your follow through. Your body should naturally follow the pitch, spinning you slightly so that your back leg comes around the front of your planted leg.
Keep your muscles loose. If you feel like you're trying to hard, you are. It won't help.

"
"
Create a strength training program to get more force behind your throws.,
Build up your lats, two of your major back muscles, to see the greatest returns on velocity.,
Tone your chest muscles for throwing arm acceleration.,
Build up strong quads and glutes for added power.,
Use shoulder exercises to protect and strengthen your rotator cuff.,
Build up your biceps to help decelerate.",How to Throw a Baseball Harder2," It is important to note, however, that you can only improve your power so much with strength training. Far and away, the biggest bang for you buck is to focus on form. However, with attention to better mechanics and an intelligent strength program, you can start to see improvement. More importantly, a strong arm is less likely to get injured.


Do not lift weights if you are under 16. The potential for injury is far greater than any added strength you'll get.
With all exercises, focus on smooth, slow motions. The amount of weight is not important, but getting through your entire range of motion is.
You want low weight, high reps for everything but the leg exercises. Don't risk long-term injury for a little more power., The best bang for your buck is a strong, sturdy set of lats. These muscles help you bring the power from your legs up into your arms to make sure you throw faster.



Overhead Pulldown: The reverse of a pull-up. There is a bar above you attached by cables to a weight. Sitting down, keeping your spine straight, pull the bar to your upper chest. Repeat 10 times.

Seated Rows: With your arms in front of you, grab a handle so that your hands are close together. You'll be using the rowing machine, which attaches to weights with a cable. Pull your hands into your chest, then slowly extend them back in front of you. Repeat 10 times.

Pull ups: You want the wide grip, palms facing forward kind.

, A lot of your upper body power comes from your pecs, and it is not surprising that they'll help you throw harder. Focus on:


Push ups
Bench Press
Pec flies.

, Take away your legs, and you take away your power. While a strong arm is important, you need to have a solid base to throw harder. Neglect leg day at your own peril.Dead-lifts
Squats
Leg Press

Lateral box jumps and plyometrics.

When doing jumps, lunges, or other active workouts, focus on side-to-side motions and rotations, as they are more similar to your pitching motion.



, Rotator cuff surgery is the most common fix many pitchers need, but you can prevent future injury with smart training now. Most exercises for the rotator cuff are low-weight, high rep. You don't want to feel a lot of burning or pain -- these are small muscles that you're working.



Internal/External Rotations: Stand with your elbow at your side, arm bent 90 degrees. Grip the cable so that it pulls your arm away from you. Slowly, rotate your arm to bring your hand inward, towards your belly. Repeat 12-15 times. When done, reverse it so that you now rotate your arm away from your belly. Do three sets of each.

Scapular Plane Elevation: Hold a small weight in your throwing arm. Point the arm diagonally away from you. Your palms should face to the sides, not pointing up or down. Lower the arm, then raise it until it is straight, keeping on the diagonal angle. Repeat 12-15 times, for three sets., Strong biceps help you counteract the force of your throw, slowing you down and keeping your arm in control. This helps form and injury-prevention. Note, however, that you don't want grossly over-large biceps. Work them out 2-3 times a week as part of your training program.

You'll need to get into the gym and work on building up and reinforcing the most important key to your swing - your body. While a massive chest, broad shoulders, and bulging biceps look impressive, a powerful swing actually requires other muscles., While the swinging seems to be done by your upper body, your upper body is mostly a vehicle for delivering the power that your legs generate. Work on improving lower body strength. Powerful, multi-joint moves like squats, lunges, and cleans are a great way to build up functional lower body strength., Abs, obliques, and your lower back muscles are necessary for stabilizing your upper body and delivering the power generated by your legs through contact with the ball. A weak core will compromise the kinetic chain from your lower body to the head of the bat.

, While biceps may look good at the beach, they do little for your baseball swing. Strong wrists and a strong grip, on the other hand, add both stability and bat speed to your swing. Don't neglect them. , There is a reason why athletes from all-star baseball sluggers to NFL running backs and receivers take yoga and dance classes to give them an edge in their sports. You should do the same.


Focusing on flexibility through exercises like yoga, which builds core strength and stability as well as increases range of motion. By making your body more flexible you'll boost your reaction time and bat speed in addition to keeping your kinetic chain fluid and powerful.

, While the effects of learning to relax are physical, the process is mental. Some athletes use meditation or yoga to relax, some repeat reassuring phrases or mantras. Sluggers and hitting coaches know that trying to hit a home run with every swing is a sure-fire way to start a hitting slump.


Find what your mind needs in order to help yourself relax and stay focused.
Relaxation will both eliminate distractions from your mind and allow your body to be calm, loose, and powerful through your swing, which allows your bat to whip through the strike zone with increased speed. , While you are trying to generate power, you must keep your balance through your swing. Smoothly transferring your weight forward while generating power from your legs will allow for maximum torque upon impact with the ball. The more torque you generate, the more energy will be transferred to the ball.

, Whether you are dealing with an inside swing or an outside swing, it is important to keep your hands close to your body. Most of your swing is generated in your hands and wrists. If your hands are extended your bat speed will slow and your power will drop. The palm of your dominant (top) hand should remain facing upwards through contact in order to drive through the ball.

, Don't over-swing, or try to put any extra power into it. Most of the power in a swing is generated through your hips and wrists. Allow that power to flow through your body smoothly. Trying to swing extra hard will harm rather than help you.


Trying to ""muscle"" through the ball will usually result in your body tightening up, which compromises your natural kinetic chain and prevents your wrists from snapping into your swing as quickly.
Light muscles are fast muscles. Tight muscles are slow muscles. , Properly following through is important for multiple reasons. Not only will it help you to add all-important distance generating backspin to the ball, but it will help point out any flaws in your swing.In most cases, you want your hands to finish high which ensures that the bat head stays through the hitting zone as long as possible.

Who covers second? What does the pitcher do before he throws? Does the situation require a steal?"" This and more is equally important in stealing.;
, This is important. Normally, the lead-off is your body length and a step. This makes it easier to dive back in. But, if you're slower, be conservative; only about a body length is necessary. If you're fast, take more, but be reasonable.

, That's about two or three steps. A good secondary is what gets you in to second. When the pitch is thrown, you take the secondary lead.

, Look only at the base and listen to the base coach, either to slide, stand up, keep on running.

, Because the ball is still live and they can tag you out if you step off, this can assist you. To call time effectively, yell time and throw your hands up, or make a ""T"" with your hands.

,, This time its about two body lengths and a step. Again, take as much as you think you need to to be able to dive back in and steal third. The secondary lead is much more important here, because the base is closer to the catcher than second was.

, When sliding into third, always go to the right of the bag. The extra couple of inches can lead to a difference of out and safe.

, This is extremely important. Many players have stolen successfully, yet been tagged out after.

, The things you need to consider should be: ""Is the catcher a good blocker?"" ""Is he fast to get the ball?"" Is the pitcher fast?"" ""Can he get to home in time for the tag?""

, If not, take a little more.

, When running home, slide to the opposite part of the bag where the catcher is. Namely, if he/she is on the right part of the backstop, slide to the right, and vice versa. You also can run through home, but when in doubt, slide.

,, If it's wet, you'll have to slide closer. If dry, slide farther away. Sliding to closer can result in broken bones or twisted ankles. Sliding to far can result in being cleated and/or outs.

, If they are in front of you and you can't move away, then try to hit them as lightly as possible. That doesn't mean slow down, but do not lower your shoulder. Common sense right there.

, If you're the batter, run as fast as you can out of the box. If you're the runner, unless uncatchable or with two outs, wait until the ball is either caught or hits the ground. Note: This is on a fly ball.

, When rounding a base, fish-hook out about three feet. To do a fish-tail, start running out a little bit off the baseline, until you're about three feet off the line. This is legal. When near the bag, start turning in so you can touch the very inside bottom corner of the bag. Pushing off the bag helps with extra speed.

",How to Execute a Baseball Hit and Run,"


There is a batting lineup that will be announced to the team by either a coach or teammate before the game.
When you are two slots away from being the current batter you are ""in the hole"".
When you are one slot away from being the current batter you are ""on deck"" and may warm up in the on deck circle.;
,


Signalling a timeout will ensure the pitcher cannot pitch to you while you are receiving your signals from your coach.

,


Be sure to keep one foot in batter's box.

,


Signals will usually be established during a practice or a meeting by your coach so that you know what gestures and movements stand for which action you will need to perform.

,,,


Each strike zone will vary based on the umpires decision.
If you miss hitting the ball, follow further direction from your third base coach or refer back to the process for signalling a time-out.
The runner that is at any three of the bases should be running to the next base as soon as the pitcher commits his or her front foot towards the home plate.







,


If you do miss your swing, you may still distract the catcher enough to let the on-base runner advance to the next base.
If you hit the ball to the left of the third base line or right of the first base line then the ball is considered a foul ball.
The ball must be hit in fair territory which is considered inside the first and third base lines.
Refer to the time-out process again.

,


As you approach first base watch and listen to your first base coach and follow his or her direction.
If you can run to the next base you need to round the base
Rounding a base is done by angling outward once you are about 2/3 of the way to the base and slowly angling back towards the bag and when you place your foot on the bag you should be facing the direction of the next base you will be running to.

,


While you are running on the base path, it can be hard to determine what to do so after rounding first base make sure to watch your third base coach to follow directions.

Long before you get up to bat, you need to study the pitcher when he is warming up, just like any other pitcher.,
Find out if the pitcher throws with their right or left hand.,
Keep in mind that while side-armers are usually very accurate, they also tend to hit more batters than other pitchers because throwing side arm is almost as tough as hitting against a side arm pitcher!,
When up to bat, always watch the first pitches to see where they will land.,
After you face a side armer once, you will realize that they are just like other pitchers and that if you are not fooled by the angle, you will hit the ball.

",How to Get Used to Batting Against Side Arm Pitchers," There are variations to side arm pitching, so watch carefully at the angle he releases the ball. Watch how fast he throws so you can time it right. Side-armers tend to throw a lot of curves and sliders, so watch for those as well.;
, If you have a right handed pitcher and a right handed batter, from the batter's perspective, it will look like the ball is heading right for you after the release. It will then move over the plate and typically land just outside the strike zone. For a righty-lefty match-up, it will look like the ball is very far outside just after he releases it. It will move in towards you at the end. Lefty versus lefty basically is the same as a righty-righty match-up, explained above. Hitting against a pitcher with the same dominant hand is harder because the ball looks as if it will hit you.

, Almost every side arm pitch looks as if it will hit you at one time or another, but if one really looks like it will hit you, turn around and stand your ground, letting the pitch hit your back. This will not hurt as much, if it hurts at all, as getting hit by an overhand pitcher because side arm pitchers do not throw as fast.

, Side arm pitchers are deceptive, yet usually very, very, accurate. Chances are the second pitch will be thrown to the exact same spot as the first. Now you want to swing at the third pitch, especially if the first two were strikes. Even though the ball will look wild, aim for the same spot that the first two landed. With the best precision (and lots of practice), you will hit the ball.

Develop an off speed pitch.,
Location is as important, if not more important than velocity.,
Mix your pitches up.,
When you are way ahead in the count (0-2, 1-2) you may want to try a purpose pitch.,
Do not be intimidated by stronger hitters, hit the corners and mix your pitches up efficiently and you most likely will not be hit.

,
Do not change your mechanics if you aren't throwing as hard you normally do.",How to Pitch to Difficult Hitters," At a young age, a changeup is the best choice. A changeup is thrown like a palm ball, with all five fingers on the baseball. Do the same windup as your fastball, and whip the ball in there at about 80% velocity. The ball will be slower because of your grip (tighter = slower), but make sure your windup looks like you are throwing a fastball.;
, Do not aim for the heart of the plate, then you are just asking to get rocked. Practice throwing on the inside or outside corner, the sides of home plate. Check the ""Tips"" section below for more important information about locating your pitches.

, Don't throw your off speed pitch whenever there are two strikes, because the batter will see it coming. Try it on the first pitch sometimes, or the second pitch, even throw two in a row if you think the batter isn't expecting it.

, This is a pitch that is thrown out of the strike zone, in hope that the batter will swing and miss. If you are going to do this, you could try the ""high heat"" which is your fastball down the middle, but just below the shoulders. Or another option is knee high and about three inches outside. Those are the two most tempting purpose pitches.

,, If your mechanics are right, then it must be your arm. If you recently pitched (3 days or less) or just threw a lot, then you may want to consider sitting the game out. But don't change your mechanics before a game unless a coach thinks it is flawed or different than usual. Otherwise, you will probably just throw slower or inaccurately.

Don't pitch through pain or soreness.,
Abide by pitch and innings limits.,
Keep tabs on velocity and intensity.,
Give a pitching arm a legitimate vacation from throwing.,
Strengthen a pitcher’s shoulder, leg, and core muscles.,
Develop a consistent pitching motion that uses the entire body.,
Stretch and warm up properly.,
Rest and recover between pitching outings.",How to Prevent Pitcher's Arm," You’ll sometimes hear professional ballplayers talk about pitching through a case of “dead arm,” which is vaguely defined as a general weakness that impacts pitching velocity and accuracy. However, big league pitchers know better than to risk their arm health (and earning potential) by throwing with a sore or painful arm, and ballplayers at every level should follow that same advice.Muscle soreness is your body’s way of indicating overuse, and may be caused by micro-tearing of the muscle tissues. Continuing to throw when soreness or pain is present is the greatest risk factor for experiencing a significant arm injury.When your arm starts to feel sore, stop throwing and rest. It will only become more sore otherwise, and will be at ever-greater risk for injury.
There is no ""magic number"" for the amount of rest needed. As one example of a general guideline, though, Little League Baseball requires rest periods of one to four days based on the pitcher's age (7-17) and the number of pitches thrown in an outing.;
, There is no “magic number” of pitches, innings, or rest time that guarantees prevention of arm soreness or injury. That said, increased awareness has led to common-sense (or even rule-defined) limits being established in youth leagues right up to the pro leagues. Know the limits for your league/level, and follow them.Recommendations and restrictions can vary, but some experts say that youth pitchers (age 9-14) should never throw more than 75 pitches in a game (or 90 if age 15-18); should not throw more than 600 pitches (age 9-14) or 100 innings (age 15-18) per year; and should not pitch in more than two games per week.You’ll have to personally keep track of pitches, innings, and rest between outings if you or your child is playing in multiple leagues (such as a high school team and a travel team) at once. Generally speaking, it is best for kids to avoid pitching on multiple teams in overlapping seasons anyway.

, One reason that pitch counts and innings limits can only be recommendations is that not all pitches and innings are created equal. A long, high-intensity inning ratchets up the levels of stress, intensity, and fatigue, making soreness and injury more likely. That is to say that three easy ten-pitch innings are less fatiguing than one stressful thirty-pitch inning.Watch closely for signs of a pitcher wearing down during a long or high-intensity inning. A breakdown in pitching mechanics is often a clear indicator of fatigue. A fastball that becomes consistently elevated in the strike zone usually indicates a breakdown in mechanics and fatigue.
Not surprisingly, increased pitching velocity increases the chance for soreness and injury. Keep an especially close eye for signs of fatigue if a youth pitcher is throwing in a championship or other important game, in a “showcase” for college recruiters or pro scouts, or when a radar gun is being used to track velocity. The desire to dig deep for a little extra “oomph” on the fastball can lead to arm troubles.

, Traditionally, baseball has been a seasonal pursuit from late spring into early fall, leaving the rest of the year for other sports like football, basketball, or soccer. In the quest for college scholarships and multi-million dollar pro contracts, however, many youth pitchers have begun playing baseball year-round in multiple overlapping leagues. Such efforts, however, are probably doing more harm than good.Many experts recommend that youth pitchers should take off at least four months per year, with at least two or three of those taken consecutively. Extended periods of absolute rest from the arm motion of throwing a baseball are vital to muscle healing and development, especially for the growing bodies of young athletes.

, If you look at successful “power pitchers” with exceptional fastballs in the big leagues, you’ll notice that most of them have thick, muscular legs that they use to propel their bodies toward home plate. Leg and core muscles are stronger and more durable than shoulder and arm muscles, and all of these muscle groups should be developed and used in concert to get the best (and most arm-friendly) results out of pitching.Consult with experienced sports trainers, physical therapists, sports medicine doctors, or pitching coaches to develop a “global strengthening program” to increase muscle stability and strength in these key areas. For instance, the “Thrower’s Ten Program” uses resistance bands, dumbbells, and an exercise ball in a simple ten-step regimen intended to strengthen a pitcher’s shoulder, core, and leg muscles.Strength programs like the “Thrower’s Ten” are intended for use during baseball season (in this case, three or four times per week), but should not be used shortly before or after a pitching performance. Be sure to allow time for muscle rest and recovery.

, Stronger leg and core muscles cannot help reduce the burden on the arm unless an effective, repeatable pitching motion is utilized. You want to be able to propel your whole body forward into the pitch instead of using your arm in a whipping motion. You also want to be comfortable with the motion and be able to repeat it consistently even as you begin to tire during an outing.There is no single pitching motion that works for everyone, but studying the mechanics of effective professional pitchers is a good starting point for developing your own motion. Use video to study others’ motions and your own. Rely on the advice of reputable pitching guides and coaches, but also listen to your body. If a pitching motion is painful or uncomfortable, it isn’t right for you.
New technologies are being developed all the time to help in establishing and maintaining safer and more effective pitching motions. For instance, there are now arm sleeves that can track arm motion and record arm angle, elbow torque, and other key data., A good pitching motion utilizes major muscle groups throughout the body, so time should be taken to loosen and warm up more than just your arm before taking the pitching mound. That said, warming up your arm properly is essential to warding off soreness and injury.Start with dynamic stretching, such as doing jumping jacks or jogging for three to five minutes, to get your blood flowing and loosen up your muscles.
Move on to static stretching, gently stretching all your major muscle groups from head to toe and holding each stretch for about thirty seconds.
Finally, begin throwing the baseball, starting with “soft toss” (easy throws at a short distance). Slowly increase the distance and velocity, and eventually move on to throwing some warm up pitches that approximate the intensity and conditions of throwing on the mound.

, As mentioned elsewhere in this article, youth baseball leagues in particular are increasingly establishing required rest periods after a pitching performance (often based on the number of pitches or innings thrown). Always follow these rest protocols, but also follow common sense and listen to your body. If your arm is tired or sore, rest it until it feels better.Icing down a pitcher’s arm at the conclusion of an outing has been standard practice for decades in pro baseball, and icing does help to reduce the inflammation that can occur due to possible micro-tearing of muscle tissues. Apply ice to the shoulder and upper arm immediately after finishing a pitching outing, and then occasionally as needed thereafter.
Anti-inflammatory pain relievers can help relieve soreness, but don’t try to use medications to mask arm pain in order to pitch again. This is a recipe for a potentially serious arm injury.

Perfect your starting stance.The ideal starting stance is a combination of good balance, keeping your shoulders relaxed and squaring your body off to the plate.,
Practice sustaining good balance during the leg lift.Make sure to lift with your knee and avoid swinging your foot up during the leg lift.,
Avoid ""tucking"" your glove.The extra movement produced when you tuck your glove will lead to an inconsistent throw.,
Release the ball correctly.,
Perfect your follow-through.After you release the ball, bring your weight down onto your braced lead leg and make sure your throwing shoulder comes down over the lead leg.,
Record yourself pitching.",How to Strengthen Your Pitching Arm1," Before a pitch, your hands should be comfortably at your belt or up near your mid-chest. Keep your eyes focused and your body relaxed.


Make sure to hold your pitching hand and wrist deep inside your glove. This hides your grip and the ball from the batter.
Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, make sure to keep the spikes of your pivot foot (pitching arm side foot) in front of the rubber and slightly open. Keep your free foot (glove side foot) next to (or slightly behind) your pivot foot.
Once you get the sign from your catcher, take a deep breath right before you throw your pitch.;
, Once up, your lift leg foot should hang loosely and straight down from your knee. Keep your posting leg straight and firmly planted to maintain balance.


Make sure your maximum knee height is somewhere between 60% and 70% of your height.
Do not allow your body to move forward until your lead leg knee reaches its maximum height and keep your posture upright.
Keep your head centered over both your body and your pivot foot for additional balance.

, Maintaining steady glove arm action will produce a steady throw and higher velocity.

, Keep your head directly over your stride leg and position your throwing elbow so that it lines up with your throwing shoulder. Make sure your wrist is straight and firm behind the ball.


Keep your fingers on the top of the ball and hold a flat back position when you release it.
Avoid undercutting the ball by trying to impart a side spin and don’t drag your hand upon releasing the ball.

, The perfect follow-through should finish with a flat back position., The most effective way to monitor and improve your pitching mechanics is through video footage because you can slow down and study the motion of your pitch frame-by-frame.Not even the most experienced instructor or coach can discern the distinct characteristics of a pitcher’s throwing motion with the naked eye.
Watch your video footage frequently and examine your pitch for faults that can be improved.

, A regulation pitcher's mound is 18 feet (5.49 meters) in diameter. The center of the mound is 59 feet (17.98 meters) from the back of home plate. The pitching rubber (or pitcher's plate) is 18 inches (0.46 meters) behind the center of the mound or 60 feet, 6 inches (18.44 meters) from the back of home plate.

, Use chalk or flags to indicate measurements on your field.

, Fill in the area around the pitching rubber with a clay, sand and dirt mixture. The pitching rubber should be 10 inches (254 mm) higher than the playing field.

, Situate the bricks in the pitcher's landing area, which is the approximate spot where the pitcher's legs land after throwing a pitch. The pitcher's landing area is the most stressed area of the mound. Burying clay bricks will provide durability to your mound and reduce the need for frequent maintenance.

, The slope from the pitching rubber should begin 6 inches (152.4 mm) in front of the rubber, and slope toward home plate 1 inch (25.4 mm) for every foot (0.3 meters).

, Once the mound has taken shape, pound the surface area of the mound with a tamp, or a hard, flat surface, to ensure there are no loose areas.

, Raking the mound will remove any pebbles or chunks of grass.

, The water will soak into the mound and firmly set the clay. Regular watering also will prevent your mound from cracking or eroding."

Separate the tips of your thumb and ring finger.,
Throw the ball by snapping your thumb and middle finger.",How to Grip a Curveball1," Hold the ball so two seams are visible in the front and two visible in the back.The four-seam grip is considered by many pitchers as more effective when throwing a curveball than the two-seam grip. It allows the pitcher to throw the ball at any angle, as long as they hold their hand behind the ball and throw it with a snapping motion.Two-seam grips are used to throw fastballs. Rather than breaking down (as in a curveball), two-seam pitches break to the right or left.;
, Place the ball in the palm of your hand and flex your middle and index fingers so they grip the top of the ball.Curve your ring finger so the ball rests against its side., Place your middle finger along the middle seam (on the pinky side) and your thumb on the seam towards the back of the ball., At this point, your thumb should be positioned on the bottom of the ball opposite your middle finger, with these two fingers forming a ""C"" around the ball.Your grip should be firm, but not too tight. You want your thumb to be able to flick up behind the ball when it is released.
Do not choke the ball. Make sure there is a gap between your thumb and index finger, and small space between thumb and ring finger.

, When throwing a curveball, extend your wrist back. When you release, ""snap"" your thumb and middle finger together while flicking your wrist.At this point, your middle finger should rotate downwards and your thumb should rotate upwards to create the centripetal (circular) force needed to spin the ball towards the plate.Through a change-up curveball by increasing grip depth.Experiment with slight variations in grip depth and finger (thumb and middle) position.

Warm up before you start training.,
Incorporate a long toss program into your training 2-3 times per week.Long tossing is essentially a throwing program performed by you and a partner.,
Spend some time weight training.,
Use ten-pound dumbbells for squat jumps and lunges.,
Do upper body weight training.,
Integrate medicine ball training into your sessions.,
Incorporate a resistance training program into your sessions.,
Include a post-training recovery system in your sessions.",How to Strengthen Your Pitching Arm2," Your rotator cuff muscles are weaker and smaller than the other muscles in your arm and they will wear out faster without properly warming up before training sessions.


Rotator cuff muscles must be strengthened in order to prevent injury, and warming up properly is the best way to start every training session.
Come up with a customized warm up and stretch routine that begins every session.

, Start about 45 feet (14 m) apart from each other and make 10-15 throws to warm up. Then move back two or three steps with each throw until you get to 60 feet. At 60 feet, throw until you feel your arm begin to fatigue. This should only take about 10 minutes.


During your next training session you will begin exactly the same way, except you will go out to 70 feet (21.3 m) instead of 60. At 70 feet (21.3 m), make 10-15 throws (until your arm starts to feel fatigued) and then stop. Work to increase your distance a little at each session.Avoid long tossing at distances over 300 feet, and perform long tossing between bullpen sessions. Do not spend more time long tossing than in the bullpen.
Make sure to use a fastball grip during long tossing. Ask your pitching coach to pay particular attention to your angle and release point. To gain maximum benefit from a long toss program, have a pitching coach on hand to supervise the mechanics of your throw.

, Weight training for pitchers has always been a controversial subject because of concerns that the increase in muscle mass would diminish flexibility. However, many recent studies have shown evidence to the contrary, as long as muscle density is increased, not muscle mass.Focus on lifting lighter weights to increase muscle density. The best upper body exercises for pitchers are dumbbell flat bench presses, incline dumbbells, lateral pulldowns, single-arm dumbbells pulls, hammer curls and tricep rope extensions.Use a stretch cord and three-pound dumbbells. Don't lift heavy weights and limit to two or three sets.

, To perform a squat jump, hold the weights securely in your hand, squat down, and then jump as high as you can from that position. When doing lunges, alternate legs frequently.


Don't forget to stretch well before you start training. After training sessions, make sure to stretch again. Always strive to consume a lot of water while weight training for muscle health.

, On top of the typical arm and shoulder strengthening exercises that all pitchers should be doing, you should also spend time upper body training. Exercises that emphasize pulling motions are ideal for pitchers because they strengthen the upper back.Strengthening the upper back with these types of exercises will result in strengthening the muscles you need to decelerate your arm when pitching.
The best exercises for this purpose are bent over rows and pull-ups. When performing them, make a special effort to squeeze your shoulder blades together, then back and down.

, Training with medicine balls is another popular weight training technique for pitchers. It is normally incorporated alongside weight training programs.The most popular medicine ball exercises for pitchers are Russian twists, granny throws, rotational throws, med ball slams, and squat explosions.

, Resistance training is one of the best ways to keep your shoulders healthy and to gain strength. Using resistance tubing (also known as Jobe's exercises) and resistance bands are the most highly recommended and effective ways for pitchers to train with resistance., A major and often overlooked component of properly maintaining arm strength is the inclusion of a good recovery system. Frequently use ice treatments to keep inflammation down.


Allow your muscles appropriate rest periods in between sessions so that your arm has the chance to rebuild broken down muscle tissue.
Perform simple post-training stretching exercises to improve your range of motion and prevent injuries."

Perfect your stride.,
Work on your delivery momentum.,
Improve your overall flexibility with frequent stretching.Gaining flexibility in the groin, hamstrings, hips, and lower back is essential and can significantly increase your pitch velocity.,
Using weighted balls during the off-season.,
Develop your own pitching style.It is imperative that you use proper pitch mechanics to prevent injuries, but within that framework you should work on developing a personal pitching style.",How to Strengthen Your Pitching Arm3," Research suggests that approximately 50% of ball velocity comes from the force you accumulate in your stride.In order to produce maximum velocity, you must increase your stride speed and length.This will help you build your forward momentum and generate an improved pitching velocity.


To gain speed and stride length, work on moving your body as fast as possible in a side lunge, going from your back leg to your front leg without stopping or hesitating.
Strive for the longest stride possible while still managing to get your head and shoulders positioned over your lead leg when you release the ball.Increase your knee flexion when your foot hits the ground after your stride. The more your front knee is bent after your foot hits the ground, the higher your velocity will be.

, Your lower body (feet, legs, and hips) is directly responsible for the building of momentum in the delivery.By starting your delivery with well-practiced foot movement and leg lifting, you generate your pitch velocity from the ground up, which in turn generates the force needed to propel the ball.This momentum builder is referred to in the industry as the tempo of the delivery.

, Not only will stretching increase your flexibility, but it will also reduce your recovery time after training sessions.


Use foam rolls, dynamic stretching, and static stretching to increase your flexibility.

, When utilized correctly, weighted balls will definitely increase your velocity. This type of training is called “overload” training and should never be employed during the regular season. Use weighted balls correctly and responsibly, combined with a proper long toss regimen, for best results.


Weighted balls should only be used by pitchers that are high school age and up.

, As long as you are observing proper pitch mechanics, feel free to use a style that is natural and comfortable for you. Marrying these two principles will only serve to increase your velocity.

Use a modified 4-seam grip.,
Hold up your middle and index fingers.,
Position your middle finger and thumb.,
Prepare to throw the ball.,
Throw by snapping your thumb and middle fingers together.",How to Grip a Curveball2," The index-up grip is similar to that for a basic curveball, with the exception that your index finger remains relaxed and pointed up.This grip is good for beginners because your will use your index finger to help guide the ball towards its target.Use this pitch to practice your curveball technique, but avoid using it in games. Experienced batters are likely to see the raised index finger and adjust their stance in anticipation of a curveball., Bend your middle finger, leaving your index finger pointing upwards. Like in the standard curveball grip, let the bottom of the ball rest against the side of your ring finer.

, Place your thumb on the back of the ball so it lies along the bottom seam. Position your middle finger along the top seam opposite your thumb.At this point, your thumb and middle finger should form a ""C"" while your index finger is pointed up.

, Make sure your index finger is up and relaxed, and the ball is firmly gripped by your thumb (bottom) and middle finger (top). While your grip should be firm, relax the muscles in your wrist and forearm., When throwing, your thumb rotates up while your middle finger rotates down. Use your index finger to control the trajectory of the ball - the ball will go in the direction in which your index finger is pointing.


Your index finger is not needed to throw the pitch, with the thumb and middle finger providing all the spin.When throwing, your elbow should be at the same height or above your shoulder. Your hand and wrist should form a vertical line with your forearm.Keep your forearm and wrist muscles loose until just prior to release. Strongly contract them and quickly snap your wrist forward and inwards, allowing the ball to spin out over the middle finger."
"
Use a more advanced 4-seam grip.,
Make a peace sign with your middle and index fingers.,
Position your thumb and middle finger.,
Use your knuckle as a pivot point to throw the ball.",How to Grip a Curveball3," For this pitch, you will grip the ball with your thumb, middle finger, and knuckle of your index finger. Holding it this way allows the ball to break sharper and later (closer to the batter).While more difficult to grip (and throw), knuckle curves increase speed without sacrificing spin.


A knucklecurve grip is on average 2.5 mph (4 km/h) faster than a standard curveball.
Over a quarter of curveballs thrown by major league pitchers in 2013 were classified as knucklecurves., Place the ball in the palm of your hand so the seams curve to the side of the ball. Bend your middle finger over the top of the ball so it rests along the seam. Next, take the index finger and bend it so the knuckle rests on top of the ball next to your middle finger.Think of the knuckle of your middle finger ""digging"" into the top of the ball., The placement of the thumb and middle finger are identical to other types of curveballs. The thumb should be placed on or along the seam on the bottom of the ball so it forms a ""C"" with the middle finger. Stabilize the bottom of the ball by curving your ring finger in and resting the ball against the first and second joint., Throw as you would for a regular curveball. As you release the ball, snap your middle finger and thumb together so it pivots against the knuckle of your index finger.This will help generate the speed and spin required for the ball to reach its target and break or curve downwards.

The batter made a hit. Although it does mean the pitcher threw a strike, it counts against his earned run average.
The pitcher walked the batter. This could be the result of the pitcher throwing four balls or hitting the batter with the pitch.;
, To calculate an accurate ERA, you must have accurate numbers. You need to know the earned runs, but to do this you have to look at when the pitcher was pulled from a game. For example, if a pitcher played three innings and in the fourth inning allowed a man on every base and then was pulled, all three of those men would count against his ERA. They do not transfer to the next pitcher simply because he was the one pitching when they made it across home plate.

, Whereas earned runs are caused by hits and are the fault of the pitcher, unearned runs are usually caused by errors or passed balls and are not strictly the fault of the pitcher. Unearned runs do not count towards a pitcher's ERA.


For example, there are runners on 2nd and 3rd base, with 2 outs. The pitcher throws a pitch to the batter, which ends up being a routine ground ball to the first baseman, but the first baseman bobbles it and can't make a play to get an out. One runner scores, and two are still left on base. The run is unearned, and if the two remaining runners on base happen to score, their runs also count as unearned.

, To calculate ERA, you need three parts: the earned runs, the innings pitched, and the total number of innings.


Earned runs, as explained above, are the number of times a pitcher lets a batter get on base. This is the total number for the whole game.
The innings pitched is just like it sounds, the total number of innings this pitcher pitched. This number will always end in thirds. That is because for every inning three strikes can be made by the fielding team. That leaves three possible outcomes: a whole inning (three outs), an inning with two outs (ends in .66), or an inning with one out (ends in .33).
The total number of innings refers to the number of innings in a complete game (9)."

Throw often, but not too often.,
Exercise Often.,
Not all throwing has to be bullpen.,
Do not try to attract attention.,
The game is 10% physical, 90% mental.,
Be professional.,
At last, it's game time.",How to Be a High School Starting Pitcher," In order to be a successful pitcher at any level, you must work hard all year. Most pitchers who aren't too serious only play baseball during the season. If you want to become better than the rest, you need to work more.;
, There are many drills that you can do to improve your game. Try to focus on the mechanics of pitching. Accuracy and velocity should follow if you are performing the right drills.

, If your mechanics need work, keep doing drills. Eventually, your muscles will remember the drills and in a week or two, it will become feeling natural.

, If you work hard enough, you should be able to throw 60-70 bullpen pitches, 2-3 times a week. ALWAYS ice your arm after throwing. The ice will help soothe any pain and it will repair your arm. Do not over-exert yourself while throwing. Stay comfortable and relaxed; being tight during throwing can increase the chances of injury.

, On the days you are not throwing, you could run or bike. During the winter, you can use a treadmill if you have one. Your week should consist of 2-3 days of throwing, 3-4 days drills, and 1 day of rest.

, Long toss is very commonly used to strengthen the arm and to improve stamina. When you do long toss, you should begin at a close distance and move your way back, then when you are far enough, start moving in again.

, If you have worked hard enough with your drills and throwing, attention should find you. You will feel good knowing that you don't have to show off to be noticed.

, Any successful pitcher would agree that in order to be control on the mound, you must be in control of yourself. There are many books and articles written on the mental game that you can read.

, Take your game seriously. Coaches respect a player who focuses in practice. Also, be open to constructive criticism from your coaches and maybe even from teammates.

, You've worked all season for this. Try to remember all you can about what you have learned in the off-season. Many pitchers focus intensely on the game starting 1-2 hours before they take the mound. Don't try to work harder than you should. Be comfortable and relaxed. All the work you've done will pay off, just pitch your game.

Keep your pitching arm from getting too sore.",How to Pitch a Baseball," There are many different ways to grip the ball (shown below). Keep the ball inside your glove while doing this, and don't begin your motion until you have a comfortable grip. The different grips are important to learn because they will help you to throw the ball in different ways., These pitches are the fastest in baseball, averaging around 95 mph (153 km/h). Spread your fingers slightly with the tips barely over the laces of the ball.

, This pitch will be slightly slower and less accurate than the four-seam, but it also curves as it reaches the batter, making it harder to hit. To hold, grip the ball along the seams with your index and middle finger.

, This pitch moves in the air quite a bit. Put your thumb and index finger in a circle, and then use your other three fingers to center the baseball.

, Keep your index finger and middle right and tight next to each other on the seams. throw like you normally do but snap your wrist when throwing the curve.

, A slider seems like a fastball until the last second, when it curves to one side. Grip with your index and middle fingers across the seam at its widest point.

, This pitch will appear to be a fastball, but will drop as it nears the batter, making it difficult to hit. You need large hands to throw this pitch effectively. Hold the ball as if you would for the two-seam fastball. Rotate the ball toward yourself, so your fingers are along the horseshoe seam. Spread your fingers to the outside of the seams and place your thumb directly under the ball.

, This ball is almost impossible to hit when thrown well. Jam the ball between your index and middle finger.

, This ball will wiggle as it moves towards the batter. Dig your fingernails into the middle of the ball seams.

, Place both feet shoulder width apart standing straight on top of the mound with your toes dangling off the front, and face directly towards your catcher, your toes pointed towards him with your heels on the rubber. Hold your glove in front of your chest, with your elbows resting on both sides of your torso. Some pitchers prefer to stand with their stride leg slightly behind their other leg. This is optional and may not work for everyone. Your should start in the stretch position when there are runners on the bases. Place your feet so they face third base if you throw right-handed or first base if you throw left-handed. The stretch is a faster way to pitch and you can maintain more balance, resulting in more control. Your right foot should be placed against the rubber, with your other foot one to two inches in front. This will enable you to get a full rotation with your hips, which will make you throw harder. If you start with your stride leg slightly back, simply shift your weight to that back leg.

, Shift your weight to your left foot, allowing you to lift your right foot and place it beside the rubber (or pivot your right foot into this position, whichever is more comfortable), so that the right side of your right foot is pressing against the mound.

, Your body should have begun to move with your right foot in the previous step, and at the end of this step your body should be facing third base instead of home plate.

, Your front arm should stay closed and your front elbow should be at a comfortable angle (45-90 degrees). Your throwing arm should hit what's called your ""sweet spot"" which is the point where you throwing arm is at its lowest point during your motion. Normally, it is at the point where your arm is nearly perpendicular to the ground, with a slight bend in your elbow. Ensure that your body stays facing third base through this step, and that you hit your sweet spot before continuing to the next step., Do this at the same time as moving your arms (the previous step). To lower your leg, bend your right knee until your left leg is close to the ground without touching the ground. Don't stride outwards until you have lowered your left leg fully or you will lose substantial power. Your front leg should have a curved ""down and out"" sweep towards home. As you are doing this, begin to raise your throwing arm out of the sweet spot so that is is parallel to the ground, without allowing your elbow to drop towards your hip.

, In other words, if landing your foot pointing at the plate is a 90 degree angle, land your foot pointing at a 75 degree angle. This will get your body into a power position. Your power position is the position where your legs are fully extended with your hips and arms still closed, ready to hurl your arm towards the plate.

, Pull forward with your front foot by pivoting from that 75 degree angle into a 90 degree angle. Ensure that you make this pivot before you swing open your upper body and pull your left arm towards first base. Pivoting early allows you to generate power with your hips, and create more of a whip action for your right arm. Your throwing elbow should be aligned with your shoulders (horizontally of course) through this step.The most common mistake pitchers make is to open their arms before their hips, which removes the power generated from their legs, causing pitchers to have less velocity, and increase the stress applied to their arms.

, Do not snap your wrist as this can cause injury. Your wrist should not guide the ball, but rather the ball guides your wrist.


During your motion, it is beneficial to be aware of your wrist. As you move your arm from your sweet spot, your wrist should be pulled back, cocking the ball in your hand. Then, as you release the ball, the ball should glide off of your wrist, finishing with your wrist fully flexed.

, Extended your arm as far you can and allow your back leg to lift up from the forward momentum, and place it on the mound to get in a fielding position.

, Pitching is really a series of movements that the pitcher does without thinking. The key to a great pitch is balance--without balance, your throw will more than likely be rather off kilter.

, To be most effective, try to maintain a consistent throwing angle for all of your pitches. Some pitchers throw more overhand throwing a curveball or dip to sidearm while throwing a slider. While this may give you better control or command or your pitch, it can easily tip off the batter as to what pitch you are throwing. Having a consistent arm angle keeps the batter guessing.

, Start off slow. Wrap ice around your arm and chest to slow down the buildup of lactic acid (the buildup of lactic acid causes soreness).


Run for 30 minutes after you pitch. This will get your blood circulating and help push out the lactic acid that might form in your arm.

Gather your information.,
Make the first calculation.,
Multiply this number with the total number of innings.,
Test your number.",How to Calculate ERA (Earned Run Average)2," You will have three numbers to use in your calculation. For example, say that Joe Smith plays for 6 innings in a 9-inning game and allows 3 men to score.

, For this, divide the number of earned runs by the number of innings played. Following our example, it would be 3/6, giving us the number .5.

, That means we would take our number of .5 and multiply it with 9, giving us 4.5.

, Depending on your preference, you can calculate ERA two ways. The first (shown above) is ERA= total innings(earned runs / innings pitched). You can also formulate it as ERA = earned runs x total number of innings / innings pitched. Test your answer using the alternate method."

Understand the motivation that you use to keep people away from you.,

Identify what actions you use to push people away.,
Talk to somebody about your fears and feelings.,
Value yourself.,
Come to an understanding that not everybody will hurt you in life.,
Fake that confidence.,
Be honest with yourself about the mistakes you made.,
Consider talking to a specific person you've deliberately estranged from you but whom you care about a great deal.,
Get out there.,
Make it happen.",How to Stop Pushing People Away," Identify why you are pushing a person away, without passing judgment on the person. Close your eyes and visualize the person in your head. Then listen to yourself. How do you feel when you see this person's face? Threatened? Nervous? Name that feeling if you can.;
, The majority of the time, people push others away because of an underlying issue with themselves. Usually this is a trust issue, commonly found in relationships. If you have been hurt in the past, it is understandable that you are wary of letting another person get that close to you ever again. The thought may even seem ridiculous. As hard as it may seem, you will trust again, provided you are open to the reality that there are many trustworthy people out there. With dedication to overcoming your own issues, you will conquer the negative feelings, to become the confident, strong person you are.

, Perhaps you fail to keep communicating. Perhaps you say you'll do something but then you fail to follow through. It could even be your entire demeanor and mode of acting, a deliberate set of behaviors of yours, that allow you to treat somebody carelessly and only at a distance. Watch for actions such as: the fact that you keep a lot to yourself, or the fact that people are trying to help you and you just deny their help.


For example, if a friend tries to help you when you’ve come out of a bad relationship, but you just refuse to be helped, you have just pushed away someone who could be a source of support and understanding. If you continue this behavior constantly, you risk alienating your friends and friends will not stay on your doorstep forever when you keep ignoring them.

, Talking about the problem is a major step to opening up. It's simple, easy and incredibly refreshing. You don't have to go into detail; just to unload some feelings can be a world of help, and help you to realize that you're not alone in your feelings.


Let out your feelings to a counselor or to your parents or someone you can trust. Explain to them why you push people away. Let the people who are closest to you in, so that they can help you.
If you don't like talking to other people about your problems, try talking to yourself in the mirror or journaling to help you understand your feelings about others.

, Learn to trust yourself and believe in your own worth. If you crave the acceptance of others all the time but then fear their rejection, this sets up a vicious cycle of not wanting to get too close to them for fear of them letting you down, and in the process confirming that you're worthless. This is not the case––you are worthy and you are the only person who can admit this and live true to it. Just as the people you care about matter, so too do you.


Think positive thoughts whenever you feel down. Make a list of the things that make you special and unique. Ask somebody else to write down a thing or two––this will give you a feeling of self worth.

, Sure, some people will, but by not allowing yourself to get close to anyone, think of all the good relationships and connections you're missing out on. Also consider the overlooked experiences, such as shopping trips with the girls you wouldn't dare talk to in case they didn't like you, dates with the guy you thought was too good for you and making a business deal with the person you felt intimidated by. There are people out there who appreciate and even love you for who you are––gravitate toward them and keep them in your life.


Learn to keep your distance only after you've made an effort with people. Be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, and see what happens.

, If you feel as if you can't face the world today, plaster on a big smile, even when you feel like you want to cry. Confidence is a morale booster, even when it's faked. Repeat positive mantras in your head such as; I am strong and I can achieve anything. You will start to believe it.

, It's hard for everyone to admit their feelings. However, it's essential in order to move on. Where you've treated people like dirt, you need to own up to it and develop a plan to set things right again., Realize that this will not be easy because the person may not trust you any longer and may be inclined to tell you to leave them be. You will need to persevere and to let them know that you're keen to discuss what made you push them aside and that you're no longer going to do that. It is likely that you will feel anxious and afraid but it's important to try to mend broken relationships that are of great importance to you. Remember that any assumptions you've made about them are quite likely to have been wrong.


Convince yourself that if you don’t want to lose a friend forever, you need to make some changes. Realize too that just getting an apology doesn’t necessarily make the offended person feel better and forgiving. Remember that words are just words, it's the actions that rebuild a good relationship.







, Grab every opportunity and begin to take risks. This will help your confidence and help you meet as many new people as you can.

, Now that you’ve honestly put yourself in the corner, and realized what you need to do, go for it! Show your people how important they are to you, and that you’d be really sorry to lose them.


Remember that your words should reflect your actions. Stop talking and start making things happen instead.
Adopt this mantra: What's the worst that could happen?

Use the correct type of tape measure.,

Know when to measure circumference vs length.,
Write down your measurements.",How to Take Body Measurements1," When taking body measurements, you need to use the correct type of tape measure. You will want to use a soft cloth or flexible plastic/rubber tape measure, such as is used in sewing. Do not use a metal measuring tape such as is used in construction (it will be inaccurate).;
, Stand straight, tall, and breathe normally when taking measurements. Some measurements may be taken better when exhaling, some when inhaling (it will depend on the purpose of the measurement). This may be difficult to do yourself, so get a friend to help you.

, You want to be sure that when you measure, the tape is straight and in line with the appropriate body part. For example, for most circumference measurements the tape will need to be parallel to the floor while while lengths will need to be either parallel or perpendicular (based on the line orientation of the body part being measured).

, You can’t get a very accurate measurement when wearing baggy or thick clothing, so try to wear clothes which fit closely or wear nothing at all. Similarly, breast measurements for women will be most accurate when wearing a well-fitting, unpadded bra.


If measuring for clothes tailoring, some measurements will need to be taken with clothing on, such as pants measurements and shoulder measurements.

, Different measurements will need to be either circumference measurements (the measurement around something) or length measurements (the measurement between two straight points). Which is necessary should be obvious but all will be indicated in the instructions below.

, Make sure that you write down the measurements as you take them, so that you do not forget them and need to take them again.

, Make the holes face right. Put your middle finger on the ball so it covers three of the holes. Put your index finger next to the holes, but separated from your middle finger. Throw 3/4 submarine and snap your wrist. Throw it outside at the batter's knees for a right handed batter and it should curve up and in the strike zone.

, Hold the ball with the holes to the left. Place your index and middle finger right next to the holes almost touching. Then throw it full submarine so your knuckles almost touch the ground.

, Hold the ball so the holes are to the right and cover the holes with your index and middle finger and throw it over hand. Opposite for righties.

, Most effective for left-handers. Grip the ball like a normal screwball and do the same arm motion except when you release the ball come through it as if your throwing a curve ball, giving it a big loop like a nasty curve ball.

, Hold the ball like you would a riser, but throw overhand, and flick your wrist as you come around. The ball should make the motion of a screwball then suddenly drop.(This pitch is awesome to use on a 2and 2 pitch. Even though you might not get a strike if you do it perfectly it will be nasty.) After throwing this about 20 times your arm may hurt, so take a break.

, Then throw 3/4 submarine and the ball should break up and to the right.

, Make a ""C' with your index finger, middle finger, and thumb. If you're a right handed pitcher then the holes should be on the right. If you're a left handed pitcher then the holes should be on the left. Make sure that your hands don't cover the holes.

, Hold the ball with the holes on the left side and stick your index finger into one hole. Allow your index finger to be the last finger on the ball and the ball should curve 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) to the left. This takes some practice.

, The holes should be on the right side. Put your middle finger into one of the holes then put your index finger on the opposite side of the hole. To make this work you should throw this in the middle of sidearm and normal.

, Same as a curve ball just with the holes facing the right. Well almost the same, you want to have your fingers on the holes this time and have your fingers pointing towards the middle of the ball more so its not parallel with the holes like the curve. Pretty much like and ""X"" with your 2 fingers and the holes. Hold this also with your index and middle fingers.


Hint: You want to throw this to the left side of the strike zone and flick your wrist a lot, hold it loose and almost lob it. As long as you have enough flick with your wrist it will slide or screw very smoothly to the right.

, Put the holes so they are facing to the right now put your index and middle finger along the holes while your thumb is underneath and throw it over hand. make sure you aim low and behind the batter because it will break a lot.

, Put the holes facing to the left(right hander) and make a ""c"" with your index finger and thumb. Put your middle finger on the words ""wiffle ball"" on the solid part of the ball. Throw at 3/4 arm slot. If thrown right it will break all the way from a right handed batter across the zone.

, Throw overhand. It should curve about 3 feet (0.9 m) to the right.

, the index finger covers the holes for a lefty, and the pointer finger for a right hander. flick your three fingers and it should move a lot while appearing to shake.

, Hold the ball so the holes are facing down and throw the ball 3/4. you must also throw the ball down a little bit.

, Hold the ball like you would a dropper, except do your full wind up and throw between a submarine and sidearm, and when thrown flick your index and middle finger, when done properly the ball will do the motion of a riser then break like a slider.

, For righties, put the holes facing the left. For lefties, put the holes facing the right. Stick your pointer finger in one hole. Throw overhand.

, Hold a screwball grip and throw 3/4 submarine and should drop and move like a curve ball.

, Position your hand so that the holes are on the right side of the ball (for Righty Pitchers) and left side for Lefty Pitchers. Make your pointer and middle fingers into a ""V"" and push the ball up between them so it is kind of stuck. Throw the ball at any arm degree. However, between sidearm and 3/4 arm is the best. The ball should curve away to a righty if thrown over the top, up and away if thrown 3/4, it will sink if thrown sidearm and will curve in if thrown submarine.

, Hold the wiffle ball with the holes out to the left and your index and middle finger vertical and on the right of the holes. Try to have your fingers on the holes. It's kind of like your giving someone the ""loser"" sign on your forehead but with 2 fingers.


Hint: Try to aim at a batter who's right handed, it will curve all the way across the plate. Sometimes even around their head and still hit the strike zone.

, Hold the ball with the holes facing to the right, split your fingers, snap your wrist, and throw sidearm/submarine.( This pitch takes practice, but it helps to learn a riser first and then try snapping your wrist.) This is J.Wayne's pitch.

, Scuff up you wiffle ball and grip it like a curve. Then throw it straight it should either curve like a gyro, curve, or slider.

, With the holes to the left put your index finger in one of the holes. Put your finger in the hole about 3/4 of the way up your nail. have your middle finger spread about half an inch apart. throw the ball 3/4 arm, or overhand.

, Holes facing up put your index and middle fingers on the holes on the right of the ball. your thumb should be on the seam on the left of the ball. throw 3/4 or sidearm and it should curve about a foot and dive about 1 or 2 feet (0.3 or 0.6 m).

, Holes facing down, get your fingernails on each piece of plastic in between the holes. Get on top; and push rather than toss.

, Put your index and middle finger on the opposite side of where the holes are throw so you turn the ball over to the side with the holes and should drop straight down.

, Have the holes facing the right for righties left for lefties split your fingers and have the middle finger be on the side of the holes have your index finger on the middle of he ball ( finger should be on the left side of the ball) throw side arm and snap your wrist up if thrown right ball will rise and at the last second curve

, Push in the hole side so that it is half a ball. Put the dent to the left. Put your middle finger on the center of the ball and your ring finger right next to it. Leave your pinkie and pointer fingers off of the ball. Throw way to the right of the batter. It's nasty.

, Put the holes on the left side. Put your middle and ring fingers right on the half mark of the ball put your thumb at the bottom and throw it at the batter just watch the ""Humongous Curve"".

, Holes on bottom put middle and index finger on top of ball where the trademark thing is. put thumb on side of holes then twist your wrist it will drop 4 feet (1.2 m).

, Hold the ball like you would hold a curve ball, but as you release, flick your wrist.

, Hold the the ball with the holes facing away from you and just throw like a fastball. It should curve about 5 feet (1.5 m) to the left.

, Make a ""c"" with pointer middle and thumb. middle finger and thumb should be on the middle of the ball with holes to the right if you are a right-handed pitcher. Pinky and ring finger should be curled up in the small circle where the pat # is (they should not be on the holes). This pitch should be thrown as a sidearm pitch, but the lower the release point the better it is. Just before the release point you should snap your wrist to get maximum rise.

, Hold this pitch the same as a curve ball but just throw it side arm and flick your wrist a lot! You want the holes to be straight up and just let the ball hover right across the plate. It usually stays right where you want to throw it unless you angle your arm awkwardly.

, Hold with the holes facing down and have your index and middle finger over the holes and your thumb on the opposite side of the ball. When you throw you want to bend down to throw, throw across your body.

, Push in the side with holes. put them on the bottom. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist.

, The middle finger goes into a hole while the other stays gripped normally. Deliver like a riser but don't throw it as hard and flick your wrist. It will float across the plate. Make sure to never throw it twice in a row.

, This pitch is the same as the riser just with the holes facing down. For some people the riser and floater are vice versa. With this pitch you also need to have a lot of flick with your wrist in order for it to work.

, Hold the ball like a circle change up, and then throw the ball submarine style. Snap your wrist. This pitch is a counter to the sidearm Rise-ball. To fool the hitter as he/she sees you pitch sidearm, they are expecting it to rise when all of a sudden it sinks. Hold just like the Rise-ball except turn the holes toward the index finger. (If held out if front of the face the holes should be pointed to the left, opposite for a lefty). Throw this pitch sidearm again. aim high and to the right a little it will sink down and away from a right handed batter. Throw harder for more break.

, Hold the ball as you would for a so-called ""screwball"" so that the holes are to the right of your middle and index fingers (which should be together). Keeping this grip, throw it sidearm w/ a strong snap of the wrist, this will cause it to rise slightly then drop dramatically, just like a splitter.

, Have the holes of the ball on the left side and put your index finger on the left side of holes or barely on the holes, then do the same with the right middle finger but except on the right side of the holes.


Hint: If you throw overhand snap your wrists down a little and it should drop a couple of feet.

, Hold the ball on your finger tips on the bottom of the ball. Throw underhand, but exaggeratedly high, and flick your wrist upwards, with as much force as a fastball. It should rise and rise, and the batter will stop to look at it, and it should drop into the zone.

, Put your middle finger in the holes so that they are on the right. Put your thumb on the bottom of the ball. Place your index finger to the left of your middle finger so they are spread apart, but not too far. Throw between 3/4 and over the top but twist your hand so the holes are in the front while pitching. The ball should drop 3–4 feet (0.9–1.2 m).

, Hold like a screwball, except split your fingers.throw sidearm and flick your wrist.

, Put pointer finger halfway on the holes and middle finger touching your pointer finger, throw sidearm at an up angle, for example throw sidearm but throw at the top of the strike zone and it will drop about 6 feet (1.8 m) if thrown hard enough. it will drop right into the strike zone and strike the opponent out!

, Hold the ball like a fastball but split your hands just less than you would for a splitter. you should almost have a slice motion to your throw so that is a 3 quarter throw. the pitch takes practice but it should cut a foot but it looks like it will cut 5!

, Put your index finger on the equator with the holes on the left for righties then have your middle finger an inch to an inch and a half then put your thumb just barely on top of the holes close to the middle then throw it at 3 quarters and it should cut straight across the strike zone.

, Holes on left of the ball put index finger over the middle of the holes, put middle finger on the seam. thumb also on the middle of holes but on bottom of the ball. pitch over the top it should break 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) away from a righty batter and will drop about 6 to 9 inches (15.2 to 22.9 cm).

, Have the holes facing you, put your index and middle fingers on the top of the ball and slightly on the holes. Instead of holding it with your fingers hold it with your index and middle knuckles. Your other fingers will tuck in on the side of the ball regularly, not with your knuckles. Also don't let your ring and pinky wrap around the ball just tuck them in with your hand.

, The original knuckle ball is pretty good, but this one is nasty! Push the center of the ball (center being circle in between the holes) and bend your pinky and ring fingers. Place them in the dent you created. Put your pointer and pinky fingers out over side of ball. As you throw it, flick out your bent fingers, it is uncontrollable but moves like crazy!


Hint: Good luck throwing this one (and hitting it)
Hint: Your hold on the ball should be almost the same as the devil's horns sign.

, Have the holes facing the right. Put middle finger slightly in one of the holes put index finger to the left of the middle finger, put thumb on the bottom of the ball, throw over hand and snap wrist down hard. ball should drop if thrown right about 4 feet (1.2 m).

, Put your fingers on the side with no holes put your index, middle, and ring knuckles on the ball.Throw towards the ground and snap your wrist. It floats like crazy!

, Put the holes on the bottom with your index, middle, ring, and pinky knuckles right above the median with your thumb on the center of the side with the holes. The batter will think the pitch will move, making him uncomfortable.

, Hold a normal Knuckleball (on the very inner edges/near the middle of the ball), but, put index and middle inside top two holes, the thumb, ring and pinky on the bottom 3 (should have at least 3 holes open, two on the left and 1 on the right for righties and vice versa for southpaws) and throw as hard and push the ball with the fingers. If successful, the ball should have little-to-no curve and have plenty of speed and drop to it! (play MLB Power Pros for PS2 or Wii and play until you have the Psychic Goggles or face Alvin in the College Kings World Series, where he has the similar, but, more powerful Star Shaker pitch, which acts like a Mirage Knuckle, only moves faster and is harder to hit/watch MLB Power Pros Success Mode videos to see how the Mirage Knuckle* works.

Note: The Mirage Knuckle is officially known as the Mirage Knuckler! Just be aware when Alvin uses it!







, Hold the ball with the holes facing which ever way you want. Stick your index finger in one of the holes. Not too far in the hole so it is completely stuck. Throw this pitch hard and let your finger come out when you release. It should be off speed. Slow, but should reach the plate after the batter swings.

, Hold the ball with all 5 fingers evenly spaced. Throw like a fastball, except step forward an extra 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm). It should appear as a sinker- except stay at the same height.

, When this one works it's sick. Hold the ball like you re making an ""okay"" sign with your hand. So your index and thumb are making a circle and your other fingers are away. Make the circle around the holes of the ball. It tends to curve to the left but it works.

, Face holes toward you and then put hour palm on the part with holes throw like a fastball it will be a little off-speed but don't throw it right over the plate throw it outside.

, Hold like a slider, but with three fingers. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist.

, Hold it with the holes to the left then hold like curve. Flick wrist like screwball. The ball will rise up to the left about 8 inches (20.3 cm) then have a 12 6 curving action to the right with a drop of about 4 feet (1.2 m). It is a deadly weapon invented by pro wiffle baller Jason Fargrovin from South Korea.

, Have the holes facing you and put the tips of your index, middle, and ring finger on the top three holes. Have your thumb and pinky on the bottom and almost cover the rest of the holes with your palm. Throw like a fastball put spin the ball by flicking your wrist left our right. It will look like a fastball but break a little bit and slow down.

, Hold the ball like you would a riser (holes down deliver sidearm). During delivery cut under the ball so it spins like a football with the holes forward. When successfully thrown it should rise and slow down in the middle of the pitch.

, Hold the ball with holes up, put mid finger on a space in between the holes and pointer finger on a hole throw overhand.

, Hold the ball with holes facing towards the batter and throw overhand spinning the ball as you throw.

, Hold the ball as you would a fastball and lob it so it just makes it a strike. Only throw when ahead in the count e.g. 0-1 0-2 1-2 or maybe a 1-1 or 2-2 but not anything else. And if they don't swing it's usually a ball.

, Put your pointer and your middle together and others below so holes are on the left side throw lightly it should curve way over to the left.

, Make a C with your thumb, and your middle/index fingers. Hold the ball so your fingers are on opposite sides of the ball. When throwing this pitch, throw it completely over the top and grip the ball very loosely. When you release the ball it's like you are almost not holding on to it. Exaggerate your follow through, (making sure you actually delivered the ball), and it should drop about 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m).

, Hold the ball between your thumb and palm with your fingers up. Experiment with how the holes go or how many fingers are up!

, This pitch moves a little but is hard to hit. With the holes all facing down, hold your index and middle fingers above the holes parallel to them. Throw sidearm.

, Hold the ball with the holes on the top. Put your index finger in the middle hole, and throw straight forward and down, and when you are about to release, flick your index finger down. It should break 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m).

, Hold almost like a slider but put thumb a little more up almost toward the trademark thing. Throw almost sidearm and it will do almost anything so it will always fool the batter. Best if used with 2 strikes.

, For righties, have the ball set as a screwball or slider, another way for lefties. Place your fingers like a riser, but your middle and index fingers curled up like a knuckle ball. Push off those 2 fingers and it should not move but it will curve.

, This pitch is very difficult to grip. The holes are facing to the right and your ring and pinkie fingers are bent like you were throwing a knuckle ball. Place your ring and pinkie finger going diagonally up the holes. When pitching to a right-handed batter, aim at him and when throwing, flick your wrist clockwise., Grip the pitch like you would a slider, but throw it like you would a riser. If thrown effectively, it will 'sweep' across the zone. This is useful for pitchers throwing to an opposite hand batter as it is an opposite curve."

Measure your upper arm.,
Measure your chest.,
Measure your waist.,
Measure your hips.,
Measure your upper thigh.,
Measure your calves.,
Measure your weight.,
Measure your height.,
Calculate your body fat or BMI.",How to Take Body Measurements2," Measure the circumference around the thickest part of your upper arm, usually at the bicep.

, Measure the circumference around your chest at its widest point. For most men this will be at the armpits, for most women this will be at the nipple line.

, Measure the circumference around your natural waist and your lower waist (two separate measurements). The natural waist is the smallest point of your waist (unlike where clothes’ waistlines are located these days) and is usually an inch or two above your bellybutton. Your lower waist is the widest part of your waist, usually at the bellybutton or just below, where weight is generally gained first.

, Measure the circumference around your hips at the widest point. This will usually be roughly just above the crotch line.

, Measure the circumference around your upper thigh at its widest point. This is usually ½ to 3/4’s of the way up your thigh, from the knee.

, Measure the circumference around your calf at its widest point, usually roughly ¾ of the way up from the ankle.

, For weight monitoring, you may include your body weight as a body measurement. This measurement will need to be taken with a scale, either electronic or manual. You can find scales for sale at many stores, or for use at gyms and doctor’s offices.

, The easiest way to measure your height is to stand straight with no shoes on and place your back against a wall. Using a pencil, place the pencil flat against the top of your head with the writing end against the wall. Carefully mark your height against the wall. Step away and measure from the mark down to the floor using any measuring tape.

, You may wish to use the above measurements to calculate your body fat or BMI if you are intending to monitor your weight loss. Be aware that body fat calculations are frequently inaccurate or unreliable, though BMI is a fairly accurate way of measuring your weight (unless you are a fit athlete, in which case better not).

Take the measurements listed above.,
Measure your shoulders.,
Measure your shoulder seam.,
Measure your sleeve length.,
Measure your jacket length.,
Measure your shoulder to waist length.,
Measure your shoulder to nipple length.,
Measure your upper bust.,
Measure your your under bust.,
Measure your pants length.,
Measure your inseam.,
Measure your cuff.,
Measure your front rise.,
Measure your back rise.",How to Take Body Measurements3," You will need many of the measurements listed above for tailoring and creating various items of clothing. Read above if your pattern or instructions call for those measurements.

, Measure the distance between the shoulder seams on an appropriately fitting shirt or jacket or the area you wish the shoulder seam to be. This measurement should be taken across the top of the back and be parallel with the floor.

, Measure the distance between the seam or desired seam of your collar and your shoulder.

, Measure the distance between your shoulder seam and your desired sleeve cuff. This measurement should be taken in a straight line along the outside or top of the arm with the arm held up (parallel with the floor).


This will help account for the fact that the cuff will move up the arm when the arm is extended, ensuring that your sleeve measurement is not too short.

, Measure the distance between the middle of the upper shoulder seam and the bottom hem or desired hem of the jacket. It may also be necessary to take a measurement from the back center of the collar seam down to the hem, if the collar seam is particularly high.

, Measure the distance between your shoulder seam where it meets with your collar and your natural waist, as described in the above section. This should align with the fullest part of your chest.

, Measure the distance between your shoulder seam where it meets with your collar and your nipple line. This should align with the fullest part of your chest.

, Measure the circumference around your upper bust by aligning the measure at the middle of your back, just below the bust line (it should at this point be parallel with the floor), and then closing the tape over the top of your breast. This should help measure breast fullness and rise.

, Measure the circumference around your under bust by aligning the measure at the middle of your back, just below the bust line (it should at this point be parallel with the floor), and closing the tap just under your breast. This should help measure your rib cage width.

, Measure the distance between the waist and the hem or desired hem of the pant. This should be taken in a straight line down the front center of the leg.

, Measure the distance between the crotch seam or desired crotch seam and the cuff or desired cuff of the pants, along the inside seam. This is considered a very personal measurement and tailors should generally respect your personal space and not get too close. If you are uncomfortable, tell them.

, Measure the circumference around your ankle and account for how loose you would prefer the cuff or alternatively measure the cuff of an existing pair of pants by taking the length from side seam to side seam along the hem.

, Measure the distance between the front center of the waist hem and the crotch seam. This is considered a very personal measurement and tailors should generally respect your personal space and not get too handsy. If you are uncomfortable, tell them.

, Measure the distance between the back center of the waist hem and the crotch seam. This is considered a very personal measurement and tailors should generally respect your personal space and not get too handsy. If you are uncomfortable, tell them.

Understand that there are many methods.,
Measure your under bust.,
Measure your bust size.,
Subtract your band size from your bust size.",How to Take Body Measurements4," Each company will use a slightly different method to calculate bra size. If you can find a measurement guide or sizing chart for your preferred bra manufacturer, use that. You can alternatively receive a free fitting, over your clothes, at most department and lingerie stores. The method described below is a good starting point for figuring out your bra size but you may need to experiment to find the best fit.


Keep in mind that bras may fit differently depending on their type. You may need a larger cup than normal, for example, with push-up bras. As with any clothing, it is also possible for bra sizes to run small or large as well.

, Measure your under bust using the method described in the clothing measurement section above. Add three inches to this measurement. If it is an even number then this is your band size. If it is an odd number, round down to the next even number to get your band size.

, Measure your bust at the nipple line as described in the monitoring weight section. The tape measure should just gentle touch you, not be pushing your breasts inward, and be parallel with the floor. If the resulting measurement is not a whole number, round up to the nearest full inch.

, This should give you a much smaller number (usually between 2-4). This number is used to calculate your cup size. Here is how the numbers correspond:


0-1/2 = AA
1/2-1 = A
2 = B
3 = C
4 = D
5 = DD
This measurement system tends to be inaccurate for larger cup sizes and the system for your preferred brand should be followed.

Maintain correct posture.,
Try a wrist stretch.,
Loosen your shoulders with seated cow pose.,
Do neck stretches.,
Use the sitting reed pose to align your spine.,
Encourage blood flow to your extremities with chair pose.,
Ease lower back pain with the sitting eagle pose.",How to Take a Yoga Break at Work1," Before you do any office yoga poses, especially those you can do seated in a chair, make sure you're sitting with good posture. Move to the edge of your chair so that your feet can rest flat on the floor.Generally you want to sit in a stable chair rather than a chair with wheels, if at all possible. If no non-wheeled chair is available, lock or block your wheels if you can so the chair won't roll.
Keep a neutral back and roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades are falling down your back in line with your spine.;
, The wrist stretch is particularly good for releasing tension if you have to type a lot at work. Doing wrist stretches periodically throughout the day can help reduce the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.Extend your arms in front of you so that your wrists are over your desk or table. Bend your hand upward so that your fingers reach upwards towards you. Try to flatten your palms as much as possible.
Hold the stretch, breathing deeply. Make sure your shoulders aren't hunched over and your shoulder blades are flowing down your back in line with your spine.
Repeat the stretch as needed, either relaxing and stretching several times. You can do this stretch periodically throughout the day whenever your wrists feel tight or tense.

, If you find you hold a lot of tension in your shoulders, the seated cow pose can help open them up. This is especially helpful if you have the tendency to hunch over your desk or computer.Lift one arm overhead and bend it at the elbow so that your hand drops behind your head. Reach your other arm up from behind and below until you can clasp the fingers of your top hand.
Pull until you feel a good stretch in your chest and shoulders. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, breathing deeply. Then release and repeat with the other side.

, Yogic neck stretches can provide a gentle counter-stretch for the muscles that often get contracted or tightened when you're hunched over a computer, or stressed out at work.You can do these stretches sitting or standing, so they are perfect for any office environment. If you're sitting, check your posture and make sure both feet are flat on the floor.
On an exhale, drop your head to the left. Inhale back to center, then exhale and drop your head to the right. You can reach your arm overhead and use it to gently push your head in the direction of the stretch. Use the arm below your head when you're stretching.

, The sitting reed pose gives your spine a good stretch and helps improve your posture, especially when you're seated at a desk all day. Start by moving to the edge of your chair so your feet are flat on the floor.Put your hands together in front of your chest with your fingers interlaced and breathe deeply for a few seconds to connect with your breath.
On an inhale, stretch your arms over your head and towards the ceiling, keeping your fingers interlaced. Keep your back neutral and your shoulders rolled back with your shoulder blades dropping down your back – don't hunch your shoulders up around your ears.
On an exhale, lean to the left until you feel a stretch. With the next inhale, rise back up to center, then lean to the right with the next exhale. Inhale back to center. Repeat for 10 to 20 breath cycles.

, When you're actually sitting in a chair, your leg muscles aren't active or engaged. Simulating sitting in a chair with chair pose releases tension and increases circulation to your lower body.Since this is a standing pose, you need to make sure you have enough space. This pose is appropriate in an open office environment, but if you work in a cubicle you might find you don't have enough room. Try to find an empty conference room.
Come to a standing pose and breathe deeply two or three times, or as long as it takes you to connect your mind with your breath. On an inhale, lift your arms overhead. As you exhale, bend your knees as if you are going to sit in a chair.
Ideally, you will lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor. However, you shouldn't go any more deeply into chair pose than you can without pain or discomfort.
Press your palms together in front of your chest and breathe deeply. Hold the pose for 8 to 10 slow breaths before returning to a standing position.

, The sitting eagle pose may be difficult for you if you have tight hips or significant lower back pain, but over time it can help ease the symptoms associated with sciatica and other lower back problems.Sit on the edge of your chair with your feet flat on the floor. Cross one leg over the other, bending your knee, so that your ankle is sitting on the opposite knee.
Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your hips and buttocks. If you can fold all the way forward so that your forehead rests on your leg, do so – but don't lean forward any further than you can without pain or discomfort.
Hold the pose for a few breath cycles, breathing deeply, then lower your leg and repeat on the other side.

, Obviously, you won't want to step in the shower if you have your clothing on. To save time, you can leave them on the floor and pick them up later.

, Once you're in the shower, it's recommended to shower with warm or slightly cold water. Hot water will convince you to take a longer shower, and you don't have time for that.

, You don't have time to clean everything, so focus on areas that you need cleaned.

, Pour some shampoo in your hand and lather your hair. To save time, you can leave the lathered shampoo in your hair, so you can rinse everything at once.

Try spinal rocking to ease stress in your lower back.,
Do legs up the chair to relax your nervous system.",How to Take a Yoga Break at Work2," You may remember easy pose from your childhood as ""criss cross applesauce"" – it's the same position. This position allows you to sit with good posture and breathe deeply, focusing on your breath and meditating briefly to relieve stress.If your office chair is not large enough to accommodate you in this position, you may have to sit on the floor. In some office environments you may not feel comfortable sitting on the floor. If the weather is accommodating enough, you might try going outside.
Make sure your spine is straight and neutral, your shoulders rolled back so that your shoulder blades are tucked into your back along the sides of your spine.
Breathe deeply, focusing on your breath. If your mind starts to wander, allow it to do so and gently guide it back to the breath. You may want to set a timer so you know when to come out of this state and don't stay here too long at work.

, The chest opener is a standing pose that will help you release tension in your chest and ease the symptoms of stress and anxiety by allowing you to breathe more fully.Stand with your weight evenly balanced through all four corners of your feet. Raise your arms overhead, then bend them at the elbow to let them drop behind your back. Clasp your hands together and breathe deeply.
Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together, hold for two or three deep breaths, then release. Repeat two to five times, focusing on opening your chest and breathing more deeply with each repetition.
If you feel weird standing up to do this pose in your office environment, you also can do it while sitting. Make sure you're sitting on the edge of your chair with good posture and both feet flat on the floor.

, Stress can cause lactic acid to build up in your shoulders, leading to pain and the feeling of tightness in your neck and shoulders. Shoulder rolls can help relieve this symptom of stress and tension.You can do shoulder rolls while standing or sitting. If you're sitting, make sure you've moved to the edge of your chair and are sitting with a straight back and both feet flat on the floor.
Rest your hands loosely on your shoulders, and draw circles with your elbows. Start small, and make the circles larger and larger to encourage more movement in your shoulders. Go clockwise and counter-clockwise, forward and backward, taking care to breathe deeply.

, Breathing exercises reduce stress with their rhythmic and meditative qualities. Given the nature of bee's breath, you may want to find some privacy, particularly if you work in an open office environment. Otherwise you risk distracting others (and you may get some stares).Take a comfortable seat and close your eyes. Reach your elbows out from your shoulders and cover your eyes with your bottom three fingers. Gently press the cartilage flap at the front of your ear into your ears with your thumb to cut off sound.
Breathe deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you exhale, create a buzzing sound deep in the back of your throat, keeping your lips closed. It may take some practice to get this sound right, but ultimately you want to sound like a bee.
Take three deep breaths with buzzing exhales, then bring your hands to the front of your chest, keeping your eyes closed, and rub them together until you feel heat. Place your warm fingers back on your eyes and take a few more deep breaths.

, Spinal rocking will only work if you have room to roll around on the floor (and feel comfortable doing so), but it can do wonders for lower back pain brought on by sitting in an office chair.If you work in a cubicle farm or an open office environment, it may not be appropriate for you to roll around on the floor. If you really want to do some spinal rocking, try to find a vacant private office or conference room, and maybe lay down a towel or yoga mat to protect your clothing.
Sit on the floor and hug your knees to your chest, keeping your feet flat on the floor. Breathe deeply to connect with your breath and lower your chin to your chest.
Drop to your back and rock or roll on your rounded spine, breathing deeply. You also can start this pose from your back, by drawing your knees up to your chest.

, If you're comfortable lying on the floor, this pose will improve your circulation and relax your nervous system to help relieve stress.You may want to spread out a towel or blanket on the floor to protect your clothing. If you work in an open office environment, tell your coworkers what you're doing – they may want to join in.
Lie on the floor in front of your chair, and lift your legs so that your calves are resting on the seat of your chair. You can stay in this position as long as you want, breathing deeply.

, A regular meditation practice outside of work can help improve your focus and concentration. However, even if you don't have a regular practice, a few minutes of meditation during the work day can help you become more productive at work.To take a meditation break at work, find a cool, quiet place where you can sit without being interrupted. If you don't have a private office, you might try an unused conference room, break room, or even a storage room.

You may want to set yourself an alarm so that you come out of the meditative state after five minutes or so.

, If you've got the space and more than a couple minutes to spare, flowing back and forth between the Warrior One and Warrior Two poses can greatly increase your focus at work.Step your right foot forward and walk your left foot back a little. Your right foot should be facing forward with your knee at a right angle directly over your ankle so your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Your left foot will face to the side, with your toes angled slightly in so that it looks a little pigeon-toed.
Drop your shoulders, imagining your shoulder blades melting down your back, and extend your arms over head towards the ceiling. Press your palms together over your head and breathe deeply. Then release and do the other side.
You also can open your arms out, extending them in front and behind you. Focus your eyes on the fingertips of your forward hand and breathe deeply. If you want to create a flow, move back and forth between these two poses with a breath for each movement.

Gather all needed materials and players (see Things You'll Need section below).,
Know that all players can play while riding a broom.,
Place the quaffle and two bludgers in the middle of the field.,
Start the game.,
Follow your duty depending what type of player you are:

Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops.,
Play the game!,
Feel free to alter the game rules.",How to Play Muggle Quidditch,";
, Brooms can be a hindrance however, so feel free to not use brooms.

, Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch.

, Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers.

, Each score is worth 10 points.






Beaters try to peg players with their bludger. If a player is pegged they have to stop what they're doing and pay a penalty; i.e. (drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds.






Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers' attempts at scoring. If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers.






Seekers try to tackle the snitch (a person) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag. You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch. A common way to play is to make the snitch a person, and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries. Then the seekers search for the snitch, and attempt to tag the player. Other methods, such as the method adopted in 2005, makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock, hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner. Regardless of method, the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team, unlike the books, in which the snitch is worth 150 points. The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch.






The snitch, generally a track runner, runs around (usually the boundaries) trying to evade the seekers.






The referee should ensure that rules are being followed. They also keep track of the score.







, The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch.

",How to Be a Great Pitcher," Look at their footwork and the way they throw the ball.;
, Whenever you have a chance to throw the ball around do it! It can be as simple as playing catch with a friend but remember to use the right mechanics.

, Lift weights or just do a light jog. I recommend 150 pushups and 100 sit ups a day. These both build strength and give your core a workout. Remember also to always stretch.

, Don't be like Joba Chamberlain who was a great prospect and always worked hard until he got to the pros. He thought ""Hey I'm in the pros! I don't need to work hard anymore, I'm playing for the Yankees!"" Well now he's about to get cut.

, Whenever you are doing anything that causes a strain on your muscles, always drink Gatorade or water.

, Before you go to bed every night, just practice going through the motions.

, Think of yourself pitching a perfect game or a no-hitter. Or just think about throwing strikes.

Change the side of the court for a new set.",How to Play Sepak Takraw," The court is rectangular and measures 13.4 meters by 6.1 meters, approximately the same size as a badminton court. The net is in the middle of the court and should be 1.52m high.A service circle should be drawn 3.05m from the back line and 2.45m from the sidelines. The radius of the service circle should be 0.3m.Each corner has a free zone just outside the marked off court measuring 3m by 3m. A quarter circle with a radius of 0.9m extends from the sides of the center line.


Get a Sepak Takraw ball, which should be spherical, about the size of a volleyball, and made from woven fiber.For women, the net should be 1.42m high.;
, Sepak Takraw is played with two teams, called Regu and Mississauga. Each Regu has 5 total players - 3 players on the court and 2 substitutes.The server, also known as Tekong, stands in the center of the court. The Tekong serves the ball over the net. The goal is to serve it so it's hard for the other team to defend.
The left inside, also known as the Feeder, stands on the left front of the court. The Feeder has the most control over the ball during the game. They set the ball based on the Striker. They can spike the ball, and toss so the striker can strike. These players are usually very agile and responsive.The right inside, also known as the Striker or Killer, stands on the right front of the court. The goal of the Striker is to place the ball in the other team's court. They also block spikes from the other team., When playing the Regu format, a match consists of 3 sets. A match is won when a team wins 2 sets. Each set is played to 21 points.


If a team doesn't win 2 sets in a row, the third set, called the ""Tie-break,"" only has 15 points.
If the match is tied at 20-20, the winner is the first team to be ahead by 2 points, up to 25 points. For the Tie-break match, if the match is 14-14, the first time ahead by 2 points, up to 17 points, wins., In Sepak Takraw, you can't touch the ball with your hands or arms. That means you have to use your feet, legs, and knees to control the ball. Although it takes a bit of agility and athleticism, there are some basic moves you can learn.

, The inside kick is probably the most important skill to learn because it's the one you'll use the most. This is used to control the ball. You can also use this kick for good spikes.


For this kick, stand with feet shoulder width apart with your support leg bent at the knee. Hit the ball with the inside of your dominant foot. Practice working with both feet to get more agility and flexibility in your kicks.When the ball comes towards you, lift the inside of your foot to connect with the ball.
To practice this kick, dribble the ball by kicking it up with the inside of your foot. Use a different foot each time the ball comes down.A variation of this kick uses the outside of the foot. When the ball comes at you and you can't get into position to use the inside of your foot, use the outside of it instead.

, The toe kick is used to save the ball, not control it. Extend your leg. Let the ball bounce on your toe or raise your leg if the ball is higher. This should be executed slowly and without power.This is used when receiving the ball.


When the ball comes to you from a low angle, bounce the ball off the top of your foot., The header is another pivotal skill for the game. This ""kick"" uses the head, preferably your forehead at your hair. This is used when the ball comes at you above the waist. You will probably have to bend down to get underneath the ball.


Practice getting used to the feeling of the ball against your head because it can hurt. This is used in both serving and striking.

, This kick is used when receiving the ball. The knee/thigh kick deflects the ball when it's coming towards you between your waist and knees. By hitting the ball with your thigh or knee, you reposition the ball so you can use an inside kick. It is also used when the ball gets too close to your body.


A knee and thigh kick is like a march step with a high knee. Using your thigh instead of your knee gives you better control. This is usually used with players who receive a serve. This kick should be be practiced with the inside kick.

, Striking or spiking the ball sends it over the net. There are different ways to achieve this.


Strike with the bottom of your foot. After bouncing the ball into the air, kick your leg up into the air to about head height. Then strike the ball with the bottom of your foot.Use the inner foot to strike the ball. After bouncing the ball high enough in the air, round your leg about shoulder height and hit the ball with the inside of your foot.Use the top of your foot to perform a back kick if you are in a position where you can't face the net. Kick your leg about shoulder height, making sure the top of your foot connects with the ball.For more power, do a combined kick. Start by kicking up the knee on your non-striking foot, then when that foot hits the ground, use that power to kick off the ground for a harder, faster strike.
Use your head to strike by hitting the ball with your head. Make sure to lean forward to send the ball over the net instead of into the air., You can use any body part except the arms and hands when playing sepak takraw. You can use the chest and shoulders to bounce the ball off when trying to get it into proper play position.


Try not to receive serves or strikes with the chest and shoulders.

, The teams captains call it. Whoever calls correctly gets to choose to go first (called ""choosing service"") or choose the side they wish to be on (called ""choosing side"")., The designated team serves first. At the start of the match, the Feeder and the Striker stand in the quarter circle on their side of the court while the Tekong stands with one foot inside the serving circle.Either the Feeder or the Striker tosses the ball to the Tekong to start the match. He then kicks the ball up and over the net with the foot not in the serving circle.The other team can be anywhere in their court.
The serving team gets a point if the ball touches the net and lands in the court. The team continues to serve each time they are awarded a point.After the initial serve, all players are free to move around the court.

, To respond to the serve, the defensive team will try to get the ball over the net within 3 touches of the ball. The Tekong and the Feeder both move around the court to pass the ball to the striker with 1-2 touches. The striker will use the final third touch to send the ball over the net.


Players can have more than one touch., As play continues, the team cannot use their hands or arms. Each team has 3 touches to send the ball back over the net.


Play continues until a team makes a fault. This occurs when the team doesn't return the ball over the net within 3 touches, when the ball is not kicked before it hits the ground, the net stops it from going to the other side of the court, or it lands out of bounds. If a fault is made, the other team scores.
When a team wins a point, they get the next serve.

, After one team gets to 21 (or 25) points, the set is over. To start a new set, the teams change sides of the court. The team that lost the previous set serves. When a team wins two sets, a new match is started.

,
When you tackle someone, they become a Raptor, and help you hunt down everyone else. But, if they prey tackles him, he is back on their team. The original Raptor however will always be a Raptor.

, Once the Raptor has everyone on his team, or everyone has been killed, the game is over.

, If you want to play again, then the last person who was captured or killed is the new Raptor, and the game starts all over.

",How to Play Triball," One tennis ball in a tied sock or equivalent to (The Sly) also you must have, 3 hoops and 6-10 people to play with. Also an extra person to be a referee/sly holder,as this job is essential!;
, The round ends once a runner has scored with the main. This means that if someone scores with the sly. The round has not yet ended.

, The main is placed in the centre hoop and the offenders around 10 meters (don't be exact!) from the centre on each side. Also set out some goal lines around a meter or two from the goal hoops.

,,, Variants are acceptable (e.g. 3 a-side triball)

, The catchers job is to focus on the sly ball (explained later) and the runners job is to focus on the main.

, This will score that team five points, which means it would take 30 goals to win the game this way.

,, The sly enters the field every five rounds, until that round both catchers are runners.

, Once it is picked up NO ONE CAN TACKLE ANOTHER CATCHER OTHER THEN THE OPPOSING CATCHER. Each catcher can use an offender ball to make the other one drop the sly, they can also tackle each other.

, If you are issued a foul then it is a free throw to the opposing team.

,, If someone IS NOT holding the main, you can only push them, but when someone IS you can do full tackle rules.

, It is a free throw from behind the goal line.

The aim of the game chuck ball is to drop the ball to the ground of the circle court without your opponent getting possession of the ball;
,
Learn how to shoot.,
Try to score.,
Don't throw it out.,
Start of the game, penalty, foul, beginning of rally/ point.,
Play Doubles.,
To play Elimination, the same as doubles except if it's your turn to get the ball and you don't get it your out.,
Try playing court.,
Try Chaos.",How to Play Chuck Ball,", Shooting, is simple to throw the ball you must have the ball face up in your hand. The ball must be thrown over head height otherwise it's a foul. To throw the ball you don't have to have it in both hands you can use the palm of your hand of a closed fist anything. If you're laying on the floor, you must extend your arms all the way up to throw the ball. If you're on your knees, then you should throw it a bit above your head height.

, Scoring every time your opponent does not get to the ball in time and the ball hits the floor you are awarded 1 point to a preset number usually 2 sets of 21 if it continues to be a draw then go to penalties.

, If you throw the ball out of the ring or the last person to touch the ball (that is if it's a legal throw) a point is awarded to the other player. If you catch the ball and you slide out of the circle court it is OK as long a tiny bit of your body still in the court. Hitting the ball on the line does count as in.

, To start you flip a coin the winner of the coin flip is in the center of the circle court. The loser of the flip has there feet touching the circle but the rest of his body out of the court (laying down) they must throw the ball. As soon as he does he can get up the person can then throw it anywhere in the circle. Alternating. If it's a penalty from a foul then the fouler is the one laying down. If this is the start of the game or the start of a point you cannot win.

, To play doubles or triples its the same rules but you must have an order so you always throw to the same player once the point is over alternate so you throw now only to the other player. During the start, penalty or foul two players must be anywhere outside the circle until the person laying down has the ball.


For Uneven numbers, You go around in a pattern until someone says at the end a point switch and then the order reverses. Penalty, foul, beginning of game and point you do it normally with the extra player out on the side.







, Last team to have players left wins.

, This game has no preset court; it can be square, circle (usually it's a circle), oval. Just make it the correct size fitted for who you playing with and have fun!

, Same rules as doubles but no set person to throw to just anyone on the other team.

Thinking of all the things you will need for game day will reduce stress so that you can keep your mind on the game. Write down the date of the tournament, equipment you will need, your meal plan, and training schedule. Free your mind so you can visualize that winning move.Important information includes information about transportation, food, drink, and what will happen in an emergency.
Bring a notebook with you to practice. Then you can write down important notes right away.;
, It is a good idea to make sure that you have the equipment, uniform, and shoes needed. If you find that some of the equipment is old or missing, go ahead and buy new equipment, a water bottle, etc. This is one less thing you have to stress about as it gets closer to game day.Check that the equipment is up to standard. There is nothing worse than turning up on game day and finding your equipment is broken.

, No, this doesn’t mean to sit back with a bag of chips and your favorite show. It’s important to keep your mind and body in great shape, but don’t overdo it. Taper the intensity of your training about two weeks before the tournament. This reduces the chance of injury and ensures that you’re well rested for the big day.You may not have a say in how much training you do if you train with a team. In this case, cut down the training you do on your own time.

, It’s hard to argue with the idea of getting more sleep. Try to increase the amount of sleep you get to 10 hours. Sorry, but this may mean cutting back on late night binge watching and video games. It will be worth it though. Get extra sleep and stick to that schedule so you guaranteed to be well rested when it comes to game day.Keep a sleep diary to manage your sleep habits. There are also smartphone apps that help with this.

, Getting enough water is really important—especially for an athlete like yourself. Staying hydrated is important when you’re training and sweating a lot. Try to drink 1.5 or more liters of water a day. Keep a water bottle with you at all times to make staying hydrated easy.Mix your water with fruit to give it some taste if you’re usually not a fan of drinking water.
Sodas are a guilty pleasure, but you should stay away from them. They don’t do much for hydration.

, Do this about one week before the tournament. This doesn’t mean skipping meals or hardly eating anything at all. Slightly reducing the size of your meals will prevent weight gain that may happen because of lower intensity training. Unfortunately, that means no large pizzas, cheesy bread, soda, and ice cream for dinner tonight. That can be a reward for after the tournament!, Okay, now it’s getting close to the big game! You may be feeling some anxiety, but you can reduce that by having everything prepared. Make a list of everything you will need. Go ahead and pack your bag. Pack your equipment, uniform, towels, and anything you will need for the tournament. Check items off of the list as you go.Put the bag by the door or in an obvious place so that you don’t walk out without it in your excitement to play the game.

, Let your body know that it’s about to do some hard work. Eat a meal that’s high in carbs and protein. This will boost your glycogen levels. A great meal to have would be pasta and salmon. It’s yummy and beneficial!, This is a great excuse to kick back earlier than usual. Try to have your dinner a little earlier than usual. It may be difficult, but turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone as early as possible. Use this time to meditate on the game or read a good book.Stop drinking caffeine around 12 p.m.

, Try to avoid letting anxious, negative thoughts enter your mind. It’s normal to have them, but focus on the positive. Go through the game play in your mind. Imagine the moment that you win. Play this over and over in your mind until success seems like the only reasonable outcome., A breakfast that is rich in carbs is ideal. This will give you a vital energy boost and prevent you from going hungry later in the day. A donut is a carb, but you can do better than that. Avoid a lot of sugar and high fat proteins. Cereal, milk, and a banana would be a good option., You don’t want to show up to the tournament with a growling stomach and realize you don’t have anything to eat. Pack something like a sandwich and fruit for lunch. For a snack, things like nuts, bananas, granola bars, and dried fruit are ideal. Keep snacking up until right before the tournament, but don’t get too full. All of this food and drink will keep you energized during the tournament, and will help you play the best you can.Make sure to bring a refillable water bottle.

, Nap for about two hours before you leave for the tournament, and make sure to set an alarm. You definitely don’t want to wake up and realize the tournament has already passed. A nap time of about 20 minutes would be ideal, though you can adjust the time to your liking. A short nap will give you an extra energy and performance while you play., Accidents and traffic are impossible to control, but it would be a good idea to do everything you can to prevent showing up late. Map the location of the tournament before you leave. It wouldn’t hurt to plan a few alternative routes as well. Leave for the tournament with so much time to spare that not even a fallen tree, traffic accident, or stop for gas could make you late., Being nervous will only hinder your performance, even if it is normal and expected. Take a moment to step aside and sit back. Reflect on all of the hard work that led you to this moment. Close your eyes and meditate. When your thoughts have steadied, get up and get prepared to win this game., Your mind might be racing before the game—thinking of past and future games. Resist the temptation to dwell on anything except the present moment. Don’t think about what this tournament means for your future in the sport. Just think about how you can be the best you can be. It’s okay if your mind drifts. Recognize you’re doing it and refocus., You shouldn’t overdo it, but it is important that your body is prepared for what its about to endure. Run a few laps. Stretch your muscles out. Do whatever you have to do for your particular sport. Then all that’s left to do is have fun."

Corner kicks.,
Overall game plan.",How to Play As a Futsal Goalkeeper," It's wise nowadays in futsal to wear protective padding as a goalkeeper, as quite often a save will require you to dive onto the hard ground. Knee pads, arm pads and some long pants will reduce the risk of injury, letting you play to the best of your ability.;
, When playing as a futsal goalkeeper you are required to protect a goal roughly 8 feet (2.4 m) wide by 6 1⁄2 feet (2.0 m) high. When positioning yourself you should always be careful of how much of the goal you are covering or not.

, When the opposition performs a breakaway there are 2 main ways to block the shot, the 1st way implies the strikers are running through onto a throughball, when this happens its best to surprise them. A fast full paced sprint to intercept or kick the ball away will surprise your opponent forcing them to shoot if they can. The 2nd way implies a pass direct to the striker leaving it between you and your opponent to battle. With this style its best to be crouched down a little with your '5 hole closed' to prevent a shot. its best to come out far enough to be able to block the goal with your feet if a low shot is taken while still being able to watch for a chip and parry/catch it.

, If the opportunity presents itself the opposing team might be awarded a penalty. Penalties are quite intense due to the distance between you and the taker being quite small. As with most goalkeeping penalty tactics, it's best to make yourself as big as possible. Unless you definitely know where the shot will be try to stay in the center as long as possible as most goalies can touch side to side without moving much in their goal.

, Free kicks are quite dangerous as they can be right up quite close to your circle. The advantage of penalties is that free kicks allow your team to have a wall. I find its best to have a 2 person wall with a dead on free kick and a 1 person wall with a side on. The remaining players should position themselves goalside of the attackers to prevent a lay off shot.

, Corner kicks can be deadly as a quick fast paced ball into the middle can leave you stranded to make the save. However when positioning yourself its best to take charge. I find its best to be at the front post while being crouched down a little with your foot on the post to prevent a low shot on the post or a diving save to prevent a low cross in the middle. With airborne crosses that require a header shot its best to punch the ball away in mid air before anyone can touch it.

, Depending on the rest of your teams capabilities, you can push forward out of your box to take side kicks and in some cases half-field shots. Of course if you do partake in this there is a chance of an intercepted ball enabling a shot on your goal while you're halfway up the field.

Be sure to offer an immediate water break.,
After practice, gather everyone and let them know what they need to work on and how they can improve at home.,
Give out any handouts.,
Wait for everyone to get a ride home.,
Shoot out an after-game email.",How to Plan a Coaching Session for Soccer," This is a list that usually consists of the following: each player's name, age or date of birth, uniform size, if they have played on a team before, preferred position, name and phone numbers of parents/guardians (if they are younger than 18).;
, You may need to ask your league's soccer commissioner for this information, check the league's website, or contact another coach responsible for the same age group as you. This information is crucial when planning the difficulty and frequency of practices.

, Some leagues do this for you. Contact other coaches who coach at the same level and age group as you to ask how often their teams practice if you're unsure.


At some point you should be able to decide this based on your own understanding of the mechanics of your players and when they need practice versus when they need breaks.
Try to maintain at least two soccer practices per week. High level teams with older players sometimes increase this to four or even five practices. It is your decision how often and long you should hold practices. It is important to manage this with when the soccer fields are free.

, You may have to contact the league commissioner for this, however all leagues are different. Sometimes you have to contact a county run office, for example the county recreation department office. Generally a league commissioner will have notified you how to do this when you signed up for coaching for their league.

, Having some form of online presence is greatly encouraged as it gives players a way to contact each other if other methods fail. Post upcoming games, practices, as well as the entire soccer schedule and be sure to add reminders for their upcoming games.

, Most coaches find that the best way to notify players is through group email. That said, some coaches find that calling each player works best.

, For older players this is probably pretty self-explanatory, however new players need to understand what to bring and wear.


They need to be equipped with cleats, long socks over shinguards, and bottled water. It is up to you to decide if they need anything else after preparing a full practice plan.
You can post this information on the internet, and/or explain it in the email, text, or phone call.

, This also depends on the practice you choose to drill, however there are some basic things every coach tends to bring.


Remember to bring soccer balls, cones, several full water bottles, coloured bibs, clipboard with practice plan as well as roster, paper, pencil/pen and any handouts you choose to give players or parents.
Sometimes a drill may require a 'ladder', a flat ladder-shaped agility obstacle. If you choose to bring this, try to keep it untangled.
In addition, mini soccer goals are occasionally provided by coaches when training on a field without them. If you decide to purchase some, look for some that wrap and compress easily.

, For first time soccer practices, it can be important to prepare a handout with league rules for games and general behavior. Also include your own rules for practice, your phone numbers, telephone number of your supervisor and the number to call to see if games have been cancelled. Also consider adding information about contacting you to get more involved both as players and parents.


Encouraging activities such as carpooling, after-game dinners, and possibly even snacks (for younger age groups) will both encourage players to get more involved as well as bring your team closer together. The closer your team is, the more likely you are to see good teamwork on the field.

, It is important to have a clear understanding of your teams weaknesses and faults before planning a large practice. Many leagues have a tryout date at which you can observe and take notes on players' abilities. If not, consider having your next practice be purely for evaluation purposes and have them do some very clean cut and stark drills (i.e. running sprints, long distance, and basic drills).

, Depending on how you coach and their ages, you may not need to assign specific positions. At an early age, a player should be more focused on developing their skill everywhere rather than one specific position.


That said, with older teams it is important to pick out one or two goalkeepers. These players need to be dedicated and hard working. Some coaches choose to bring in specialists or assistant coaches to coach them separately, but bring them back in occasionally for scrimmages and exercises to keep the flow of teamwork.

, Keep players hydrated, it's important to keep them playing at their best.

, This is usually a pulse raiser, or a drill specifically designed to gradually increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles. This can be as simple as running laps, or you could include a small circuit of exercises. Try to limit this to a simple 5-10 minutes.


For youth teams, fun activities such as stuck in the mud are good.

, This stretches out joints and can make exercise more comfortable. Stretches such as lunges, side steps, high kicks and windmill arms are great for this. That said, your pre-practice stretches shouldn't consume too much time.

, This gets the body back into soccer mode and your muscles get to remember how to perform the basics again. Make the players do some exercises such as these:


Short and long passing in pairs or small groups.
Quick shooting practice.
Again, for youth teams this could be made into a game. For example, seeing which pair can make the most passes or hit the target the most in a certain time period.

, This should raise the players' heart rate to 60-80% of their maximum heart rate. This helps to develop their cardiovascular endurance. Fitness needs to be constantly maintained so that players are at match fitness throughout the season.


Fartlek training is possibly the best training method for soccer. The mixture of intensities and terrain simulates match situations.

, If you want to go through set pieces, new tactics or just maintain the team's skill level, this is the part of the session to do it in.

, This gives the players a chance to put any new skills or tactics they have learned into practice and helps develop muscle memory. If the players are tired and weary, let them rest before playing the game. Adding a game is optional.

, This gradually returns the body to its normal state and disperses excess lactic acid, reducing stiffness and muscle soreness. This is often consists of a light jog around the pitch, then slowing into a walk before sitting down with straight, stretched legs.

, This helps stretch out your joints and is good for relieving stress after a hard session.

, After practice is when everyone should be quiet, refueling, and listening to you. Lots of coaches use this time as an opportunity to review practice and remind players what to do outside practice.

, It's important to remind them to stretch, practice and stay active in general. Never ridicule specific players, but feel free to compliment any players you think did exceptionally well, or the ones who could use some encouragement. It's important to switch up the players you call out to avoid a teacher's pet situation.

, It's important to have some handouts ready for players and/or parents to let them know what happens next. Be sure to announce the next practice time and offer yourself to answer anybody's questions or concerns.

, This is simple coaching etiquette and simply shows you care. For lower age groups, it's also a safety matter. Wait for your players to either get home by themselves or have their parents take them home.

, Phone calls and SMS may be a little bit heavy handed for this, but it's good to let players know what they need to work on once again in an email and on your team's online presence.


If you've got the time, shooting emails out to individual players is a good idea, too. Remember, however, anything you email a player can be shared with other players. The goal is to provide an open and positive community within your team.

Repair toe cracks.,
Repair cracks in the face or edge.,
Reattach the handle.,
Replace the rubber handle.,
Keep the bat dry and cool.,
Replace the anti-scuff sheet.",How to Repair a Cricket Bat," Most cricket bat cracks can be repaired with glue and repair tape or twine, plus some sandpaper and oil. First of all, locate the crack and fill it completely with glue, such as wood glue or superglue.Remove any excess glue and allow it to dry for 12 to 24 hours. After that:


Sand the area down with a sandpaper between 100 and 220.Oil the repaired area with raw linseed oil
Bind the area with bat tape or twine. If you use twine, soak the twine with glue as you wrap the bat.;
, To repair these types of cracks, follow the same initial steps as you would for toe cracks. Once you have filled the crack with glue, cover the bat with two pieces of wood (one on either side) and clamp it in place while the glue dries.Once the glue has dried, follow the same steps for sanding, oiling, and taping.
If you don’t have a clamp to use, cut up strips from an old bat grip and use those as elastics to clamp the bat as the glue dries., Sometimes the handle on a cricket bat can fall out of the body, and this can be reattached with glue. Cover the handle with wood glue and reinsert it into the body of the bat.


Use a rubber mallet to tap the handle into place. Remove any excess glue.
Tape or clamp the bat to hold the handle firmly in place and allow the glue to cure for at least 48 hours.
For added support, insert wood screws into the body and through the handle to keep the handle in place.

, As soon as you notice wear or cracking on the rubber handle, replace it right away. After you gently roll the new grip on, tape it with bat tape.

, Store your bat somewhere that’s not too hot and never wet or damp.Never store your bat in a hot car or any other hot area, as it can warp the wood. If the bat ever gets wet, dry it with a cloth and store it somewhere cool to dry. When it has dried, apply a thin layer of oil.

, At the end of each season, remove the anti-scuff sheet. Apply a layer of oil and let it sit for 24 hours. Then, apply a second coat of oil and let it rest for a week. Sand it down and repeat the oiling process. Apply a new ant-scuff sheet."

Scan a standard box score.,
View the team's lineup.,
Scan the more-detailed fielding and batting information under the offensive table.",How to Read Baseball Statistics1," Box scores are statistical representations of how players performed in specific games and you can find them in the Sports section of a newspaper or on a sports website. Standard box scores list, in a table format, 4 offensive statistics and 6 pitching categories.

, The entire lineup is listed in the offensive, or batting, section of the box score. Players are listed in batting order with the positions they played during the game following their names. Substitutes' names are indented in the box score and are listed under the player they replaced. The 4 categories listed in the offensive table are:

AB: at-bats






R: runs scored






H: base hits






RBI: runs batted in







, Individual accomplishments are singled out in this section. For example, if a player named Smith hit his 6th home run of the season, the box score would read, HR: Smith (6). Other statistical categories in this section of the box score would include:


E: errors, LOB: left on base (team statistic), and DP: double plays (team statistic).
2B: doubles, 3B: triples, and HR: home runs (with season total).
SB: stolen bases, SF: sacrifice flies, and S: sacrifices.

",How to Play Matball," This game really requires more than about 10 people to play per team, that's why its commonly played at schools.;
, A level floor playing surface is adequate enough, however, more often this game is played in a large gymnasium or other large open area where it is deemed acceptable to play a game similar to kickball.

, Although you can use whatever ""base"" you'd like to use,as long as it's large enough for all the players to stand on the bases at the same time. The bases themselves tend to be gymnasium mats (thereby the reason why this game is called Matball).

, Crossing that imaginary line makes the kicking player automatically safe. Most often times, this imaginary line is centered at the direct center of the area of the gymnasium floor - all so that the kicking player can have room to take action on the ball when it arrives.

,, The kicker can either kick the ball and begin running the bases, or they let it slide past and into whatever is behind them. However, the outcome of missing this ball can be deemed to be either an out or just a miss, but must be based solely on the umpire or other officials officiating the game.

, They can either run to the right (much like the current game of baseball) or towards the left and run from base to base until they reach home.

, You can have many players on one single mat.


Sometimes, game officials give the teams an ultimatum when they reach base, in hopes that they are not called ""out"" at any time (outs are discussed a little later). They can continue running in hopes not to get stopped by any one baseball fielder near the mat, or they can stop and safely rest on the mat.
Recognize what should happen in the case the player oversteps a base (even by just one foot). Most often times the game official gives players the opportunity to lead with their one lead foot, however, they must not come off the base or they can be thrown out to be considered ""out"". Most often times, once you leave a base, you can't return again to that same base.

, Games vary from location to location and include (but are not limited to) these two universally-accepted rules.


If the ball is kicked behind home plate, it is considered to be a foul ball.
If the ball hits the ceiling of the location traveling forward, it is either a foul or out (dependent on location rules).

, An out for a player is recorded when either the player has swung their leg and missed on several attempted kicks or when they swing and kick but the fielder catches with their hands, when the running player gets tagged while running the bases or during an altercation in the game that causes the out.

, If the location's doors are open in front of home plate and the ball heads out the doors, some places consider the ball to be live at all times until the fielding team retrieves it, or it may be considered a home run. Sometimes if the game is played indoors inside a gymnasium and there are basketball hoops that have been raised and the ball travels into or through the baskets, it's an automatic home run, but that's only a general advisement and not a required idea to determine.


Recognize that there are more scenarios than what are posed here, but vary widely upon each individual situation the location encounters.

,, Sometimes, interference can be called in the field when some members of the fielding team are playing their position in or near the basepath and/or to a certain extent so that the running player must collide with them to get to their next base. If this error is recorded, the player can safely be marked as safe on the next base, and the player who committed the error must sit out until the next inning or till the end of the game and can't be up to bat unless these players are elementary school age and are just learning the game.

,, Sometimes, as long as theirs a ball in play and their is a runner on a base (or is running the bases) these teammates can continue running the bases. However, if you want, you can tell the teams that they have to stop after (x) amount of runs.

, After several outs have been recorded by the kicking team, the side is out. If all players reach base without leaving any other players behind, you may end up waiting for someone to make a mistake and have all players leave their bases, but that won't happen very often.

, Repeat this play after the two teams switch places (the kicking teams becomes the fielding team and the fielding team becomes the kicking team).

, The team at the end of a few rounds or the one to record the most runs will win and the game will be over.

Browse pitching statistics.,
Survey in-depth pitching data.,
Examine season statistics.,
Investigate other statistical applications.",How to Read Baseball Statistics2," Pitchers are listed in the order they appeared in the game. If a pitcher earned a decision in the game--win, loss or save-�it is shown after his name as either W, L or S. The symbol is accompanied by his current win-loss record or the number of saves he has earned to date. The 6 categories listed in the pitching table are:

IP: Innings pitched: this can involve a decimal figure of either .1 or .2, representing part of an inning. For example, a starting pitcher completed 6 full innings and retired one batter in the 7th. His IP figure would be 6.1.



 


H: hits allowed






R: runs allowed






ER: earned runs allowed






BB: walks allowed






K: strikeouts





;
, Under the pitching table is a list of additional pitching statistics. They can include:

WP: wild pitches, BK: balks, HBP: hit batsmen, and PB: passed balls (catcher's statistic).







, Season statistics include all of the categories listed in box scores, and also other important data. Some of the most notable are:

OBP: To find a player's on-base percentage, or OBP, add his hits, walks and hit-by-pitch totals and divide that sum by the combined total of his at-bats, walks, hit-by-pitch and sacrifice flies. (H+BB+HBP/AB+BB+HBP+SF)






Slg.: To find a player's slugging percentage, divide his total bases by his at-bats. Total bases are the sum of the player's home runs x 4, triples x 3, doubles x 2, and singles.






Avg.: Divide the number of hits by the number of at-bats to compute Avg., which is the player's the batting average.






ERA: Earned-run average, or ERA represents a pitcher's overall effectiveness per 9 innings. To find an ERA, divide the pitcher's earned runs by his innings pitched, and multiply the quotient by 9.







, In recent decades, various methods of statistical analysis in baseball have surfaced. Few have revolutionized the process of evaluating baseball talent like Sabermetrics. While many of Sabermetrics' tenets have gained widespread acceptance among fans and analysts, the two below stand out.


OPS: On Base + Slugging. Sabermetrics creator Bill James sought a simple, defining statistic that would gauge a player's ability to produce runs. After compiling OPS figures on hundreds of players over many years, its effectiveness in determining a player's value to his team was continually supported. The Major League average for OPS is 0.728. A superstar has an OPS of 0.900.
Pitching analysis: Using a variety of complex computations, Sabermetrics devised ground-breaking methods to examine pitchers. With nomenclatures as unusual as their formulas, BABIP, dERA and DIPS measure pitching effectiveness while removing the effects of luck and defense, and incorporating the effect of the ballpark.

"
"
Add walks and hits given up by the pitcher in his outing.

,
Divide the above total by the total number of innings pitched.",How to Read Baseball Statistics3,", For example:


Kershaw walks none and gives up one hit over 7 innings, 1/7 = 0.143 WHIP. If that hit was a home run, his ERA would be 1.28. But it if was just a hit, his ERA would be 0.00 which doesn't fully dictate what happened. To better show the difference, say he scatters 3 walks and 4 hits, but no runs. His ERA is still 0.00, but now his whip has jumped to 1.00. You can take that two ways, either he gets out of trouble, or he's gotten lucky to avoid giving up runs.

Clean your glove after use.,
Apply a little leather cleaner.,
Dry off the glove.,
Keep your oil use limited.,
Avoid products not approved for leather.,
Use cool, dry air on your glove.,
Keep it out of the microwave.",How to Oil a Baseball Glove," Baseball gloves are made of leather, so you’ll want oils and products that are specifically made for leather. The glove manufacturer will probably offer recommendations for oils and conditioners that will work well with their product, which you should be able to purchase at a sporting goods store.Some other common materials that are useful for breaking in the glove include baby oil, petroleum jelly, shaving cream, and saddle soap.;
, Put a little bit of oil into the pocket, the areas between your thumb and forefinger where you catch balls, and rub it in so that you get a light coating. Make sure there are no globs of oil or other liquids left.








If you don’t want to just use your hands, a soft, clean cloth is a good idea. Put a small amount into a clean dish towel, and rub that into the glove., Let the glove sit overnight in order for the oil to fully soak into the leather. Make sure it stays in a cool, dry place. The next morning, wipe the glove dry to remove any remaining oil., This is the last step to breaking in a glove. The best way to do this is by playing catch for a few minutes every day for a few weeks. This will help make the glove form better to your hand, and give you the comfort you want while playing.There are a few other popular methods for making a pocket. Place a baseball or softball into the pocket and tie the glove shut, repeating that process every night after giving it some use. Alternatively, use a hammer to pound the pocket in.

, Once you are done for the day, either in a game or just playing catch, wipe down the glove with a clean rag. Get rid of any dirt or debris on it, and store in a cool, dry place daily., To give your glove a better clean, put a little bit of cleaner on a damp cloth or sponge. Make sure you wipe the entire glove with the cleaner. This includes parts other than the pocket, including the laces and webbing.








Make sure you use the right kinds of leather cleaners. Look for designated baseball glove leather cleaners, or products recommended by the manufacturer. Avoid oil conditioners like linseed oil, mink oil, neatsfoot oil, silicon, or petroleum-based products.
Keep your application light. Too much cleaner, or applying it too often, will cause the leather to break down faster.
You probably want to do this once a year to help keep your glove lasting for a long time.

, Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe off any remaining oil. Then let your glove air dry overnight. Make sure you find a cool, dry place for your glove to sit, which means not in your gym or bat bag.








The leather will be a bit stiff after drying, but some regular use should soften it up again quickly.

, You want to make sure you don’t overdo it when you apply cleaner. Make sure you don’t soak the leather. Too much will make it deteriorate faster, the opposite of what you want., Remember that your glove is made of leather, a specific kind of material. Not all oils are good on leather, and because it is a common material, they will usually say so on the label. Using these oils will break down the material and cause your glove to deteriorate faster., Keep your glove in a cool, dry place when you are done oiling. Do not use a blow dryer, furnace, or dryer to dry it off. The extra heat will damage the glove, especially since you’ll be letting it sit overnight and not carefully watching it., Cooking your glove in a microwave is a good way to dry out the leather, making the laces brittle and more likely to break. You can also start a fire if you aren’t watching carefully. Some gloves have metal parts in them as well, which create sparks that will catch fire and damage your microwave.This goes for other heating methods like ovens or your car. While your glove probably won’t catch fire sitting on the dashboard, it will still dry out and become brittle.

Have someone throw tennis balls at you while you are in your batting stance.,
Step into the batter's box expecting to hit the ball.,
If the pitch is coming at your body, the best way to avoid getting injured is to follow this method:
Turn your back and head away from the pitcher and face the backstop.,
Try to take the ball in slowly by almost sliding farther back toward the catcher and the take the hit softly so it won't hurt as much or leave a bruise.,
If you don't have enough time to get out of the way, simply turn your back to the pitcher and let the ball hit you in the back or the butt.,
View being hit in a positive light.,
Remember that remaining stoic after being hit makes you look tough and, if anything, will scare the other team.

",How to Not Be Scared of Being Hit by a Pitch in Baseball," This is so you can get used to seeing and reacting to a pitch coming at you.;
, Don't think about being hit, think about getting a hit.

,






Look up and pinch your shoulder blades together, so your neck is protected by your helmet and your spine is less vulnerable.
Rotate your front leg and press your knee against the ground so you end up down on one knee.






Touch the end of your bat the ground to avoid getting a foul ball.







,


You will end up on one knee facing the backstop with your head and bat down. This will reduce the possibility of being hit and ensure that if you are, you will be hit in the back, the butt, or the bottom of the spikes.

, It won't hurt that much because you have less nerve endings in your back and your butt is a soft target.

, You will be getting on base and helping your team as well as improving your on-base percentage.

Use the offseason to improve your game.,
Work on specific parts of your game.,
Prioritize accuracy and command as a pitcher.,
Work on your bat speed and plate discipline.,
Show your versatility as a ballplayer.",How to Make Your School's Baseball Team1," Most U.S. school baseball seasons end around June. This gives you about nine months until tryouts in March. During this time, objectively evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Asking your current coaches how you can improve is a good start, and will leave a good impression.Try to get on a fall team in order to keep your skills sharp. Fall is a time to improve your game and work on things for the spring such as throwing a new pitch, bunting, hitting to the opposite field, etc.
In the winter, if possible, work with a coach specifically to get better at fielding, hitting, and/or pitching.;
, Talk to the coach or another person whose opinion you trust about what areas need work. Focus your energies on improving those aspects of your game, while at the same time not ignoring your overall skill-building and conditioning regimen.Becoming a better defender can help separate you from the pack. Work on positioning yourself properly, catching fly balls, scooping up grounders, and throwing on target.
No matter how fast you are, working on your base running skills — like sliding and rounding the bases properly — will also pay dividends., For pitchers, control is more important than velocity. Work on the hitting the strike zone first, then work on velocity. Remember that velocity is enhanced by proper mechanics, which also benefit control.During the offseason, focus on developing a smooth, repeatable delivery and accuracy in your pitches. Don’t wear out your arm by trying to hurt your catcher’s hand.

, Bat speed is essential to making the ball go far. Sensible strength training can help increase bat speed, but proper form and technique are at least as important. Work with a hitting coach or look on the internet for drills to improve your swing.Take batting practice regularly, from a machine or — even better — a live pitcher. Work on your plate discipline, so you can quickly differentiate a good pitch to hit from a ball off the plate.

, School baseball teams often have limited rosters, so you’ll better your odds of making the team if you can play multiple positions and fill multiple roles. Even if you prefer the infield, work on your outfield skills as well. Practice bunting and base-stealing so you can be used as a pinch hitter or pinch runner. And teams can almost always use another catcher, since many players shy away from this physically and mentally demanding position."

Understand the different ways of completing a double play.,
Practice turning ground-ball double plays.,
Get in optimum throwing position before catching a fly ball.",How to Make a Double Play in Baseball," A team can make a double play in baseball in several different ways.


Ground-ball double play: This is the most common double play because it usually is executed by forcing out both runners rather than tagging out one or both. If a ground ball is hit to an infielder or the pitcher with a runner on first base, the fielder will throw the batted ball to a player covering second base. The player must catch the ball while in contact with the base, and then throw the ball to a teammate covering first base before the batter reaches it.
Ground-ball double play with tag: A fielder can elect to tag the runner instead of throwing to the base the runner is approaching to record the first out and then throw to first to complete the double play. Sometimes a first baseman step on first base after fielding a ground ball, and then throw to second to record the double play. In this case, the runner is no longer forced to run, so the player receiving the throw from the first baseman must apply a tag on the base runner to record the second out.
Unassisted double play: An infielder can turn an unassisted double play under certain circumstances. This occurs most often when a player catches a line drive near an occupied base. If the defender is able to touch the base or tag the runner before he safely returns, the double play is recorded.
Fly-ball double play: A double play can be made on a fly ball to the outfield. Normally, this occurs when a baserunner tags up and tries to advance after the ball is caught. If the outfielder throws the ball to a teammate covering a base or home plate, and that player tags the runner before he reaches that base, the double play is successful.
Strike-out, caught-stealing double play: If a batter strikes out and a baserunner is caught stealing on the same play, a double play is recorded. Fans call this kind a strike-'em-out, throw-'em-out double play.;
, Ground-ball double plays are the most common and easy to practice. The key is for all the infielders to move in simultaneously as the play unfolds.


On balls hit to the left side of the infield, to either the third baseman or shortstop, other infielders must get into position to turn the double play. The second baseman must move to cover the base as the ball comes to the fielder. Ideally, the second baseman will be at or near the base before the throw is made.
On balls hit to the right side of the infield � to either the first or second baseman � the shortstop must rush to second as his teammate fields the ball.
If not making the play on the ground ball himself, the first baseman should move to cover first base immediately, getting in a comfortable position to receive the throw. A relay throw can be errant on a double play because the baserunner is sliding hard into second base, trying to disrupt the fielder's effort.
A middle infielder � shortstop or second baseman � sometimes will field a ground ball in close proximity to second base. The fielder may elect to carry the ball to the base himself, touch it, and throw to first to complete the double play. This reduces the chance of an error occurring on the relay exchange.

, An outfielder can ready himself for a throw to any base by practicing a few simple techniques.


Move to the area where you will catch the ball.
As the ball starts its downward trajectory, glance at the base you plan to throw to.
After picking up the flight of the ball again, edge closer to where you're going to catch it.
Catch the ball while moving toward the base you're going to throw to. The momentum will put more power behind your throw, helping you to cut down a runner trying to advance.

Create a training schedule.,
Rest injured or sore muscles and joints.,
Condition your arm in time for tryouts.,
Build strength in baseball-friendly ways.,
Use cardio to complement sprints and interval training.,
Work on running faster.,
Eat and sleep properly.",How to Make Your School's Baseball Team2," The more you practice, the better you get, and you can practice some aspect of baseball every day. Make a weekly schedule that includes conditioning as well as working on skills. Following a regular routine will make it easier.Consider alternating days between specific baseball skills (throwing, batting practice, fielding drills, etc.) and targeted conditioning exercises (interval workouts, running drills, etc.). This might prevent a sore throwing arm or calloused hands (from swinging a bat too many times), and can also reduce potential boredom.

, If you've had a long season or an injury, it is important to take some time to recover. Repetitive motion injuries are common among serious athletes. Even if you have to alter your offseason program, give yourself time to rest and recover. You definitely won’t make the team if you’re still injured during tryouts.If you have a “dead arm,” for instance, running cross country and/or doing a sprint training program can help keep you in shape while giving your arm a rest.

, So long as you’re not dealing with soreness or injury, incrementally build up your arm strength and stamina during the offseason. Start early (at the beginning of winter, for instance) and work slowly so you don’t have a sore arm or blisters interfering with your tryout.


Look for arm strength training programs online, or even better, talk to a knowledgeable coach or trainer. The program should focus specific exercises on specific areas — like the wrist, elbow, shoulder, hips, legs, etc. — and typically culminate with long-toss exercises., Most baseball coaches used to advise against weight training, and even today some are not big proponents of it. Talk to the coach about their views on strength training and the type of workouts they prefer their players to do. Remember, it’s never too early to get on the coach’s good side.In many cases, basic exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, and working with a medicine ball may make up the backbone of your strength training program. If you do choose (or are advised) to do weight training, lift safely and sensibly and give yourself adequate rest between workouts., Baseball is largely an anaerobic activity — that is, it requires short bursts of energy as opposed to aerobic endurance. So, while distance running is good for your health and may help loosen up a stiff arm (and all your other joints), focus primarily on short-burst workouts.Talk to a trainer or coach, or look online for a sensible workout plan that incorporates sprints, interval training, and other exercises that involve bursts of energy.

, You might hear baseball coaches say “you can’t teach speed,” but you can in fact train to make yourself at least a little faster. Sprint and interval training sessions can help, along with improving your running form and technique.Make sure to incorporate sport-specific drills into your program — in this case, base running drills, for instance. Being a faster runner won’t help you much if you’re still a subpar baserunner., Eating healthy — lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and a minimum of processed carbohydrates and sugars — will make a difference over time. The appropriate intake for your activity level is also important. This may mean eating five small meals a day instead of three larger ones. Consult with your doctor or a trainer or dietician to find the best diet for you.Don’t forget that you need to sleep well also. Getting the right amount of sleep will give you more energy and focus, and reduce recovery times. As a teen, aim for at least eight hours per night."

Learn what you can about the coach and the baseball program.,
Get on the coach's good side.,
Display humility.,
Accept failures and move on from them.,
Give it your best and never quit.",How to Make Your School's Baseball Team3," Especially if the coach has been there for a while, the school baseball program probably has an ingrained culture — that is to say, “the way things are done here.” Talk to current and former players, and others with knowledge of the program. Learn the “do’s” and “don’t’s” before tryouts begin.Go right to the source and talk to the coach as well. They will likely be more than happy to discuss their expectations and preferences for their team and players.

, A school baseball coach looks for more than just skills. Show good sportsmanship, get good grades, and present yourself as a good kid. This can give you the edge over another player. Don't play around during practice or act like a goof. Be serious and try to improve every day., There are sure to be some exceptional ballplayers at tryouts, so when you get out there don't be too cocky or overconfident. If it's an open tryout, stretch and run on your own. Find someone else to throw with. Take it seriously and follow the coach's instructions fully.Follow the rules, take instruction willingly, and don’t grumble, complain, or bad-mouth other players.

, Baseball is a tough sport in which failure is an integral part; even the best hitters get out more often than they get hits. When you do come up short during tryouts, it is important to show the right attitude. Be confident yet polite. Keep your head up, look your coach in the eye, and don't look down at your feet when you do make that inevitable error or mistake.If you fail to make the team this year, leave a positive impression on the coach with your effort and attitude. They’ll remember it — and you — when next year rolls around.

, There is no fool-proof way to make a school baseball team; even a player with superior skills might not make the cut due to a bad attitude or poor grades. Conditioning and training can improve your talents only so much, but you have total control over your effort level and determination. If you know you’ve given it your best shot, you can — and should — be proud of yourself regardless of the result.

To decide between them, prioritize speed on the ground over power at bat. Save the guy who hits the most home runs for when bases are loaded. But don’t choose a weak hitter just because he happens to be the fastest runner, because your lead-off is likely to come up to bat the most often!Look for these strengths to determine who should fill the #1 spot: Speed
Bunting
Stealing bases
Gets to base often
Makes regular contact with the ball
Rarely strikes out;
, Again, choose between one of your three best hitters. Since the fastest of the three has already been picked as #1, decide between the two remaining. Choose the one who delivers the most consistent performance, rather than the most powerful hits, to ensure that your lead-off has a chance to make it to second or third base.Pick the player who is best at:.


Sacrifice bunts
Hit-and-runs
Getting on base

, Bring your #1 and #2 hitters home (or at least closer to it) by selecting your best all-around hitter to bat right after them. Base your decision on both power and consistency. Pick the player who is able to send balls the farthest into the outfield. However, prioritize a high batting average over pure power. If this means loading all three bases instead of driving #1 all the way home, go with that. Your #3 hitter should ideally:Be comfortable hitting all sorts of pitches.
Have a high rate of runs batted in (RBI).
Be able to hit home runs and doubles occasionally, if not often.
Have a high batting average.

, Note whoever begins as your second hitter is likely to come to bat more often. Be aware that some people consider this to mean that it is wiser to bump your #3 pick (who is your best overall hitter) up one slot. Consider whether or not you wish to do the same.

, This position is known as the “cleanup,” so choose the player who is most likely to do just that: clean those bases of runners. Pick whoever is most likely to hit home-runs or, failing that, to send the ball way, way out into the outfield. Force your opponents’ defense to waste time chasing after it and passing it back to the infield. Give your #1, #2, and #3 hitters as much time as possible to reach home., Since they may have a less than perfect batting average, expect your #4 hitter to strike out on occasion. When they do, follow them up with the next best power hitter. Give your first three hitters another chance to make it to home plate. Or, if #4 was successful at bat, give them a chance to reach the next base, too., Understand that the traditional method of making a lineup is to use your very best hitters for the first three spots and then fill out the remaining slots with your fourth-best hitter, then your fifth, sixth, and so on. However, be aware that there is some debate about this. Consider this:Because the #3 hitter is likely to come up to bat more often in one game than #4 and #5 will, the traditional logic holds that you are better off filling that position with the power-hitter who has the highest batting average.
However, even though #4 and #5 may have fewer opportunities to bat in one game, they are more likely to do so with more than one base loaded.
Because of this, some people believe that the smarter move is to reserve the more consistent hitter for the fourth or fifth hole.

, You may have a solid team of players who are very close to each other in terms of talent, or the dropoff in batting skills may be very apparent from player to player. Either way, review each player’s strengths and weaknesses as a hitter. Weigh these concerns against what you are likely to need most from a given hole at the bottom of your lineup.Traditionally, #6 through 9 is usually determined by the remaining players’ respective talent and placing them in descending order, with your worst hitter going last.

, Unless you are blessed with an all-star team of power hitters, expect your remaining players to be more proficient at only hitting singles. So, in the event that both your first- and second-pick cleanups strike out, fill out the next two slots according to who has the best record of hitting the ball. Improve your odds of bringing baserunners home while your team is still at bat.If your sixth and seventh best players are pretty close in performance levels, base your decision on who is better at stealing bases.Filling the #6 spot with a strong base-stealer will increase your chances of driving this baserunner closer and closer to home, even if #7, #8, and #9 can only hit singles.

, Now that you are down to your two worst hitters, figure out where you want to place the absolute worst. Consider the dropoff in talent across the middle of your lineup. Figure out what situations you are likely to face as the batting rotation nears its bottom.If you have a strong team who can reach the bottom of the lineup with only one out, perhaps stick to the traditional method of placing your worst hitter last. This way, if they strike out, they will be immediately followed by one of your best players.
If you expect to have two or more outs well before that, think of your eighth and ninth hitter in terms of your first and second. Since they may likely be starting the rotation next inning, pick who goes first according the same criteria that you used to pick your lead-off.

, Research the other team's pitchers. Review any past games that you may have played against them. Consider switching your batters to different holes in your lineup if you think this will give you an advantage. For example:


If you have a fairly even number of left- and right-handed batters, alternate between the two to pose a constant challenge.If their pitcher is left-handed, reevaluate each batter's performance against such pitchers.
Review each batter's past performances against individual pitchers. For example, if your sixth-best batter overall happens to fare better against one pitcher, consider bumping them up.

Practice, Practice, Practice.",How to Train for Basketball," Basketball is one of the most physically exhausting sports. It is crucial for players to have very high endurance. The best way would be to run at least 2–3 miles (3.2–4.8 km) everyday. Try to gradually increase your distance over time.;
, In order to be a good ball-handler, you need to dribble a basketball wherever you go and whenever you can. Always start your workout with intense sessions of dribbling by focusing on your crossovers, behind the back, change of direction, in and out, and pull back and crossover.

, This is another key element and must be practice every single day. The best way to practice would be to have a group of 2-3 people where one person rebounds, the other passes the ball, and the last person shoots. It is optimal to shoot about 300-500 shots per day.

, This is something that is often avoided despite its importance to the game. You should try to grab another person and do 1-on-1 guarding where one person dribbles in a zig zag fashion and the other has to closely guard. In addition, you can always practice on your defensive slides alone and try to stay in a stance for at least a minute at a time.

, This is a skill that requires timing and boxing out. The best way to work on your timing is throwing the ball off the backboard and try to catch it at the apex of your jump. In addition, you should work on your jumping ability by doing squats and other leg strengthening exercises.


Exercising is important because it trains you physically for playing high level basketball.

, Perfect practice makes your work perfect. You always have to play games everyday. It will help you home in on the skills that you need to work on.

Check the venue before and during the World Series.",How to Get World Series Tickets," During some World Series matches, a standing-room only ticket can go for $650 on the secondary market. This means that seats in the arcade can be sold for several thousand dollars.;
, The MLB has its own Sweepstakes that can be entered by online form during August. Look for many local contests to increase your chances of winning by drawing.

, The season ticket holders for the year's championship teams usually get the right to buy tickets to the game at face value. In 2011, the Cardinals allowed those who bought season tickets for the next year to buy a current world series ticket at face value.

, Although season ticket holders get the chance to purchase at face value, this may also be possible if you purchase the tickets online, by phone or at the stadium box office before or right after the team qualifies.


Allotted team tickets sell out very quickly after the team qualifies. One year they sold out within 18 minutes of going on sale.

, StubHub is an affiliate of eBay and a partner of Major League Baseball and most of the American and National league teams. The following are good tips for buying baseball tickets on this secondary market:


StubHub has the advantage of guaranteeing your tickets, unlike some other websites. They have agreed to a process of reselling series tickets for the MLB. Once you buy a seat from an existing ticket, they deactivate the old ticket bar code and they create a new bar code for them. They will send you the tickets by email in Portable Document Format (PDF).
Go to the ""World Series"" section on StubHub.com site. It will tell you how many tickets are available and the lowest price you can find. Click on ""See Tickets."" You can choose based on price, number of tickets, seating and more. Buy a ticket with a credit card as soon as you find the tickets. They are not likely to be available at the same price for long.
Search for tickets during the playoff games. Buying tickets before the teams are set allows you the option of a refund. StubHub knows that even if you ask for a refund, they can always resell it to an eager fan. As soon as the game is decided, ticket prices will go up by $100 to $1,000.
Set a ""Price Alert."" You can name a price that you are willing to pay and you will receive word if there is a ticket available. This is a good way to stay within a budget.
Tickets are sold up to 2 hours before the game. Prices may go down as the game nears, because the seller will not benefit from having an empty seat.

, Sometimes tickets become available if there are open seats. If there is an agreement between the team and StubHub, you may be redirected to their website to purchase the tickets.

, Tickets occasionally become available and are sold at the gate up to 2 hours before the game. This is rare, but others may assume that there are no tickets.


Buy tickets at the bigger stadium, if you have an option between the 2. Because there are more seats available, they are also likely to be less expensive.

, Keep your grip relaxed as you hold the bat. Your grip will automatically tighten through the swing motion. Your grip will be the strongest as you make contact through the baseball. Focus on a light grip as you begin your swing.Keeping a tight grip will create fatigue in your fingers and muscles. It will also result in a slower, weaker swing. Grip with your fingers and pad of your hands., Your grip needs to enable your wrists to move well so that you can properly create bat lag and deliver the bat head to the ball. Bat lag is the relationship of your hands to the head of the bat as your swing progresses through contact. As you swing, your hands will come forward but your bat head will be left behind.The bat head is whipped around at the last instant by your wrists, but primarily by the wrist of your top hand. You want to generate as much bat speed through this whipping action and an improper grip can inhibit your wrists from generating the full potential.

, Your upper body should mimic your grip and be relaxed. The more explosive the movement, the more relaxed your body needs to be. You want to uncoil your muscles and explode into your hit., Make sure your shoulders aren’t level. You want there to be some tilt to your shoulders to create some explosion., Look at where your bat will make contact relative to where you have your hands gripped on the handle. The strongest grip is when the palm of your top hand is facing up and the palm of your bottom hand is facing down.Your hands should be parallel to the ground if you open both your hands. The thumb of your top hand will prevent the bat from getting knocked backwards as your grip tightens to make contact with the baseball.
The range of your knuckles should allow you to make contact with the ball with one palm up and the other down. To find this, pick your bat up and align your middle knuckles. Take a half swing, as if you’re making contact with the ball, and hold the position. How are you gripping the bat?, You should be balanced with your weight on the balls of your feet as you slightly bend your knees. Stand slightly wider than shoulder width apart to ensure your lower body is properly engaged and ready to engage into your hit. You want to take a short stride as your lower body rotates with the rest of your upper body to create maximum power for your hit.Avoid leaning back on your heels because it will make it difficult to keep balance as you move forward into your swing. Having too much weight transfer as you uncoil into your hit will reduce your speed and power.
Don’t keep your feet too close together because it might be difficult to keep your head level, time the pitch, keep your balance, and adjust to pitches that are off-speed. Having your feet too close together is known as overstriding and is common amongst beginners. In contrast, if your feet are too wide apart, you will decrease your power because you won’t be using your entire weight as your body rotates into your swing.
Open up your stance if you are having problems seeing the pitcher and the ball. You want to be able to see the ball with both eyes.

, Keep your hands at the top of the strike zone and your feet slightly more than shoulder width apart. You want you swing to be fluid through the strike zone. Any small adjustment will decrease your speed and your power.Avoid getting “happy feet”. This means moving around when already in your batting stance. The added movement can disrupt your timing. Relax and focus on the pitch.

, Play around with your grip so that you feel the effect when you have one palm up and one down when you make contact with the ball. One grip may feel easier than the other.You may find that if you align your middle knuckles your wrist rolls too early. You may find that if you align the middle knuckles of your bottom hand with the big knuckles of your top hand you have hard time holding on to the bat upon contact. You may also find yourself becoming more tense and forcing your shoulders to tilt in order to get into position rather than allowing a more natural motion. The size of your hands may cause you to adjust your grip to find your natural swing., You need to be confident and comfortable with your grip so don’t be afraid to slightly adjust when you’re consistently running into the same problems. You may be rolling your wrists early if you are topping the ball. Close your grip by bringing the middle knuckles of your bottom hand closer to the big knuckles of the top hand.Bringing your middle knuckles closer may aid you in coming through a better path through the hit zone. This can prevent constant pop ups. A tight grip may create unneeded tension in a swing and reduce your power. This may be the first reason why you are having difficulty hitting. There may be many reasons why you are finding problems but first focus on finding a grip you are comfortable with., The angle of your bat as you stand ready with the bat cocked back factors into how effective of a hitter you are. Angle your bat straight up and down. This creates a loop in your swing.The extra length in the back swing generates more power from this position because you’re increasing the space to speed up your bat.

, Lay the bat flat and parallel to the ground as it is ready to explode into your swing. This shortens the back part of your swing and creates a direct path to the pitch.Because your bat is travelling a shorter distance than if it were angled up, you will not generate as much power.

, Find an angle that is comfortable to you. Most people find an angle that is in between parallel to the ground and straight up. This will depend on what type of hitter you are and how you intend to control the baseball bat.

, This is where the seams form a C shape, a backwards C shape, or a horseshoe shape.

, Your last knuckle should lie just before the seam.

, Your thumb should be directly in line with the gap between your index finger and middle finger.

, There should be a gap between the baseball and the palm of your hand. This will minimize friction as you release the ball thus adding velocity.

Stretch your upper body, especially your arm.,
After stretching start throwing with a partner.,
Talk to your catcher who will catch you that game.,
Halfway to your team's infield practice, go to the bullpen and warm up with your catcher.,
Talk to your catcher if any of your pitches were better than the other pitches.,
After warming up put on warm clothes again so your body doesn't get cold.,
After stretching and all of the pre game stuff, it's time to play!,
Be sure you and your catcher are on the same page on the signs.",How to Get Ready to Pitch in a Baseball Game," Hurting your arm is the worst part if you are a pitcher. After stretching try to use athletic bands to stretch your arm again. You don't want to hurt your arm. After that try to get a light jog in.;
, Try to stay close to your partner at first and when you start to get warm, take a step back each time you receive the ball. This process is called long tossing. Once your arm is feeling good, take a step forward every time you receive the ball until you and your partner are 10 feet (3.0 m) away.

, Go over the signs and what kinds of pitches you will throw that game. Then sit in the dugout as your team practices and takes infield. Be sure to wear something warm to keep your arm warm.

, Bullpen is a practice pitchers mound where a pitcher can warm up. In the Bullpen try to test all your pitches out and see if your fastball and your off speed is working. This way you can know what pitch is working for you or know what pitch is the best that day.

, If the catcher says any pitch is not working for you that day, then don't throw that pitch in the game. Try to work on some of the off speed pitches like curve ball, change up, knuckle or any other off speed pitches. That way the catcher can also get used to your off speed pitches.

, If your arm is hurting in the Bullpen then be sure to tell your coach, because you will rather miss one game then pitching with a hurt arm and sitting out the rest of the season. The coach will probably ask you ""how is your arm hurting?"" If he asks any question don't be scared to tell the truth.

, This is the best part of baseball. When the game starts and it is your turn to pitch go to the mound and throw a couple of times. There is usually a hole where the pitchers step on the front side of the mound, so if that bothers you try to kick some dirt in there and cover up the mound.

, If you can't see the catcher's sign take a time out and talk to him. The catcher then will use his body parts as a sign instead of his fingers. If you follow these steps you will be properly ready to pitch.

Do your pre-draft research.,
Familiarize yourself with the rules and scoring system of your league.,
Note the date, time, and location.",How to Draft in Fantasy Baseball1," With the explosion of interest in fantasy baseball, all the information you need is easy to find. Dozens of fantasy sites each employ a team of experts who specifically cover fantasy baseball issues, including who is injured, who is primed for a big season and who is the best player at each position. Magazines cover all of these topics but are generally a poor investment since they tend to become outdated quickly. Instead, bookmark the sites you find most reliable, and visit them daily for the most up-to-date information.;
, Fantasy baseball used to be fairly standard, but not any more. Between the use of unconventional statistical categories, a variety of scoring systems, and the prevalence of inning or game limits, it can be difficult to overlook a critical wrinkle that can have a significant impact on how you value the players you draft. Ask your league commissioner for the specifics regarding the scoring system, categories, and limits (if applicable).

, You don’t want to be the one guy who forgets when or where the draft is being held and either show up late or miss it altogether. Online leagues will often send reminder emails the day before the draft is scheduled, but it is your responsibility to keep the draft specifics handy and ensure that you show up on time and ready to go.

"
"
Make a list.,
Arrive in plenty of time.,
Make your first pick.,
Watch out for trends and adjust accordingly.",How to Draft in Fantasy Baseball2," Seasoned fantasy owners usually have a preferred method of ranking players. Some separate them into positions (catcher, first base, second base, shortstop, third base, outfield, pitcher) and rank them in order from best to worst. Others create a master list beginning with the most valuable fantasy players, while some separate the players by proficiency in a specific category (home runs, strikeouts, etc.). The choice of ranking is up to you, but be sure to have some sort of system in place so you’ll be more organized when the draft begins.

, If you’re drafting online, your league will likely feature its own live draft room that you can reach via a link on the main page. Live draft rooms are usually created roughly 30 minutes before the start of the draft, so be sure to jump in as soon as you have the chance. This ensures you do not arrive late and risk losing the opportunity to make your first pick. If you draft live, make sure you arrive a few minutes before the scheduled start time to set up and take care of any last-minute research.

, If you are fortunate enough to have the first overall pick, you should have a very good idea of who you want to select by the time the draft begins. If you’re selecting in any other slot, be sure to monitor all players who have been selected ahead of your pick so you don’t take anyone who has already been chosen.

, Baseball drafts often feature “position runs” in which fantasy owners opt to draft from the same position in the same round. This is especially common when selecting “closers,” a term referring to pitchers who come in to work the final inning of a game. It’s wise to ignore position runs—which often come about due to owner panic about position scarcity—and stick to your original plan. While closure come off the board, good players at other positions are available.

"
"
Decide which players you plan to keep.,
Study other teams’ keeper lists.,
Conduct the draft.",How to Draft in Fantasy Baseball3," Keeper leagues allow fantasy owners to hang on to a predetermined number of players. Deciding on keepers is mostly about being able to forecast which players will be more valuable than the players you would draft in their place. If you believe Player A will outperform his draft slot, then you should keep him. If you think there’s a chance you can get a better player in his spot, toss him back.

, Not only will it help you avoid selecting a player in the draft that belongs to another team, but it will give you an idea of your opponents’ strengths going into the draft. This can help in the early rounds of the draft: if you notice that a player drafting ahead of you has kept several pitchers, it’s a safer bet that he or she will not pick another pitcher early. It isn’t always indicative of opposing strategy, but you can occasionally plan your early draft strategy around other teams’ keepers.

, Remember that in the early rounds of a keeper draft, the goal should be to fill in your roster holes as quickly as possible. You already have a number of good players, so be mindful of your league’s scoring settings and make sure you bolster your roster in areas that weren’t addressed through your keepers.

Research dollar values.,
Come up with a flexible budget strategy.,
Start the bidding.,
Monitor your budget closely.",How to Draft in Fantasy Baseball4," Auction drafting is nothing like a standard one-pick-per-round arrangement, and your strategy must be completely different as well. Players in an auction draft aren’t selected, they’re bid on, and knowing the projected approximate value of as many players as possible is the best way to track whether you’re getting enough value for your fantasy dollar. Most reputable fantasy sites provide auction value information for free. Study the values and identify potential busts or bargains.

, While standard drafts generally center around selecting the best player available when it’s your turn to pick, auction drafts are more complex due to the ability to land whichever player you want—if you’re willing to spend the fantasy dough. Here are some of the more popular auction strategies, each with its own built-in benefits and drawbacks (note that standard auction budgets are $260 for a 23-man roster):


The balanced team follows a standard formula in which team owners limit spending big on any one player, while devoting roughly 70 percent of the budget toward hitting and 30 percent toward pitching. It isn’t the most glamorous system, but it does ensure that the team owner ends up with a solid collection of players who accumulate stats in every category.
The “stars and scrubs” team sees the team owner shell out big for several established major-leaguers then spend the remainder of his budget on relative unknowns. While this enables the drafter to load his team with players he or she can almost certainly rely on, it leaves the rest of the roster lamentably thin—particularly if the lower-end players do not pan out.
The “LIMA” team, which stands for “Low Income Mound Aces,” is a strategy that funnels little money toward a team owner’s pitching staff. For a standard auction league, this means an owner is likely spending no more than $3 on any one pitcher. The upside here is obvious: having roughly $235 to spend on 14 hitters almost guarantees a phenomenal lineup with a great chance at securing top points in all offensive categories. But with such a thin stable of hurlers, the owner needs to get lucky—or make some slick moves or pickups—in order to not finish near the bottom on the pitching side.
These strategies are only guidelines - it is your responsibility to come up with a plan you feel gives you the best chance to win.

, If you’re interested in a player, make sure you monitor the bidding. More aggressive players will try to bid up a player they want by a large margin ($5 or more at once) in order to show players they’re serious. You can try to bid up a player you don’t want in order to take some money out of a rival owner’s budget, but you run the risk of getting stuck with that player. When it’s your turn to nominate a player, a good tactic is to toss someone you don’t want, but who will likely draw a lot of bids. That can take a good chunk of money out of play.

, One of the biggest mistakes a novice auction player commits is leaving money in his budget. Try not to be left with any money at the end because you can’t use it for anything once the draft is over. If you see that you’re a little richer than you expected to be as the draft winds down, don’t be afraid to spend an extra dollar or two on a player you want. It’s better to be poor than rich at the end of an auction draft.

"
"
Pre-rank your players.,
Check your roster immediately following the draft.",How to Draft in Fantasy Baseball5," If you don’t, the auto-draft will default to the site’s ranking list. This can be problematic, since each site’s rankings are based on a number of factors that may or may not run in tandem with how you might rank the players. The only way you can ensure that the computer is making choices you approve is to go in and rank the entire list from top to bottom. It is time-consuming but well worth it.

, The sooner you can identify problem areas in your auto-drafted teams, the better chance you have of filling those holes with waiver or free-agent pickups. Those who wait too long will almost assuredly miss out on the top players that weren't drafted.

",How to Try Out to Be a Cheerleader,";
, It is very important to attend the practices.

,, Don't suppose you know better or are above following the rules. They are there for your safety and your success.

, If you can, consider wearing your team colors. Wear something simple like a t-shirt and shorts or sweats. Also wear comfortable, sturdy athletic shoes.

,, Before you go in to audition make sure you stretch really well and drink some water.

, Take some deep breaths and if you're nervous, tell yourself you can do it. Go into the room you're supposed to try out, and go for it!

, Practice is the key to success, so draw up a comprehensive practice schedule to ensure that you set aside time each day to work on various aspects of the routines in the time leading up to the tryouts.

, The best way to calm your nerves is to gather a clear idea of exactly what is going to happen. Then you can relax and focus on getting better. Ask them to help you review your routine, too.

, This will give you invaluable feedback on your appearance and positioning. And also make sure someone else is watching you, so you can ask their opinion on how you did.

, It will help to make you less nervous, hide your errors, and make you a better performer. Make big, intentional moves, smile, make sure your moves are sharp, and when saying a cheer, say it loudly and clearly.

, You may be so nervous or excited that you don't take the time to stretch properly or to get your blood pumping, but be sure you do so.

, One option is to come dressed in your team colors, which is always a nice touch. If not, then consider black shorts and a white top (it makes it easier for the selection committee to see your basic form during routines).

, Often, people can focus so much on remembering steps that they will look lost or introverted -- not a good thing in cheerleading. Keeping your chin up and your posture tall will help a lot.

, If you get nervous, you need something to fall back on, and yelling, ""Go team!"" can make you look spirited. and fill in for a moment while you come up with something else.

, It's tempting to stare into the middle distance so that you are not distracted by external things, but again, cheerleading involves making a connection with the crowd. A great way to do that is to look people in the eye.

, Tie it back in a ponytail or bun if this is a potential problem.

, This is key and we shouldn't have to explain. You're trying to be a cheerleader for goodness sake.

, That doesn't mean shrieking or screaming, but project from your diaphragm. You'll have to cheer really loudly to be heard in competitions and games, so practice projecting your voice and not singing the cheer!

,, A lot of people feel silly cheering away like a freak in front of a small tryout committee. Cheerleading involves a lot of acting (for instance, acting like you care who wins the football game, or still smiling when your team drops a stunt twice in a competition). The tryout committee will want to see that you can turn on the juice, no matter what the circumstances are. If you hold back because you're afraid of looking dumb, then you will look dumb. Just go for it.

, If you happen to misstep, recover as quickly as possible and proceed as though nothing happened. Don't stop, don't slap your forehead, don't pause and look confused or nervous. The only thing worse than making a mistake is drawing attention to it. For example, if you fall on your knees doing a back handspring, just hit a high V, look at the judges, and smile.

, However, if you're trying out for an all-star team, they will place you in a level according to the things you can do (for example, if you have a round-off back tuck but not a standing tuck, you'll probably be placed in level three). Remember to be tight at all times.

,, It's contagious.

"
If you are trying out, start by speaking to someone already on the squad.,
Get your endurance up.,
Start core exercises.,
Learn the basics of cheerleading jumps.,
Increase your flexibility.,
To increase the flexibility in your hips and strengthen leg muscles needed for toe touches, sit on the floor in a front straddle.,
If you have the time and resources, seek out a local gymnastics facility to help you.,
Take a dance class, or use dance instructional videos to sharpen up your ability to retain choreography.,
Finally, try to cross train your body to prevent plateaus with flexibility, weight, and strength.",How to Train for Cheerleading," They can tell you specifics about the try outs, as well as what the coaches will be looking for. This will show where you should train hardest. The basics you have to know without a doubt are toe touches, herkies, kicks, motions, splits, cartwheels, round offs,front/back handsprings,and handstands.;
, Cheerleaders are required to cheer in front of crowds for an entire game - sometimes up to two hours. Start by running every day, even if you can't run the whole time. By being active you increase strength. Elliptical training and stairs are also helpful in training the leg muscles you will need as a successful cheerleader. Do one of these in 10 minute intervals several times a day. Every week increase the incline or speed by 1 point.

, A popular training circuit counts down from thirty by tens. 30 jumping jacks, 30 crunches, 30 push ups, and 30 seconds of a plank. Do not stop between rounds. Take a ten second break at the end of each circuit and start again with twenty, then ten. Do this circuit once a day everyday.

, The most common is a toe touch, but squads usually require four or five. To increase your height in jumps, place a piece of tape 12"" above your extended hand. Start in a crouched position and jump up to touch the tape. Only count the reps where you reach full height, and try to do 10-15 a day to start. Also do the jumps you must know repeatedly, about 5-10 each.

, Stretch twice a day, when you get up in the morning and before you go to bed. Particularly stretch your thighs and legs with straddle stretches. Do the lunge, kneeling lunge, kneeling reverse lunge, straddle, pike, splits, quad stretch, shoulder stretch, tricep stretch, bridge, etc. Hold each stretch for 10 seconds and repeat the stretches 3 times a stretching session.

, Depending on previous flexibility, lean forward on your hands or forearms. Slowly, lift a leg one at a time a few inches above the ground, lower, and repeat. Try for 10 a day on each leg. If your hips lock up, do a pike stretch and try again. When you have mastered lifting, try circling your feet in the air before lowing for a more advanced movement.

, Private or group lessons can give you personalized training on jumps and tumbling. Do not be afraid to ask for help! Tumbling is very important in advanced cheerleading but can be difficult to learn, give it time. In the mean time, teach yourself cartwheels, round offs, handstands, bridges, and back bends. You may be able to teach yourself a back and front walkover, but only if you master the other skills.

, YouTube is a great source for easy amateur routines. So is Activity TV. Cheerleading is heavily dance oriented and having a background in dance can help you.

, Pilates, weightlifting, and swimming are great exercises to increase endurance and muscle.

Spend 10-20 minutes stretching your back, legs, and arms every day. To prevent injury, be sure you begin with gentle stretches before moving into more extreme stretches.
, A backbend is a great exercise to do when you’re working up to a scorpion, which requires an extreme back arch. A backbend stretches your back and is a good warm up. To do one:Begin by standing with your legs shoulder-width apart.
Raise your arms above your head with your hands flat so they are parallel with the ceiling.
Slowly bend backward and push your thighs forward. Make sure to keep your arms locked as you move closer to the ground.
Plant your hands and keep your feet firmly in place when you reach the ground. You should be looking in between your hands.

, Lay on the ground on your belly and bend your knees so that your toes are pointing toward you. Lift your torso off the ground, and reach back to grab your toes. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then slowly release it and lower your torso and legs back to the ground., Mastering your splits will help prepare you for a scorpion. Practice both the side split and the front split to ensure your legs are as limber as possible.For a side split, stand with a wide, straight-legged stance. Spread your legs slightly more than shoulder-width apart, and lower yourself down to the ground.
For a front split, put one leg out in front of you, and one leg behind you. Place your hands on the floor and slowly slide your front leg forward until your reach the floor, keeping your toes pointed.
For an additional challenge, when you’re in the front splits, bend your back knee so your foot points toward you. This will help you achieve your scorpion.

, Lay flat on the floor on your stomach. Place your palms flat on the ground underneath your shoulders, and flex your feet so that your toes are touching the floor. Keep your abs tight and raise your body off the ground, so that your weight is resting on your hands and feet. Be sure to keep your back straight. Try to hold the plank for 30 seconds., Doing yoga increases both your balance and your flexibility. Look for a cheap or free class in your area, and sign up. Follow along with the instructor, and ask them to make sure you are using the right technique. You could also get a yoga DVD or follow along with online tutorials., A great way to improve your balance is to use a balance beam. Walk along the beam and practice keeping your center of gravity over the beam. Keep practicing until you no longer need to hold your hands out for support and can walk the entire length of the beam in under 6 seconds., Work up to balancing on one foot for a minute. Use a little support if needed. Then switch, and balance on the other foot. It’s important to exercise both sides so that one side doesn’t become weaker than the other., Stand on the board with your feet shoulder-width apart. Tighten your abs and rock backward, forward, and side to side. Keep trying until you can balance for one minute or longer., Stand with your hips and knees apart, your arms out, back straight, and abs tight. Bend your knees and hips, slowly lowering yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Rise back up slowly, squeezing the muscles in your backside. Repeat the desired number of times., Those who do tai-chi have incredible strength and balance. Do an Internet search to find a class in your area, or look for a personal instructor. Focus on your breathing and balance while following along with the moves., Ballet dancers also have amazing balance. Find online tutorials and videos, or sign up for a ballet class. Not only will you improve your balance, you’ll also increase your flexibility and learn new moves., You should be facing forward, with your arms at your sides. If you are attempting the scorpion for the first time, you may want to have a spotter there to assist you, or stand near a dresser or other flat, stable surface you can use for balance., Bend your leg backward at the knee so that you can reach your foot. Use the hand on the same side of your body to grip your foot (e.g., if you are bending your left leg, grip it with your left hand). Keep the knee on your other leg locked for stability., Use your leg muscles to stretch your leg as high as it will go behind you. Don’t use your hand to pull your muscles, just use it to guide your foot into the correct position., As your leg raises higher, turn the elbow on the hand gripping your foot outward so that it points forward, in front of your head., Reach behind you and grab your foot with your other hand, so that both hands are now holding your foot. Your elbows should be above your head, pointing in front of you., Try to push your leg as high as it will go. This is the scorpion.

, If you can’t quite reach your toes yet, use a sports band to help you stretch. Hold the band in both hands behind your legs like you would with a skipping rope. Put the band around the top of one foot (near your toes) and pull your leg up behind you.

Warm up!,
Straddle.,
Stretch your side splits.,
Lay on your back on the floor and pull your leg towards your face, making sure to point your toe.",How to Stretch for a Bow and Arrow in Cheerleading," Warming up beforehand is a ""very"" important step. If you don't warm up you could easily tear a muscle, which could put you off your schedule to get your bow and arrow for days or even weeks! Think of your muscles as a rubber band. If the rubber band is warm and flexible, it becomes easier to stretch. You can stretch it further and longer and has better elasticity. But if you pop the rubber band in the freezer, making it cold, and then take it out and try to stretch it, it will snap clear in half because it has become brittle (just like your muscles can). To avoid this problem, warm up those rubber band muscles by simply jogging in place for 60 seconds. Or you can do these stretches immediately after your normal cardio or workout.;
, Sit in a straddle and put your hands and arms out in front of you. Try to scoot and reach your hands out in front of you as far as you can and try to push your chest and shoulders towards the ground. As you do this, try to keep you feet turned out, knees and toes pointed back (not flexed feet). Don't bend your knees, or else you are not stretching the proper muscles. It is ideal to be flat against the ground, but you won't be able to do that at first. Hold this for 30 seconds, making sure to breath deeply to get oxygen to those muscles! You also want to go over and hold 30 seconds each leg and also put your nose to your knee for 30 seconds each leg.

, Hold a runner's lunge for 30-60 seconds on each leg, pushing your hips toward the floor and making sure your knee does not pass your toes on the leg in front (make sure the leg in font stays at a 90 degree angle). Now slide into your splits. Note: even if you don't have them to the floor, just stay in them! It does hurt, but just tough it out for 30 seconds.

, If you cannot yet reach your leg, tie a belt/scarf that you don't mind getting ruined around your foot or ankle and use it to pull your leg towards you. Hold for 45 seconds, each leg. Eventually, you will be able to pull your leg so close to your head that you can use your other hand to hold your foot and then eventually you will be able to push that other arm through the space between your leg and body, and be able to do a perfect bow and arrow!

, If you can, put up flyers around the school/city to let people know about it. Have a set date and time. Some basic requirements that need to be met are:


Are they flexible? Kids should at least be able to do a roundoff and be able to bend easily. Preteens should be able to do that to, with also having to do a few stunts. Not too many, just a few.






Appearance. The kids should be able to have a lot of make up applied and be able to have their hair curled or straightened. The kids should also look pretty presentable and clean

Go out and cheer for your team, and have fun!",How to Start a Cheerleading Team," Competitive, or “all-star”, teams work with the goal of competing in and winning local, regional, and national cheerleading competitions. Regular, or plain squads perform for show.cheering for a semi-pro or little league sports team; traditional squads bring entertainment to sporting events. If you want to start a traditional squad, contact your local semi-pro or little league team head coaches, and simply ask if they’d like to have a cheerleading squad – 9 times out of 10, you will get an enthusiastic “yes!”.;
, These will likely be decided for you if you’re a traditional squad. For all-star squads, your regulations will be especially important, and will govern practice times and locations, uniform and travel costs, tryout guidelines and eligibility, insurance policies, team fees, community involvement and philanthropy, and discipline.

, It is extremely important that you not mix the squad’s funds with your personal funds.

, For all-star squads, this must be a space with adequate padding for stunting and tumbling practice, as well as a regulation-size floor mat to practice competition routines. For traditional squads, you can likely use your sports team’s gym or practice space- check with your team’s head coach to coordinate times the space will be available for your squad’s practices.

, At a minimum, come up with a quick dance routine that is at least eight 8-counts, and require the performance of one cheer, and couple of jumps. For all-star squads, the performance of stunts, standing tumbling, and a tumbling pass may be necessary. Make sure you have at least three judges, a space to hold tryouts, plenty of copies of scores sheets, and badges for participants to write their try-out number on. It is optional, but some squads offer try-out clinics and/or require a tryout registration fee, usually $10-$25.

, Your squad will need duffel bags, shell tops, skirts, bloomers, poms, cheer shoes, socks, and at least one set of practice shorts and a team shirt. Optional items include hair bows and team sweat suits.

, Your competition schedule will determine the time line you have to perfect your routine and raise money for uniforms, competition fees, and travel expenses.

, Split all fundraising profits among those who choose to participate in the fundraiser.

,, You’ll also want to keep a few half-time routines on reserve that you can easily perform to popular songs and dance mixes. All-Star squads: choreograph and teach your competition routine. The time limit, music, and technical requirements will be set by the competitions you choose to attend.

, You can either find software for this, or get a professional’s help- many all-star squads enlist the help of a pro.

Stretch.,
Practice your tumbling.,
Participate in a cheer camp.,
Work at it!",How to Stay in Cheerleading Shape over the Summer," This is the most vital step in maintaining your flexibility. You should spend approximately ten to fifteen minutes multiple times a week stretching, holding each position for about thirty seconds. Do not rush through stretching simply because you cannot be bothered as if you do not stretch properly and injure yourself, it will prohibit you from being able to work on your cheerleading over the break altogether. Try some of these simple yet effective stretching positions.


Pike stretch. This stretch will stretch your hamstrings and your calves, two very important muscles needed in cheerleading, especially when performing jumps. To stretch your pike, sit up straight on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Gently bend over, reaching your arms to your toes, and try to get your nose to touch your knees for a better stretch. Be sure to keep your feet flat and your toes pointing to the ceiling.



 



Lunge Stretch. A lunge stretch is a good way to stretch out your splits. Go into a kneeling ""proposal"" position on the ground with one knee pointing to the ceiling and the other on the ground. Without moving your front knee in front of your front toe, stretch out your back leg as far as you can. Be sure to keep your back upright. Hold for thirty seconds and switch sides so your other leg is on the front.







The Butterfly Stretch. Sitting on the ground, bend your knees in so the bottom of your feet are touching each other in front of you. try to move your feet closer to your body and lean forward so your nose is touching your feet. Also try to push your knees so they are flat on the ground. Hold for thirty seconds.







The Bridge. To do a bridge from the ground, lay down on your back with your knees pointed to the ceiling. Make sure your feet are flat on the ground. Place your hands so they are in line with your ears and so your fingers are pointing the same way as your toes and push up. To do a bridge position from standing, you must have a pretty solid bridge on the ground. Keep your arms locked and by your ears. Watch your hands as you push your hips forward and bend your knees and fall back into your bridge. Performing a bridge from standing is called a Backbend. Always use a spotter if you have never performed a backbend before. A backbend (or bridge) stretches out your back. Bridges can be tough to hold, so try to hold one for as long as you can (even if that is only ten seconds).







The Quad Stretch. The quad stretch is also an important stretch. It stretches your quad (or thigh) muscles. To achieve a quad stretch, stand on your right leg and lift up your left foot so your left knee is pointing towards the ground. Grab your left foot with your left hand and pull your foot towards your bottom. Hold for thirty seconds and then switch so you are standing on your left leg and lifting up your right foot.







Stretching the shoulder and arm muscles. These are important especially during tumbling as they are the things holding up your body. To stretch your shoulders, bend both your elbows in front of you so your forearms are parallel to each other. Then, move both your arms to they are on either side of you. Place each arm against a wall. A door frame or hallway is ideal for this stretch. Then, push forward on your chest. To stretch your wrists, extend one arm out in front of your body so the palm of your hand is facing away from you. With your other hand, gently pull back on your fingers. Hold for thirty seconds and then switch arms.





;
, If you do not practice your tumbling over a long period of time, chances are when you need to tumble again next season you will chicken out of it. Practice on a safe, stable trampoline (preferably one with a safety net around it). If you haven't mastered a move yet, use a spotter for assistance. Practice:


Back handsprings
Back walkovers
Front handsprings
Front walkovers
Back tucks
Layouts

, There are many great cheer camps that take course over the summer holidays. These are the perfect opportunity to meet new friends, gain flexibility and learn many new tumbling, stunting and dance moves. Search online or phone up your local gym to see if they have anything going these holidays.

, This is the perfect time to excel at something in cheerleading you don't have completely down pat. If you're not flat in your splits, stretch daily and try to make it all the way to the floor. If you can do a split on only one leg, stretch out the other leg! If you can do a standing back bend but can't kick over, search up youtube videos to help you. Get your toe touch that much higher and practice it daily on the ground and on the trampoline! There are many simple things you could do at home which could improve yourself for next season - and who knows, maybe your hard work on your toe touches or your tumbling could score you a front-row position in your next routine!

Reduce calories.,
Eat more protein and fiber.,
Avoid starch and sugar.,
Don’t drink fizzy drinks.,
Try eating coconut oil.",How to Reduce Waist Size1," It’s a fairly obvious point, but if you want to reduce your waist size, you need to reduce the amount of calories you consume. Weight loss is an obvious equation: You need to burn more than you take in, and exercise burns fewer calories than many people think.


It takes a caloric deficit of 3,500 to lose a single pound. Many studies have found that if you keep a food diary in which you list what you eat every day, with the number of calories consumed, you will be more likely to eat less.
Use online calorie counters to figure out the number of calories in everything you eat. Pay careful attention to condiments, like salad dressing, that might contain more calories than you think. Even eating 100 fewer calories per day will make a difference over time .

Running is a great way to burn calories. Try to work toward running for 30 minutes at least three times a week. You can alternate walking and running until you’re stronger. If you could jog 20 miles per week, you could lose a lot of belly fat in 6 months time. ;
, You will eat less if you eat protein-heavy meals because they make you feel fuller. You should make sure you eat a high-protein breakfast, especially. Don’t skip breakfast. You could increase your weight loss rate by 25 percent if you switch to a high-protein diet.


Remember that 80 percent of losing weight (including around your waist) needs to come from diet, not exercise. Eggs, tuna fish, vegetables, salads, almonds, apples, and lean meats are good choices. If you find it hard to clean up your diet, remember that having a waist over 34.5 inches means you’re at higher risk for a series of ailments, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. And you simply will not shrink your waist dramatically without a decent diet. Try to limit how much dairy you eat. Foods that you should fill your diet with include skinless chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. These are good for the waist.
If you can pull it off, try to eat at least one-third of your overall diet raw.

, The problem with starches and sugar is that they raise the levels of insulin production. This hormone is associated with larger waist size. So you need to weed starch and sugar out of your diet. Avoid refined carbohydrates (foods made out of white flour won't help your waist).


Be aware that high sugar foods can contribute to belly bloat, and some of them are foods you might assume are healthy, like beans, potatoes, and bananas.
The other problem with sugar and starch is that you will end up with high calories and less satisfaction. These are basically empty calories with little nutritional value. Examples include doughnuts, French fries, and white bread.
Look at labels, and weed fructose out of your diet. Fructose makes it a lot harder to lose weight. It’s found in a lot of processed foods and drinks, and you should limit your intake of it to less than 15 grams per day. Some foods that are considered healthy but have a lot of fructose in them can include enhanced water, yogurt, and some foods labeled as diet foods.

, Even if the carbonated drink you typically reach for is a diet version, it can be problematic for your waist size.


Fizzy drinks increase the amount of gas in your intestinal system. In addition, some diet drinks contain sweeteners which the body has trouble breaking down. Both of these things contribute to larger waist size.
Instead, drink water (you need to drink water throughout the day, as it will also increase your metabolism). And try drinking peppermint tea. If you must drink alcohol, red wine in moderation is a better choice than beer.
Another reason to drink more water is because people often mistake dehydration for hunger. So, if you feel hungry, try guzzling a bottle of water instead. , There are many reasons to eat coconut oil. One of them is because it burns abdominal fat, as well as boosting your metabolism.


Coconut oil contains acid that makes the body feel more full. So studies have found that people ate fewer calories when they started eating coconut oil daily. Coconut oil metabolizes very fast in your body. Some studies have found that coconut oil reduces the size of the waist and belly fat. "

Try waist turns and curls.,
Try hooping.,
Join a pilates or circuit training program.,
Try waist training.",How to Reduce Waist Size2," Make sure the exercises you choose specifically target the waist. Avoid doing the old-style crunch. It can damage your spine.


Stand with a pole between your shoulders. Keep your back straight, and your feet apart. Twist your waist from side to side while looking straight ahead. See how many rotations you can do. Try to do as many as 50 rotations.
Instead of a crunch, try a curl. Lie on your back. Your hands should be palm down. Tuck them under your back. Bend your knees and lift your head and shoulders – but only a bit.

, If you get bored with typical exercises, why not buy a hula hoop? If you hoop for just a few minutes a day, you will end up with a smaller waist. Even hula hooping for 10 minutes a day has been found to reduce waist size! You can also burn 100 calories a day just with a few minutes of daily hula hooping. To hoop better, keep your back straight, bring the hoop against your back when you start hooping, and try not to turn your hips too much. Put your right foot slightly before the left. Spin the hoop counterclockwise and then shift your hips from front to back to keep the hoop moving. You need to keep your core engaged, making the hoop stay above your hips.
One study found that hooping for 30 minutes, three times a week took 3-6 inches off the waist in just a month. , Circuit training is a great choice for an exercise program because it involves elements of strength training, resistance training, and cardio, all of which will help you pare your waist. Pilates features many poses that work on the core.


A typical circuit training program would involve 4 circuits that feature different exercises, which you do for about 12-15 reps about three times each and then rotate.
Circuit training often involves such exercises as squats, push ups, vertical jumps, resistance bands, and using light dumbbells.
Pilates will tone your waistline because it focuses on poses that will create a strong core.

, If exercise isn’t cutting it for you, you could try the latest celebrity trend: Waist training. Jessica Alba is among the celebrities who have tried this technique, which she did to help regain her figure after having a baby.


Basically waist training means you wear a corset on a daily basis. Buy a waist trainer (or corset, or waist cincher) that has flexible bones in it, so you can breathe. Don’t expect instant results, though. Waist training can take months to be visible.
You could also try buying a waterproof cord you wear underneath your clothes around your waist, and you tighten it as you lose weight. This will help you realize when your stomach is expanding.

"
"
Reduce stress.,
Sleep well.,
Don’t smoke.",How to Reduce Waist Size3," It might surprise you, but stress is associated with larger waist size. This is because it increases the hormone cortisol, which is associated with weight gain around the belly.


The other problem with stress is that it causes many people to overeat or reach for the snacks. Meditation and yoga are techniques that can help you reduce stress.
People sometimes wonder why waist size is so much harder to shrink than it is to lose weight in general. This is because waist size is linked to the hormones of cortisol and insulin, not just diet. If you understand this, you will realize that reducing stress can be a key factor in shrinking your waist size. , Experts suggest that insomnia is associated with weight gain, especially around the stomach. There are hormonal reasons for this.


You should aim to get about 7-8 hours of sleep a night. This will reduce hormone production and make your appetite decrease. Sleep is associated with increasing the human growth hormone that burns fat and builds muscles.
Insomnia is associated with high stress levels, which also leads to production of cortisol, the hormone associated with larger waist size.

, Smoking isn’t just bad for your lungs, but it’s also a bad thing for your belly. So if you want to reduce your waist size, you need to put down the cigarettes.


Studies have found that smoking increases waist size.
It's never a good idea to smoke in order to lose weight (as the cliche goes), but it's definitely not going to make you lose weight around the waist.

If none of you do, teach yourself some basics and enroll in a gymnastics class. Gymnastics is a must. You all must be able to do a cartwheel, round off, handstand, and split before you even start doing cheernastics. Cheerleading is the easy part, no need for spotters to do some jumps, kicks, and arm motions. For gymnastics, it gets tougher with tumbling, stunts, and extreme moves. So, if you want to do cheernastics, gymnastics is a must unless you are on a school or all star cheerleading squad. On school squads, you won't learn much tumbling, but they may teach you back handsprings, handstands, cartwheels, and round offs. You can teach yourself back bends, walkovers, and the Valdez. Save the tucks, aerials, and flips for gymnastics class.

, You can use your own pom-poms and megaphones if you have any. Your outfit should be dance shorts, a tank top or top with your squad logo, cheer shoes or white tennis shoes, and a hair bow.

, Choose cute and cool color combinations that are cute and awesome together. They need to go well together and everybody on your Cheernastics squad should have those colors. These will be the colors of your outfit. For example, if your squad colors are purple and white, wear white dance shorts and a purple and white striped shirt. Your hair bow should also be that color. Or, do your school colors in case you want to try out for your school squad after this.

, Your name should be something that is fun, original, and short. It can be something like ""Tumbling Trio"", ""Dancing Divas"", or anything you like. Your logo should have and abbreviation of your squad name. If your name is Fly Gals, your logo can be a flyer and say FG. You can do whatever you want as long as it is cheer related. Don't go by your school team name, as this is a little corny.

, Go on YouTube and learn a few by heart. Or, make your own cheers. Remember to add a chant to them. You should also learn a few dances. Practice them together everyday until you have them down pat. Improve your cheers by keeping stiff motions. Improve your chants with a loud and clear voice. Improve your dance by flowing with the music and letting go. You should really focus on jazz, hip hop, and modern dancing. You can find free videos on Activity TV and YouTube. You can also learn some cheerleading motions and routines.

, Motions include: bow and arrow, daggers, punch, hands on hips, L, K, T, broken T, touchdown, low touchdown, high and low V, diagonals, buckets, and candlesticks. Jumps include: toe touch, herkie, hurdler, pike, spread eagle, tuck, T, around the world, abstract, and many others. Kicks include: front, 45 degree, and side. Cheerleading tumbling includes: back handspring, front tuck, back tuck, aerial, cartwheel, round off, handstand, front handspring, back bend, rolls, walkover, among others.

, You all need to be in an oversplit, be good at gymnastics, have wonderful endurance, and be strong. So, you need to stretch 4 times a day, take a gymnastics class once a week, run 3 days a week, and do strength training 3 days a week. If none of you take gymnastics, you will have to look up ways to train for tumbling moves, but never attempt them without a coach and/or spotter. Practice gymnastics everyday.

, If you win make your team something cool or go do something fun together. Example gifts include shirts with your team name, emergency cheer kit, a makeup kit, and stuffed animals of your mascot. Things to do together can be a movie, lunch, sleepover, or hanging out in the park.

If you feel that you are good enough, you might want to try out for a cheerleading squad.,
If you want to, you can try out for All Star Cheerleading.,
Begin training daily.",How to Start a Cheernastics Squad2," First, tryout for your school squad. Since you do gymnastics, you are flexible, you can do the jumps and kicks, and you are in shape, you might be able to become a flyer! So, keep up your work if you want this to turn into a real cheerleading career.;
, These girls do lots of tumbling, dancing, and cheering, and it takes up tons of time. If you don't make the school squad, tryout for this because you will always make it and be on a team with girls of your skill ability. Plus, you compete in competitions.

, You need to stretch four times a day, strength train three days a week, do aerobics three days a week, and do cheer drills every day. You need to get a good and strong toe touch, herkie, pike, and tuck jump. Keep your toes pointed and your back straight. Do straddle leg lifts, squats, squat jumps, and anything that strengthens your legs and helps you jump higher. Also do core exercises like crunches and sit ups to strengthen your core for better jumps and tumbling.

If you are more on the gymnastics side of Cheernastics, you may want to join a gymnastics team.,
Be prepared for the time.",How to Start a Cheernastics Squad3," You will learn more gymnastics moves, become more flexible, get better jumps, and get in the best shape of your life. Before doing Cheernastics, you should have been in gymnastics or at least had somebody in your squad doing gymnastics and teaching you the moves. So, you should know some basics. If the other girls in your gymnastic class are better than you because they can do handsprings and tucks, don't fret. As long as you taught yourself a handstand, cartwheel, round off, Valdez, walkover, and practiced tucks in the pool and on the trampoline and/or done drills that help you get stronger in those areas, you should be fine. If some girls make fun of you, shrug them off and say this is your first time in a class. This will shut them up because of how good you are with no help.

, Gymnastics requires tons of strength to jump that high, lift your body up on thin bars, and flip around like that along with flexibility. You need to be in a split, oversplit, and a bridge without any trouble whatsoever. Gymnastics is a great alternative if you don't make the cheer squad because it teaches you similar jumps, flexibility, tumbling, and stunts. You will just have to teach yourself motions, which are easy.

"

If you have no girls in your neighborhood who want to do cheernastics, don't worry.,
Sign up for those classes!,
Practice!,
Do your own stage name!,
Show off.",How to Start a Cheernastics Squad4," You can do it yourself. Cheernastics is best done in the summer and before school cheerleading tryouts. Complete all of the steps above, but by yourself. You can teach yourself jumps, stunts, kicks, motions, and some tumbling.

, Since you are by yourself, beg your parents to sign you up for a summer gymnastics class. If they won't give in, see if you can do a summer cheerleading or gymnastics camp. In these camps, you will learn tumbling, jumps, moves, and flexibility that you will need to become a cheernastics star. If they won't even sign you up for that, search the internet. There has to be online videos to help you learn basic tumbling and cheer skills. Never give up.

, Even though it won't be as fun by yourself, you get to do what is right for you, it will fit your schedule, and you can do what you like. So, begin your practice by jogging around your backyard. Then, do the exercises recommended to build leg and core strength along with pushups. Do some weight work if you can with bicep curls, tricep extensions, and flies. Throw a few jumps and practice a cheer. Then, stretch out your whole body, head to toe. Now, you are done! Do everyday along with the aerobics, strength, and stretching.

, Since you don't have a team, you have yourself. So, you can choose a stage name or use your nickname. If your name is Emma, go by your first and middle name or by Emmy. Jazz up your current name. Or, you can do your school's team name, especially if you will be trying out for a school sport. Same thing with the logo, you can do your school's or your own original thing.

, Perform in front of your parents, siblings, or the video camera!

Wear sunscreen every day.,
Use a rich, moisturizing night cream.,
Use retinoids to fight fine lines.",How to Stay Young Looking After 401," To keep your skin looking young, use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day. This UV protection will help to prevent fine lines, age spots, and skin discoloration. Opt for a lotion or moisturizer with broad spectrum protection, meaning that it will prevent skin damage from both UVA and UVB rays.Apply sunscreen to bare skin at least 15 minutes before going outdoors.Purchase a lip balm with SPF to protect your lips from sun damage.Always apply makeup after applying sunscreen.;
, If you buy an all-purpose moisturizer with SPF in it, purchase a separate moisturizing cream for to apply generously to your bare face before bed, when you will not need UV protection. Get advice from a product consultant at a beauty supply store or research online reviews to choose a moisturizer that is right for your skin. Look for ingredients that target you specific skin type, such as:Ceramides, glycerin, and mineral oil for dry skin
Lavender oil, rose oil, or green tea extract for sensitive skin
Hyaluronic acid or glycerin for oily or combination skin

, Retinoids, derivatives of vitamin A, increase your skin' s production of collagen and regulate skin cells, leaving skin looking more youthful. Buy a mild retinoid cream from a department store or beauty supply store, or visit a dermatologist to get a prescription for a stronger retinoid treatment. Prescription retinoids may be rougher on skin for the first few weeks of use (e.g., causing redness or peeling skin), but will ultimately produce faster and more noticeable results.Ease into using retinoid creams or lotions by applying a pea-sized amount at night for 2-3 nights before using it as you normally would a day or night moisturizer. If the formula is too harsh for your skin, try a milder formula of retinoid moisturizer.

Open windows at night to let in the cool air and breezes, but keep windows closed and blinds drawn during hot, sunny days.",How to Stay Cool and Feel Fresh During the Summer," Use exfoliating shower gel to clean off the grime. Turn the water to hot to start the shower (because it cleans you more effectively), but towards the end of your shower, turn the water to a lukewarm or cool setting. This lowers your body temperature to make you feel cooler (and wakes you right up in the morning!).;
, A great trick is to use baby oil instead of the normal lotions. While you're still damp, rub small amounts all over your body. If you prefer scented lotions, use something light. Opt towards citrus or flowers for a nice crisp scent. Heavy scents like Vanilla or Coconut can make you feel warm. Bath and Body works has lots of nice scents (Sweet Pea and Cucumber Melon are ideal for summer), and they usually have coupons and sales.

, Sweat and oil can accumulate and clog your pores, making your face feel dirty and heavy. A good exfoliating cream and a light moisturizer should do the trick

, Ponytails always work. Be sure to wash your hair at least once a week (or however often you need to for your hair type) to keep your scalp clean and healthy.

, You should do this at least twice a day anyway. A fresh, clean mouth can make your tongue feel cooler. Minty toothpastes and gum are good to use during the summer to help you feel cool.

, Remember: the lighter the color the less heat it attracts, so try to choose brighter colors like white, pink, yellow and orange. The weight of the fabric is also important to consider, so silk shirts will keep you cooler than denim.

, When doing outdoor sports/activities, bring plenty of cold water or Gatorade and try to stay in the shade as much as possible. A small fan or a spray bottle can help you avoid heat exhaustion too, if you want.

, The water and vitamins in fruit will treat you much better than the sodium in those savory treats.

, This can make your house feel several degrees cooler and help you avoid turning on the air conditioner, which draws a lot of power.

Get 6-8 hours of sleep a night.,
Eat all-natural, healthy foods.,
Drink water or other hydrating drinks.,
Exercise at least 30 minutes a day.",How to Stay Young Looking After 402," To stay young looking, make sure to get between 6 and 8 hours of sleep every night. Fatigue can cause your body to release extra cortisol, a stress hormone that breaks down the elasticity of your skin. Getting enough sleep will also prevent puffy eyes and a general worn-down look, which can both be aging., To look younger after 40, make a conscious effort to eat foods that are not processed or high in saturated fat, sugar, or sodium. Many food additives can cause skin inflammation and may have an aging effect on your body. Choose to infuse your diet with antioxidant-rich foods, such as:Kale, spinach, and other leafy green vegetables
Salmon and other fatty fish
Beans, lentils, and peas
Tomatoes
Carrots
Apricots
Blueberries
Nuts

, Staying hydrated is important to help skin looking supple and young. As a general rule, men should drink about 3 liters (13 cups) of fluids per day, while women should drink about 2.2 liters (9 cups). Be sure to drink water before, during, and after exercise to compensate for lost fluids.Drink water before you are thirsty to stay hydrated.

, Exercise can contribute to a youthful appearance by boosting circulation, firming skin, reducing stress, and eliminating excess body fat. Do at least 30 minutes of moderate cardiovascular exercise (i.e. anything that gets your heart rate up to 50 to 60 percent higher than its resting rate) per day, 5 days a week to elicit results.This rate of exercise, if maintained, can decrease cellular aging in your body by nine years."

Use minimalist, youthful makeup.,
Color your hair.,
Whiten your teeth.,
Invest in a better quality, better fitting wardrobe.",How to Stay Young Looking After 403," Looking overly made up can actually make you look older, so aim for a minimalist, fresh makeup look. Apply a light tinted moisturizer and a small amount of concealer to hide age spots and dark circles. Make your eyes look bigger (and therefore younger) by curling your eyelashes and applying a black mascara. A soft rose color on lips and cheeks will give you a youthful glow., Coloring your hair will not only cover grays but also brighten your look, particularly if you opt for a lighter shade or soft, natural highlights. For the best results, visit a salon to have your hair colored. If your budget does not allow for a salon experience, purchase a semi-permanent, ammonia-free hair dye at your local pharmacy, which will allow you to practice coloring your hair and experiment with different shades with less commitment.Semi-permanent hair dye will generally last for several washes, depending on the brand and the darkness of the color you choose.

, Yellowing teeth are a part of aging and will make you look older regardless of whether you have youthful skin and style. Invest in whitening toothpaste with enzymes and micro-abrasive ingredients, or talk to your dentist about more intensive options like bleaching. In addition, cut back on things that can cause tooth discoloration, such as:Coffee
Tea
Fruit juices
Cigarettes
Soda
Red wine

, To stay looking younger after 40, concentrate on buying clothes that fit well and complement your body rather than following trends. Go for classic, tailored pieces (e.g. a simple, sophisticated black blazer and fitted white shirt) and leave behind more casual, carefree attire (e.g., beach inspired t-shirts and shorts) which may appear inappropriately young and highlight your age. Avoid any clothing that is too loose or too tight, both of which can age your appearance."

Take a break.,
Learn breathing techniques.,
Get away.,
Pamper yourself.,
Disconnect yourself.,
Reassess your life.,
Research various relaxation tips.",How to Rejuvenate Yourself," In some cases, you may be able to take a break and walk away from a stressful situate. Whether you are at work or at home, stepping away can help clear your mind so that you can refocus and approach any issues from a new angle. Take a walk around the block or sit outside for a few moments.;
, Take a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds. Slowly release the breath and wait 5 seconds before taking another breath. As you exhale, imagine you are releasing all the negativity from your mind and body. With each intake of breath, imagine you are ingesting vitality and positivity. Repeat for several minutes until you feel you are relaxed enough to refocus on your tasks.

, Time away can help clear your head and rejuvenate yourself. You could simply take the day off and stay at home or you may wish to truly get away with a vacation. If you go away with family or friends, make sure to keep the atmosphere as free of conflicts as possible. Going from 1 stressful environment to another will not help you restore your energy.

, Spend a day at the spa or give yourself a pedicure and enjoy a long hot bath. Add bath salts and fragrant bubbles to your bath. Lavender is a wonderful scent that helps with rejuvenation. You may also wish to turn on soft, relaxing music in the background and light candles, similar to the environment you would get at a spa.

, If it is at all possible, turn off your cellular phone and computer. Give yourself an hour or a few days of no distractions as you rejuvenate yourself. This will allow you to truly immerse yourself in relaxing activities without distractions from work or other outside influences. You may wish to check messages in case of emergencies, but only check them sporadically and only return calls for things that truly need immediate action.

, You may be feeling stressed because you realize you are not meeting your own needs. Look at the things that make you unhappy in your life and try to find ways to improve those areas. Changes could be as small as blocking off 10 minutes a day to sit and meditate or as large as changing careers and moving. Take the steps you feel will best help you restore your energy and regain control in your life.

, There are all kinds of things you can do to help rejuvenate yourself. You may wish to take up a new hobby, read more, or spend more time in social situations. Not all tips work for everyone, so choose relaxation tips that fit into your lifestyle and what is feasible for you.

Purchase a toothbrush.,
Use lip balm or Vaseline to keep your lips soft and moisturized.,
Buy lip liner.,
Purchase lipstick.,
Use lip gloss or try mattifying.",How to Shop for Lip Makeup Essentials," A toothbrush is useful for exfoliation. The simplest way to get soft, supple lips is to rub gently in circular motions with a toothbrush that has a little Vaseline spread on it. It is recommended that you use a separate toothbrush for this so dead skin cells don't go back in your mouth. Another simple way to exfoliate is to use sugar and olive oil. Just mix a tiny bit together in a bowl and rub in circular motions, and then rinse (or lick) off.;
, Apply the balm or Vaseline before bed, after exfoliating, and any time during the day when your lips feel dry.

, Lip liner is optional, but in order for your following lip products to last, lip liner is an easy option. You want to try to match your lip liner to your lipstick or lip gloss that you're using, or as close as possible. If the lip liner is darker, it will smudge and look harsh, plus it'll make your lips look smaller. If it's lighter, then it'll probably look unfinished.


Line the very edge of your lips starting with the Cupid's bow and fill your lips completely; that way, if the top lip product rubs off, there won't just be a line surrounding your lips.

, After adding your lip liner, you'll usually apply a layer of lipstick. Lipsticks come in various finishes. The finishes include: Matte (no shine), glossy (color or glitter layer with shine), satin/cream (moist full-coverage), frosty (shiny and metallic pigmentation), and sheer (little pigmentation).


The right lipstick finish for your lips depends on whether your lips are dry or not. If you have dry lips, the best lipstick finish for you would be a glossier formula. If you have normal lips you could go for a more matte finish, since that formula tends to be more drying. If you're somewhere in between, a satin/cream finish might be a good choice.
If you aren't sure what colors would suit your skin tone best, you need to know what undertones you have. Warm undertones look best with orange undertone lipsticks, and cool undertones look best with blue undertoned ones with respect to red lipsticks. Usually you can tell which lipsticks look good with your skin by swatching them on your hand.
Warm goes with warm, cool goes with cool. If you aren't sure what undertone you have, you can check simply by looking at the veins on the underside of your wrist. Cool undertones- blue or purple veins; warm undertones- green or olive veins; neutral undertones- blue-green veins.

, Lip gloss is pretty simple. You can choose a color that matches your lipstick, or a clear one to make any lipstick glossy. You can even wear it by itself. If you want to mattify any lipstick, just put a little translucent powder on your finger and pat it on until the powder is undetectable.

Start eating natural, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, healthy meats and fish.,
Avoid empty calories, like those in candy, junk food, and soda.,
Don't be afraid of healthy fat such as those found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fish.,
Don't make yourself feel deprived.,
If your willpower alone is not enough to resist eating unhealthy food, don't feel guilty!,
Make healthy eating convenient.,
Record some data.,
Get enough sleep.,
Use smaller plates and taller glasses.,
Plan portions before eating.,
Put less healthy food farther away from you.,
Eat with friends that eat less.,
Concentrate on what you're eating.",How to Reduce Fat Without Doing Exercise," Much of the food in grocery stores and fast food restaurants is highly processed to make it cheaper to produce and extend its shelf life. This processing often cuts out essential nutrients, and changes the food composition in ways that make you get fat.


Stick to the outside aisles at the grocery store. An easy way to eat better is to shop on the outside aisles, where the fresh foods are kept, and avoid the shelves in the middle where everything is preserved and processed.
Learn to read food labels. Reading the small print on food packaging will help you tell the difference between food that is really good for you and clever food marketing. A lot of ""healthy"" food products make claims that are deliberately misleading in order to trick consumers into buying them.

Check the serving size. Sometimes foods will advertise being low in fat or sugar, and the numbers in the nutritional guide will appear low, but the serving size will be far smaller than a normal serving.
Look at the overall healthfulness of the food, not just an isolated health claim. Many foods claim to be high in fiber, but are also extremely high in sugar and other refined carbohydrates. This makes the food fattening even if it is advertised as healthy.

;
, Again, these have very low nutritional value, and and have a lot of calories packed into small serving sizes.


Be especially wary of refined carbohydrates. These are notorious for causing obesity. Anything that contains flour or sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose) is going to be stored in your body as fat.

Refined carbohydrates can also trigger changes in your body that make your metabolism less efficient.
Sugar can also cause cravings that make you want even more of it later.


Make water your drink of choice. It contains no calories, aids digestion, and can also help flush metabolism-slowing toxins from your system.

Sugary drinks, such as soda or even fruit juice contain a lot of carbohydrates, and therefore add to weight gain.
Diet sodas, though they claim to contain few or no calories, have sweeteners in them that also promote weight gain, and are possibly toxic. , Getting up to 40% of one’s calories from healthy sources of fat is acceptable, especially if this is replacing refined carbohydrates in your diet.This contrasts from the low-fat diets of the 80's and 90's, many of which have been proven ineffective.


Beware of products that are low-fat. Just because something is low in fat, it doesn't mean it's not fattening. Lots of low fat products are loaded with sugar and other refined carbohydrates that will turn into fat in your body once you eat them.
Avoid trans fats. Trans fats such as hydrogenated oils are made by manipulating the chemical structure of natural oils and turning them into something that is completely alien to your body. These not only cause weight gain, but are also implicated in illnesses like heart disease.Limit saturated fat to no more than 10% of your daily food consumption. Recent research has shown that saturated fats such as those found in butter and red meat are not as bad as previously thought, but most mainstream nutritional guides suggest that it may raise LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol levels., The worst thing you can do for your motivation is to feel like you're depriving yourself. Feeling deprived can make you feel anxious, and this can drive you to wards unconscious eating.Don't starve yourself! There are plenty of health risks to not eating regular meals. Furthermore, if your body doesn't get enough to eat, the body prepares to survive what it thinks is a famine by going into ""starvation mode"" and storing extra fat.
At first, add, rather than subtract food to your diet, and figure out what you like. Don't just focus on cutting out unhealthy foods. Find some new, healthy foods to try to start adding them to your eating routines. These foods will replace less healthy foods little by little until your overall food intake is a lot healthier.

, Just understand that you're going to have to be creative about sticking to your diet, even if your willpower fails.


The impulse to eat is vital to survival, and throughout most of human history, the main problem has been getting enough to eat. Our brains and bodies have not yet adjusted to the modern surplus of food.
Salt, sugar, and fat (and all the tasty, modern combinations of the three) are things that our bodies are designed to crave. Again, these were once scarce yet essential nutrients, so in many ways we are ""programmed"" to look for them. , We are faced with an overwhelming number of food decisions every day, so it helps to make healthy food the easiest option. Set up routines with your eating, and have healthy food accessible to you at all times.


Have some standby snacks ready, such as nuts, carrot sticks or fruit for when you get hungry, and make them easier to access than the processed stuff (better still, make healthy food the only food in your house!).
Have some healthy meals you can eat ""by default"" when you're not feeling too picky about what to eat, or when you need something quick and convenient. Instead of stocking up on instant noodles and PB&J, keep salad fixings or veggie casseroles on hand.

, Measure your waistline periodically, or get your body fat measured. Just the act of measuring your body is correlated to losing weight.Keeping track of the results of your diet can be a great motivator.
Remember that weight fluctuates a little each day, so don't get discouraged if the weight on your bathroom scale unexpectedly goes up a bit.

, Research has shown that being sleepy can cause you to overeat. When you're sleepy you often go on autopilot, and might find that you have a much harder time making good decisions., Because of the way the brain processes visual information, the size of your dishes can affect how you decide how much food you're going to need to feel satisfied.If your plates are a lot bigger than your food, you'll feel it isn't enough. Using smaller plates will require less food to make them appear full.
Small, skinny glasses appear to hold more liquid than short, wide ones, even if they have the same volume. Use this optical illusion when you're drinking sweet drinks you want to limit.

, Most people's tendency is to finish whatever is put in front of them, even if they are already full, and food manufacturers know that people will buy and eat more if they are presented with bigger packages.


Don't sit down with a huge bag of potato chips. Put a few in a bowl and stop when the bowl is empty.
Repack mini portions of any snacks you buy in bulk.

, If you put your unhealthy favorites where they are harder to reach, you're much less likely to eat them without thinking. Even just taking things off your desk and putting them on the other side of the room can make a big difference., When people eat socially, they often take cues from their companions about how much to eat. If there are people around you that eat a lot, try taking meals with people that eat less.


If this is impossible or unpleasant, at least be aware of this tendency and notice how other people's eating affects you.
If you tend to eat more when you're alone, try eating more meals around other people and see if this helps., If you're distracted while eating meals, because you're eating in front of the TV or while driving, you're far less likely to notice that you feel full or how much you have eaten. Be conscious of what you're eating and pay attention to the feelings in your body that tell you when you feel full, and you will eat less.

This takes 30 – 40 minutes for the face and about 20 minutes for the neck. Afterwards, a moisturize will be applied.There are two types of device:The more common has a tip that shoots out tiny, rough aluminum oxide crystals that abrade your face before being vacuumed back up along with dead skin cells. It works something like a miniature sandblaster.
The other type has an applicator that applies a fine diamond tip to scrape the skin from your face before the dead cells are sucked up in a vacuum.;

Active acne
Warts
Eczema
Dermatitis
Open sores
Psoriasis (patches of thick, scaly skin)
Lupus
Uncontrolled diabetes

, The average cost of a procedure in the United States is $143,but it may be as low as $15 – $40 in India and other Asian countries.Multiple sessions — usually between 5 and 16 — are required to achieve desired results.Many doctors offer financing plans to make the treatment more affordable for their patients.

, Microdermabrasion is performed by plastic surgeons and dermatologists, and also in spas and salons. Aestheticians at spas and salons may perform effective microdermabrasion, but these providers are unregulated, so you will minimize your risks by choosing a doctor.Doctors can examine your skin to be sure that microdermabrasion is safe for you. To pick a doctor:Talk to your friends. A referral is the best way to find a good clinic.
Ask your physician for a recommendation.
Read online reviews, but be careful. Reviews may be posted by clinic employees.

, You should have a consultation before scheduling your procedure to make sure you are comfortable with the facility, that microdermabrasion is safe for you, and to ask the doctor any questions you might have, such as:Are you certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Dermatology?
How many treatments will be needed?
What are the possible side effects?
Is the procedure safe for me?
Do you have any before-and-after photos?
How much will it cost? Do you have payment plans?

, Tretinoin (Atralin, Refissa, Tretin-X) is used to treat severe acne. Use results in an increased risk of scarring after microdermabrasion treatment. You will need to wait at least six months after your last usage before undergoing microdermabrasion., Some physicians ask patients to use a special type of skincare product prior to microdermabrasion to ensure the surface of the dermis is in top condition at the time of the treatment. These solutions are often available through the doctor's office where the procedure is performed. If not, be sure to fill your prescription early so that you can start using the solution on time.

, Because microdermabrasion works by peeling away a layer of skin, any treatments that leave your skin more sensitive can lead to discomfort or other complications. Be sure to discuss any treatments you may have recently had with your doctor.Treatments to avoid include:


Facials
Waxing
Tweezing
Electrolysis
Laser treatments
Injections of collagen or BOTOX
Chemical peels

, Sun can damage your skin and make it more sensitive, so you’ll want to avoid sun exposure as much as possible, especially in the week before your treatment.Even when not preparing for microdermabrasion, you should always apply sunscreen when going outside for more than a few minutes, even on overcast days.

, You want your skin as healthy as possible before the treatment, and cigarette smoke inhibits blood circulation in the skin. You’ll want to stop smoking for at least the week before your procedure, and for better, long-lasting results and healthy skin (not to mention a reduced risk of cancer), you should stop smoking altogether., If the drugs are over the counter, simply stop. If they are prescribed, consult your doctor first. These anti-inflammatories increase the risk of bleeding or facial rashes as a result of the procedure.NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) include:Aspirin
Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
Naproxen (Aleve)
Celecoxib (Celebrex)
Diclofenac (Cambia, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR, Zipsor, Zorvolex)
Mefenamic acid (Ponstel)
Indomethacin (Indocin)
Oxaprozin (Daypro)
And the following: aceclofenac, etodolac, etoricoxib, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, meclofenamate, meloxicam, nabumetone, piroxicam, sulindac, and tolmetin.

, Most topical medications use acids to peel away outer layers of skin. They will leave your skin more sensitive, leading to potential discomfort.Discuss any products you are using with your doctor before microdermabrasion. Do not use:


Alpha hydroxy acid products containing glycolic or lactic acid
Salicylic acid products
Retinoids (Retin A, Renova, Differin, Tazorac)
Benzoyl peroxide

, Microdermabrasion can occasionally lead to a reoccurrence. To avoid this your doctor can prescribe antiviral medication to take before your treatment., Instead of soap, use a syndet bar (a cleaner that uses a synthetic detergent) or a lipid-free cleaner to clean your face and neck.These cleaners help to preserve moisture in your face much better than soap. Look for cleaners that contain glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, sodium laurel, or sulfate., To avoid possible adverse effects, you want your skin to be as healthy as possible going into the treatment.

Gain a better understanding of nudism.,
Get dressed again.,
Take it one room at a time.,
Branch out.,
Talk to your close ones about it.,
Meet like-minded people.,
Consider taking a ""nacation."",
If you're not comfortable, keep it private.",How to Practise Nudism in Your Room With No One Knowing," Shut and lock all the doors and windows in the room that you'll be staying in. Especially at night, pull the shades or blinds. Put a towel or blanket along the bottom of your door if there is a gap between it and the floor. You want complete privacy with no interference. It's common courtesy for people in nudist clubs to bring their own towels to sit on, so you can start this practice in your own room.


Make sure that you have plenty of things to do, and that you can keep to yourself for the period of time that you have in mind.;
, Put your clothes in a pile in the same order that you'd put them on so you can get dressed if someone comes knocking on your door. If you're really worried about getting caught nude, then you should do this. However, you can also keep a towel around, quickly wrap yourself in it, and claim that you were about to take a shower if someone comes in.

, Now that you've removed any obstacles in your way, as well as your clothes, you can just go about your daily life. So, don't do anything particularly special just because you're in the buff. Real nudists just do what they normally do, only nude -- even if they are able to enjoy life a little more and feel more liberated as a result. Here are some things you can do in your room:


Have fun. Read a book, play a computer game, watch TV, draw, paint, play solitaire, do word searches, play guitar, it doesn't matter what you do as long as you are nude while doing it.
Get down to business. Refine your resume, do computer research, do your taxes, clean your room, organize photos, and so on. Things that might otherwise not be much fun to do (i.e. cleaning) are often much enjoyable to do while nude.
Get healthy. Moderate exercise, stretching, or yoga is very beneficial while nude, especially in front of a full-length mirror, as one can see which muscles and ligaments come into play.






Give yourself a self-massage. While you are not able to reach your back, you can massage your legs, arms, torso, feet, hands, stomach, scalp, and other places you can relieve tension.
Pamper yourself. While nude with an extended amount of time at your disposal, it is a good time to apply moisturizing lotion all over your body as you relax on a blanket.
Be bold. Call a friend on the phone and talk in the nude with your friend being none the wiser. See how it feels to interact on a platonic level with a friend without having any clothes on. If you feel perfectly comfortable, you may want to join a nudist group in the future, when you're ready.






Know that it's not about the sexy stuff. Though you may be tempted to touch yourself while you're in the nude, which is, of course, perfectly natural, remember that one of the core principles of nudism is that it is practiced in a non-sexual manner. That is why it is important to have as many other things to fill your time as possible once you shut your door.

, Many people sleep naked just because they think it feels good, even if they don't consider themselves nudists. If you're serious about practicing nudism alone in your room, then a great way to do it is to go to bed naked; if you're caught, people won't think it's too strange, because plenty of people do it. Keep a bathrobe handy if you have to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. If you're serious about nudism, you can just wake up in the morning and continue to be nude for as long as it's possible.

, Another great thing to do while you're all alone in your room is to research nudism online. You should have a firm understanding of what you're really doing if you want to truly practice nudism. There are many misconceptions about nudism that you need to be aware of before you can say you truly understand it. Here are some things you may learn:Many nudists actually prefer to be called naturists.
Nudism isn't meant to be sexual. Being naked is meant to be perfectly natural instead of causing arousal.
Nudism is about gaining back the freedom little kids feel about being nude. You have to stop thinking about the restrictions that society has placed on you and return you your inner child. Nudism is playful.
Nudism is also called naturism because it's all about returning to your natural state.
While it's illegal to be nude in a public place, the practice of nudism as a whole is not illegal, unless you're living in Arkansas, Saudi Arabia, Iran, or a few other locations.
Nudism is not sexually deviant. Nudists have perfectly healthy sex lives; they just don't make their daily lifestyle any more sexual just because they aren't wearing clothes. Nor does this mean that they are asexual. Being part of a nudist group does not mean that you have to be overly sexual just because you're in the buff.
You don't have to have a perfect body to be a nudist. You just have to be comfortable with what you've got.
You don't have to be naked all the time to be a nudist, either. Many nudists hold regular jobs and wear regular clothes when they ""have to,"" though they are always looking for opportunities to be nude and express themselves.

, Unfortunately, you can't be naked in your room forever. Whether you're meeting friends at the movies or having a family dinner, it's time to put those clothes back on and to go out into the world. If you really are starting to feel restricted doing this and can't bear to be walking around with your clothes on all day, then you can start thinking about taking your nudism to the next level.

, Once you're fully comfortable practicing nudism in the comfort of your own room, you can take it to the next level. If you just want to do it in your room, then chances are it's because you live with roommates or family members who may not be super understanding of your lifestyle. If that's the case, then either you talk to them about it or see how they react (the harder option), or just start exploring other rooms in the house when you know nobody is home.


Start by just going in the buff from your room to the bathroom before and after a shower. Then, try going to another room naked, even if only for a few minutes.
When you know no one will be home for a few hours, you can shut the blinds, and have fun hanging out all over the house in the buff.
Just make sure to have a back up plan in case people come home earlier than you expected (if you really care about explaining why you're watching TV in the buff.)
You can always keep a towel around to cover yourself up and say you were just getting into the shower. However, if you really believe in nudism, then you don't want to be sneaking around forever, do you?

, Once you've mastered being nude at home, you can take it a step further. If you live in a relatively secluded area, or near one, then see how good it feels to get nude in your backyard, in the woods behind your house, or even on a deserted beach nearby. Just be prepared for the reactions of people who may see you and could get the wrong impression, and try to do it in a place that is as isolated as possible. For example, you can go on a little hike into a deserted wooded area or swim out to a secluded part of a lake, and then go commando.


See how it feels to be so close to the elements. Is this something you'd like to do more long term, and without feeling like you're sneaking around?

, If you've liked the freedom and liberation you've felt from going in the nude, then you may want to have a conversation with your loved ones about it. Talk to your best friend, your boyfriend, or even your parents, if you feel that this desire has become an essential part of you that people should know about. Be prepared for people not to understand what nudism is all about and to be a little bit skeptical or judgmental, at first. But don't worry -- they'll come around. And if they don't, you'll find a way to manage.

, If you feel good about being a nudist, then you can take your interest to the next level by jointing AANR (American Association for Nude Recreation) or a similar league for people who are interested in maintaining their rights to be nude and to know where they can go to safely practice nudism.This organization as well as others can help you find clubs where you can practice your nudism, whether you're meeting at a private residence or a health club.


You can also look out for nudist beaches or resorts, whether you're in the USA, France, or other nudist-friendly locations.
Don't be afraid. If you find the right home, you won't be entering into a overly-sexualized, predatory environment. Make sure you look into the ideals of the group you want to join before you take the plunge. Nude recreation is supposed to be about acceptance of the self and respecting your individuality as well as the freedom of others, and feeling liberated, not uncomfortable., If you're not quite comfortable with the idea of going in the buff in the place where you currently live, consider branching out by finding resorts that are nude-only. You can use a regular vacation search website and hone your search to ""nudist spa vacations"" to find a resort that is perfect for you, whether you're looking in Mexico or the California hills.This can be a great way to immerse yourself in the life of nudism without feeling like you'll run in to your mom or your fourth grade teacher., Public nudism isn't for everyone. If you just want to stick to being nude in your room or your house, then there's nothing wrong with keeping it that way. You don't have to be nude outside, in public, or around a bunch of other nudists. It's all about expressing your mind and body in the way that makes you happy. So enjoy being nude -- wherever you're doing it!

Find the vertical grooves in the ball.,
Decide whether to use one or two hands.,
Bend your arm to about a 110-degree angle at your elbow.,
Hold the ball in your dominant hand with your finger pads.,
Start with your fingertips pointing toward your body.,
Take your non-dominant hand and place it on the side of the ball, slightly closer to the back of the ball.,
Make the toss.,
Practice the toss several times.,
Catch the ball on the tip of your dominant index finger.,
Move your arm upward to meet the ball.,
Bring your arm back down to a comfortable position when you make contact with the ball.,
Make sure your finger is directly in the center of the ball where the grooves meet.,
Spin it on your fingernail for a faster, smoother spin.,
Maintain momentum with your non-dominant hand.,
Finished.









",How to Spin a Basketball on Your Finger," You will want to spin the ball on the bottom middle of the ball where all of the grooves meet in a perpendicular point. If you spin the ball with the grooves in a horizontal position, your spin won't look as clean and your finger won't have a point to rest on.;
, Some people will prefer to use two hands to throw and guide the ball into the air before catching it with their finger. Others prefer to palm the basketball in one hand and use a quick flick of the wrist to prop the ball up to the fingertip.









, You want your elbow to be at a comfortable height, usually a little bit higher than your hip. The ball should be about level with your face when you spin it.









, This should be the same hand that you will use to spin the ball. Do not hold the ball entirely flat on your palm, as this causes the ball to slide around too easily. Instead grip it with your fingertips and allow for a small air pocket between your palm and the ball.









, By the time you finish the twist of your wrist, your hand will have made a 180-degree twist and your fingertips will be pointing away from your body.









, You want your thumb to be directly in the middle between the top and the bottom of the ball because it will provide the majority of the force as you toss the ball.









, Simultaneously flick your dominant hand 180-degrees, pinky leading, while flicking your thumb on your non-dominant hand forward to spin the ball. Be sure to complete the two motions at the same time in order to create an equal force on both sides of the ball. Use your finger pads on your dominant hand to guide the ball in the proper direction. If you choose to only use one hand to complete the spin, disregard the non-dominant thumb.









, You want to get the ball to spin very quickly regardless of whether you are using one or two hands. The toss should not be very high above your dominant fingers and should only float a few inches into the air so that you can quickly place your finger under the ball. If you toss the ball too high it will be very difficult (and somewhat painful) to catch with your finger.










The faster the ball spins, the longer you will be able to hold it on your finger.
Be aware that extremely fast balls are more difficult to balance, however.

, Once you've mastered the speed and height of the ball toss, you should be able to catch the ball on your finger without much difficulty. The closer you can keep your hand to the ball, the easier it will be.









, You don't want the ball to be floating on its own for very long, so allow your arm to float up and make contact with the bottom of the ball.









, Do so slowly in a gradual downward motion until your arm is at a comfortable resting height.









, This position will make it easiest to keep the ball in a steady position.









, The nail allows the ball to spin with less resistance. However, if that position is uncomfortable for you, you can spin the ball on your finger pad instead.









, Gradually learn to create a faster spin by slapping the side of the ball with your non-dominant hand in the same direction that the ball is spinning. At first, slapping the ball will probably cause it to fall off of your finger, but eventually you will be able to slap it without causing it to fall.










Slap the side of the ball in three to four slap increments and make sure not to slap too hard.
A light, but swift slap should be enough to keep the ball going without disrupting the spin.

Answer questions about your medical history truthfully so that your doctor can work to keep your side effects at a minimum.,
Talk to your doctor about ceasing to take certain medications before your Botox injection.,
Plan to stop taking any aspirin-like medications at least four days before the procedure.,
Avoid drinking alcohol for at least two days before you receive Botox.,
Bring non-steroid, anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs with you to fight pain, swelling and headache.,
Have an ice pack with you to reduce bruising after the procedure.,
Arrange for someone to drive you home.,
Avoid doing strenuous exercise.,
Watch out for the serious adverse effects of your procedure and notify your doctor if they occur.,
Be aware of the side effects of Botox.,
Understand why the side effects can occur.,
Be aware of the “spread of toxin” effect and know that it is not permanent.,
Know that while Botox is generally safe, some people should not get Botox.",How to Prepare for Botox Side Effects," Before your first Botox treatment, your doctor may ask you for a thorough medical history along with any history of therapeutic drug use.


It is very important that you answer your doctor’s questions accurately and honestly, as some drugs are not suitable to be taken in conjunction with Botox treatments.
Even health supplements such as vitamin tablets and fish oils should be brought to your doctor’s attentions, as these can thin the blood and cause more bruising post-treatment.;
, Specific medication that you may need to stop taking before your Botox treatment include:Painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen)
Certain herbal remedies
Antibiotics
Heart disease-related drugs
Alzheimer’s disease drugs
Neurological disease drugs
Vitamin-mineral supplements

, Your doctor may advise you to stop taking any aspirin-like products for a minimum of 4 days before the procedure.


This is due to the fact that aspirin causes bleeding, as it is an antiplatelet drug that prevents the blood from clotting.
Taking aspirin before a Botox treatment may cause excessive bleeding during and after the procedure.

, Having alcohol in your system can make bruising and bleeding worse during a Botox procedure, so avoid consuming any alcoholic drinks for at least two days before the treatment.

, These medications will help you manage the pain, headache, and swelling following a Botox treatment. NSAIDs inhibit the body’s production of prostaglandin, the hormone responsible for pain and inflammation. You can take these NSAIDs:



Acetaminophen (Tylenol). It is available in 200-400mg tablets and you can take it every 4 to 6 hours or as needed for pain management.

Ibuprofen (Advil). It is available in 200 to 400mg tablets and you can take it every 4 to 6 hours as needed.

, It’s a good idea to have an ice pack with you that you can use directly after the procedure in order to prevent bruising.


Be sure to wrap the ice pack in a cloth or towel to prevent directly damaging your skin. What's more, be sure to keep it on the area for only about 15 minutes, also to prevent damage.
The cold from the ice pack constricts the blood vessels underneath the skin, reducing the level of bleeding. The ice pack will also temporarily relieve any pain and inflammation caused by the injection.

, You should arrange for a friend or family member to drive you home following the Botox procedure. Since Botox causes your eyelids to relax and your facial muscles to droop, it may be dangerous for you to drive or operate any kind of machinery for at least 2 to 4 hours following the procedure.

, Avoid strenuous exercise for at least 24 hours following the Botox procedure, as the movement may cause the Botox toxin to spread to other parts of the body. Movement is fine, just make sure it's minimal.


If the Botox spreads to parts of the body it is not supposed to be in, you may experience adverse side effects.

, Symptoms like slight pain, inflammation, bruising, bleeding and drooping eyelids are normal following a Botox procedure. However, there are other, abnormal side effects that should not be experienced after Botox. If any of the follow symptoms occur, contact a medical professional immediately:


Difficulty in breathing and swallowing
Swelling of eyes and unusual eye discharges
Chest pain
Hoarse voice
Severe muscle weakness
Drooping of both eyelids and eyebrows
Presence of muscle weakness in areas that are away from the site of injection

, Botox has several adverse side effects that are completely normal, but can be rather unpleasant. These include:


Swelling at the site of injection
Pain and tenderness at the site of injection
Bruising
Drooping of eyelids
Muscle weakness
Nausea, vomiting and headaches
Excessive sweating in your underarms
Difficulty swallowing
Flu-like symptoms

, The Botox procedure basically involves having a bacterial toxin injected into your skin. The body will recognize this toxin as a foreign substance and produce an immune response, which results in the symptoms described above.


In some sensitive people, this immune response against the toxin may be severe (a reaction medically known as hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis). However, this is rare and does not occur amongst most patients.Bruising usually occurs in patients with pre-existing blood disorders such as anemia because their blood tends to be thinner which results in a poor healing process and hence more bruising.

, You might have come across this term whilst doing your own research. Basically, Botox is administered at a particular, small, local site which means the effect acts particularly in that place without affecting the surroundings. At least, normally. In some cases, it doesn't.


However, if you perform any strenuous work or in case of bruising, the toxin might spread to other places around the site of injection which can lead to the spread of the toxin which could paralyze the muscles in unwanted areas leading to effects such as eye drooping.
This phenomenon is called the” spread of toxin” effect. It is one of the most common side effects of Botox treatment; however, it is temporary and will usually disappears on its own within a few weeks.

, Botox is generally safe and can be administered to the vast majority of people without any danger of harmful side effects. However, there are some people for whom Botox is not safe. These include:Pregnant and lactating mothers should not take the treatment as it can prove harmful to the baby.
People with a history of neuromuscular diseases are not fit for the treatment as it can actually make their condition even worse, since the whole principle behind Botox is paralysis of muscles.
Patients with underlying heart diseases or blood disorders are also advised against the treatment as they are more prone to bruising.
People with Botox allergies. Unfortunately, there are no ways to determine whether one is allergic to Botox or not. There are no skin tests or test dose procedures that can satisfactorily determine any presence of allergy to the toxin.

Step in with your stronger foot first.,
Keep your weaker hand on the side of the ball, just enough to keep the ball balanced on your hand.








,
Hold the ball with the tips of your fingers, as though you are holding a waiter's tray.,
Extend your shooting hand fully when you are letting go of the ball (this is part of follow through).,
Use your legs when you shoot, bending the knees (not a full squat), then to elevate quickly, rising: that is, straighten your legs as you shoot.,
Work up to shooting three pointers, one angle at a time to build muscle memory for perfecting hand and eye coordination.,
Always remember.,
Always jump when you shoot.,
Practice at least one crossover, so that you can trick your opponent in order to have more time to shoot.,
Think fast on your feet, and don't be intimidated, even if there is a person coming at you.,
Visualize yourself making every shot!",How to Shoot a Three Pointer," If right handed, when you are about to shoot make sure your right big-toe is aligned with your right elbow.









As you step out slightly with your stronger foot, remember to bend your knees. Bent knees will help you explode upward, getting more height and a better angle on the basket.;
,, You are holding the ball incorrectly, if you check after the game and your palm is dirty.








, Your weaker hand should stay where it is, floppy and relaxed. You also want to flick your wrist as you release, for backspin, for a nice soft touch (for your shooting hand).









Backspin will create more rotation on the ball. If the ball doesn't go in the basket at first, the additional rotation will make it go in.

, A good way to build up muscle in your legs is doing squats and wall sits. If you strengthen your triceps, you don't need to use your legs as much. You should also try doing calf raises/squats with weights on your shoulders.








, Work on that one line of sight working away from the basket:









Visualize a line toward the basket and many lines about 1 foot (0.3 m) apart, horizontally, squaring-up, facing the basket at that angle. These lines go from the basket back down the court to the three point line and will indicate places to stand, each about one foot deeper.
Standing (set your off-foot, then step into your shot with the shooting foot stepping toward the basket as you extend your arm and release) close to the basket and shooting at least five times (reps/repetitions). In a different practice session practice dribbling up to a spot, doing a jump-stop and quickly align and shoot. In other sessions practice with a partner who will pass the ball to you, to practice ""catch and shoot"" -- using good form all the time, not flopping/goofing around (but not stiff, either).
Move a foot behind that one and shoot five more times, keeping moving back after you finish five reps at each mark. This helps you to gradually learn your own strength, build the muscle memory and your hand-eye coordination for accuracy at longer distances (that's all on one angle). Next take a breather/water-break and choose another angle to start close up and work outward on that one.

, B.E.E.F:









Balance. Every good shooter begins with balance, always line your shooting foot up with the basket and be on balance this is the B in BEEF, BALANCE.
Elbow. Keep your forearm straight, in a groove, not wobbling around on each shoot. After you have your balance, have your elbow on your shooting hand line up to make an L right under the ball (when the wrist is raised to near the eye level).
Eyes. Focus on the goal, where you want the ball to hit, basically above the rim, so the ball will go into the goal.
Follow through. After you release the ball, keep your hand up in the air, as if you were reaching into a cookie jar/the basket (for a second).

Keeping your eye on the target (the square in the backboard) is an important part of your follow through.



, This will allow you to have more power in your shot and will enable you to shoot over opponents. Practice the same way each time, until you have this perfected. Naturally, in game situations there will be distractions and obstacles, but practicing shots thousands of reps makes shooting automatic, with consistently good form.








, Do not rush into your shot unless you have to.








, You may fake by raising the ball upward, then if that defender leaves his or her feet (jumps), then you'll jump while the defender will be coming down. If you're fouled by the jumping-defender, you go to the foul line and make your best shot.








, Be confident!

Put your hip toward the basket.,
Aim your toes at 10 o'clock.,
Sweep and sway.,
Shoot the ball properly with a traditional follow-through.,
Keep it simple.",How to Shoot Like Kevin Durant1," The most distinctive thing about Kevin Durant's shooting technique is that he doesn't square up to the basket to take a shot, he instead aligns himself by pointing his hip to the hole. Some analysts believe that squaring up this way can help to take tension away from the neck and shoulders, resulting in a more natural action, though it traditionally isn't the way shooting is taught.;
, Likewise, Durant's feet aren't aimed at the hoop when he shoots, but turned to approximately 10 on the clock, if the basket is 12. Some other shooters, like Dirk Nowitzki, orient themselves to the basket similarly, lessening the torque on the neck and shoulders and throwing off defenders.

, Durant doesn't jump straight up in the air when he takes a shot. Instead, he sweeps his feet forward and sways his shoulders back, resulting in a high-arcing shot that he's learned to make incredibly accurate. It's not the most technically-perfect form for a shot from long-range, but it has yielded great shooting percentages for KD.

, Unlike Reggie Miller and Kobe, who have strange off-kilter follow-throughs, Durant's shot itself is fairly straightforward and his technique is pure, other than his foot placement. He keeps his elbows in tight, puts his hand in the cookie jar during the follow through, and almost always makes his shot.

, Unlike flashier players like LeBron and Kobe, Kevin Durant's game is basically built around his jump shot, which he earns by making his way to space and passing the ball, not by using step-jukes and other methods of shaking the player. Unlike other tall ballers, Durant also hops on almost every shot, however close he is to the ball, using his good arcing from any distance.

Use gentle pressure to avoid irritation., Rinse your feet every 1-2 minutes to wash away dead skin. Continue scrubbing gently until your feet are smooth. Rinse and pat your feet dry with a clean towel., To maintain soft, smooth feet, use a pumice stone on your feet between one and three times a week. If you don't have the time to soak your feet regularly, use the pumice stone after showering when your skin is softest. Rub your feet with the pumice stone for a few minutes each time and always use gentle, circular movements., Be sure to rinse your pumice stone thoroughly after every use. Clean it after every 3 or 4 uses by scrubbing it with an old toothbrush and an antibacterial liquid soap. Rinse it and allow it to air dry.To give your pumice stone a more intense cleaning, boil it in a mixture of 4 cups of water and 2 tbsp. of bleach or vinegar.

, Pumice stones should never be shared as they can spread fungus or strains of HPV that cause plantar warts. Avoid sharing a pumice stone with family members, as even one use can lead to the transmission of such foot ailments. Store your pumice stone somewhere outside of the shower or bathroom to ensure that no other members of your household use it., Pumice powder is made from a kind of igneous rock that forms after a volcano erupts. the powder is used as an exfoliating element in beauty products, but can also be found as an additive in cement, heavy duty cleaners, and herbal medicine.

Add 2 ml (0.4 tsp) of peppermint oil and mix the ingredients together with gloved hands. Transfer your foot scrub to a jar to store it for use.If stored in a cool, dry place the scrub should last 1-2 years.

, Apply the scrub generously to your feet. Massage it into the skin of your feet in circular motions for several minutes. Rinse and dry your feet, then apply lotion if desired."

Take lots of high-probability attempts.,
Take the ball inside.,
Shoot from your strong side.,
Practice constantly.",How to Shoot Like Kevin Durant2," Durant shoots the ball. A lot. If you want to start shooting like KD shoots, start taking lots of shots and upping your shooting average. Focus more during practice on pure shooting drills and less on dribbling or other types of exercise. The jump shot is key to Durant's success and his playing style.


Don't hog the ball, wait for high-probability attempts at a range you're sure you can hit from. Unlike Kobe, who makes plays from scratch, Durant's a team player who waits for the play to come to him.

, Like lots of high-scorers, Kevin Durant is deadly on the inside. His drive and his dribbling skills on the cut aren't necessarily his most famous attributes, but shot-diagrams prove that the majority of his points come from inside. His tremendous height makes his inside play aggressive and high-probability, especially when matched with his outside accuracy.

, Shot charts show that the majority of Durant's points come from his right side, both in the paint and outside 3-point range. While he's accurate, or at least at the league average from all over the court, he's most deadly from the right side. Again, one of the Durant trademarks is his smarts, and knowing where the high-probability shots are and when to take them.


Durant is less accurate from long-range when he's lined up straight on, and takes less attempts from that location on the court. To shoot like Durant, take it on an angle when you're in long-range, or cut into the paint., If you want to shoot like Durant, there's no quick fix. You've got to start working on a regular shooting routine, practicing until you've got a jump shot you can take in your sleep. Practice on your strong side and your weak side, practice after running sprints when you're exhausted and can barely lift your arms, practice three pointers, turn-around jumpers, and free throws. Practice constantly.

Warm up.,
Start your layup outside the key on either side.,
Make a buffer between you and the defender to cut inside.,
Drive to the baseline.,
Jump outwards towards the opposite side of the rim.,
Delay the pickup of your reverse layup before the shot.,
Make the shot.",How to Shoot a Reverse Layup in Basketball1," Shooting the reverse layup involves executing swift, sharp drives across the court to the opposite side of the basket. This kind of activity can easily strain muscles in your legs. To prevent this, you should warm up before attempting the reverse layup. To warm up, you might:Do some light stretching. Touch your toes. Brace yourself against a wall and incline each foot, one at a time, to stretch your calves, and so on, until your muscles are warmed up.
Do some light calisthenics, like lunges, jumping jacks, a few laps around the court, or other kinds of light aerobic exercise.;
, Technically, it's possible to perform a reverse layup at a closer distance. However, for the purpose of mastering the mechanics of this technique, you should begin your approach for this shot outside the key.


There are many angles of attack you could use for the reverse layup, but all traditional ones drive from either side of the free throw lane to the opposite side of the basket.
True beginners can locate the key on the court by looking for the keyhole shape formed by the paint of the free throw lane and the semicircle at the top of that lane., If a defender sees you coming, they might block you from cutting to their inside (towards the basket) and crossing to the opposite side of the hoop. Try to create enough space between you and the defender that you have a clean route to drive to the baseline.


The baseline is the boundary line for either side of the court directly underneath the basket of each time.
While approaching the basket for your reverse layup, you might juke to the outside (away from the basket) to throw off the defender, then cut hard to their inside to the opposite side of the basket., Now that you've created space enough for your approach, drive to the baseline of the opposite side of the basket. When you are about two steps from the opposite side of the rim, you'll need to take hold of the ball and prepare to make the shot.


You may have to adjust to defense while taking this shot. This may mean that you have to begin the jump for your reverse layup a step early or late and adjust accordingly.

, As you cut across the free throw lane to the baseline, one side of your leg will face inside (toward the basket), and the other outside (toward the court). Drive downward off your inside leg and jump toward the opposite side of the rim.


The reverse layup can be shot from either side of the free throw lane. No matter which side you approach from, always jump off your inside leg.
When jumping, it is often instinct to look down or at the ball. Losing sight of the basket will only hurt your shot. Incline your head slightly while jumping to keep the basket in view., An instant after you begin your jump, you'll need to take the ball and make the shot. When taking hold of the ball, delay your pickup slightly so you grip the ball high in the arc of its bounce. The ball should be at about chest level before you make the shot., At this point, one of your hands will be facing inside (toward the basket) and the other outside (toward the court). Take the ball in your outside hand while jumping, extend your arm, and flip the ball off the backboard and into the hoop.Unlike many distance shots, the reverse layup doesn't require you to shoot from the knees. Instead, focus on a strong, consistent, clean shooting motion."

However, every good shooter begins with balance, there is always a nail at the middle of the free throw line, find the nail or dot and line your shooting foot up with it and be on balance this is the B in BEEF, Balance.
Keep your Elbow straight. After you have your balance, have your elbow on your shooting hand line up to make an L right under the ball. Make sure your fingers are spread to insure backspin.
Focus your Eyes on the rim. Keep your eyes on the back of the rim, so you are basically looking through the net. Aim for the back of the rim.
Follow through. After you release the ball, keep your hand up in the air for a second or two after the ball leaves it, as though you were reaching into a cookie jar.;

Step up to the line with confidence. Even if you don't make the shot, it's the experience that counts, right?

, Many shooters in the NBA and other professional leagues do a few dribbles or spins with the ball before they shoot. Maybe it's holding the ball in each hand, or evening out your feet, but find a method that works for you. This method should help you to focus precisely on your shot.

Know how many shots you get. If it is a one on one foul, you will be given only one shot. Always be alert and prepared. Although the chance may be slight that the ball will come your way, be ready to catch it when it does.

"
"
Shoot closer to the baseline to protect your shots.,
Add spin to your shot for better backboard action.,
Drill your reverse layups.",How to Shoot a Reverse Layup in Basketball2," The closer you shoot to the baseline, the more your shot will be protected from potential blocks by the backboard. However, as you approach the baseline, your shooting angle will diminish. This can make for a more challenging shot to some.


In many cases, defense will determine just how close you can get to the basket. You may not always be able to perform the layup close to the baseline.
Taller and more aggressive defense may require reverse layups to be very close to the baseline., Spin on your ball will cause it to grip the backboard, allowing you to utilize more of the backboard when making your shot. As you release the ball, flick your wrist slightly to impart spin to the shot.


Each basketball player is different, so you should experiment with how you flick your wrist and the intensity with which you flick to find the way that works best for you., To be able to perform this shot in an instant on the court, you'll need it to be second nature. This means you'll have to practice it until the mechanics are deeply ingrained in your muscle memory. To drill for the reverse layup, you might:


Place four cones on the key. One cone should be placed at each elbow, and one at each second free throw block.
Start behind either elbow cone. Fake a shot, like you might while creating a buffer between you and the defense to cut to the inside, then take a single step back with your right foot.
Push off with your back right foot and cut to the hoop on the outside of the cones. When you are beside the cone at the second free throw block, drive to the baseline.
Shoot the reverse layup. Jump off your inside foot, delay your ball pickup slightly, and use your outside hand to flip the ball off the backboard and into the basket."
"
Attempt a finger roll.,
Try out the teardrop.,
Alternate between variations for greater versatility.",How to Shoot a Reverse Layup in Basketball3," This kind of shot travels higher in the air than the traditional reverse layup, which means it can get over defenders that might otherwise block it. However, this move can be difficult to master, and it has the disadvantage of being one-handed, which makes it more vulnerable. To perform this variation:


As you pick up the ball to make a traditional reverse layup, keep the ball firmly palmed and begin extending your arm to the basket.
When you near the backboard, extend your fingers and allow the ball to roll off your fingertips, sending the basketball off the backboard and into the basket., The main feature of this variation is its early release before a defender can meet you and block the shot. This can take defense by surprise and give you the opening you need. To shoot the teardrop:


Approach the defense and read the situation. If you're up against players significantly taller who might give you blocking grief, you're in a good position to shoot the teardrop.
Begin your approach as you would a traditional reverse layup, but begin your inside leg jump while still on the fringes or center of the key. This should be initiated while there is still a gap between you and the defense.
Bring up your outside leg as you spring upward to follow the raising motion of your outside arm, which should be holding the ball. Straighten your arm and leg as you reach the top of your jump, and shoot the ball at the basket.
When shooting, loft the ball in a high arc with a soft touch, and decrease the ball's rotation by using a lighter touch than usual in your follow through., The traditional reverse layup, the finger roll, and the teardrop all have strengths and weaknesses. Which of these best suits your situation will depend on circumstance, so being able to alternate between these styles easily will strengthen your offensive game.

"
"
Line up the ball, not your body, with the rim.,
Keep your legs hip width apart and your shoulders square to the basket.,
Place your weight forward into your toes, but keep your back straight.,
Bend your legs a little at the knees.,
Hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand, specifically your thumb, pointer, and middle fingers.,
Use your free hand to balance the ball.,
Make sure your elbow is straight and close to your body.,
Keep your eyes on the rim.,
Take a deep breath, bend your knees slightly, and shoot.,
Follow-through on your toes.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Find your free throw ritual.,
Do a shooting drill.,
Work up to making a free throw with your eyes closed.",How to Shoot a Basketball Free Throw," Using the middle of the free-throw stripe to position yourself can lead to an awkward 30 to 45 angle to the rim, and likely a bad free throw shot.Instead, hold the ball in your shooting hand. Then, stand in front of the basket and draw an invisible line from the ball in your hand to the rim of the basket.
Your right toes will be just to the left of center and your right arm should line up with the basket.
Positioning yourself this way will minimize your left-to-right or right-to-left movement and give you a more consistent free throw shot.
If you are a left handed shooter, you may want to practice a two handed free throw. It’s difficult to be an accurate shooter with two hands, so you can use your left hand as your shooting hand if it feels comfortable.;
, Some shooters keep their toes lined up behind the free throw line. Some shooters stagger their feet slightly. Try to find a stance where you feel balanced. You don’t want a lopsided stance as this will lead to a poor shot.If you are a right handed shooter, your left foot may be a bit further back from your right foot. If you’re a left handed shooter, your right foot may be a bit further back from your left foot., Don’t lean forward. Simply transfer your weight forward into your toes.


Keeping your back straight will keep you from stepping over the free throw line and getting a foul in a game.

, Your legs are what will provide the upward power for your shot. So you want to place your weight in your toes and bend your legs to access this power, or the “up” motion.Some players find it more natural to stand with their knees straight and then initiate the shooting motion by dipping down and bending their knees. Then, they will straighten their knees as they go up for the shot, or a “down then up” motion. Do whatever technique feels comfortable and natural for you.

, Do not hold the ball in the palm of your shooting hand, as you won’t generate enough power from your palm to throw the ball properly.


Hold the ball so the black lines on the basketball are going across the ball. This will help with your throw.
There should be a little pocket of space between your palm and the ball.
Press your thumb, pointer and middle fingers against the ball to get a sense of the right hand placement. When you release the ball, those three fingers should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin, giving you a better chance of a successful shot.

, Hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand and place your other hand on the other side of the ball.


Your shooting hand should be under the ball and your free hand should be beside the ball. It will act as your guide hand and make sure the ball stays balanced as you take the free throw.

, Don’t let your elbow flap out to one side. Scoop it down and up so it is close to your body and in line with the rim. It should make an “L” shape.

, As you shoot, don’t take your eyes off the target! Lock your eyes on the rim, not the ball. The sudden jerk of your head from the rim to the ball will throw off your shot.

, Your thumb, pointer and middle finger should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin or rotation on the ball.


Make sure you come up on your toes as you release the ball. Coming up on your toes will ensure you are releasing as much power as possible from your legs into the shot.
Make sure your back is straight and you aren’t lunging forward with your upper body.
If you miss the basket by a few feet, this means you may need more power. Adjust this by jumping a little on your release to give your shot more power.
If you overshoot the basket, you may need less power in your throw. Adjust this by throwing with less force and further back from the free throw line.

, Keep your shooting hand up in a “gooseneck” after you release the ball, until it goes into the net. You should be up on your toes and looking at the rim, not the ball in the air or as it lands in the rim.

, A big part of a successful free throw shot in maintaining your focus and technique on every free throw. The only way to do this is to practice your free throw technique every day, at every practice until it becomes natural and almost like second nature. That way, when you are at the free throw line during a game, with one five seconds to go, surrounded by all the noise of the fans, you can simply focus on the rim and make the free throw, just like you practiced.Try to shoot 25 shots every day for 5 days of each week. Keep track of how many free throws you make and how many you miss. If you aren’t making more than you miss, there may be a flaw in your technique. So evaluate your level of success and adjust your stance or your arm placement accordingly.As you practice, think: BEEF. Balance the ball, keep your Eye on the rim, keep your Elbow straight, and Follow through., Because a free throw does not involve defense, you can create a small ritual or routine before you make your shot. For example, every time Michael Jordan took a free throw, he followed the same ritual: spin the ball, dribble three times, spin the ball again, and then shoot. Relying on a ritual that you have practiced many times will relax and focus you before you take the shot.Create your own small ritual during your free throw practice. Start every free throw with this ritual so it feels natural and comfortable.

, This can help you with your distance control, which is the control you have over how far or how short the ball goes when you shoot it.Stand 9 inches in front of the free throw line. Maintaining your free throw technique, shoot the ball, aiming for the back of the rim. Do this several times, missing the shot, but aiming at the back of the rim.
Move 9 inches behind the line and hit the front of rim on each shot. Do this several time, missing the shot but hitting the front of the rim.
Finally, move back to the free throw line and get into your free throw position. Try to swish each shot, using the same distance control you used in the previous spots on the court.

, This may sound impossible, especially when you are just starting to get comfortable with your free throw technique. But once you develop a good technique and your technique feels comfortable through practice, you should be able to close your eyes, shoot, and swish the ball."

Gather the necessary materials.,

To build up the knob, start with a napkin.,
Measure a forearm-length strip of tape.,
Try to use as little tape as possible to get the grip you want.,
Experiment.,
Smooth out any tape bubbles with a puck.,
Apply the wax.,
Consider other additions.",How to Wrap a Hockey Stick," To do a quality wrap-job, you'll obviously need your hockey stick, right-handed or left-handed, depending on your dominant side, or a goalie stick. The process is essentially the same for each. Additionally, you'll also need:


Cloth tape
Scissors or a sharp knife
Stick wax, surf wax, or old candle wax;
, For some players, the color and style of the tape they use on their stick is just as important for identification purposes as for practical reasons. The right tape can make your gear instantly identifiable and distinctive, allowing your teammates to recognize your stick in a crowd of opponents, open for a pass, something Bobby Orr popularized.










Use black tape to mask the puck. Other players can have a more difficult time distinguishing if you've got control of the puck if it's up against a blade wrapped in black. Alternatively, some players prefer using white tape to help improve their puck handling, as it makes it easier to see and track the puck. If you want to help out your teammates, use team-colored tape to help them instantly spot a friendly stick., Before you wrap around the blade, apply some tape to the bottom edge which skates along the ice with you. Keep the tape centered on the edge of the blade. There won't be much to grab onto, but you'll wrap it up more thoroughly when you go around.









Some players will file down this edge to remove any burrs or chinks in the wood that have occurred over time before they apply tape. Check the smoothness and attend to any issues you find.

, Picture the blade as a foot. Some players elect to go from the toe to the heel, while others prefer the more traditional heel-to-toe method. Pick your starting point, and wrap the tape vertically around the width of the blade, moving the tape down the blade diagonally. Overlap your previous wrap by no more than a quarter-inch or so.










Traditional wisdom says to tape from heel-to-toe because it creates more spin on the puck, but recent analysis of the fastest shooters has shown that spin actually slows the puck down. Depending on your style and your purposes, you can wrap your blade in either direction.
If you want a faster release off your blade, wrap toe-to-heel. If you want more spin, wrap heel-to-toe. While spin slows the puck down, it also makes it harder for the goalie to make a 5-hole save because the puck will still be spinning when he stops it between the pads.

, It may seem strange to the uninitiated, but taking a small piece of paper (like a napkin) to start out with can help with the grip and is quite popular among players because it creates a distinctive butt for you to hold.










Start with the folded piece of paper around the edge of the handle, just under the knob, wrapping tape around it several times to keep it in place. If you don't have a knob in place on your stick, start the tape at the edge of the stick itself where the knob would be.

, Without tearing, use your wrist to your elbow as a guide and twist the tape around, creating a kind of strong tape rope. Wrap this firmly around the handle of the stick, moving down diagonally to form the grip. Do not tear the tape.










Start wrapping the flat part of the tape (where you stopped winding) back up the handle and over the rope, overlapping it slightly, until you get back to the knob. Wrap it a couple more times around the handle at the knob to make sure everything is secure, then cut it.

, Loading your stick with lots of tape can sometimes just weigh you down, adding extra weight to a stick that you'll get tired of carrying around by the end of the game. Figure out the most economical amount of tape you can use to get the right feel and response from your stick and stay with that.










When you get it right, or feel you've done a particularly good job taping it, measure the tape when you remove it after play. Remember how much you used and cut only that amount next time to make it easy (and cheap) on yourself.

, Your own style will depend upon personal preference. Try out different tapers, knobs, and tapes to see what feels best. There is no right way to tape the handle and most players have different methods and routines particular to their play. All you're looking for here is grip and feel, so do what works best for you.









, Start with the blade at the heel and press towards the toe. Rub the puck along the new tape job to smooth things out and work out any bubbles, which can tear and make your tape raggedy on the ice. The friction of the puck makes the tape bond better with the blade, resulting in a smoother action.









, Take some wax and apply it to all taped areas of the blade. This keeps the tape from getting waterlogged, increasing the longevity of the tape job and decreasing friction as the bottom of the blade moves along the ice. This is especially useful if you're taking lots of shots.










For the best results, use stick wax, not generic wax of some other kind. This is widely available at sporting goods stores that specialize in hockey gear. But even candle wax will do in a pinch.
Make sure your ice rink allows the use of wax. Some that don't regularly renew the ice or those that use the rink for other commercial purposes discourage this.

, Some players have fairly elaborate taping routines, adding other bits to their stick for color, personality, or for practical purposes. Learn from other players and do what feels natural.










Some players like to add a thick roll of tape midway down the stick, about 3/8"" thick, to help with picking the stick up off the ice when gloves are on.

Find a good position on the court.,
Get low to the ground.,
Spread your arms.,
Box out your opponent, if necessary.",How to Rebound in Basketball1," Before the shot even goes in the air, be on the lookout for a good position. First, look for other players on your team, and make sure you are not getting in a teammate's way. If you do not see any teammates close to the hoop, move in to try and get the rebound.Communicate with your teammates by yelling, “Shot” as soon as you see the ball go up.
Both defensive and offensive players should look for a rebound, so don't worry about your position. Rebounds are important to the game, so go for them as much as possible.
If you took the shot yourself, follow the shot to the basket to try to get your own rebound. The majority of first shots in basketball are not made. Therefore, there's a good chance you'll miss on your first try, so be prepared for a rebound.;
, If you did not take the shot yourself, a good way to prepare for a rebound is to get low on the ground. You may have to jump in the air to catch the basketball. You may also need to block opposing players going for the rebound, a process called boxing out. This usually involves crouching slightly so, in the event you have to box out another player, you will already be in the right position.


Use your legs to keep other players from getting between you and the basket. Bend your knees slightly and spread your legs, making your body bigger. This will block other players behind you who are considering the rebound.Stay on the balls of your feet so you are ready to move and jump when the ball comes down.

, Keep your hands up and arms open wide. This allows you to have the widest coverage on the court, blocking other players. It also prepares your arms for catching the ball. When the rebound comes, you'll need to jump and grab quickly.The opposing player can also choose to pin your arms down. This is another reason why keeping your arms up is important.

, Boxing out, as stated, is a means of blocking another player from reaching the basket. You can use your hands and feet to position yourself between the opposing player and the basket. If you're crouching and spreading your arms, you're already in the box out position. Just keep an eye on the player behind you.









Push the other player back with your behind as you spread your arms and legs out wide to keep them behind you. You have to make first contact, so locate any potential opposing players and move in front of them.Be prepared to reposition yourself as the opposing player attempts to move around you. Move backward if necessary, forcing the opposing player further back in the court. If you're boxing out an opponent too close to the net, the player can easily jump up over you and get the rebound."
"
Jump towards the ball.,
Grasp the ball with both hands, if possible.,
Have a plan to pass the ball.",How to Rebound in Basketball2," As soon as you see the ball come off the glass or the rim of the basket, spring up with your arms outstretched. You want to grab the ball as quickly as you can to secure a rebound.








Be aggressive in moving towards the ball. If you are afraid to jump because someone else is jumping as well, you will have a lesser chance of getting the rebound. Even if another player is going for the ball, take the risk and jump. You may be the first one to get the rebound.
Keep your arms stretched toward the ball as you jump. Keep your eye on the ball, following its movements so you can best aim your grasp.

, Always try to grab the ball with both hands. Rebounding with one hand will give your opponents an opportunity to swat the ball away easily and take possession for themselves.








Hug the ball to your body as you come down. This protects the ball from being intercepted from other players as you come down from your jump.
Extend your elbows outward in a defensive position. This also discourages other players from grabbing the ball from your arms.
As you reach the ground, pull the ball up to your chin. This prepares you to pass the ball to a teammate.

, As soon as you grasp the ball, scan the court. Look for an open teammate moving down court to pass the ball. Give a quick pass out to send the ball towards your basket.









If you got an offensive rebound, try to put the ball back up for a basket. If you don’t have an open shot, pass or dribble the ball out to get a better position on the net.
If you're rebounding your own shot, try to immediately throw the ball towards the basket again if you have an open shot.

Develop a rebounding mindset.,
Learn to anticipate missed shots.,
Do McHale taps.,
Practice bangs.",How to Rebound in Basketball3," If you want to get more rebounds, developing the right mindset is key. Understand that proper rebounding techniques are as important as dribbling, shooting, and other skills.


Make rebounding a priority. If you're able to rebound a lot of shots, you increase your team's chances at victory. Gaining control of the ball as fast and often as possible is key to a successful game. Always be on the lookout for potential rebounds when playing basketball.Be aggressive. Go into the game ready to take control of the ball. Do not shy away from boxing players out when necessary. Having a ""loose ball"" mentality, meaning you're lax in regards to who is controlling the ball and when, decreases your chances of winning. Go into each game ready to be aggressive and go for rebounds when possible., Most shots in basketball, especially first shots, are missed. Even at the professional level, players only make 43% of their first shot attempts. Therefore, each time a shot is taken you have a solid shot at a rebound. Learn to be aware of the factors that increase the likelihood of a rebound.Pay attention to your opponents as the game progresses. Players have preferences as to where they shoot the ball. If you notice one player tends to always shoot from the right corner, go to the right corner when that player has the ball. This way, if the shot is a rebound, you have a solid chance of intercepting it.Understand the angle the shot is likely to follow. If a shot is taken anywhere from the wing to the baseline, 80% of the time these shots will rebound from the same angle. Shots taken above the foul line rebound to sides 60% of the time and from the front of the rim 40% of the time.Keeping this information in mind, watch where shots are made. Move to the part of the court where they're likely to rebound. You will not make every rebound this way, but you will increase your chances greatly., Just as you need to practice skills like shooting and dribbling, engage in exercises that develop your rebounding skills. McHale taps are one exercise you can use to improve your coordination and skill at rebounding.


Move to the right side of the backboard. While jumping, dribble the ball off the backboard using your right hand. Dribble the ball while you are in the air.You should not be jumping between dribbles. Each jump is its own dribble. Try to touch the rim with your left hand with each dribble you make with your right. At first, you may not be able to reach the rim. That's okay. Try to at least get the net. You'll work your way up with time.Do this for 50 jumps or for 2 minutes. Then, switch it up. Dribble with your left hand and touch the net or rim with your right. Repeat for another 50 jumps or 2 minutes., Bangs are another great exercise to help improve your rebound skills. To start, pick up the ball with two hands. Jump and then bang the ball on the backboard 3 times, using as much force as possible. Jump one more time, this time putting the ball in the basket.Do about 20 bangs. Then, change sides. Move to the left side of the board and repeat the process, once again doing 20 bangs."

Dunk one-handed first. The two-handed slam is maybe the most dominating move in basketball, but it takes a lot more leap to touch the rim with two hands. You can build up to it.;
, It's much easier, when you're first starting out, to try dunking with a smaller ball. You'll be able to palm it more easily and control your approach, making the maneuver more satisfying and your practice closer to the real thing. Continue dribbling and shooting exercises with the appropriate-sized ball so you're not getting too used to the ""wrong"" size, but keep a small ball around for your sick dunks., Get a feel for how to use inertia to control the ball when your arm is extended. Even people who can palm a basketball sometimes lose their grip when dunking, so you need to get a feel for maneuvering the ball and controlling it in the air.


Practice running at the rim and slamming the ball against it. Even if you're not ""dunking,"" you're still practicing your approach and holding the ball correctly as you leap toward the hoop.
You can try a tennis ball or golf ball first, then a volleyball, and work your way up to a basketball.

, It's common to focus all your energy on getting the rock in the hole and end up falling on your butt, which hurts. A lot. It happens, even to the pros, but spend some time completing the follow-through and focusing on completing the entire sequence of moves, landing safely, and you'll dunk more accurately and more consistently.









Visualize the successful dunk and immediately focus on your landing. Try to land on both feet, cushioning your legs and flexing into the landing. Watch out for other players.
Don't hang on the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you, but hanging on the rim can damage the hoop, and also throw you off balance, pulling your legs out from under you so you fall backwards. So don't try to grab the rim after you've slammed the ball, just dunk it and drop.

, Start with an adjustable height basket, if you have access to one. Lower the height so you can get a feel for dunking, then raise it gradually to the standard height as you improve.

, Most players find that high-quality shoes improve their ability to dunk, and more importantly, prevent you from getting hurt when you try to dunk.

, You'll likely embarrass yourself during your first several attempts to dunk, but get up off the floor and try again. You'll be very impressed at your improvement if you keep practicing your leaps and building the strength in your legs.








, You will need the lifting power of your legs to get you in the air and up to the basket. Building a regimen of leg workouts that will increase the fast-twitch strength and the flexibility of your leg muscles can help you add inches to your vertical leap, getting you that much closer to the rim.A good regimen to get started with might include:









50-100 calf raises

2 or 3 sets of squats and lunges

3-5 sets of 60 second wall sits


, Plyometrics are exercises that use the resistance of your own body to build strength and are essential for building the kind of strength necessary to build your jump. It takes time to train your body to jump higher, but working the right muscle groups can improve your explosiveness and height without maxing out regularly in the weight room.









Muscle groups that need to be stronger: Quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, calves. The quadriceps extend the knee, while the hamstrings and gluteals extend the hip. The calves flex the ankle, giving you that initial hop.

, Just building strength in your legs won't do it. The muscles also need to be loose and flexible, giving you the movement and response you'll need to dunk over the defense. Develop your flexibility by regularly stretching, doing elastic resistance exercises, and giving yoga a shot.









Muscle groups that need flexibility: Hamstrings and hip flexors. Tight hamstrings will impede the knee extension during the jump. Hip flexors resist the hip extension part of the jump.

, Coaches make you run stairs for a reason. Running stairs will develop all the quadriceps, hips, and calves, helping to build all-around leg strength and flexibility. It's also cheap. You can run stairs at your house, at school after-hours, or even on the bleachers outside.








, Jump across the whole court and back. Try three laps or more, leaping as high as you can each time. Jump to touch the net with a running jump until you are able to do it ten times in a row. You probably won't be able to do this all in one day. Keep working at it. Keep jumping. Set your sights on the rim.








, Shaquille O'Neal was known for double-handing the ball into the goal so forcefully, the backboard would shatter. While rim technology makes that not particularly possible any more, it's still a powerful and demoralizing dunk to pull off.


You need a really high vertical to pull of a two-handed dunk. Practice standing under the rim and jumping straight up until you can touch your wrists to the rim.

, Suggesting you're so high you could dunk it twice, in the double-pump dunk you bring the ball back down to chest level at the apex of your leap, then force it back up to slam it with authority. Some notable players, Tracy McGrady among them, would do this regularly while spinning in the air, doing a 360 dunk variation.

, As you approach, bring the ball into your abdomen and back, extending your arm behind your body and up in a circular fashion, like a windmill spinning. At the apex of your jump, bring your arm all the way around to throw it down like a boss. Dominique Wilkins, the Dunkmaster General of the 90s, used to blow crowds away with this spectacular dunk.

, Either two-handed or one-handed, the tomahawk dunk involves bringing the ball back over your head by bending your elbows and slamming it forcefully into the hoop, as if you were chopping a tomahawk. ""Dr. J"" Julius Erving popularized this poster dunk, as well as Darryl Dawkins, who broke several backboards tomahawk dunking.

, While he wasn't the first player to complete it, Vince Carter wowed crowds at the 2000 NBA dunk contest by passing the ball under one leg while in the air and slamming it with authority. It didn't hurt that his forehead was almost touching the rim. If you've worked your ups to that height, try passing it under one leg and dunking it.

Start a windmill dunk by approaching the basket while dribbling, then jump toward it as high as you can., One of the distinctive features of a windmill dunk is that it is executed with one hand. As you jump in the air, you must take the ball with you in your dominant hand., While jumping in the air and holding onto the ball with one hand, swing your fully extended arm around in a circular motion. This movement should be smooth and even, like a windmill going around., As your extended, rotating arm approaches the basket, slam the ball in the basket. This should happen as quickly and smoothly as possible. After the ball goes in, return your arm to a normal position as you hit the ground., High jumping is essential for doing a windmill dunk, so train to build strength in your legs and lower body. Squats, lunges, hamstring curls, and leg presses are all good exercises to try for this purpose., Whether or not you are tall, you will have to have excellent upward movement in order to do a windmill dunk. Strength and ability combine to make powerful jumps. Try doing skips, squat jumps, and toe raises as practice to improve your ability to launch yourself upwards.If you are a shorter or average sized player, dunking can be difficult, though not necessarily impossible. Practice jumping, and work with a coach to determine if dunking is within your reach.

, If you need help figuring out how high you need to jump in order to make a dunk, try using a dunk calculator. Enter in your height, the rim height, and extra height for the dunk itself to calculate how high you need to jump in order to dunk the ball. You can then use this information in order to practice achieving the jump height you need., Some players prefer to do dunks by jumping with two feet. However, you may be able to achieve your maximum jump height more easily if you jump with one foot while reaching upwards with your arm. Jump with your non-dominant foot and keep the ball in your dominant hand. For example, a right handed player will jump with the left foot while rotating the right arm., If your jumping or dunking feels unsteady, you may need more balance in the air. As you jump to make the windmill dunk, hold your non-dominant arm either at your side or up in the air. Experiment with each position to see which one gives you better balance., Before attempting a windmill jump, you can practice leaping toward the basket with empty hands. This allows you to get a sense of your maximum height, and to practice the basic movements. Jump upwards and rotate your arm just as you would if you were holding a ball, until the movement feels balanced and fluid., Holding onto a full-sized basketball while learning to do a windmill dunk can be difficult. In order to build your familiarity with the move, you can try dunking a smaller ball (such as a tennis ball or mini basketball) until you feel confident jumping and rotating your arm. Then, move on to practicing with a full-sized basketball., Once you’ve mastered the basic windmill dunk, you can try some variations on the technique. A popular move is the 360 windmill dunk. To do this, spin your body in a 360 degree turn as you dunk the ball in the basket, windmill-style., Another popular and challenging variation on the basic windmill dunk is to try it backwards. Unlike a regular windmill dunk, you perform this move by holding onto the ball with both hands. Jump while facing away from the basket and bring the ball down toward your chest with both hands. Once you are up near the basket, rotate the ball behind your head (using both hands) and dunk it into the basket., You can develop your own personal style of windmill dunking, once you are familiar with the technique. Be creative and combine a windmill dunk with other dunking and dribbling techniques. For instance, you could work with another play to try an alley-oop windmill dunk."

, It could throw your defender off, and you might need a different play style to win. If he's a pretty defensive type player, who doesn't like giving up shots, you must learn to get off quick shots, or learn some moves. If he's a player who likes getting in close to shoot, keep your eyes on the ball, and stay between him and the net at all costs. If he's more of a Tracy McGrady, who just likes to score, then you gotta be on your toes, because he's gonna fire them off every chance he gets.

Stay behind your defender.,

Watch for the Post Player.,
Learn how to guard the Perimeter Players.",How to Play Man to Man Defence in Basketball," The defender should always have his man in front of him (relative to the net). In professional basketball, the player who receives the ball has someone behind him.;
, When a pass is coming towards him, try pulling your hands out from behind and tip it away. If the player is in post position, he'll most likely be still. Keep a hand in front of him to deny it. But still, be careful not to commit a foul by trying to reach in for the steal. If he's more of a perimeter player, he'll most likely be running around to get free of you, so try to keep up. If he thinks he's open, try waiting for a pass to come up to him, and jump in and tip it away.

, If the player is post, he will most likely be backing into you.


Best thing to do is have ONE hand on his back(this is allowed) and stop him from advancing further. If he is a good post player, he will try faking and then spinning around and laying it around you. You must observe him, and try not to fall for these. He could also pump fake then go under you. Once he shoots, you can try blocking it. He will most likely be fading away; if he's much taller than you, he'll shoot right over you. When blocking have your hands STRAIGHT, not bending and try swatting it. If you don't think it'll work, put your hands in front of his face (straight still) and contest the shot, but don't hit him. Beware, he could do multiple pump fakes.

, Now onto the perimeter based players. These players will most likely be harder to guard. They will be quicker (and you will need to be as well), drive on you, cross you up, pump fake you, better shooters, will attempt to draw fouls, and do hop stops. You, as a defender, will need to be prepared for all of this.


Know his range. This is a little thing that will help A LOT. If he isn't as great of a shooter, take him out of his comfort zone. If he's in a spot where his range will let him make the shot, be more up in his face. If you're comfortable that he's not in it, you can sag off a bit
Keep your knees bent when guarding him. That way, you can move quickly as he moves or drives. If he drives quickly, move back and attempt to contest the shot, but be aware of a foul call.
Watch out for pump fakes.
When trying to block the shot, you can try this alternative: put your hands in front of his face when he shoots.
He could Hop Step, which means jump one way then the other, or close to get rid of you to get off an open look shot.
Stay far enough that if he likes to drive you can react quick enough; if too close one step might be all he needs.

Work out.",How to Play Small Forward," First you need to make sure you got the right height and weight to play for an adult or young adult you want to be about 6'7-6'9 and about 245-260 lbs. For ages 12-14 you want to be about 5'6-5'8.;
, You need a whole bunch of practice first you need to be able to shoot from basically anywhere on that court so probably about 40% layup and up close 35% mid range and about 25% three point range.

, As a small forward you will be expected to cut or drive to the basket, and shoot the mid range shots. Maybe add in a sweep or a jab step and then drive or when your shooting add a little bit of fade to get space between you and your defender. Try to limit your 3 point shots unless you are weakly guarded. Remember when you're shooting BEEF: Balance, Eyes, Elbows and Follow through.

, Unless you are injured, you need to work out. Every small forward you see in the NBA has amazing bicep, tricep, chest, leg, forearm, back,and ab strength! Also get a good amount of carbs and protein and try to limit fatty foods.

Anticipate the rebound.",How to Play Knockout," You need at least two players to play. There is no limit to the number of players you can have in each game. Each player should be able to shoot and rebound a basketball., Unlike most variations of the game, knockout requires that you use two basketballs simultaneously. Purchase two regulation sized basketballs. Test to verify that the basketballs are still properly inflated.


Generally, when you drop a properly inflated basketball, it should bounce back to about two thirds of height from which it was dropped. For a more exact measure of how inflated the ball should be, check the instructions that come with the ball. The instructions should specify how heavy the ball ought to be., The first person in the line should be directly behind the foul line. The first and the second person should each have their own basketball.


The foul line, also known as the free throw line, is a line on the court inside the three-point line. There should be a rectangle on the court that is adjacent to the semicircle which intersects with the three-point line. The foul line is the line where the rectangle and semicircle meet.
The foul line is where professional players shoot from when they have been fouled.
If you are playing at home and need to create your own line, the standard distance for the foul line is 15 feet from the backboard. Use a piece of chalk or tape to mark off the line., The player is not allowed to advance beyond the line before taking his first shot. After the first shot, however, he can run up and shoot from whatever location he chooses too. He should keep on shooting until he gets it in, at which point he can run to the back of the line.


The player is not required to dribble the ball after picking it back up again.
There are variants of the game in which the player is required to return to and shoot from behind the three point line, but that is not the standard way to play.The person who starts out in the front of the line will always be at a disadvantage. Every player will rotate to the front, but the person who starts there won't have anyone in front of them who they can knock out.

, After the first person in line has taken his shot, the second can advance to the foul line and take his own shot. If he misses, he should rebound as quickly as possible and take another shot from anywhere on the court. He should continue shooting until he scores., Once a player gets the ball in the basket, he returns to the back of the line. There, he is safe until the line cycles through and he is back to the front of the line.When the player scores, he should pass it to the next person in line as quickly as possible. The faster that player gets it, the more likely it is that he will have the time to score and eliminate another player.

, If the first shooter scores, then no one is eliminated from the game. However, if the second person to shoot scores first, the person in front of him is eliminated.To get an advantage, you can “bump” or “knock” the ball. This is when you take your ball and use it to bounce the other ball off the court. The other player will need to chase the ball and will lose valuable time. You can knock the ball directly out of the other player’s hands, if possible.

, Cycle through the line as many times as is necessary. Each time you cycle through, some players should be eliminated by the person behind them. By the end, there will only be one player standing.

, You should keep your feet approximately shoulder length apart. Your shooting foot should be slightly in front of the other foot. Bend your knees slightly when you begin to shoot.


It is important to keep a consistent stance. So that you can develop a feel for how to shoot the ball accurately, try to shoot it the same way every time. To do this, be conscious of how you position your feet., Spread your fingers far enough apart to balance the ball on your fingers. Position one hand on the center of the ball, with the air hole between your middle and index fingers. Place the other hand on the side of the ball, along the long seam of the ball.


Keep some distance between your palm and the ball. The ball should rest on your fingertips.
The hand on the side is only used to balance the ball. You should not apply any force to the ball from that hand. Remove this balance hand as you take your shot., Align the ball and your eyes directly with the rim of the basket. Bend over slightly, keeping the ball a couple of inches above your waist. Maintain a consistent from every time you line up for your shot., As you shoot, straighten your body and jump. Simultaneously lift the ball so that your elbow is directly underneath the ball. The ball should be above your head, aligned with your eyes and the basket. Flip your wrist just before the high point of your jump to propel the ball toward the net.


To maintain balance and aim, jump straight up. You should aim to land at exactly the same point from which you jumped., Rebounds are unpredictable, but typically the ball bounces back in a particular direction, depending upon where you take your shot. If you are shooting from the foul line, the ball is somewhat more likely to rebound directly back than to the side. However, shots taken from the side of the rim tend to bounce to one side or another.


When shooting from the front, the ball will rebound to the front 40% of the time and has a thirty percent chance of rebounding to one side or the other.
When taking a shot from the side, there is only a 20% chance that the ball will rebound to the front. There is a 40% chance that it will rebound back to the side from which you shot, and a 40% chance that it will rebound to the opposite side.
Because it is extremely disadvantageous to chase the ball to the opposite side of the court, you are better off taking shots from directly in front of the backboard. There, your chances of the basketball rebounding back in your direction is higher."

You set five or more spots in an arc around the basket. Each player gets two shots at each spot. If you make it, you move on to the next one. If you miss two in a row, you start from scratch. The first player all the way around wins.


You need at least two players. However, there is no upper limit on the number of people that can play.;
, You want to make a small half-circle around the basket. If you're new to the game, set it up around the key, the rectangle in front of the goal. If you're experienced you can back up, even setting every spot around the three point line. You want to make a half-circle, representing the world, so that you have to shoot from every angle and on both sides of the basket. However, you should feel free to pick whatever spots you want. Mark them with tape or chalk.


In general, you want your spots evenly spaced out. You can have as many spots as you want, depending on how long you want the game to go on for.
Some people like to add the free-throw line as the first and last shot -- your ""home base.""

, Know, however, that everyone will get a chance to shoot. If the first person happens to win, everyone else gets one round to try and tie them, forcing a rematch or overtime. Thus, the person who goes first does not matter too much.







, Take your first shot. If you make it, move on to the next spot and shoot again. If you miss it, you get one more shot. If you miss both shots, it is the next person's turn to shoot.









Since there is nowhere to go back to on the first shot, there is no reason to skip your second shot., This is where the strategy comes into play. If you miss two shots in a row, you must start over on your next turn. But if you miss the first one you can skip your next shot. When it is your turn again you get to start from the same spot you left off.








If you have a big lead, it is often best to wait. Remember, however, that it only takes one good turn for someone to catch up -- or even win.
If you're behind, it might be worth the risk to take your second shot. If you can develop some rhythm, one great round might help you come back.

, You could theoretically win on the very first turn if you make every shot. The goal, especially for real basketball, is to develop shooting consistency, getting into a rhythm of good shots.








, Every player should get the same number of chances to win. Say, for example, you're playing with four people who shoot in the order A, B, C, and D. During the fifth round, player B makes every bucket and wins. However, players C and D only got to play for four rounds. They each get one more chance to win, forcing a playoff. Player A, who got the same number of chances as Player B, loses.









For tie-breakers, play one more round. Whatever player gets the furthest around wins."

Try using the ""T"" stop at first.,
Drag one skate back.,
Pull the back skate forward.,
Shift your body weight to the dragging skate.",How to Stop on Ice Skates1," This is usually touted as the easiest way for pure beginners to learn how to stop on ice skates. Begin by skating slowly forward, on a straightaway, with no obstacles or turns before you., As you glide, turn one skate at a 45 degree angle. Let it hang behind the other skate to create friction.

, Bring the dragging skate up into the instep of the leading skate. Make sure to keep your dragging skate in contact with the ice as you do this. You may need to apply some pressure., Lean back slightly, and tip your weight into the direction you're coming from. Keep your shoulders straight, pointing forward. Let your arms hang at your sides. Keep your weight on the rear foot, creating friction, until you slowly come to a stop.

Create more complicated patterns for harder games.,
Add different types of shooting to work on other skills.,
Eliminate the second shot for higher stakes games.,
Allow simultaneous shooting for a chaotic, strategic game.,
Limit the number of skips per game.,
Make shooters use both hands.",How to Play Around the World2," Once you have the basics down, it's time to make your world a little tougher. You can add in the free-throw line, make players go down the line and come back, or make the last shot an extra-difficult 3-pointer.


Make sure everyone understands all of the shots before beginning -- it makes a big difference when deciding whether to move on or stay put for the second shot.

, Mix-in different kinds of shots, such as layups. Throw in blind shots, backwards throws, backboard shots only (or no backboard shots at all), or any other challenge you can think of to make the game more interesting.







, If you're a great shooter, you should be able to constantly hit every shot under pressure. If you're really looking to improve your game or make things tenser, only allow one shot per spot. You can also eliminate the ability to skip a shot, forcing players to take both shots every time and move back if they fail.








, This is best for smaller groups of 2-4 players, and you may need a referee to ensure it all works out. Start with every player on roughly the same square, say go, and start shooting. The rest of the rules apply as well, except you cannot skip turns. If you miss twice, you start over. Players will have to be strategic about when to shoot, and smart players can even try and hit other players balls to knock them back to start -- though you'll be sacrificing one of your own shots as well.









To make it easier to enforce the rules, players should shout ""chance shot"" every time they take a second shot, allowing you to know if they must restart if they miss., You could only allow three total skips in the entire game, making them much more strategic and putting a greater focus on good shooting. It can, however, also make the game much longer.








, This little variation mixes up the normal game and allows for odd and spectacular shots. You can make players alternate arms every shot (making them more or less likely to risk the second shot), or force them to shoot opposite handed whenever they want to take a second shot. You can mix this up with backwards shots or blind, eyes-closed shots as well to make things interesting.

Try pointing your toes to stop.,
Practice at a slow speed.,
Pigeon-toe your skates.,
Grind to a stop.",How to Stop on Ice Skates2," This beginner technique is sometimes called the ""snowplow stop"" because it relies more upon angle and stability than finesse. It is less graceful than the ""hockey stop,"" but it will slow you down in a pinch.

, Skate forward on a straightaway, with no big turns coming up. Let yourself glide at a comfortable pace, and wait to stop until you are already slowing down. As you improve, you can practice stopping at faster and faster speeds.


If you feel out of control: don't panic, and don't try to stop right away. Try to find your balance. Wait until you slow down a bit before you try to stop.

, When you are ready to stop, point both of your toe picks inward. Your feet should form an upside-down ""V."", Hold your feet at a steady angle as you slow down. The friction of the skates against the ice will gradually bring you to stop. Don't push your feet in toward each other, or you risk twisting your ankle.

Work your way up to the hockey stop.,
Skate forward at a medium to slow speed.,
Bend your knees.,
Shift your weight back.,
Create friction.",How to Stop on Ice Skates3," As you build confidence and skill, you can learn to stop harder, at greater speeds. This is the technique that ice hockey players and other professional ice skaters use. It becomes necessary, at some point, as you need to stop quickly and efficiently in order to keep up with the competition. If you're a beginner, however, you don't need to worry about mastering this right away., You can be gliding more quickly than you would for the ""snowplow stop,"" but you should still feel as though you are in control. In certain high-performance situations—an intense hockey game, or a complex figure-skating move—you may need to come to a halt or change directions very quickly. In general, avoid trying to suddenly stop while flying across the rink at your top speed., As you glide, go into a half-crouch, as though you're going to sit. Make sure to keep your knees shoulder-width apart. This is called un-weighting yourself. Then, turn your skates sideways not-quite-90 degrees from the direction that you were going before.

, With your knees bent, lean away from the direction you are heading. Focus your weight on the side of your feet that is away from the direction that you are moving.

, Slowly but firmly dig the edge of your skates into the ice. Hold fast, and dig harder as you slow down. Ride the friction until you come to a halt.Only a small portion of the skates should be in contact with the ice, thus minimizing friction and eventually allowing you to stop on a dime."
"
Try stopping on a straightaway.,
Consider wearing pads and a helmet.,
Watch videos.",How to Stop on Ice Skates4," Find a long, open stretch of ice to practice on. Ideally, pick a time when there is not much skate traffic around you, so that you don't need to worry about colliding with other people. Make sure that there are no turns, holes, or other obstacles ahead of you. Put yourself in a space where you only need to focus on the act of stopping.

, If you are going to be stopping suddenly at high speeds, then safety is of the essence. This is especially the case if you are stopping in the midst of a high-intensity activity like a race or a hockey game. You can use hockey pads or non-ice skating pads – anything that will protect you from the ice! If nothing else, make sure to protect your head, your hands, your elbows, and your knees.

, Look online for videos of other people stopping on ice skates.Watch hockey games, speed-skating races, or figure-skating competitions on television to get a feel for the motion. There may be other tricks and styles of stopping that pertain to specific types of ice skating."

Everyone keeps track of their own score., On a regulation basketball court, this is a straight horizontal line. Usually, this is 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket.However, if you’re playing on a driveway or smaller court, you can improvise.

, This is the large semi-circle that encloses the free-throw line on a regulation court. Usually, this is 23.75 feet (7.24 m) from the basket.Feel free to improvise on a smaller court.

, Every game of 21 has its basic rules. However, you and the other players can make adjustments to create a challenge or make things easier for beginners.Some common rules are:


Regular shots are worth 2 points each. You can make them anywhere on the court except the free-throw or 3-point line.
3-point shots are worth 3 points each. Make them from the 3-point line.
Free-throw shots are worth 1 point each. Make them from the free-throw line., Take turns shooting at the hoop rim. The first person to hit the rim takes possession of the ball.You could adjust this rule so that you have to get the ball in the basket in order to take possession.

, The player with possession shoots the ball at the 3-point line. All other players try to stop them from making the basket.This is called busting-in or breaking-in the ball. A successful bust gets the opponent 2 points., Each 2-point shot you make earns you a 1-point shot from the free-throw line. After you make 3 shots in a row, one of your opponents can check you in a one-on-one match-up. If you make that shot, you get 2 points.If you miss your free throw, try to stop your opponents from putting the ball back in the basket.

, Dribble the ball outside the 3-point line. This happens if someone misses the 2-point shot and one of their opponents rebounds the ball. The player with the ball can’t shoot before clearing., Shoot additional 1- 2-, and 3-point shots until someone gets 21 points. In basic rules, the first player to 21 wins. You could end the game there or have a rematch.

, In a tip-in, one player shoots the ball toward the basket but misses. Meanwhile, another player jumps, catches the ball, and scores before it hits the ground.Make the game more challenging by reducing the score of the “tipped” shooter (the one who missed their shot).


You can reduce it to 13 or a lower number if the player has less than 13 points. To make it even more interesting, reduce the score to zero.

, Make a rule that the winner must have at least 21 points and lead by a set number of points. For example, you could agree to continue beyond 21 points until someone leads by 2, 4, or more points., Sometimes, a player will have to make a free-throw shot in order to make it to 21. If they miss, their score gets rolled back to 13 points."

Line everyone up behind the foul line.,
Player 1 shoots the ball at the basket.,
In either of the above scenarios, a new pair of players will end up competing (whether it's Players 2 and 3 or Players 3 and 4).,
Eventually, as people become ""out,"" the line will shrink to two people.","How to Play ""Bump"""," For clarifying purposes, the first four people are labeled Players 1-4, Player 1 being at the front of the line. Player 1 and Player 2 should each hold a basketball.


In the beginning of the game, Player 1 may also call ""first person protection"" so that Player 2 and Player 3 will both have to score the ball before Player 1 is out.;
, Once (s)he shoots, Player 2 may begin shooting their ball.Players 1 and 2 can bump each others' basketballs whenever except if in player's hands. The 1st shot from each player must be from the free throw line.(Every 1st shot should be from the free throw line) Both continue shooting (from anywhere on the court) until one player makes a basket.


If Player 1 gets a basket before Player 2, Player 1 must pass the ball to the next person in line (Player 3), who may immediately begin shooting against Player 2. Player 1 then moves to the back of the line.






If Player 2 gets a basket before Player 1, then Player 1 is ""out."" Player 1 must pass their ball to the next person in line (Player 3), and sit on the sidelines. The second person passes their ball to Player 4 and moves to the back of the line.







, These two players follow the same rules as Players 1 and 2 in the beginning -- if the person who began shooting first makes a basket first, they pass the ball on and go to the back of the line. If the person who began shooting second makes a basket first, both balls are passed on and the shooter who began first is out. The game continues as the balls make their way through the line.


Also, If the Player before you ends up out you may call ""first person protection (earlier explained in rule 1).

, These people continue play as usual, the second person trying to make a basket before the first. If the first person makes a basket first, however, instead of passing the ball on (as there is nobody in the line), they run back to the foul line and begin shooting as the new ""second"" player. This continues until the second player scores first. (S)he is the winner.

Rebound missed shots.",How to Play Baseketball," You will need two teams, each with the same number of players. In college intramural BASEketball regulations, each team is allowed a maximum of six (6) players.Of course, you can play with however many people you recruit.;
, Each team will need a mix of offensive and defensive players. In a team of six players, you will want three offensive players and three defensive players.


For defense, two players serve in the ""outfield"" and one is stationed next to the shooter to attempt ""psych outs,"" which will be explained in Part 3.
For offense, three players are on the field: one will be the shooter and, just like in baseball, the other two are runners on bases.

, In baseball, there are nine innings, each a period of play where one team plays offense and the other plays defense.You can use all nine, or you can decide on whatever number you'd like.

, You can use a hoop mounted on a building or a freestanding hoop. Just make sure you have about 20 feet of free space in front of it to set up your court.

, Sidewalk chalk is great for this because it washes right off and comes in different colors. A BASEketball court combines elements from baseball and basketball, using a space about half the size of a basketball court. Imagine it like a baseball diamond inside a rectangular basketball half-court.

, The ""top"" of the diamond should be just in front of the basketball hoop. The ""bottom"" of the diamond, also known as ""home base,"" should be about 20-25 feet away from the hoop and located directly across from it. You may want to make home base a little bigger or use a different color of chalk to distinguish it.


Just as in baseball, 1st base is located on the diamond to the right of home base, and 3rd base is located on the diamond to the left of home base.

, Use different colors of chalk to distinguish them, if you have it. The various shooting locations radiate outward from the hoop in a roughly triangular shape, with the spots closest to the hoop located closer together and spread out farther apart as they get farther from the hoop. Spread out each row of squares so that one is in the middle of the ""diamond"" (roughly in line with the hoop and home base) and the others slant off to either side just outside the diamond. The squares should form a rough line so that the triple square is a bit behind the double square, which is a bit behind the single square, etc.


Draw two ""bunt"" squares just in front of the hoop to either side. The bunt squares should be in line with 2nd base (just in front of the hoop).
Draw three single squares at the free throw line (about 15 feet from the hoop).
Draw three double squares between the free throw line and 3-point line (between 15 and 20 feet from the hoop).
Draw three triple squares at the 3-point line (just over 20 feet from the hoop)

, Whoever makes the first shot from the foul line (a horizontal line running between first and third base) will get the ball.

, The player who got possession of the ball in Step 1 chooses a square to shoot from. The square chosen determines the number of bases awarded if the player makes the shot: singles get one base, doubles two, triples three.


The bunt squares move runners ahead one base each, but they cannot go to home base on a bunt. Bunting also results in a ""sacrifice out."". If your team has two outs already, you cannot make a bunt.

, You must stand within the shooting square while taking the shot. Stepping outside the square counts as an out. If you miss a shot -- meaning you fail to hit the basket or the backboard of the hoop -- it is counted as an out. A player counted ""out"" cannot shoot again for the remainder of the inning. If you make the shot, the number of bases is awarded based on the square you're shooting from.


You cannot shoot from the same square twice. Once a shot has been taken from a square, a team cannot use it again for the rest of the inning. You may find it helpful to use small objects such as bean bags to mark used squares.
If your shot does not enter the hoop but makes contact with the target, you may be able to use a ""put back."" In basketball, a ""put back"" occurs when a player is able to secure a rebound from his/her own team's missed shot. If you or a team-mate can ""put back"" the shot, you score.

, After a successful shot, players must run the bases just as in baseball. A shot scored from a single square would advance the runner one base, and so on.

, A unique feature of BASEketball is that each player must shoot a specific order in each inning. If a player shoots a single the first time, they must attempt a double the next time they are ""up to bat,"" and a triple the next time. If the first shot is a home run, a single must be played on the next turn.

, Two players serve in the ""outfield"" near the hoop in order to attempt rebound shots. The third defensive player stands near the shooter and attempts a ""psych out.""

, ""Psych-outs"" are a hallmark of BASEketball and are used to disrupt the shooter's concentration. Only one player may play ""psych-out"" tactics at a time; there is no double-teaming. The ""psych-out"" defense may use props, hollering, and all kinds of silly behavior as diversion tactics, but is not supposed to actually touch the ball or the shooter, limit his/her line of sight, or impair his/her vision (such as putting your hands in front of his/her face). Of course, a lot of play is good sportsmanship, so make sure you also don't hurt anyone's feelings!

, The offense can attempt a ""put-back"" if the shooter misses a shot. The defense can also try to rebound a missed shot using a ""double play"" if the defense has runners on base. If the defense rebounds the shot, the shooter and the player closest to home base are both counted out.


If the defense misses the shot during a double-play, the offense is allowed to ""tip in"" the missed shot for a play conversion. A valid tip in must be shot with both feet off the ground (so you'll have to jump to try one).< Any player on base is allowed to attempt a tip in. If the first tip in is missed, the shooter can also attempt a tip-in. If this shot succeeds, the shooter is awarded the base(s) s/he was originally attempting.
Only two attempts at conversion may be made during a play. If no shot succeeds after two attempts, the play is called as ""dead.""

Figure out what needs replacing.,Remove the insole from the inside of the boot so you can see the rivets inside.,
Remove the rivets.,
Use a different technique if your skates have bolts.,
Check the holes.,
Measure your washer.,
Take one of your bolts with the washer on it and place it in the hole it goes with.,Take one of your lock nuts and place it on the respective end of the bolt that is sticking out by the skate blade.,
Use your ratchet socket set or pliers to tighten down the nut.,
Repeat this for the remaining bolts until your skate has no remaining holes from old rivets.

",How to Replace Missing Rivets in Hockey Skates," When rivets go bad on hockey skates they either fall out (yay no removal) or get loose. Test this by trying to put a flat head between the head of the rivet and the blade holder. Only use a small amount pressure, as you just want to make sure it is still holding, not pull extra ones out. Count the number or loose or missing rivets and make note which ones you will want to replace.;
,, The easiest way to remove the rivets is to use wire cutters or bolt cutters and chop the end off from the bottom of the skate (blade side) and the remainder will fall out inside the boot.


If the part of the rivet does not fall out on its own, you can use the new bolt to push it out from the bottom of the skate towards the boot. If you don’t have cutters then you can pry them off with a pair of needle nose pliers but this is much harder.

, Some skates have bolts instead of rivets and the female portion inside the base of the boot loses its traction and needs to be removed (like Graf skates). Here you will need to pry the boot away from the blade holder (it will already be pulling away if they need replacing).


Next you will need to use the needle nose pliers to grab the female portion and hold it while you use the star shaped wrench set (or whatever the bolt head requires) and remove the bolt. If you had to use this method, use Gorilla Glue to glue the space where the female portion of the bolt was.







, Take your bolt and place it through the hole where the rivets used to be, checking all holes to make sure it fits. Some might require some pressure or to be screwed through. This is good as it leaves less gaps or wiggle room for the bolt to move around.


This is where the size of the bolt varies; you can use smaller or larger diameter bolts to accommodate the size holes. If necessary, you can use a drill to widen the hole but ultimately the bolt will hold as long as the bolt fits through.

, As stated earlier, optimally you want to use a washer as large as possible but does not sit on the side of the boot and creates unwanted height and an annoyance you will feel when your foot is in your skate.  Using the larger washer will just hold better than a smaller one and with old skates it will diversify the pressure when skating. If you are using the same size washer throughout you don’t need to measure anything.


Your washer will need to be placed on the bolt then you will place it in the hole from the inside of the boot so the end of the bolt sticks out towards the blade.   To make sure the washers all fit you can either:

A: one by one go over each hole you are going to be filling and figure out which washers you will use where.
B: measure as you replace each bolt. To stay organized, place each bolt with the washer it needs on the insole mirroring where it will be placed in the skate.



, Place the Phillips head screwdriver on the bolt and keep pressure on the bolt the whole time.,, (You might have to switch to the pliers at some point if the blade holder gets in the way of your socket)  ,"

Grip the stick correctly.,
Assume the correct stance for shooting.,
Position yourself correctly next to the puck.,
Transfer your weight to your back foot.,
Bring the stick back and rotate your wrists slightly so that the blade angles outward.,
Transfer your weight forward to shoot the puck.,
As the stick blade crosses your body, transfer body weight on your stick while pushing forward with your dominant hand and pulling backward with your non-dominant hand.,
Release the puck when it reaches your front foot and your shoulders are square to the net.,
After the puck is released, follow through by pointing the toe of your stick toward the target.",How to Shoot a Hockey Puck1," Put your non-dominant hand on the top of the stick and your dominant hand about halfway down the shaft or a foot below your non-dominant hand. This will help give you proper control and power.


The position of your fingers on the stick is not as important. Choose what is comfortable for you.;
, Your knees should be bent in an athletic stance and your body should be positioned at a 45 degree angle in relation to the net or wherever you are shooting.


It is important to be at the correct angle to the net so that the puck will be shot in the right direction.

, For the wrist shot, the puck should be positioned at your back foot. This will allow you to have more leverage and thus more power.


Do not put the puck so far back that it is uncomfortable. Try to get the puck as close to your back foot while still being in a comfortable position.

, Again, this will help you get more power in your shot and be a more stable shooter.

, Only raise the stick so that it makes at most a 10 degree angle to the ground.


The blade should rotate at most 45 degree angles backward.

, Sweep the puck forward while transferring your weight toward your front foot and rotating your body forward. Your hips and shoulders should turn toward your target


The rotation should be a quick turn but not so quick that it hurts your back or makes your shot unstable.

,


Your non-dominant hand should across and behind your hip when pulled backwards.

, At the point of release, turn your wrists at the point of release in order to turn the stick blade out and lift the puck.

, The height of the shot depends on how much you rotate your wrists and how high your follow-through is.

In order to shoot accurately, you must follow through correctly. After the shot, point the blade of the stick and angle your hips and shoulders to where you want the shot to go.

"
"
Grip the shaft of the stick correctly.,
Position the puck about halfway between your two feet for the slap shot.,
Raise the stick so that it is about parallel to your shoulders.,
Quickly bring the stick down toward the puck and shift your weight forward.,
Follow through correctly.",How to Shoot a Hockey Puck2," This grip should be close to identical to a wrist shot. You may want to slightly raise your dominant hand's position on the stick in order to get more power.

, You will need to hit the ice slightly before the shot so the puck needs to be further up in your stance.


The stance for the slap shot should be identical to any other shot. You should still assume an athletic stance and be angled about 45 degrees to the intended target of your shot.

, Do this by raising your dominant hand backwards and raising the stick off the ice.


To a certain extent, the higher you raise the stick, the more power you will get from the shot. If you want less power, raise the stick only to your hip.
You should also transfer your weight to your back foot at this step. Just like in the wrist shot, this will help you gain more control and accuracy.

, You should try to hit the ice slightly before the puck for the slap shot. Think of it as if you are shooting the puck down into the ice. This will help the puck rise off the ice.


Flick your dominant hand's wrist slightly one you make contact with the puck. This will help with the power and rise of the puck.

, Angle your hips and shoulders where you want the puck to go and point the blade in the direction of the target.


The follow-through may not seem as important but it is essential in aiming. Thinking of the follow through while shooting will help focus your aim toward the target.

Be certain that all five players know where they should be set up on the ice during the overload power play.,
Place the right winger as either an outlet pass or as a middleman.,
Settle the responsibilities of the center.,
Set up the role for the defensemen.,
Help the team members understand their various options.,
Explain the options for the wingers.,
Explain the options for the center.,
Practice the roles often.",How to Play the Overload Power Play in Ice Hockey," The following sections will explain the individual positions for each player involved, in the style of your role as coach telling the players where to go, and what to expect.
, Let’s say the puck is in the right corner down in the offensive zone. Depending on what your coach wants, the right winger would typically set up on the board side hash marks. They don’t want to be hugging the boards, but just a bit off of them. The right winger can act as a few things for this power play. They can be an outlet pass for the center that will be below the goal line or they can be the middleman and deliver the puck from down low to the defenseman up top.


The right winger can also drive towards the net and look to give a pass to the left winger that will be floating around looking to get open or take a shot on net. This is the same deal for the left winger, so it just depends on what side the puck is on.

, Again, depending on where your coach wants you, typically the center hangs out down below the goal line, shifting with the puck from the right corner to the left corner. The center is meant to be an outlet pass for the wingers on the hash marks and for the defensemen up top. The center can skate the puck from corner to corner looking to create something and to look for open ice. The center and the defenseman up top can pass back and forth, but that only depends on how tight the defending team is pressuring. The center can either skate it towards the net, pass to the winger hanging around the center of the net, or pass back and forth with the winger trying to cause a mistake for the defending team.
, This one is quite easy. Typically, the defensemen don’t want to go below the top of the circles. The reason for that is that just in case the defending team finds a whole in the power play, they can’t get a break away or an odd man rush. So, to be smart, the two defensemen should try to stay above the circles.

Let’s say the puck is on the left side of the ice. This will mean that the left side defenseman will be close to the left side boards just a few steps above the circle. They are looking for a pass down low or to take a one timer on net. They can also receive a pass from either the winger or the center and walk the puck towards the middle of the ice and take a shot on net or pass it over to the right side defenseman. While the puck is down in the right corner, the left side defenseman will be in the middle of the ice between the middle of the circles. Depending on how low the right side defenseman is, the left side defenseman should either hang high or can sneak down towards the top of the circles.

, There are an endless amount of options for the team running the overload power play., As mentioned above, the wingers have quite a few options when the puck is on their stick. They can either pass it down to the center, pass it up top to the defenseman, drive towards the net looking for an open shot, look for the opposite side winger hanging around the net, or if nothing is open, create a battle along the boards. Really, the wingers can do whatever they want to do with the puck as long as their coach approves of it. Those with a good hockey sense can create space and pick up on opportunities to create something good.

, These are pretty endless. If there is no open ice and the defending team has a pretty solid penalty kill going, the center could start what is called a cycle. The cycle can be run with either two players or three. Again, it all depends on what your coach wants.

Let’s say your coach wants a two man cycle. If the puck is down in the left corner, the center and the left winger will run the cycle down in the left corner. All that is done in the cycle is the center will skate the puck up towards the hash marks and throw the puck down back into the corner, trying their best to keep the puck along the boards so the defending team can’t pick it up. The left winger will loop and basically just follow the center. Once the left winger picks up the puck they can either walk it out and drive it to the net, get a quick shot on net, or cycle again back down to the center that will be looping back around to the corner. The cycle just creates space and can throw the defending team off.

, With these directions on where each player should be placed and what roles each player can play, your team's overload power play should be a success."

Start at center ice with the puck on the face-off dot.,
Start skating to build up speed.,
Any decent goalie will come fairly far out of the net to begin, then back in as you approach the net.,
If the goalie is too far out and not backing up fast enough, then you want to deke.,
Once you have made your decision keep skating and complete your deke and/or shot.",How to Score in a Hockey Shootout,";
, It is important to go as fast as possible while keeping the puck under control. The faster you go, the more difficult it is for the goalie to react to what you are doing.

, Ideally, you want to be skating forward, faster than the goalie is skating backward.

, If the goalie moving back too quickly and is close to the net, then you want to shoot because you can see more of the net.

, Hopefully you will score a goal in the process. The main thing in the shootout is to score and give your team the advantage, while also putting pressure on the opposing player to score for their team.

Preparation for a game starts not on the day of the game, but during the practices during the week before.,
Arrive at the rink at least an hour before going out on the ice.,
When it’s time to get on the ice put on your helmet and gloves and grab your stick.,
When you get on the ice, use the shots during the warm up to prepare yourself.",How to Prepare for a Hockey Game As a Goalie," Try your hardest to stop everything in practice. Make sure not to stay up late the night before the game either and don’t sleep in, sleeping in will cause you to feel lethargic. When you wake up get a nice breakfast - maybe some eggs, toast, bacon, and a glass of juice or milk. Depending on what time your game is you need to eat a good lunch as well. During the time before the game, try to use as little energy as possible before you head to the rink. When you arrive at the rink you will need a medicine ball, preferably five to eight pounds, and either two racquetballs or tennis balls depending on your skill level.;
, This will give you plenty of time to do all that is required to prepare. First, you need to leave your phone and any other distracting devices in your car, at home, or with a parent or trusted friend. This does not include devices for playing music. When you arrive at the rink put all your equipment in the locker room. Take the medicine ball and roll it against your muscles in your legs, your back, and your abs. This will help to loosen you up as well as help you build muscle. Then take out your two racquet balls and find a solid and flat wall. Stand two or three feet from the wall. Throw the balls against the wall either one at a time, both at the same time, or alternating between the two. This will work on your reaction time and will warm up your arms and eyes. Do this as quickly as possible till you have about thirty minutes left. Go into the locker room and put on the rest of your equipment except your helmet and gloves. Use this time to get mentally prepared. To get mentally prepared there are several things you can do, but it’s up to you to decide what works best for you.


You can sit in a calm and quiet place.
Others prefer to play music to get them pumped up.
No matter how you mentally prepare yourself you should always make sure to get your mind off of anything that isn’t hockey. Think positive thoughts and never look at the upcoming game in a negative way. You can also try to mentally picture yourself making saves.

, Wait for the rest of the team to be ready to go out and make sure you are in the front. You need to lead the team out onto the ice.

, There should at least be three waves of shots. Use the first round of shots to work your upper body. During the second round of shots go down and work on your legs and movement. The third and remaining rounds just focus on reaction, rebound control, movement, and making the save. After warm ups go to the bench, get a drink, listen to the coach talk, and then return to your net. You should now be both physically and mentally prepared to play.

Stay alert.,
Wear proper gear.,
Stay loose.,
Stay away from the center of the rink.,
Get up slowly.",How to Receive a Check in Ice Hockey," If you can't see a check coming, you cannot receive it properly. When you have the puck or are going after the puck, look up and see if any players look as if they might check you.;
, Helmet, elbow pads, chest pads, kneepads, ankle braces and leg guards are important to maintain safety during a game. Make sure all of your gear is strapped on tightly before the game.

, Don't tense up right before the hit - stay calm and loose. Staying tense while receiving a hit will transfer the pain throughout your body and cause more injuries.

, If you can, steer yourself into the the boards to help stabilize you. Being hit into the center of the rink proposes the threat of being skated or tripped over.

, Get up one body part at a time, making sure that each of your body parts is intact and you have no broken bones.

The object of the game is to score more points by passing the puck, a small rubber cylinder or rubber ball, through their opponent's goal more times than the other team. Each goal is worth one point.


A game of hockey consists of three periods, of variable time lengths depending on the level of the competition, though most games consist of three 20 minute periods.;
, While hockey can be played on roller skates (roller hockey) or on foot (floor hockey), the most popular and common type of hockey is played on the ice. Ice hockey is played on an ice rink that is 200 feet (61.0 m) long and 85 feet (25.9 m) wide and divided into three sections, demarcated by the blue lines on the ice. In the middle of the rink, there is a red line that divides both territories of play, and two blue lines fifty feet from each side of the red line. Between the two blue lines is called the ""neutral zone,"" while the space outside the blue lines is defended by each team.


At the ends of the rink, there are two thinner red lines where the net goes. In front of the goal there is an area called the crease. The crease is usually colored blue. This is the goaltender's area.
On the rink are also five face-off circles in which the puck is dropped to begin play at the beginning of the game, the period, or after a penalty that stops play.

, Each hockey game starts with a ""face-off,"" in which the puck is dropped by a referee between two opposing players at close range. From there, the clock starts and the game begins. One team takes control of the puck and attempts to score while the other team attempts to defend their goal or intercept the puck.


Like soccer or lacrosse, the game features fluid non-stop play, only pausing the action at the end of each period, after each point, or after a penalty.

, In hockey, major and minor penalties are distinguished by the length of time the player is sent off the ice and into the penalty box. A minor penalty results in 2 minutes of penalty box time, while a major results in 5 minutes.If a penalty is committed, the team must play down a player for the length of time of the penalty, without substituting a new player in. If the opposing team scores during the penalty period, the penalty ends. The same violations may result in a major or minor distinction at the discretion of the referee. Common penalties include:

Dangerous use of the stick, including slashing or high-sticking
Obstruction penalties, including hooking or tripping
Interfering with or checking a player not in control of the puck
Checking from behind or by targeting the head



, Because of the tough physical demands of ice hockey, players wear nearly as much if not more gear than football players, the most unique of which is the hockey stick and the skates.



Hockey sticks are wood or polycarbonate poles with a curved end, called the blade. Players use the stick to shuffle the puck across the ice and attempt to score. Getting a stick is essential in playing ice hockey. Get a size-fitted stick and learn to wrap it for play.

Hockey skates are sharpened and fitted for playing ice hockey. Hockey skates are more curved than regular ice skates, made for maneuverability and speed. They should be tight, with good ankle support and should be sharpened regularly.

Helmet and pads should be fitted to your body shape and weight. Usually, a hockey pad set-up includes shoulder pads, leg pads, and a secure helmet that will allow you to skate hard and play safely.

, Even if you're a proficient ice-skater, skating in hockey requires a whole new set of skills. Learning to change direction and brake properly without crashing into the boards will take some time, but developing a routine of practice will have you moving fast in no time. Before you even pick up a stick, develop your skating skills until skating is as natural as walking.


Skating backwards is essential in being a good all-around hockey player, allowing you to change direction at a moments notice and follow the play without having to adjust constantly. Learn to complete a ""mohawk"" by switching position quickly, stepping into your in-step while moving forward and transitioning to skating backwards.
Crossovers are also an essential part of hockey skating. Hockey players often change direction quickly not by skating, but by taking several quick side-steps, called cross-overs. Practice gripping the ice with your skates and taking side-steps to improve your game.

, In your non-dominant hand, hold the ball at the end of the stick handle, centering the stick with your body. Your other hand should hold the stick down two glove-lengths. The grip should be firm, but not tight.Keep the hockey stick out in front of you, your arms comfortably flexed but mostly straight. Don't keep the stick in close to your body.
Holding the stick properly and learning to move with it can be the difference between a great skater and a great hockey player. You won't be very effective on the ice if you can't use the hockey stick.

, As in basketball and soccer, you've got to learn to ""dribble"" the puck, moving it around as you skate to make it more difficult for the opposing players to take it from you. Practice shuffling the puck back and forth in front of you and to each side of you without moving your feet. Keep your eyes up and try to feel the puck without looking down at it.


Surprisingly, your control of the stick comes from your non-dominant hand, the one higher on the stick, not the lower hand that you write with. Learn to control the stick with your wrist, making gentle but quick movements with the puck to control it.

, Imagine your hockey stick as a leg and foot. To pass, you want the puck to roll off your hockey blade from the heel to the toe, using a sweeping motion to roll the puck, rather than stabbing at it. Follow through by completing the sweep of the stick after the puck has left your possession.Don't slap the puck when passing. One of the biggest misconceptions about playing ice hockey is that the best way to move the puck around the ice is to slap at it widely. While a slap shot is appropriate in some cases, passes require that you use more finesse on the puck.

, When you first hop on the ice, it's hard to learn to cushion the puck as it comes toward you. Angle the top of the blade of your hockey stick toward the ice slightly to create a pocket that you can use to trap the puck. Practice receiving hard passes without letting the puck bounce of your stick wildly and you'll be a valuable asset to your team.

, To shoot, sweep the puck forward and flick your wrists at the last minute to give the puck it's momentum and thrust. Follow through by pointing the toe of your hockey stick where you want the puck to go.


Like so many things, an accurate shot is all in the wrists. To develop your shots, learn to move your lower hand farther down the stick and position your body at a 45-degree angle to the net on your approach. As you bring the puck back, lower your shoulder and shift your weight to your back leg. Keep the puck as close to the middle of the blade as possible, and create the same kind of pocket you'd make to trap the puck after a pass. Then let it fly.

, The coordinator of the offense and the defense, the center is the player who takes the face-offs and serves as the team leader on the ice. If you want to play center, you need to be a great skater and a smart hockey player with an eye for strategy. Coaches want the center to be the smartest, most talented, and most experienced player on the team.

, There is perhaps no more difficult and iconic position in sports than the ice hockey goalie. Decked out in enough pads to stop an elephant, the goalie is sometimes all that stands between a wooden puck hurling 100 mph (160 km/h) toward the back of the net. A good goalie has quick reflexes, great hand-eye coordination, and laser-vision.

, The right and left wing are offensive players who work each side of the ice, playing physically and creatively, taking shots and scoring points. Wingmen need to be fast and accurate shooters who can scrap in the corners and work the boards.

, Because hockey is so fluid and the players are able to traverse the ice so quickly, defensive hockey players are more involved in the offense than in soccer or other similarly-structured games. Still, the defensive players' primary goal is to mark-up on the opposing team's wingmen and disrupt their play, then feed the puck to their own wings.

, As you start learning hockey, it's important to become a good all-around player. A good wingman is a lot more than a puck-hogger who can shoot the puck a million miles an hour. He also needs to play strategically, keeping the team working as a unit. Your hockey will be much better in general if you get a chance to see the ice from all the different positions.


Goalie, on the other hand, is a full-time commitment. Usually, the goalie starts early and sticks to it for life to learn the tricks of the trade.

, A good hockey player at any position has excellent vision, anticipating his or her teammates' motion and making crisp passes into space. It's hard to make accurate and intelligent passes if you've got your head glued to the ice. Keep your eyes up and look around.


This will come with time, after spending lots of time skating and practicing your puck control.

, Your team shouldn't be a 6-headed monster chasing the puck around the ice. Spread out, moving to space and finding the right angles to make passes around the ice and moving your offense forward in an attempt to score.


Good passes are more effective and essential to a team's success than the ability to juke out the defense and make hard shots all by yourself. You can't do this unless players move to space and get open.

, Make smart passes and control the puck to give your team the best chance to win. The team that controls the puck controls the game.


Keep the puck on the ice to eliminate the possibility of wild passes. Passes should be crisp, not hard, meaning that you need to try your best to control wild pucks that raise up off the surface of the ice. When shooting and passing, practice whipping the puck forward and avoiding dead-duck slaps.

, Inexperienced hockey players have a tendency to tense up in gameplay when they get the puck, gripping onto the stick too tight and losing their fundamentals and ability to control the puck. Suddenly, their passes are wild and too hard, their puck control crazy, and their play not so great. Learn to relax. Breathe deeply and have fun.

, The variety of skills required to be a good hockey player can take years to master and it helps to practice with other players and an experienced coach. Look for a league in your area that you can join to play recreationally, and learn the skills necessary to be a great hockey player.

, Problems in all aspects of your life including home, school and work can really bring you down. When you're down, your performance in everything can take a major hit. If you do have problems that are upsetting, you need to find a way to handle them. It is important that you keep your stress levels low and keep your mood stable.

, If you like watching baseball, go out for the Little League team; football, go out for the county team; etc.

, This will help you remember the techniques and rules better.

, For example, get a bat, baseball, and glove for baseball, or a football and kicking tee for football, etc.


Turn up with the correct equipment, organization is a valuable trait of a team member.

, If you're trying out for a team, make sure you know all of the rules and know how to play the game. Research the sport through any means such as books, the internet or through friends whom are familiar with the sport itself. Depending on the sport, you should try to master some of the skills which will be important for try-outs. For example if you are a good offensive Soccer player, you may want to make sure that you know how to play in defence in case you are needed in that position.


Learn the rules and regulations of that sport. There are a ton of people who will be willing to teach you the new sport, but have a good attitude or they'll give up on you!







, They'll keep you on track and be your support system when you're sore and don't want to get up, but you have to do the same for them, too!


If you have the opportunity and money, go to a camp. They'll teach you a lot of vital skills for the sport.

, If the coach knows you are responsible, hard-working and trustworthy then they will be much more willing to give you a spot on the team. Try to show these attributes at all times to develop you as a person on the team; however, don't ever believe that being trustworthy alone will get you a guaranteed place on the team. You need to be good at the sport itself too.


Coaches look for people who are teachable. Be willing to learn new things.
Talk to current team members so you can get advice to how to be a better player.

, Make sure you know who you're going up against and how good they are. Find their weakness and use it against them.

, Don't sign up at the last minute., Tardiness is almost always going to get you turned away. No coach wants to deal with someone who gives the impression that they don't care about the team or whether they make it or not.

, Use common sense and be appropriate. You don't want to be uncomfortable when playing., The tryouts will not be as easy as you think.

, Don't act like a show-off––chances are you'll just look foolish in front of people that have played years longer than you.

, Cheer and pump up the other players. The coach will want people that support each other, even if they aren't the best on the team.

, If you miss the free throw, as long as it doesn't hold everyone else up, try again. This will show the coach you're not a quitter.

, If not, don't be a sore loser. Thank the coach, tell the others that made it, ""Congratulations,"" and walk out with your head held up high, knowing that you did your best.

, If its running then you can run every day; this will build stamina and speed. Always be positive.

Adopt an athletic stance.,
Grip the bat properly.,
Drop your elbow.,
Relax your shoulders.,
Engage your whole body.,
Follow through with your swing.",How to Improve Bat Speed1," Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. Bend your knees and drop your butt to straighten out your back. In this stance, you’ll be able to generate the maximum amount of power., Hold the bat somewhat loosely. The bat should be touching your hand where your fingers meet your palm. If you hold your bat too high in your fingers, you won’t have as much control over it. If you bury the bat in your palm, your wrists won’t be able to push the bat smoothly.


If you tend to hold to the bat too tightly, try gripping the bat with only your middle, ring and pinky fingers. Your thumb and forefinger will naturally tighten when you make contact with the ball.
Your dominant hand should be directly above your weak hand and the knuckles of both hands should be lined up.

, Your front elbow should be down so that the top of your bat is at a forty-five degree angle behind your head. If your front elbow is up, your bat will have to travel further to reach the strike zone slowing down your swing significantly.


Make sure your bat isn’t straight up and down or you won’t be able to take a full swing.
Your back elbow should be slightly higher than your front elbow.

, Try to get rid of all your tension. You may think that tensing up your body helps you concentrate, but in reality all it does is waste your energy and prevent you from having a smooth swing.Save your energy for your swing.

, The speed of your swing is dependent on how much torque you can generate. Your swing starts in your legs, moves up to your hips and finishes by travelling through your arms to the bat. To perform a smooth, quick swing, your entire body should work together.









Torque is the power generated from your body’s twisting motion.

, Imagine that you are swinging through the ball. Flip your wrists at the climax of your swing to complete it. You want to drive the ball outward. If you stop your swing midway, it won’t be as powerful.









Don’t let your head follow your swing. Keep your eyes on the ball.

"
"
Swing a light bat.,
Swing by a fence.,
Cross your hands.,
Practice swinging your club through the strike zone.",How to Improve Bat Speed2," If you want a faster swing, you have to teach your body what it feels like to swing a bat faster. Choose a bat that is ten to fifteen percent lighter than your normal bat. Swing it as fast as you can for five reps. Do five sets of this three times a week.








Remember to have proper mechanics.
Don’t practice swinging with a heavier bat or you could alter your swing.

, Your swing should be compact for maximum speed. Walk to a fence and then measure out the proper length of your swing from the fence. Swing your bat by the fence. If you hit the fence, then your swing is dragging too long.


Do three sets of twenty reps three times a week.
This drill works best with a chain link fence. It could damage a wood fence.

, Switch the position of your hands. Have someone toss a ball up and practice driving it into the net. This will help you learn how to snap your wrists at the end of your swing and get the most out of the torque energy your body generates.


Do three sets of twenty reps three times a week.

, Assume a normal batting stance and have a friend toss up a ball. Practice swinging the club of your bat through the ball. Really focus your attention on the club of your bat. This drill will help you follow through with your swing. If you don’t swing through the ball, you can’t have a smooth swing.









Do three sets of twenty reps three times a week.

"
"
Work out your legs.,
Strengthen your obliques.,
Tighten your grip.,
Be explosive.",How to Improve Bat Speed3," Your swing begins in your legs. Exercise your legs so that you can generate more power at the beginning of your swing.


Do leg presses. Sit down at the leg press machine and put your feet flat on the platform. Make sure they're about shoulder-width apart. Unhook the safety bar and lower the platform till your knees are at a ninety degree angle. Push the weight all the way up and straighten your legs. Make sure not to lock your knees. Exhale as you push the weight up and inhale as you lower it. Do three sets of twenty reps.Do squats. Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Straighten your back and make sure your hips, knees, ankles and shoulders are parallel. Lower your buttocks while trying your best to keep your knees over your ankles. Push your chest out and roll your shoulders back to keep your body straight. When you get as low as you can, stand back up. Try to focus your weight on your heels so that you don't lean forward. You can do squats with your body weight, dumbbells or even at a weight bench. Do three sets of twelve reps., Your obliques are your side abdominals. They help your body achieve a more powerful twisting motion. The stronger your obliques are, the quicker you’ll be able to pull your bat around.








Do standing weighted twists. Hold a weight six to ten inches in front of your face and twist your midsection from side to side while keeping the rest of your body still. Your legs should be shoulder width apart. Do three sets of twenty reps.
Do windshield wipers. Lay on your back with your legs raised together so that the bottoms of your feet are facing the ceiling. Lower your legs from side to side while keeping your shoulders on the ground. Stretch your hands out to the side to keep your balance. Do three sets of twelve reps.

, You need strong muscles in your hands and wrists to be able to control the bat and get the most out of your swing. Try squeezing a tennis ball as hard as you can for about ten seconds. Relax your grip and then repeat the exercise with your other hand. Do this five times for each hand.


Do wrists curls. Bend your arm. Hold a dumbbell in your stretched out hand with your wrist facing up. Lift the dumbbell using only your wrist so that your knuckles are facing up. Do three sets of twenty reps with each hand.
Do reverse wrist curls. Bend your arm. Hold a dumbbell in your hand with your wrists facing down. Lift the weight using only your wrist up so that your knuckles are facing up. Do three sets of twenty reps with each hand.

, Your goal in your workout should be to achieve explosiveness in your swing. When you’re working out, you should lower the weight slowly, but lift it in one quick motion. You need to train your body not only to be strong, but to exert a massive amount of force.









For example, when you do leg presses, bend your knees slowly but straighten them as quickly as you can.

Determine what size you want your table to be.,
Plan or find dimensions for each part of the table.,
Decide on the type of wood for the playing surface.,
Cut boards for the sides.,
Fasten boards together.,
Add supports to the sides.,
Add plywood to the box.,
Lay carpet in your box.,
Cut the table legs the correct length.,
Use boards to help attach the table legs.,
Screw the boards onto the box.,

Reinforce the join.,
Paint or stain the playing surface.,
Paint or draw your game board.,
Seal with polyurethane.,
Lay and secure your surface in the box.,
Wax and spray the surface with silicone.",How to Make a Shuffleboard Table," The size of a shuffleboard table can range anywhere from nine feet to twenty-two feet. Keep in mind the amount of space you have to build and store it. You wouldn’t want to build a fourteen foot long table in a twelve foot shed. Remember you need at least two feet of additional space on each end of the table to actually play.


The size you decide on will affect what dimensions and plans you use for the playing surface, the bed and the legs.;
, You can find dimensions for shuffleboard tables online. They can save time and help you avoid mistakes. Looks for plans that are detailed and that tell you exactly how long the table should be, the width of the box, and the height of the legs. Map out the dimensions of each board you use, if you make plans yourself. Find pre-made plans at http://www.zieglerworld.com/shuffleboard-plans.htm.

, While maple or oak will give you the most durable table, these materials may be too expensive. For something more moderately priced, consider using plywood and bamboo flooring for the surface, which can be just as good once it's sealed and polished. Use mahogany for the trim, if you want a classic touch., The sides of the box should be sturdy, and if you can afford solid wood, that is best, but you can use many types of wood. Place your board on top of a saw horse so that the cut is made perpendicular to where you're standing. Clamp a metal straightedge, or a straight board, down to use as a guide. Carefully run your circular saw over the area you want cut.Remember you will need room for gutters. The box should be six inches longer on each end and several inches wider than the surface.
Because the boards square up the box, take extreme caution when cutting them. Adding any boards that are cut incorrectly will result in an uneven playing surface., Line boards up along the edges of each other to make a box frame. Pre-drill holes, if you’re using a softer wood like pine. This will prevent wood splitting. Use wood screws around the edges of the box to fasten them together., Because your table will be long, it is important to support the length of the box with additional boards to keep the wood from bending. Reinforce the sides by laying boards perpendicular to the length of the box. Space strips of board about a foot apart and place them towards the underside of the box. Secure them with wood screws along the sides.

, Use sheets of plywood cut to the correct dimensions to lay over the supports. Fasten the plywood together with mending plates. Drill wood screws through the plywood and some of the supports. There’s no need to drill through every support. Use just enough screws to attach the plywood., The carpet in the box will look nice, when the playing surface is laid, and it will catch and soften the blow of pucks during a lively game. Cut the carpet into pieces for the bottom and each side. Staple away to attach it to the wood.


Try to use a powerful staple gun for this job.
Look into battery operated guns, which may staple a bit stronger than manual ones.

, The top of the playing surface should be about three feet from the ground. Remember the rest of the table will be laying on the legs though. Adjust the length of the legs to the correct dimensions of the overall table and cut them accordingly.


If you’re building a table around sixteen feet or longer, additional legs will be needed to support the weight.

, Instead of screwing legs directly into the bottom of your box, attach them to separate boards first. This will further stabilize your shuffleboard table. You can use pieces of pine wood cut to the width of your box for each pair of legs. Drill screws into the boards to attach them to the legs., After you attach the legs to separate boards, you can simply attach the boards to the underside of the box. Position where you want the legs to be on the box, and drill into the boards to attach them.

, You may need something to hold your playing surface up. You can use nuts, bolts and rails to float the game board on. Drill holes on each end of the box from the bottom. Cut through carpet with a razor blade before you drill. Screw a bolt from the bottom so that it shows through the box. Place a rail or tie bar on top of the screw and secure it with bolts.

, Whatever wood you decide to use for the surface, inspect it for any knicks, warping or surface imperfections. Use your level to determine if it’s even. Sand any trouble areas down, until the surface is smooth.

, Since wood is unlikely to come in a piece as long as you need it, you will have to adhere sheets together for the playing board. Join two sheets together by first cutting the edges with a biscuit joiner. Have a biscuit ready, cover it in glue, and place it between the cut edges. As it dries, the glue expands, giving you a solid connection where the edges meet., Prevent the area you joined together from detaching by reinforcing it with board on the underside of the surface. You can use whatever board you have handy for this. Pine is inexpensive. Flip your surface upside down, cut a strip of board the width of your surface, cover the seam where the surface joins, and drill the board down.

, Whether you choose to use paint or stain will depend a lot on what type of wood you chose. If you braved working with a traditional solid maple surface, you will want to use stain. If you decided on MDF, use an opaque, oil-based paint to help make it more durable. Use either a water-based or oil-based paint on plywood.

, Consider drawing your game board using a felt tip pen or another fine drawing tool. Shuffleboard tables often allow for multiple types of scoring: lines in the standard game and circles in curling rules. Decide if you want to play using both scoring systems. Make sure paint on the surface is dry before drawing on it., You will need to seal the surface to protect it and allow for play. There are many types of polyurethane seal. What type of paint you used and how much time you have on your hands can point you in the right direction. An oil-based poly will take longer to dry, but can be more durable.
Don't use oil-based over a white surface, because it can yellow over time.
A water based poly dries quickly, but cannot be used over oil-based paint.

, You should be able to lay your surface on the rail structure you built in the box. For additional support, use more screws, nuts and bolts in discreet areas.

, Shuffleboard pucks should glide on the surface of your table. Wax it with furniture polish and buff with a soft cloth. Use silicone spray to extend the life of your waxing job and further seal the table."

Lack of talents-to make varsity easier and sooner.;
, The sooner the easier. Introduce yourself to the head coach prior to your freshman year. Let him know what your goals are and see what his goals are for the team. See what style the team plays at. Here are a few ways to make the team.


Hustle! Coaches love to see a guy that is willing to get down and dirty, fight to lose balls.
Be Athletic, people can't help but keep an eye out for the blazing fast kid or the kid that's throwing down dunks.
Be Well-Rounded, you don't even have to be average at every aspect of your game, EX: Don't look like you've never dribbled a ball or rebounded when doing drills
Do what you do best. Don't go out there doing new things or do that one move you practice every once in a while, if you're a shooter shoot 3's, slasher go to the basket, defensive types, stop your guy and try to get a steal/block.

Teach proper hand placement.,
Show the kids a proper stance.,
Have the kids practice passing.,
Play passing games.",How to Teach Volleyball to Kids1," Have them place one hand flat, place their other hand underneath that hand, and curl in their thumbs to the middle of their hands. Their forearms should form a flat surface, which is where the ball will be hit.Alternately, they can make a fist with their left hand and then cover the fist with their right hand so that their thumbs line up on top.
They should never interlock their fingers because it is dangerous and they could end up with a broken finger.;
, They should stand with their feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart and their knees bent. Have them practice squatting as if they were sitting in a chair.They should be light on their feet so that they can move and get to any ball. To help develop this agility, you can have them shuffle laterally from one side of the court to the other.

, The kids can stand in pairs and practice throwing the ball to one another. The ball should be thrown underhand to the other kid’s arms. The ball will be hit with their forearms back to the other kid. This is known as bumping the ball. Have them do this until they get used to the feel of hitting the ball on the proper surface.


One kid can hit the ball 10 times and then the other can hit the ball 10 times.

, You can then start moving around and making fun games out of it. For example, the ball can be thrown towards alternating sides of the child instead of directly at their arms. You could give them a point each time the child who threw the ball is able to catch the ball that was hit back towards them. The team with the most points at the end of a minute wins!

, Women should wear a sports bra, as it is a high impact sport. Men use a cup or jockstrap.

, Wear a short or long-sleeved T-shirt with a player number on the back. If your team does not have T-shirts with numbers, your league may provide jerseys for you. Also, wear sweatpants or track pants. Some broomball players prefer to wear hockey shorts instead of pants to protect hips when falling.

, There are specialty shoes for broomball, but most recreational leagues do not allow them. Hiking boots are also commonly banned. Regular tennis shoes will work just fine. In order to improve traction on the ice, make sure the bottoms of the shoes have good tread. Tie the laces in a double knot to make sure they stay tied.

This will be tough.,
Make the team.",How to Get on a D1 College Basketball Team3," Worst case scenario you'll have to walk on to that school. Being a walk on means you'll need to pay the normal price for the school (unless you are eligible for financial aid). Being a walk on also means that you do not have a spot on the team. Meaning you have to earn it in a try out.

, You basically have to do the same thing as trying to make the team back in high school. But this time, you have to be at least decent in every part of your game. But most importantly be athletic. If they see you flying all over the court and dunking left and right that gets a lot of attention. Then when they see that you shoot the ball well, they're gotta make a spot for you, hopefully.

Show them how to toss the ball.,
Teach them to step towards the ball.,
Have them make contact with the ball.,
Have them practice serving.,
Teach an underhand serve if they aren’t able to do an overhand serve.",How to Teach Volleyball to Kids2," With their non-hitting hand, kids should toss the ball in the air slightly in front of them. Their tossing hand shouldn’t move too much and the ball shouldn’t go too high. If the ball is thrown very high, then it will be moving faster and more difficult to hit. Aim for about 2ft (.6m) above the head and about 2ft (.6m) in front of them.The key to a good serve is to keep it simple. It should all be one smooth, fluid movement.

, Kids need to take a large step forward in the direction that they wish to hit the ball. This will help them to generate enough power to hit the ball over the net. They should step forward with the foot on the same side as their hitting hand., Their hitting arm should be extended above their head and they should hit the ball with the heel of their hand. This will help the ball to go the furthest without spinning. The arm should follow through after hitting the ball until the hand is down by their thigh.The hand should be completely open when hitting the ball.
The ball should be hit as it is descending from its toss. The kids should reach up towards the ball to make sure their arm is fully extended.

, They can stand several feet away from a wall and practice serving the ball against the wall. They can form pairs with one child on each side of the net and practice hitting it over. The key to getting a good serve is lots and lots of practice.The toss, step, and hit should all happen in one fluid motion.
Some kids won't be able to serve across the full court. You can have them stand closer to the net so that they can practice hitting the ball over.

, To serve the ball underhand, they can toss the ball and step forward, but they will move their hitting hand down by their side and then swing it forward instead raising it up in the air. They will hit the ball over the net with their fist. This method is the easiest for making contact with the ball.An underhand serve is easier for younger players, but they should still be practicing the overhand serve so that they can learn it and be able to do it eventually.

Teach proper hand placement.,
Have them practice catching the ball.,
Have them practice pushing the ball upwards.",How to Teach Volleyball to Kids3," When setting the ball, kids should start with both hands hovering right over their forehead. The thumbs and pointer fingers should form a triangle and the palms should face outward. The elbows should be out to the side in a wide position, which will provide leverage to push the ball. They will then push their hands upward to set the ball.The key is for the hands to make contact with the ball when it is right at their foreheads and for all 10 fingers to touch the ball.

, They can toss the ball up to themselves and catch it right above their forehead with their hands in the setting position. Their fingers should wrap around the ball. This will help them get used to the setting position.This drill can be done seated so that kids don’t worry about foot placement.

, You can divide the kids into pairs. One child can toss the ball to themselves and then instead of catching it, they will set it to the other kid. They should push the ball upwards, straightening their arms into parallel lines in one smooth, direct motion. The other kid should be about 5 feet (or 1.5m) away and they will catch the ball.The child setting the ball can remain seated and the other child can stand and catch the ball and return it to their partner. After 10 times, they can switch turns.
To make this drill more difficult, increase the distance between the kids by having them take a large step backwards. To set the ball further, they will need to push their arms more diagonally rather than straight up. You can increase the distance so that the kids are up to 10ft (about 3m) apart total.

Stick to dynamic stretching.,
Run, jog, or walk.,
Practice some side steps.,
Do a few high knees.,
Warm up your quads with heel flicks.,
Jump.,
Swing your legs.,
Stretch your back (optional).,
Perform static stretches after exercise.,
Stretch your calves.,
Stretch your hamstrings.,
Work on your quadriceps.,
Try the ""touch the grass"" stretch.",How to Stretch for Volleyball," Dynamic stretching involves active movement, warming up your muscles for exercise. Avoid static stretches (holding a stretch) before exercise, as this does not prepare your body and may even decrease athletic performance.The rest of this section describes various dynamic stretches that are useful for volleyball players. You may go through all of them, or pick and choose the ones that seem to help most.;
, A few minutes of light to moderate exercise will warm up your muscles. Maintain a moderate pace, but don't push yourself to the point of gasping or exhaustion.

, Next, get some lateral lunges in to warm up for side-to-side movements. Make sure to avoid overextending your thigh muscles, keeping your knee directly above your toes.

, Stand up straight with your feet at hip width apart. Jump from one foot to the other, lifting the other knee up to hip height.This will improve your hip flexibility.


You're doing this as a warm up, not an intense exercise. Stick to moderate speed.

, Return to a low-intensity jog. Every couple steps, bring one of your feet backward to touch against your backside. Alternate feet as you do this.Don't push back with force. Make it a slight flick that brings your foot up for only a moment.
There is no need to bring your knee forward for this exercise. Keep your upper leg close to vertical.

, Jump forward about 1.5 meters (5 feet), or less if necessary for a comfortable landing. Try to land as quietly as possible, then stand slowly. Repeat this exercise five times.

, By now your muscles should be well warmed up. Add some leg flexibility with some targeted dynamic stretches, such as the leg swing:


Stand sideways to a wall and put your hand out against it for support.
Swing the leg closest to the wall forward and back as high as you can. Do not hold your leg in an upright position.
Turn around and put your other hand against the wall. Repeat with the other leg.

, If your back is sore or tight, address that with a targeted exercise. Here's one option:


Lie flat on the ground with your arms straight out, in a T shape.
Swing your leg toward your opposite arm, keeping both shoulders on the ground.
Return that leg immediately to the ground.
Repeat the exercise with alternating legs.

, Static stretches hold one of your muscles in an extended position. These exercises improve your flexibility and help your recovery after exercise. Read on for examples of these stretches, starting at the lower muscles and moving up.

, Places your toes against a wall and your heel on the floor next to it, with your foot in a straight line. Push your heel down and lean toward the wall with that leg, with your other leg behind you for balance.

, Sit down and place your left foot against your right knee. Lower your left knee to the ground, or as close to it as you can with moderate stretching. Reach for your right foot with your right hand and hold it for a few seconds. Repeat with your other foot.

, Sit up straight with your legs outstretched. Bend one leg at the knee while keeping it flat, bringing that foot to the side of your body. Lean back to stretch the quad on that side. Repeat for your other leg.

, Volleyball usually puts the most use on the thighs and calves. Try this exercise to stretch them out after a game:


Stand up straight with your feet wide apart.
Bend over and touch your right hand to your right foot. Hold for 20-30 seconds.
Repeat 10–20 times, alternating feet.

Put on your padding.,
Find a helmet of appropriate size.,
Pull on your water-proof gloves.",How to Dress for Recreational Broomball2," Start with your leg guards; hockey style knee guards are the best protection for the legs because they protect the knee and shin. Next, pull on elbow pads. Finally, you may want to use rollerblading wrist guards.

, It should be snug on your head, so when you turn side to side it doesn't move. But, it shouldn’t be so tight as to cause a headache. Helmets are required for all players in all leagues. If you are having trouble with your helmet, ask a teammate for help.

, Gloves keep your hands warm and provide some protection when falling.

"
"
Decide whether to wear shoulder pads.,
Get a girdle.,
An athletic cup is very important for both male and female players and is required of players under the age of 18.

,
Get shin guards.,
Helmets are also a required piece of equipment for all ages and for players under the age of 18 it also required they wear a full face cage or shield.,
Mouth pieces are only required of players under the age of 18 however, but are recommended.

,
Hockey gloves are important if you like having the use of your fingers.,
Hockey elbow pads are another piece of equipment that is not worn by many players and most definitely should be worn every time you are on the floor.

,
Choose your skates carefully.,
Put your shin guards wherever they feel comfortable.,
Typically, inline hockey uniforms call for inline hockey pants which you wear over your girdle and shin guards.,
Inline Jerseys are also much lighter than ice jerseys.",How to Dress for Roller Hockey," With the exception a a few professional inline leagues, most inline hockey players do not wear shoulder pads because direct checking is not allowed, although, rubbing players into the boards is OK. There are players however, that feel more comfortable and protected wearing shoulder pads anyway. Another alternative to shoulder pads that many high level players wear, is a padded shirt. These are breathable stretch shirts with pieces of foam and hard plastic shells inserted. They offer good protection without having bulk of shoulder pads.(They are also socially accepted so you won't get chirped at. XD);
, One piece of equipment a lot of inline players do not wear but should is a girdle or ""hockey pants."" Inline girdles are more lightweight and cooler than ice girdles. There might not be legal checking, but this is still a contact sport and collisions are frequent. Most inline girdles have a jock built in and some even come with a cup.

,, Shin guards are both recommended and required equipment. Ice hockey shin guards are more often than not exactly the same as inline, as in, shin guards are shin guards as long as they are designed for hockey. Hockey shin guards also provide knee protection unlike soccer shin guards for example, and are designed to take the impact of a puck as well as a stick.

, Many players over the age of 18 prefer no extra face protection or wear a half shield. A full face cage or shield is highly recommended.

,, Often times sticks from opposing players will get up on the hands, many times unintentionally. Gloves are the same as shin guards in the sense there is no difference between ice hockey and inline gloves.

,, Inline Hockey skates for the most part, are ice hockey skates with wheels. If you are looking for skates, try them on first and see what feels comfortable to you. If you have the option, bake new skates. Baking skates helps them conform to the shape of your foot and much faster. This makes the breaking in process shorter and less painful. One mistake a lot of new or inexperienced skaters make is not tying their skates tight enough. Once you have the skates good a tight, pull them tighter. The tighter the skate the healthier for your ankles and knees but also, the better and faster you will be able to skate. Loose skates will be harder to stand on and when you take a stride will absorb the energy of your push whereas a tight skate will transfer that energy through the skate to the floor.

, This is a matter a preference. Some people like to wear their shins over the tongue of their skates. Other players prefer to wear their shins under the tongue, or inside their skates.

, Ice on the other hand calls for a bigger girdle so nothing is worn over it, instead hockey socks are worn to cover the shin guards. Some inline players also play ice and wear an ice girdle and hockey socks when playing inline. Other inline players wear shorts over their girdle and wear ice hockey socks. Wearing pants or socks is not important however, most leagues require you to cover all your pads.

, The type of jersey you wear does not matter however, inline jerseys are much cooler than ice jerseys.

Use hand signals when your partner is serving from behind you.,
Position your hands properly.,
Signal who you want your partner to serve to.,
Signal a split court/no block.,
Signal a double line block.,
Signal a double cross block.,
Signal a line-cross block.",How to Use Hand Signals in Beach Volleyball," You should be positioned in front of your partner at the net, blocking. These signals help you communicate who they should serve to, when and where to block, and more. You can even come up with your own signals; just make sure that your partner clearly understands what it means.
, All signals should be made behind your back so that your opponents don't know what you are going to do. Most people put the signal behind their butt., Make a fist with your pinky finger sticking out on both hands.

Whichever side your hand is on coordinates with the player on that side. Shake or wave the hand on the side that coordinates with the person you want your partner to serve to.

, To do this, make a fist with both hands., To do this, point your index finger with both hands or' use one hand and point your index and pinky fingers (like the ""rock on"" symbol. #*Typically this means that you will peel to the side coordinating with the side your partner serves to on the other side of the net. Your partner will then cover the other side., The same goes for double cross as double line except, instead of pointing your index finger, you will extend your index and middle finger like the ""peace out"" gesture.

You cannot do this on one hand.

, Once again, coordinate with the appropriate side. On one hand, point your index finger and on the other, point the middle and index fingers."

Examine the hats.,
Consider a baseball hat frame.,
Load the dishwasher with hats only.,
Set the dishwasher to a short wash without drying.,
Add dishwasher detergent carefully.,
Let air dry.",How to Clean Baseball Hats with a Dishwasher," Some cleaning experts recommend avoiding this method for the safety of your caps. Others think it's acceptable, but acknowledge the risk of damage.Wash the hat by hand or in a washing machine instead if you notice one of these warning signs:


A cleaning tag that says ""cold wash only""
Fraying stitches, tears, or other signs of damage
Wool material
A cardboard brim; these are usually only found in hats made in the 1990's or earlier.Washing sentimental hats is not recommended, since there's always some risk of damage.;
, Also called baseball hat cages or shapers, these are intended to protect the hat's shape. They will not protect your hat from heat or moisture, but they should stop severe bending. Simply open the frame, place your hat inside, and snap the frame shut around it.


Confirm that the frame is dishwasher-safe before you buy it.
This may void your dishwasher's warranty., For hygienic reasons, do not mix dishes and clothing in the same load. Place the hats on the upper rack, where heat and water pressure are usually less intense.

, Set your dishwasher to the shortest wash cycle. Never include a drying cycle, which can bend or wrinkle the hat due to intense heat.If your dishwasher has a temperature setting, choose a low-heat option.

, Adding detergent is risky, since it may alter the fabric color. Use a small amount of detergent, and avoid lemon detergent and products that contain bleach.


For added safety, rub a small amount of the detergent on a hidden corner of the hat. Wait until dry to check for color fastness.
Consider skipping detergent completely if you're just trying to get rid of mild grime. Unless you plan to eat soup out of your hat, it doesn't need to be as clean as your dishes.

, When the washing machine is finished, leave your hats to dry on a drying rack. If using a baseball cap framer, leave it on to prevent shrinking.

Analyze the player's contract.,
Provide the player with written notice.,
Pay the player any money due under the contract.",How to End a Standard Player Contract1," While the standard player contract includes basic provisions for termination of the contract, an individual player's addendum may have additional clauses that address contract termination.For example, the SPK used in the NFL allows clubs to release players at any time. Since the NFL has salary caps and requires teams to pay fines for going over the salary cap, teams often release players so they can stay below the salary cap.
A high-profile player may negotiate an addendum that specifies certain conditions must be met or that he is guaranteed a certain amount of money if he is released for such a reason.
Keep in mind that teams normally are reluctant to make deals that guarantee money, because they have to pay that money even if they release the player – and that payout counts towards the team's total payroll for the purposes of the league's salary cap.;
, Typically if a club plans to release a player the contract requires the club to provide that player of written notice that he or she is being released.For example, the SPK used in the NFL provides that a contract is terminated when the player receives written notice that his contract has been terminated.
The termination is effective on that day – there is no advance notice required under the SPK, although individual players are free to negotiate such conditions.

, When the player is released, the club must pay that player any money he or she has earned in the current pay period, as well as any additional amount specified in the SPK or the player's addendum.For example, if the player is paid every other week during the season, and he is released mid-season, he would receive a paycheck for the days he'd been on the roster during that pay period before the date he was released.
In most cases, players aren't entitled to any money besides this once they are released.
In contrast to the NFL, professional baseball players are entitled to termination pay plus reasonable traveling expenses back to their home town if their clubs terminate their contracts.

Try your hand at first base.,
Practice the shortstop and second base positions.,
Test your skills at third base.,
Perfect your throwing as a pitcher.,
See how good you are as a catcher.,
Give the outfielder position a try.,
Don’t neglect your hitting skills.,
Make a list of your strengths and weaknesses.,
Choose a position that makes sense for your skill set.,
Talk to your coach.,
Don’t overspecialize.",How to Choose a Baseball Position," As the name suggests, a first baseman is responsible for watching the line between home plate and first base. Lots of balls get thrown toward first base, so get practice catching if you want play the position. You’ll need to be skilled at keeping a foot on the base while also catching balls headed your way in order to make outs.First basemen need good focus, since the position gets action in many plays.
If you are tall, this can be to your advantage when choosing the first base position, since a first baseman has to catch a lot of balls.
A strong throwing arm is less necessary for this position.;
, These two positions often work together, so try your hand at both if you are interested in either. Shortstops and second baseman need to pay attention and think ahead when runners are on or headed toward bases, so that they are prepared to make a catch, touch a base, tag a runner, or get a ball to another baseman to make an out.Shortstops hover between second and third base, which means they need to be prepared for action. These players often have more movement than any other, so stay focused when you’re trying out the position.
Outfielders frequently throw balls to the shortstop, who relays them to one of the bases to make an out.
A good throwing arm, speed, and agility are essential for both second basemen and shortstops.

, Be prepared to see less frequent action when playing third base, since this position probably has less contact with the ball than the other infield positions. However, you’ll need to work on your speed, because when your moment comes, you’ll have to act fast to catch a ball and try to throw it all the way to first to try and get an out.Bunts and grounders often go to a third basemen, so concentrate on reacting to these if you are interested in the position.

, Standing in the center of the field, pitchers get a lot of attention, but they have a tough job. Practice your throwing arm, since you’ll need to throw pitches that are hard for the batter to hit--fast ones, but also curves, screwball, and others. Don’t neglect your catching skills, either, because if you want to be a pitcher, you’ll need to be ready for bunts, grounders, and popups., While it might look like the catcher doesn’t move much, it's one of the most important positions. If you’re a good leader, then try this position. You’ll be facing your teammates, and have to be good at “calling the game.” In particular, you’ll have to work well with the pitcher, by signaling which type of pitch is needed.If you’re an active player but not the best hitter, you might consider this position, since batting ability isn’t necessarily considered a high priority for it.
Catchers may also need to keep track of balls and strikes, and be ready to participate in infield plays when needed. If you’re trying out for the catcher position, keep your mind on these skills as well., Though sometimes they get a bad name or are looked down on, outfield positions show their importance in critical moments of the game. There are three outfield positions, but the general skills needed for them overlap. Try one of the outfield positions if you’re a great hitter but fielding isn’t your strength.Center field needs to be prepared to cover a lot of ground. If any balls make it past the shortstop and second baseman, or to the wall, it’ll be your job to go after them and get them back to the diamond to make an out.
Left field concentrates on the part of the field past third base. This position can have to handle a lot of hits, since so many hitters are right-handed.
Right field will need a strong arm. If a deep ball comes your way, you may have to throw it all the way to third base, since the hitter will have had more run time.
Whichever outfield position you try, be prepared to have less frequent action. On the other hand, you’ll need to stay focused on the game for when your moment comes, and when it does, you’ll have to act fast and cover a lot of ground.

, Every player will benefit from being a strong and consistent hitter. Practice lots of swings so you’ll be ready when it’s your turn to step up to the plate.


Your coach may develop a batting order based on hitting ability, but other factors come into play as well, so make sure to ask if you have questions.

, To make the best choice, you’ll have to have a good sense of what you excel at, and what you might need to improve on. Make some notes for yourself to rank your ability in critical skills, including:


Throwing speed
Throwing distance
Running speed
Reaction time
Catching ability

, You might have your heart set on a particular position. Baseball is a team sport, however, and a team is only strong if its members are in the right plays. Think about which skills you are good at, and choose a position that needs your strengths most of all, and allows you to work on your weaknesses outside of game time.For instance, you might think that you’ve always wanted to be a shortstop, but have trouble getting balls to other basemen as quickly as the position requires.
On the other hand, maybe no one can touch your throwing distance. That means that right field might be the position for you. It will give you a chance to shine when you throw beautifully all the way across the field.
You can also work on making quick throws in practice time to improve on your weaker skill.

, If you're interested in playing a particular position, your coach can work with you on how to improve, and try to give you practice at it. Or, if you’re not sure of which position you want to concentrate on, talk to a coach about it. They can give you feedback and share observations about what your strengths might be so that you can make the right decision.

, Good players will be able to give any position a try, and be better off for it. Though pros get a lot of attention for being a star in one position, coaches put value in “utility players,” those able to perform well in lots of different plays and positions. Experts also warn that overspecialization, especially when you’re young, can actually hurt your playing ability.If you’re unsure of what position to play, give them all a try!
If you’re tired of playing one position, or want to expand your skill set, practice a new one!
Ask your coach if you want to try something new.

Review league rules.,
Request waivers from other clubs.,
Notify the player.,
Confirm the transfer.,
Complete the transfer.",How to End a Standard Player Contract2," Each league has its own rules that govern when players can be traded to other teams within the league, and what procedures must be used.In most professional sports leagues, players have substantially fewer reasons to terminate their contracts than clubs do. For example, in Major League Baseball, a player can only terminate his contract if the club doesn't pay him, and only then if the club still doesn't pay him within 10 days after receipt of written notice.
An MLB club, in contrast, can terminate a player's contract if he fails to conform his personal conduct to the league's standards of good citizenship and sportsmanship, fails to keep himself in peak physical condition, or fails to exhibit skill or ability sufficient to qualify him for continued membership on the club's roster.
Often these criteria, including the assessment that a player lacks sufficient skill or ability, are subjective assessments made by the club's management. As such, an MLB standard player contract can be terminated by a club based on management's opinion.

, One of the more common procedures used is to have the club that currently has the player request waivers from other clubs who want and have the ability to sign the player the club wants to transfer.This procedure is used by MLB clubs and is outlined in the MLB standard player contract.
A club that wants to terminate a player's contract must request waivers from all other MLB clubs. Waivers are requested from each team in order from the lowest-ranked team in the standings to the highest.
If another club wants the player, it may claim assignment of the player's contract. These claims are valid for two business days.

, Typically a player must be notified either before or soon after the club issues a request for waivers that the club intends to transfer the player's contract.Under MLB procedure, if the club receives a claim from another club, it must notify the player that waivers were requested for the purpose of terminating his contract, and that his contract was claimed by another team.
Once a baseball player receives notice that his contract has been claimed by another team, he has five days to decide whether he wants to transfer to the new team or be released.
During the five-day period, the player can choose to terminate his contract by providing written notice to his club.
If he fails to provide notice to his club that he wants to terminate his contract, his contract will be assigned to the new team.

, Once a team has been chosen and has accepted the player, the original contract is terminated and the player must sign a new contract with his or her new club.If the waiver period ends and no team has claimed the player, his contract is fully terminated.
Baseball has two trade deadlines: July 31 and August 31. Players traded after July 31 must go through waivers. Those traded after August 31 cannot be included on any postseason roster.

, Standard player contracts and collective bargaining agreements typically require a player to report to the new club immediately after the contract is assigned.All obligations between the club and the player under the contract cease on the date of termination, except that the club must pay the player any income he has earned to that date, as well as any moving allowances.
The NFL's standard player contract does not require use of the waiver system. Rather, a player's contract can be assigned to any other team in the league at any time.
The new team agrees to take over the contract on the same terms and pays the player's travel expenses to report to the team.

"
Check the collective bargaining agreement.,
Notify the other party of your grievance.,
Receive an answer from the other party.,
Create an outline of your legal and factual position.,
Attend the grievance hearing.,
Request arbitration.,
Attend the arbitration hearing.,
Accept the arbitrator's decision.",How to End a Standard Player Contract3," In some professional sports, termination of contracts due to a breach requires the parties to follow a particular grievance procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' association.The arbitration method of ending a standard player contract is most commonly used in the NHL, and the collective bargaining agreement of the NHL/NHLPA establishes that the league and the players' association, through the grievance procedure laid out in the agreement, are the sole arbiters of grievances between players and clubs.
However, either the player or the club, if dissatisfied with the results of the grievance procedure, can request an impartial arbitrator be appointed to resolve the dispute.
For example, if an NHL team wants to terminate a player's contract because the player has breached his contract, the team must file a grievance and ultimately submit to arbitration.

, League procedures typically require players or clubs to notify the other party of any grievance under the contract within a specific period of time after the incident that gave rise to the dispute.For example, the NHL/NHLPA collective bargaining agreement requires the grievance process to be initiated within 60 days of the date the incident occurred, or the date that the party became aware of the problem.
The NHL/NHLPA collective bargaining agreement includes specific rules for effective service of written notices. They can be sent using email, or using fax if internet service is unavailable.
Notice to players may be sent through the player's certified agent or through the NHLPA.

, Typically the other party has a deadline set forth in the collective bargaining agreement to respond to the notice in writing.In the NHL, the other party must respond to the notice within 10 days, and admit or deny each fact alleged in the notice.
If the receiving party denies any facts alleged, it must provide the specific grounds for each denial.

, In some leagues such as the NHL, each party is required to give the other an outline of its legal and factual position concerning the grievance in advance of the grievance hearing.These outlines must be provided to the other party at least seven days in advance of the grievance committee hearing during which the grievance will be heard.

, A separate grievance hearing in front of representatives from the league and the player's association may be held in advance or instead of a hearing before an impartial arbitrator.Under the NHL/NHLPA collective bargaining agreement, the grievance committee, formed by representatives from the league and the players' association, meets once every two months.
Each meeting covers grievances filed at least 30 days prior to the meeting. Grievances filed later will be heard at the next meeting. In other words, if the grievance committee is meeting 10 days from the date the grievance is filed, that grievance will be heard in the meeting occurring in two months and 10 days.

, If the dispute isn't resolved through the grievance proceeding, the party that filed the grievance may request a hearing before an impartial arbitrator.Under the NHL/NHLPA agreement, the arbitrator must be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators.
For example, if an NHL team wanted to terminate a player's contract and the grievance committee found no grounds to terminate that player's contract, the team could request an impartial arbitrator to hear the matter.
If arbitration is requested, each party must submit a disclosure statement to the other party that provides a statement of the issues, the factual background of the case, the theory of the case, and any witnesses or documents that will be produced as evidence.
If documents are listed, they must be attached to the disclosure statement.
The party that requested arbitration must submit its disclosure statement to the other party at least 30 days before the date of the hearing. The other party must submit its disclosure statement at least 20 days before the date of the hearing, so it has 10 days to complete and submit its disclosure statement after receiving the statement from the grieving party.
The costs of arbitration are shared equally among both parties.

, An arbitration hearing typically works much like a court hearing, with the arbitrator listening as both parties present their sides of the dispute and then deciding which party should prevail, much like a judge.Arbitration hearings under the NHL/NHLPA collective bargaining agreement take place either in New York or Toronto. The parties can agree to hold the hearing in another location.
Witnesses are expected to testify at these hearings. If a witness is unavailable, the parties may agree to allow the witness to appear and give testimony over the telephone, or the hearing will be rescheduled for a date on which the witness can attend.

, Typically an arbitrator's decision is binding on both parties under the collective bargaining agreement, so there is no opportunity for appeal if you disagree.Under the NHL/NHLPA collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator must issue a written decision within 30 days of the date of the hearing.
The arbitrator's decision constitutes a full, final, and complete disposition of the grievance.

A lot of mud on your cleats will take longer to dissolve. Do not leave your cleats in the water for longer than 7 minutes, as you may damage the plastic or leather fabric of the shoe.

, Rub with the brush to remove mud and dirt that has been softened by the water., Dunking your cleats after using the brush will rinse off softened dirt left behind by the scrubbing brush., This will allow you to clean underneath the laces, and the laces themselves. It is useful to remove laces so that you don't miss small pockets of dirt., Most laces will be clean after being soaked and scrubbed. If your laces are not clean, wash them in the sink. You can lay the laces aside to dry with your cleats later., Pieces of dirt, mud, and rocks can get stuck between cleat spikes. Use a cloth to rub each spike clean, and get your fingers and the cloth into the small spaces between the spikes.Use a toothbrush to scrub between cleats on small-size shoes.

, Bad grass stains and scuff marks may not come off in warm water. Put a small amount of stain remover on the stain and rub it off with a damp cloth., Work a small amount of dish soap into a cloth and wipe down the shoe, including the outer material over the foot and the laces.Dish soap dissolves bacteria that causes shoes to smell. Your shoe will smell better if you use dish soap to clean it.
Try not to soak your shoe in dish soap. It will soak into the lining of your shoe and be hard to rinse out. This can cause uncomfortable suds to form in your shoe when you sweat in it.

, Going over the shoe multiple times will keep it looking new and smelling good for longer after you clean it.

, Hold them under a tap, shower or hosepipe to wash off dirt, sand and soap.Clean up dirt and soap from the sink, tub, or backyard after you are finished.

, Pour water into your shoe and shake it out to clean sand from inside your shoe., Use a dry cloth to wipe your cleats and remove excess moisture from the outside of the shoe., Push kitchen towel, newspaper or a dry cloth into your shoe and count to ten before removing it to soak up moisture inside the shoe., Direct sunlight will dry your shoes fast, but can damage some shoes so leave your shoes in a shady, warm outdoor area. You can also dry them indoors in a warm area such as a laundry room or drying cupboard.Try not to leave your shoes outdoors to dry overnight. Local animals may chew them, and overnight dew will make them damp.

, Thread the laces back through the lace holes in your cleats when dry. Start lacing at the bottom of the shoe and move upwards."

Consider time zones.If a team’s home stadium is based in the same time zone that you live in, relax, no worries.",How to Choose a Baseball Team to Support1," Do you have a lot of state or city pride? Do you have a readymade home team based nearby? Is their home stadium close enough for you to make a day-trip so you can root for them in person? If the answers to all three is yes, consider throwing your support behind whichever team represents your hometown or state. Buy season passes or the occasional tickets for individual games. Bond with your team by forging memories that are stronger and more personal than so many days or nights spent watching tiny figures move around a TV screen., If you have more than one option as far as nearby teams go, but still feel no particular loyalty to one over the other(s), take their home stadiums into consideration. Is it an eyesore? Depressingly empty of attendees?A pain in the butt to get to and/or out of? Reduce the number of inconveniences and annoyances that might mar your outings and overall experience of supporting a team. Choose a ballpark that you enjoy going to, rather than suffer in one you hate.

, Does attending a game in person do nothing for you? Do you feel ambivalent about your local team anyway? Or do you outright despise them for some reason? Then broaden your horizons. Consider other teams in the league that are based in other states or cities. Before you settle on one, however, be sure that your local TV and radio affiliates broadcast their games regularly so you can actually follow their season.

, But if they are situated on the other side of the country, compare your schedules. Are you likely to be eating dinner with the family, doing homework, or turning in early to face another busy day at the office when their games typically start? Or are you going to still be stuck at school, work, or in traffic when their games usually wrap up? If the answer is yes, consider choosing a team closer to home so you can watch their games consistently.

Buy an eraser.,
Grip the ball by the seams.This will help prevent any dirt or oils on your fingers from making additional smudges on the ball while you work.,
Rub the eraser on the dirty spot on the ball.",How to Clean a Dirty Baseball1," A simple pencil eraser can remove most stains from white leather, including grass stains and scuffs. Using a small eraser, such as one on a pencil top, can help to clean up a small scuff or mark on a particular spot on the baseball.You can also use it to rub away dirt from the whole surface. However, you might want to get a larger eraser for cleaning the entire ball.


You can use any type of common eraser, including ones made of rubber, vinyl, or art gum.
Try to find an eraser that is either white or free of any intense color. Erasers that are dyed bright colors like pink may rub off onto your ball, making an even worse mark.
Don't use this method on an autographed baseball. The eraser is likely to remove ink just as readily as it will dirt.Don't use this method on stains that are still wet, which can spread the stain. Blot away excess liquid with a moist paper towel and wait for it to dry.;
, Be sure to also wash your hands before you begin and wipe down your work area.

, Press the eraser against the surface of the ball. Rub the eraser back and forth over the spot you wish to clean, just as you would erase a mark off of a piece of paper. Repeat this motion until the dirt or marks come away."

Do you feel more kinship with that plucky, ragtag Rebel Alliance than you do with the exalted institution known as Starfleet? Do you savor the journey more than the destination? Then follow your instinct by backing a team whose victories are always hard-won. Reward your devotion by sharing in triumphs that amount to more than just gimmes.

, Are you addicted to winning? Do you value consistency? Then pick a proven contender. Find a team that finishes strongly season after season, like the Yankees, Cardinals, or Dodgers.Do your homework, though, to make sure you choose a team that has shown itself to be dependable time and time again, rather than simply picking last year’s champs, who may have only been an underdog team that won by chance.

, If no one team calls out to you, forget them altogether. Consider individual players. Do you already have a strong familiarity with those who have achieved star status?Does a particular team member embody your personal ideals and philosophies in terms of sportsmanship? Follow your gut and root for them regardless of what team they play for or where they are based.

, Are you having trouble forcing yourself to “like” a team you happened to pick? Do you feel like you would have the same trouble forging a bond with any other? Then go the opposite route. Ask yourself: “Is there a team out there that I absolutely loathe?” If so, find out who their rivals are. Throw your support behind them so you can at least feel uplifted if and when they trounce that other team you hate so much., If you find that you just don’t care that much about location, players, or status, pick a team whose uniform pleases your eye. Choose one based on your favorite color, or go by their mascots. Do you think marlins are the most beautiful fish out there? Support Miami. Do you love to sail the open sea? Then follow the Seattle Mariners., If your immediate family, friends, neighbors, etc. all support one team, root for the same one. Stoke your own enthusiasm by siphoning off theirs! Take part in the group atmosphere in order to feel more invested in the game. Make forging a bond with your new team that much easier by linking it with bonds that you already share with other people in your life.


Conversely, if you love to be the contrarian in the group, root for anyone but their favorite team–especially their rival, if they have one.

, If you are following an interscholastic league, whether it be college, high school, or younger, root for your current or former school's team. Rely on your personal connection with that school in order to foster a new connection with their baseball team. Feel closer to the players on the field by playing Six Degrees of Separation between them and yourself.

Find out what other teams they belonged to before joining yours. Go over recent seasons to see how new members helped or hurt their game, and how the loss of other players may have done the same. Dive into the off-the-field drama of scandals, backroom politics, and draft picks to round out your knowledge of the team as a whole.

, You don’t have to memorize the stats of every single player who ever played for them since the team was founded (although this will probably impress people if you do), but at least familiarize yourself with the team’s general history. For instance, you don’t want to claim to be a diehard L.A. Dodgers fan and then be called out for not knowing that the Dodgers were once based in Brooklyn. Memorize such basic facts as pennants they have won in the past, former players who were inducted into the Hall of Fame, and those players who weren’t inducted but should have been according to other fans.

, Even if you are unable to watch every single game, provide ample time in your life to keep up-to-date on their performance so far. Stay informed about who is injured and otherwise underperforming. Devote a chunk of your brain to planning how you would personally strategize future games based on current predicaments.

, Use “we” instead of “they” when talking about the team. True, you aren’t technically part of the team, but you are a fan and part of the franchise, so think of your team as extended family whose every action effects you personally. Allow yourself to be swept up in the drama. Revel in their victories as if they symbolize your own. Take it to heart when they make mistakes. Participate in casual debates, online forums, and call-in shows to share your opinions and argue with others.

Purchase a magic eraser.,
Wet the magic eraser.,
Rub the surface of the ball with the magic eraser.,
Rotate the ball as you clean.",How to Clean a Dirty Baseball2," Magic erasers are a popular type of household cleaning product made from melamine foam. Although a fairly new cleaner, magic erasers have become quite common and can usually be found at your local grocery store. Use a magic eraser when you want to clean the whole surface of the ball quickly.


Magic erasers are especially effective for removing all types of stains from white leather. However, keep in mind that also includes ink stains. Don't use a magic eraser on an autographed ball., Run your eraser under the tap and squeeze to remove excess water. While magic erasers can also be used dry, they are more effective with some moisture. Water makes it easier for dirt to cling to in the same way that a wet paper towel is a much more effective cleaning tool compared to a dry one.You may also choose to cut your magic eraser into multiple pieces with a pair of scissors. You'll increase its surface area, getting more use for your money. The smaller size will also be easier to grip while working on a small object like a baseball., Melamine foam is a soft material with an extremely hard microstructure that works as an abrasive cleaner. In other words, magic erasers clean surfaces in a manner similar to a sander, directly scraping away dirt and grime with friction. Because magic erasers don't hold their shape, you will need to both grip yours securely and press down fairly hard. From there, make a few back-and-forth motions as you would erase pencil from paper. It should lift the stain fairly quickly, needing only a few passes to work its ""magic."", Turn the ball in your hand and continue to rub until the entire surface is clean.


Avoid rubbing the stitching on the seams of the ball too much, as you don't want to damage or fray them. Frayed seams will ruin the look and durability of the ball. Remember that melamine foam cleans through abrasion. While it shouldn't harm the leather of the main part of your ball, the thinner cotton stitching can be more prone to damage."

Make a solution of dilute bleach and dish detergent.,
Dampen a cotton swab with bleach.,
Wipe the damp cotton swab over the stain.,
Wipe the bleach off of your ball.,
Towel your baseball dry.",How to Clean a Dirty Baseball3," Fill up a glass about halfway with warm water and then add the same amount of a gentle dish detergent. Then drop in about a capful of ordinary household bleach and stir.You can substitute a number of leather-safe solvents for this solution. Some choices include hairspray, rubbing alcohol, and white vinegar.This method works best for removing autographs, scuff marks, and grass stains.

, Dip the tip of the cotton swab into your bleach solution and squeeze the excess off with a paper towel or old rag. You just want enough to lightly moisten the surface of the ball.You can also use an old tooth brush or any other type of scrubbing tool able to hold water., Rub the end of the cotton swab with bleach on it back and forth over the surface of the ball. Do this a few times until you see the stain lift away.


Be careful to avoid contact with the seams or any of the stamps. If the bleach touches the red stitches on the seams, it will discolor them. The solution will also remove any stamps you scrub over.

, Moisten a towel or a cotton ball with clean tap water. Either wipe down your entire ball or just go over the spot you bleached. Do this a few times. It's important to remove all residual cleaning solution., If you've significantly wetted your baseball, do not allow it to air dry. Air drying can cause leather to warp and crack. Instead, rub the baseball with a clean, dry towel."

Place the balls in the drum.,
Add the cleaning compound.,
Let the machine run for a length of time that matches the extent of your balls' grime.,
Retrieve your balls.",How to Clean a Dirty Baseball4," Lift the latch and pour the baseballs into the container. Baseball cleaning machines are able to scrub dozens of balls clean in just a few hours. If you need to clean many balls on a frequent basis, an expensive baseball cleaning machine might be a worthwhile investment


Choose baseballs that have roughly the same amount of dirt for each load. Cleaner balls will take less time than dirtier balls, so break the balls up into groups to get the best results.
Read your machine's owner manual to determine the maximum number of baseballs you can safely load. These machines do not typically require a minimum number.
This technique is best for cleaning well-used, very grimy baseballs., Commercial baseball cleaning machines use a dry rubber compound to clean the balls without using moisture. This helps to preserve the leather and won't waterlog the balls.This method is essentially a large-scale, extremely thorough, automated version of the pencil eraser method.

, Place the drum back on the machine. Turn the machine on and set its timer. The base will rotate the drum full of balls along with the cleaning compound. If your baseballs are still not scrubbed white at the end of the run, you can always start the machine up again.


Lightly-scuffed balls take roughly an hour to clean.
Moderate grime can be removed in two to three hours.
Baseballs caked in a serious amount of dirt may take as long as 12 hours to thoroughly clean. Feel free to leave these loads to run overnight., When the cycle is complete, remove the drum from the machine. Open the lid and remove the balls. They should be a shiny, bright white.


Leave the cleaning compound in the drum for the next load of balls. These rubber chips can be used until they've been entirely worn away, just like a pencil eraser.

Understand slugging percentage.,
Find the number of singles.,
Calculate the number of bases.,
Divide your answer by at bats.",How to Calculate Slugging Percentage1," Also called slugging average, SA, or SLG, this is a player's average number of bases per bat.If a player has an (unrealistic) slugging percentage of 1, their average result was a single.


This only measures number of bases from hits, not from walks or hit by pitch. Ignoring the bases out of the batter's control makes this a more accurate measure of offensive power.;
, Most player stats don't include singles, but it's easy to figure out from other stats. First, add Home Runs + Triples + Doubles to get all the hits that aren't singles. Then subtract your answer from the total number of Hits to get the number of Singles.


For example, Willie McCovey has career stats of 521 Home Runs, 46 Triples, and 353 Doubles, adding up to 920.Subtract 920 from his career Hits of 2211 to get the number of Singles: 1291.

, Add together (Singles) + (2 x Doubles) + (3 x Triples) + (4 x Home Runs) to get the total number of bases.


Willie McCovey scored a total number of bases equal to (1291) + (2 x 353) + (3 x 46) + (4 x 521) = 1291 + 706 + 138 + 2084 = 4219.

, Divide total bases by the number of at bats to get the slugging percentage.


Willie McCovey had 8197 At Bats, so his career slugging percentage is 4219 ÷ 8197 = 0.5147 (rounded to 0.515). On average, he scored a little more than one base for every two at bats.

Understand what WAR measures.,
Determine the WAR rating of non-pitchers against the league average in a variety of offensive, speed and fielding categories.,
Find the replacement player's rating.,
Calculate the player's WAR rating.,
Compile a pitcher's statistics in several categories and compare each to the league average.,
Find the pitcher's WAR rating.",How to Calculate Baseball WAR," WAR is a simple representation of a series of highly complex equations. The concept was conceived by baseball statistician Sean Smith. It purports to measure the value of a player to his team, expressed in wins. You can find a player's WAR rating by following a 3-step process:


Compile the player's single-season statistics in all pertinent categories for the season you're examining.
Determine the league average for each statistical category. You can only calculate WAR numbers after you've examined all players. A player's WAR is based on his figures compared to the league average, but is ultimately calculated against the projected statistics of a player who would replace him in his team's lineup. Replacement players usually have WAR ratings far below the league average.
Apply the player's statistics to those of the replacement player. After finding the difference in each category, take the sum of those figures and divide by 10. The quotient is the player's WAR rating.

, These include:


OPS+: Take the sum of the player's on-base percentage plus his slugging percentage, and compare the sum to the league average. The result yields a figure for batting runs above/below average.
Ballpark and era adjustments: You must complete further detailed analysis to incorporate the characteristics of ballparks and style of play during the season you are analyzing. Do this by examining players' statistics at individual parks and comparing the figures to the league averages. These adjustments are extrapolated onto the player's batting runs figure for a final total.
Speed: You can judge an individual player's speed against the league average by measuring several different categories. Stolen bases, caught stealing, ground ball double plays, and extra bases taken all factor into this figure. You will have to examine play-by-play records to determine a player's effectiveness in taking extra bases. Compare the player's statistics to the league average in the other categories. The results yield a figure above or below the league average that you add to the batting runs number.
Fielding: Measure the player's defensive capabilities against the league average for putouts, assists and errors at his primary position. This produces a range figure. For infielders, add the range figure to the player's double-play number to arrive at a defensive number. Add the defensive number to the batting runs and speed numbers.
Position adjustment: Some positions are more difficult to play than others. This is considered in WAR ratings. For example, shortstops get a +8 adjustment to their WAR. Right fielders are -8. For a complete list, search online for WAR position adjustments.

, To find the theoretical replacement player's rating, subtract 20 runs from the combined averages in the various categories.

, Compare the rating of the player and the replacement player. Divide the difference by 10 to find the WAR rating of the player.

, The key statistics for finding a pitcher's WAR rating are:


Earned Run Average: Compare the pitcher's ERA to the league average.
Defensive adjustment: Determine the defensive capabilities of the team that played behind the pitcher, compared to the rest of the league, and apply that figure to the pitcher's rating. This is done by comparing the fielding rating of each of the team's position players to the league average and applying that sum to the rating.
Fielding Independent Pitching: F.I.P. is a tally of the 3 categories pitchers control entirely: strikeouts, walks and home runs. F.I.P., combined with average innings per start, yields a figure that represents the number of runs a pitcher must save to qualify for a win. Find the pitcher's F.I.P. and compare it to the league average.
Pitcher's winning percentage above replacement: To find the pitcher's winning percentage, calculate the average number of innings per start. This number expresses how many runs the pitcher must save to qualify for a win. Subtract the league-average F.I.P. from the pitcher's F.I.P. and divide that result by the runs-saved number. This result will be expressed as a percentage. Add .500 to this figure to get the pitcher's winning percentage.
Use a .380 winning percentage as the benchmark for comparison. Subtract the pitcher's winning percentage from this figure to get the result.;
, Take the pitcher's adjusted winning percentage above replacement and multiply it by the number of innings pitched. Divide that product by 9 to render a number that expresses how many wins the pitcher is worth.

Find the total bases with a faster method.,
Divide by at bats.",How to Calculate Slugging Percentage2," The method above is the easiest to understand, but requires extra math to find the number of singles. Here's a way to skip that step and find the total bases using Hits instead: Total Bases = Hits + Doubles + (2 x Triples) + (3 x Home Runs).


This works because one base per Hit takes care of all the singles. Since this also awards one base for each double, you only need to add 1 more base per double to find the total. Similarly, add two extra bases for triples, and three extra for home runs.

, Just as before, the slugging percentage is equal to the total bases divided by at bats.

"
"
Add Slugging Percentage to On Base Percentage.,
Adjust slugging percentage for league.",How to Calculate Slugging Percentage3," The result, On Base Plus Slugging (OPS), takes into account the most important offensive stats. Baseball statisticians don't consider this accurate, but it's a quick and easy way to compare offensive power.OPS+ is a less commonly used statistic that adjusts for the league and park. The formula for OPS+ changes each year to make 100 the league average.

, This statistic was invented for the baseball encyclopedia Total Baseball, and is rarely used elsewhere. It's a more accurate way to compare players from different years, but it might be hard to dig up the statistics you need to calculate it:Adjusted production (APRO) = (On Base Percentage / League OBP) + (Slugging Average / League SA) - 1
The League stats are the average stats for all players that year.
The stats are sometimes adjusted to factor in differences between parks as well.

Get the right glove.,
Position your body.,
Watch the ball.,
Go to the ball.,
Position your glove.,
Catch the baseball.,
Keep your vision clear.",How to Catch a Baseball1," Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove.


Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch.;
, Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect:








Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused.
Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you.
Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed.

, The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball.









”You can’t catch what you can’t see,”meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball.

, Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it.







, Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment.


If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down.
When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards.

, Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch.









Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball.

, Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second.


Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day.
You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.

Find the player's hits.,
Find the player's at-bats.,
Divide the number of hits by the number of at-bats.,
Round to the third decimal place.,
Find the on-base percentage.,
Understand runs batted in.,
Find slugging percentage.",How to Calculate a Batting Average," Hits (also called base hits) are simply the sum of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.This statistic is easy to find online for professional players.

You can use the statistics for a season, a whole career, or any other period of time you're interested in. Just make sure all your statistics come from the same time frame.
;
, This is the number of times the player has made an attempt at an hit. This does not include walks, hits by pitch, or sacrifices, since these do not reflect the batter's offensive skill., The answer tells you the battering average, or the fraction of the time that a batter turned an at-bat attempt into a successful hit.

For example, if a player had 70 Hits and 200 At-Bats, his Batting Average is 70 ÷ 200 = 0.350.

You can read a batting average of 0.350 as ""this player would expect to get 350 hits in 1000 at-bats.""


, Batting averages are almost always rounded this way. When a baseball fan mentions a batting average of ""three hundred,"" she means 0.300.

You can calculate batting averages to four or more decimal places, but this doesn't have much use beyond breaking ties.


, A player's OBP tells you the fraction of the time that player makes it to a base, including walks and hits by pitch. Some fans consider this a better metric than battering average, since it takes into account all scoring methods. To find OBP, calculate Hits+Walks+HitsByPitchPlateAppearances{\displaystyle {\frac {Hits+Walks+HitsByPitch}{PlateAppearances}}}.This formula is good enough for most purposes, but it does count some uncommon plays that do not reflect on the batter's skill, such as sacrifice bunts and catcher's interferences. If you need to be precise, replace plate appearances with ""at-bats + walks + hits by pitch + sacrifice flies.""


, Runs batted in, or RBI, tell you how many times the team passed home plate due to this batter. For example, if there are two teammates on base and Sarah scores a home run, Sarah gets 3 RBI (two teammates + herself). This gives you a straightforward account of exactly how many runs a batter has scored. However, since it depends on other batters loading the bases, this statistic isn't a great way to compare players from different teams.

Do not add to RBI if the at-bat led to a double play (two outs), or if a run only occurred due to an error., Slugging percentage is similar to a batting average, but counts the number of bases scored instead of just the number of hits. This rewards more powerful hitters who score more doubles, triples, and home runs. Slugging percentage equals Hits+Doubles+(2∗Triples)+(3∗HomeRuns)AtBats{\displaystyle {\frac {Hits+Doubles+(2*Triples)+(3*HomeRuns)}{AtBats}}}.You will get the same result if you count the bases in a more intuitive way: Singles + (2*Doubles) + (3*Triples) + (4*Home Runs). The formula above is usually easier to use since most baseball statistic websites do not list Singles.

Catch ground balls.,
Dive for the ball.,
Recover a botched catch.,
Improve your footwork.",How to Catch a Baseball2," Ground balls are those that aren’t caught, but instead hit the ground. If you are out of range to catch the ball, get into the habit of approaching the ball to position yourself to secure a grounded ball. Once you are facing a ball’s path of direction, take a modified athletic stance. Bend your knees so that you are close to the ground, position your glove with your fingers facing the ground, and have your free hand hovered above your glove to secure the ball.









Avoid catching the ball on a short hop. The short hop is when the ball first hits the ground and bounces in an unpredictable way. Avoid rushing the ball to avoid catching the ball on a short hop.Stay on the balls of your feet to quickly reposition yourself to catch the ball.

, The key to a successful dive that won’t cause injury is all about your approach. Keep your eye on the ball the entire time. Begin by running towards the ball while lowering your body by bending your knees with each step. On your last two steps extend your arms outwards to align your glove with the ball’s flight path. Take a leap off the ground with your glove side's foot to become airborne.


Rotate your glove hand so that the palm of the glove is facing upwards.Have your free hand out to support the catch.
Don’t dive out if you are in range to normally catch the ball. It’ll take experience and practice to properly judge the distance of the ball.

, Every catcher messes up in the field and there are certain things you can do to recover from an error. First, you need to locate the ball and do so quickly. To avoid “losing” the ball, keep your eye on the ball at all times. The key is to pick up the ball and throw it to the proper fieldsman.


Bend your knees as you pick up the ball and be prepared to turn and throw.
A key to recovering from your mistake is to not let it get you down. You need to think fast in the field with no time to spare to reflect during a play., Footwork means the way use your feet to approach a ball. This skill is important for improving your game. Practice “square up” position, which means sprinting to a ball in order to catch the ball straight on. Other footwork techniques you can practice to catch a ball are:









Side shuffling means to move sideways towards the ball while facing forward. Alternate pushing off with each foot as you move and avoid crossing your feet.
Charging means a direct sprint towards the ball. This usually ends in skidding to catch the ball.
Crossover and sprint is a good approach to reach a ball to your sides. Cross one foot in front of the other and take off in a sprint."

Go for it.Once you see that ball come into your side of the stadium, give it everything you got.",How to Catch a Baseball3," You can increase your chances of catching a baseball at a game by knowing about each batter. Right handed batters, for example, hit foul balls off to the right of the home base. Left handed batters hit fouls left of the home base.Create a cheat sheet of all the players and their dominant hands.

, Once you have a ticket, you can usually get around to most parts of the bleachers. You don’t need to worry about staying in your assigned seat. There are plenty of standing areas around the bleachers and near the bases.

, Like the professional athletes, you increase your chances of catching a baseball with a glove. It’s better to use an older glove that you've already broken in from playing catch.Try getting to the stadium early to catch the easy balls. Before a lot of games, players will hit home runs and throw balls to the audience.

, Have a plan for when to be in the foul zone for each player. If you don’t want to move for each player, pick a side to the right or left. To catch a ball at a baseball game, you need to constantly be on your feet and focused on the ball.


Think of yourself as the outer-outfield-man.

, Move quickly to align yourself with ball’s flight path. Once the ball gets close enough, go for it by any means necessary. Be prepared to lunge for the ball just as the defense would do.


Catching the ball in this manner could irritate other audience members or seriously injure someone.
If you lunge for it, be prepared to pay the price of sacrificing someone’s hot dog or an elbow in your eye.

Scrub your glove.,
Remove the laces from the glove.,
Apply a leather-cleaning agent to the glove.",How to Clean a Baseball Glove1," Using a stiff-bristled hand brush or a cloth, scrub or wipe away visible dirt and debris from your baseball glove. Check the palm of the glove as well as the top side.Do this after each time you use your glove.;
, Removing the laces will allow you better access to the grit and debris that might be caught between the fingers of the glove, or beneath the area concealed by the laces. However, due to the way gloves are laced, it might not be possible to untie your glove’s laces.If you cannot unlace your glove’s laces, you can skip this step, or use a sharp implement to cut them.
If you choose to cut your glove’s laces, you won’t be able to use them again, and will have to obtain new laces or take your glove to a sporting goods store to have it re-laced.
If you’re re-lacing your glove after removing the laces, aim to reproduce the same level of lace tension the glove had before you removed its laces.

, Every leather-cleaning agent is slightly different. Generally, however, you’ll simply dab a clean cloth with a bit of the leather cleaning agent, then rub it onto the glove in a gentle motion. You could apply it with small circular motions, or back-and-forth wipes. Consult manufacturer directions for more detailed information regarding use.After applying the leather-cleaning agent, you must typically wait for a few hours or up to 24 hours. Check manufacturer directions regarding the length of time you must wait before using or conditioning the glove.
Take care not to overuse your leather-cleaning agent. Overuse could cause the agent to build up on the glove and clogs its pores.Check the label on your leather-cleaning agent for information regarding the frequency with which you should apply it.

Wear your baseball cap every day.,
Work out in your new baseball cap.,
Play sports in your new baseball cap.,
Distress your hat's fabric.",How to Break in a Baseball Cap1," The best way to break in a new hat is to wear it as often as possible. Whether you're running errands, cleaning the house, hanging out with friends, or even at work (if your boss will allow it), keep your new baseball cap on your head at all times. This will allow your hat to form to the shape of your head and experience some casual wear and tear., Working out in your baseball cap may seem like a strange idea, but it's a great way to break in a new hat! Keep on your new cap when you hit the gym, and try to get as sweaty as possible. Applying heat and moisture to a new hat is the easiest and fastest way to break it in, which is why sweating in your hat is perfect. Keep the hat on after you've finished your workout to allow it to morph to the shape of your head.

, Wear your new cap while playing sports on your league or with a group of friends. This will cause you to sweat in your hat, but will also put the hat through some physical wear and tear (especially if you're playing sports like tackle football). It's called a baseball cap for a reason, so put it to good use!

, Distressing the fabric and fading the color of your new cap can help to make it look more worn. Wearing the cap every day will help to naturally wear down the hat, but there are other things you can do to speed up the process.


Get your hat dirty. You can step on your hat, leave it laying on the ground, and wear it in the sun. All of these things are great ways to speed up the wear and tear on your hat.

Contact your local league.,
Collect information on all players.,
Contact all the parents.,
Get to know your league’s handbook.",How to Coach Little League1," The first step in becoming a Little League coach is to volunteer for the job. There will probably be a formal application process and an interview, though each local league is different. The league’s manager and other officers will consider you for the position if one is available.If you have substantial knowledge of baseball rules and strategies, or prior coaching experience, you are more likely to be considered for the position.;
, Before the season starts, or early in the season, you should receive a contact sheet from the league with information about all the kids on your team. In some cases, you might need to provide parents with this sheet yourself. This sheet should have each player’s full name, address, their parents’ phone numbers and addresses (if the parents live apart from their child).This sheet (or a secondary sheet) should also include detailed medical information, such as allergies, blood type, and any other relevant medical information.
Some leagues might require you to collect additional information. Consult your league handbook to ensure you have all the necessary information on your players.

, As soon as you have phone numbers for all the players on your team, call their parents and introduce yourself. Explain to the parents what the league’s general rules are and what your expectations for the team are.During this call, you might also want to speak to the player briefly about how you’re looking forward to seeing them on the field. There’s no need for an extended conversation, however, since you’ll have lots of time with the players during games and practice.

, Every little league is a bit different. Obtain your league’s handbook and read it several times so you can familiarize yourself with the league’s rules, policies, and regulations.Keep this rulebook handbook close during games and practice so you can reference it if necessary.

Know the key differences in baseball bats.,
Identify any guidelines that must be used in order to purchase the baseball bat.,
Consider the age and height of those who will make use of the bat.,
Investigate the quality of the baseball bats that meet your needs.,
Test the bats that seem to be the best fit.",How to Buy a Baseball Bat," Bats are available in both wood and metal versions, with the metal bats often made of titanium or aluminum. The grips on the bats may also be different, as well as the length. Typically, longer bats are appropriate for players who are a little taller, while shorter bats are easier for children or teenagers to manage effectively.;
, Should the bat be for use by an amateur or professional baseball club, there are usually specific standards set by baseball leagues that help to determine the length and type of bats that can be used during a game. Obtain copies of those standards, and use them to focus attention on bats that are in compliance with those standards and regulations.

, Most sporting goods stores and other outlets that sell baseball bats have access to a chart that takes into consideration factors such as age, gender and height to determine the ideal length and size of bat. Unless you are familiar with how to properly match the size of a bat with a player, making use of those charts is a good idea.

, Like many other types of goods, quality will vary from one baseball bat manufacturer to another. Spend some time checking consumer reports and comments found at online forums regarding different makes and models. This will help you get a better idea if the bats made by certain companies are likely to hold up well or are not worth the asking price.

, Many stores have floor models that can be tested for swinging, gripping and other basics involved in batting. Trying the floor model before settling on a specific brand and size will make it easier to choose the right one the first time.

Moisturize the glove with a glove conditioner.,
Wait for the conditioner to be absorbed.,
Do not overuse glove conditioner.",How to Clean a Baseball Glove2," Glove conditioner is a product that both cleans and softens baseball glove leather. General directions for use involve dabbing a clean cloth into the glove conditioner, then wiping it lightly over the glove’s surface using a circular motion. Consult manufacturer directions for more specific information regarding use.Apply glove conditioner between the webbing of the glove’s fingers and to the inside of the glove, too.
Once applied, your glove will appear restored, and flex more easily during use.

, After applying the glove conditioner, you must typically wait for 24 hours. Check manufacturer directions regarding the length of time you must wait before your glove can again be used., Overuse could actually attract dirt and debris to the glove. It is typically not necessary to use more than a few dabs of conditioner.Additionally, don’t use conditioner too frequently. Using conditioner more than twice per season is typically excessive."
"
Wipe your glove with soap and water.,
Keep your glove cool.,
Store your glove in a dry place.,
Maintain the glove’s shape.",How to Clean a Baseball Glove3," Before storing your glove, at either the beginning or the end of the baseball season, give your glove a gentle scrubbing with water and soap. Dab a clean cloth into a mixture of warm water and mild hand soap. Wring the cloth out as much as possible to avoid causing the glove to absorb too much water. Dry the glove with a dry cloth after wiping it down, then allow it to air dry.Do not use dishwashing liquid or detergent to wipe your glove.

, When you aren’t using your glove, store it somewhere with a stable temperature. Avoid leaving your glove near a heater or in a hot area (for instance, next to a window that receive direct sunlight). This will cause your glove to dry out, and become stiff and unusable., If your glove gets too wet, it will become stiff and less pliant when it dries. Keep your glove somewhere with low humidity and adequate air flow.If your baseball glove gets wet – even as a result of rain during a game – wipe it off as soon as possible. Allow it to dry naturally.
Don’t dry your glove with a blow dryer, or place it near a heater. This could cause it to crack.If, after your glove dries, it feels too stiff, apply glove conditioner to soften it.

, When you store your glove, don’t pile heavy baseball bats or other sports equipment on it. Place a baseball in the webbing and wrap the glove tightly with an elastic cord or other binder. Tighten or re-tie the laces using square and overhand knots.Place the glove with the palm up or facing to the side. Proper storage will help the glove keep its shape."
"
Purchase baseball glove conditioning oil.,
Use a baseball glove or a softball glove.,
Put a ball in the glove.,
Wrap several large rubber bands around the glove with the ball inside.,
Leave the band-wrapped glove out in direct sunlight for a few hours (no more).,
Take the glove out of the sun, remove the bands, and take the ball out.,
Close the glove around the ball and wrap it with the bands again.,
Retrieve the glove.",How to Break in a New Baseball Glove1," Most manufacturers offer oils specifically formulated to treat their gloves. Applying a small amount of conditioning oil will soften, enrich, and preserve the leather in the pocket of your glove.


You can use some shaving cream with lanolin in it as a cheap alternative to conditioning oil.Do not use too much oil or cream on your glove. Applying too much can cause the leather to deteriorate. Use just enough to apply a light coating all over the pocket. ;
, They're not the same thing. Softball gloves have slightly larger pockets to fit the slightly larger ball.

, Put it in the ""sweet spot."" The sweet spot is where you would ideally catch the ball, in the lower part of the webbing between the thumb and forefinger.

, The bands should be tight so that the ball rests snugly in the pocket of the glove and not be able to move around. This is to shape the pocket to fit the ball.


Don't use string for this. Tightly wound string or twine can leave an odd-looking imprint around the outside of the glove.

, The sunlight will make the leather warm and flexible. Do not leave the glove on a hot surface. You don't want to cook it.

, Shape the glove by punching your fist into the pocket and opening and closing the glove. Throw the ball hard many times into the center of the glove's pocket, and close the glove over the ball as soon as it hits the webbing. The more you do this, the better the ball will fit and the more you'll develop a feel for catching and retaining the ball.

, Store it for a day or two in a dark, dry spot. Choose an out-of-the-way place away from pets and small children (who might disturb the process).

, Remove the bands and ball. Your glove should be ready for action. The more you use it, the more the glove will conform to your hand.

"
"
Soak your hat in hot water.,
Take showers in your baseball cap.,
Wash your baseball cap in a washing machine.",How to Break in a Baseball Cap2," If you want to break in the entire hat, then soak the entire hat in a bowl of hot water. If you want to keep the bill of the hat firm, only soak the crown of the hat in the bowl. Soak the cap for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then remove it from the water. Lay it out on a towel to dry until it goes from soaking wet to damp. When the hat is damp, place it on your head, and allow it to finish drying while conforming to your head.There is a possibility that soaking your hat in hot water can cause its color to slightly fade. This will help your hat to look more worn. If you don't want the color to fade, soak your hat in cold water instead. If you soak your hat in cold water, soak it for 2-3 hours.

, This may seem like the most unconventional method yet, but showering in your new cap is a great way to break it in. Water alone is a great way to break in a hat, but keeping the hat shaped to your head while you wet it takes this one step further. Once you've finished showering, keep the hat on your head and allow it to air-dry.Be sure to take off your hat at some point during the shower to wash your hair, then put the hat back on for the remainder of your shower.

, Use warm water and liquid laundry detergent to wash your hat. It's easiest to wash your hat on laundry day and simply throw it in the washer with your load of clothes. You can wash the hat over and over again, with multiple loads, but do not put the hat in the dryer. Putting your hat in the dryer could cause it to shrink. Instead, let the hat air-dry or wear it on your head until it is finished drying.


If you have a wool or cotton cap, you can shrink it in the dryer to fit your head. You'll need to get a hat that is slightly too big or you, and then put in in the dryer to shrink it after washing it. If the hat shrinks too much, wash it again, and let it air dry on your head to stretch it out to the perfect size.

Stick the bill of your baseball cap in a coffee mug overnight.,
Wrap the bill of your baseball cap around a can or glass overnight.,
Curve the bill of your hat into the back opening of your hat.",How to Break in a Baseball Cap3," This is a great way to give your bill a permanent curve, as it is very effective and easy to do. Curve the bill inward so that the ends are touching, and slide it into a coffee mug. The curved bill should fit into the coffee mug with no problem. Allow the cap to sit in the mug overnight, and it will be perfectly curved when you remove it in the morning., You'll need a can (soda can, beer can, soup can, etc.) and a rubber band to secure it in place. Leave your hat wrapped like this overnight, and you'll have a nice, subtle curve in the bill of your baseball cap.


You can also use a baseball instead of a can or glass. This will be a bit harder to hold in place with a rubber band, but is doable and will get you similar results.

, Turn your hat upside down so that the inside is facing upwards. Curve the bill so that the ends of it are touching. Then, fold the bill towards the back opening of the hat, and slide the curved bill into the hat's opening. The opening will hold the bill in place. Leave the hat in this position overnight. This method will give you a less intense curve in the bill of your baseball cap."

Keep your directions simple.,
Offer players appropriate encouragement.,
Offer constructive criticism.,
Speak with parents regularly.,
Discipline your players fairly.",How to Coach Little League2," Some little league coaches offer complicated and confusing directions. However, at its core, baseball is about catching, hitting, and throwing the ball. Keep your directions and guidance simple by employing that terminology.For instance, instead of saying, “I want to see a double when they get bases loaded,” you might say, “I want you to hit the ball, run to first base, and then run to second base.""
Using clear and straightforward directions, you can gradually teach more complex plays as your players master the simpler ones.

, All your players are different. Get to know each player on your team as an individual. This will allow you to identify when and how you should push your players to improve their performance.Some players, for instance, might respond best to an aggressive delivery such as, “Come on, step it up!”
Other players might respond best to a more gentle and comforting suggestion like, “You’re doing great, but I want you to work a little harder out there.”

, Nothing is worse for the kids than a coach who yells after every error. If you see a player doing something wrong consistently, pull them aside and explain what they are doing wrong. If necessary, work with them to adjust their technique., Let all the parents know when the games are, when they need to bring snacks to practice, when they need to pay equipment fees, and any other information that they might need to know. Use a variety of methods to keep parents in the loop.If you have specific concerns for a single parent, it’s best to call or meet them face-to-face.
If you have general information you want to share with all the parents, you can email them or send a handbill home with the kids on your team. For quick messages (“See you at tonight’s game at Barton Field!”) you could send a text message.
Don’t expect your players to communicate information directly to their parents.

, Disciplinary issues are likely addressed in your league handbook. Consult this guidebook in the event you need to discipline your players. Hold all your players to the same disciplinary standard and, when necessary, apply disciplinary actions equally. In most cases, a verbal warning is enough to correct a player's foul attitude or misbehavior.Let your players know at the outset of the season that they should demonstrate a positive attitude. Inform them of the consequences of poor discipline.
During practice, warn any troublemakers that they will be running laps or performing pushups if they continue to cause problems.
During games, warn any troublemakers that they will be removed from play if they continue to cause problems.

Coach with confidence.,
Provide an example to your players.,
Teach good sportsmanship.,
Treat your players fairly.",How to Coach Little League3," If you demonstrate confidence in your skills and abilities, your team will feel confident, too. The best way to coach little league with confidence is to gain experience coaching little league or another sport.If you don’t have coaching experience, you can build confidence by reflecting on your prior successes in business, academia, or another field in which you excel.
Carefully study your team’s ability level and identify how you can improve it. Keep an eye on each player's batting technique, pitching ability, and hand-eye coordination.
Use your knowledge of each player to maximize the team's strength. For instance, do not put your player with the strongest arm as an outfielder. Play them as a pitcher instead.

, Do not scream and shout at umpires or disrespect the opposing team, even if the game has already ended. This will only encourage the kids in your league to do likewise., As coach, your players will be looking to you to demonstrate good sportsmanship. Take the lead in shaking hands with the opposing coach when the game is concluded and insist that your players line up to shake hands with their opponents after the game – no matter the outcome.Remind your team that winning isn't everything. Whether your team wins or loses, the most important thing should be to have fun.

, Some little league coaches give weaker players less time on the field or less attention than the more skilled players. However, in the interests of fairness, you should give everyone on your team equal attention and allow everyone to play.Some leagues might have rules regarding how long or how often each player can be on the field. Consult your league’s guidebook for more information.
Do not bench players just because they are not playing well.

"
"
Practice regularly.,
Plan your practices ahead of time.,
Vary your practice activities.,
Run scrimmages.",How to Coach Little League4," As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect. Schedule practice at a regular time at least twice each week. Practice provides your team with the opportunity to not only practice their skills but to bond and build trust with each other.Practice should not last more than two hours.
With regular practice, you will be able to see your team improve immensely.

, By planning out exactly what you want your team to work on during practice sessions, you won’t have to think up something for them to work on when they show up. Doing so could make your team and their parents think you’re disorganized and lacking in capability.Select only a few skills to work on in each practice session. Focus primarily on fundamentals like hitting, catching, base running, and throwing.
Reserve some time for advanced skills like run downs, situational defense, and so on.
Spend the last 30 minutes doing something that your team wants to work on like errors, run, and hits.

, If you focus on any one activity for more than 20-30 minutes, you will lose the attention of many kids. You can forestall this somewhat by encouraging your players to focus by saying things like, “Keep your head in the game!” but over too long a period, even the most attentive player will tire of the same exercise. Move your practice sessions along to prevent the players from getting bored., Scrimmages are short practice games. Depending how many players you have on your team, you should be able to divide your team into two roughly equal squads (six on six, for instance). Designate one team the “at-bat” team and the other the “on-field” team. After the on-field team scores three outs, let the players switch sides. This will allow your team to practice under more game-like conditions."
"
Enlist an assistant coach.,
Maintain proper safety.,
Ensure your team has the right equipment.",How to Coach Little League5," Additional or assistant coaches are crucial to coaching little league successfully. Another coach will be able to bring a second set of eyes to your team, identify strengths and weaknesses that you might not, and prevent the kids from getting into trouble. Your league might assign a second or third coach to your team, or you might wish to request one from the league manager.With the help of assistant coaches, you can run several practice sessions at once. For instance, while you work on outfield drills, you might have another coach working on pitching and catching, and another coach working on infield drills.

, Meet with your league’s safety officer. The safety officer will recommend what sort of equipment you’re required to have on hand. You should always have a first aid kit equipped with ice packs, band-aids, and so on. You should also have your payers’ medical information sheets available in case they become necessary.Before each game or practice, walk the field, looking for safety liabilities. For instance, if you see broken bottles, glass, or sharp objects on the field, remove them to prevent injury.
Do not allow games to continue in excessively inclement weather.

, At the start of each season, consult with your league’s equipment manager. Your players will probably bring their own gloves and bats. They might also provide their own shin guards, mouth guards, and other safety equipment. The league will probably provide batting helmets and baseballs.Additionally, consult with parents directly or via email to help them choose the right sort of cleats for their children, if necessary.

Apply a conditioning oil to the glove.,
Place the glove on a rack above a pot of water and turn the burner on.,
Remove the glove from the steam.,
Work the glove into shape with a mallet.,
Hit the glove in the desired spot to form a pocket.,
Flip the glove over and hit the heel of the glove near the pinky side.",How to Break in a New Baseball Glove2," Coat or spray the entire surface of the glove. You may want to apply a little extra to the laces to make sure they are adequately protected. Let the glove sit for several minutes and soak up the conditioner. Then wipe the glove with a towel until dry.

, Be sure to keep your glove several inches above the water to avoid splashing. Place a curved lid or a large upside-down bowl over the glove to trap the steam. Let the glove sit in the steam for two-to-five minutes, depending on how soft you want the leather. You want the temperature of the glove to reach about 150° F.Many sporting-goods stores offer professional glove-steaming services. Some will even steam a new glove for free when you buy it from them.

, Turn the stove off and wait until the steam dissipates to retrieve your glove. Dry the glove with a towel. The glove should feel much more flexible now.

, Fold the glove in half so the thumb is on top and hit the heel close to the thumb side with a mallet to bend the material. Work your way toward the center of the glove.

, Depending on your preference, you might want a deep or shallow pocket.


Hit the glove near the webbing for a deeper pocket or more toward the palm of the glove for a shallow pocket.

, Your glove should be much easier to open and close now. Play some catch to help finish the process of breaking it in.

"
"
Put the glove in the microwave.,
Set the time for less than 60 seconds.,
Play some catch while the material is still flexible.",How to Break in a New Baseball Glove3," The heat will soften it up and accelerate the break-in process.


Use this method in moderation and at your own risk. Most glove manufacturers say that you should never put a glove in an oven or microwave. Excessive heat will dry out a glove too much (or even destroy it by making it hard). Too much heat may turn the glove more flexible at first but ultimately render it too hard to use.

, Anything longer than that is going to cook your glove. You can tell the glove is ready when it smells like a steak cooking.

, Throw the ball into the glove as hard as possible to help form the pocket to your liking. Your glove should start feeling softer and be much easier to play with.

Buy a baseball-glove foam treatment from a sporting-goods store.,
Apply the foam and lather it into the glove.,
Place the glove in a 300ºF oven for four minutes.,
Carefully remove the glove from the oven.,
Work the glove repeatedly every which way for ten minutes or more.",How to Break in a New Baseball Glove4," This method is equivalent to breaking in a new glove for six months.

, Cover the entire surface of the glove. Coat the back of the glove as well. Let the material soak up the lather for several minutes.

, Put the foamed glove on a cloth-covered baking sheet. Set it on the top rack of the oven. Set a kitchen timer to make sure you don't leave the glove in too long or forget to take it out.

, Allow it to cool. Wipe away any residue from the treatment.

, Insert a baseball or softball into the glove's sweet spot where you are most likely to catch the ball. Allow the glove to cool around the ball.



Note: Most glove manufacturers recommend against using chemicals or heat to break in gloves. In other words, take the above steps in moderation. Too much heat or chemical treatment can ruin the flexibility and comfort inherent in leather.

Hold the ball like a fast bowler.,
Position your bowling arm vertically and close to your head.,
Step forward with your non-dominant foot.,
Rotate your torso.,
Raise your non-bowling arm.,
Position your legs.,
Deliver the ball.",How to Bowl the Doosra1," Position your index and middle fingers on either side of the seam. For better ball control, your index finger should just about touch the seam. Your thumb may rest on the ball, but this usually doesn't affect delivery. Use your remaining two fingers to hold the ball in place., Place your wrist at its highest point with your palm facing left (roughly towards the cover position). Keep your arm bent at 15 degrees or less. Anything more than 15 degrees is considered illegal in cricket., Plant the sole of your foot flat on the ground. Position the leg on your bowling side behind you with your toe pointed. Make sure your feet remain aligned during this step., Pivot your waist at a perpendicular angle from the batter. Position your torso toward the side of your bowling hand. For example, if you're bowling with your right hand, your torso should face right., This will help to keep your body balanced. Rotate your shoulder so that your arm is above your head. Bend the elbow of this arm. Position the forearm and hand of this arm toward your bowling hand., Raise the thigh on your non-bowling side, with your shin and foot helping to form a 135-degree angle. Position your knee slightly toward your bowling hand. Keep the foot on your bowling side planted flat on the ground., Keep the back of your hand facing square leg. Move your index finger downwards over the ball. Right before you release the ball, bend your elbow. Just before release, bend your wrist inward. As you deliver the ball, spin it as you would in an off-break."

Watch baseball with a scouts eye.,
Play baseball.,
Take a course on scouting.,
Understand what it's like to be a scout.,
Know the differences between scouting different leagues.,
Find an internship with a team.,
Learn about the job from a baseball scout.,
Look for associate scout openings.,
Work on your player evaluation skills.,
Improve your reporting skills.,
Promote to an area scout.,
Progress in your career as a baseball scout.",How to Become a Baseball Scout," First, refresh your knowledge on the game of baseball if necessary. You need to have a strong understanding of the strategies and mechanics of the game. It is valuable for an associate scout to know as much as possible about playing the game of baseball so he can relate to prospects.Baseball is in some ways a very technical sport, which means that baseball scouts need to have a keen eye and meticulous attention to detail. When you watch a game, practice the kind of behavior scouts do by paying attention to things like batting averages, running speeds, and pitching techniques.
If you find it helpful, read up, both with books and online, on the strategies and mechanics of baseball, as well as the statistics and attributes that go into determining what separates a good player from a great player.;
, Although there are plenty of scouts who have little experience actually playing the game, it can certainly help. Playing baseball gives you the kind of first hand experience with how the game is played and what makes a good player that you can't get from just watching. Any experience with the game from the player's perspective is going to give you a leg up when it comes to analyzing them from the other side.You don't need years of semi-professional experience or a college baseball career. Look for a recreational baseball group in your city, or put one together yourself.

, There exist courses that anyone can take that teach the foundations of how to be a scout. They are training programs designed specifically for a aspiring scouts. Search online to find scout courses near you.MLB has its own official scout school, but be aware that they only hold programs in a few states, and positions are limited.

, Scouting baseball isn't a particularly glamorous job. It involves constant traveling, long periods away from home, waking up early, and an exhausting amount of work. Scouts have a lot of information in their heads when they're out on the job, everything from the names of coaches and players in their area to batting averages and pitching speeds. As a scout, you'll see endless hotel rooms, high school and college games, plane flights and rental cars. Your tools are nothing more than a radar gun, a notepad, and a wealth of knowledge about the minute details of what makes a baseball player great., The most significant difference between scouting high school players and scouting college players is that with high school players, a scout needs to be able to project their skills farther into the future. College players will have already enhanced their speed, strength, and skill, thanks to both more experience and better, more specialized coaches. That being said, high school scouting is the more important of the two, because the players you'll be watching in college will be the ones you identified as worth watching in high school., Many high up executives in the MLB were once scouts, and many started out as unpaid interns before that. Unpaid internships usually require little to no experience, which makes them an ideal first step into an organization like the MLB.You can search for internships online, or by simply going into the offices of nearby teams and asking if they're looking to fill any positions.

, Find a baseball scout at local baseball games. They usually hold a radar gun, which is used to measure how fast a baseball is thrown, and carry items like clipboards or binders with the logo of their professional baseball team employer on them. Approach them and discuss your aspirations.


Get into the habit of going to local games in leagues that scouts will be looking at, like amateur leagues, semi-professional leagues, and college baseball.
Avoid coming on to strong. When you try to make a connection with a baseball scout, be aware that everyone is different, and some people are not going to open to helping out an aspiring scout. You'll need to be outgoing and friendly, and know when to cut your loses.

, As associate scout is an unpaid position that reports to a baseball scout. The associate scout is responsible for providing the scout with information on a regular basis regarding baseball players in a designated geographic area. Associate scouts typically work in the areas in which they live.MLB its own career opportunities search engine on their official website. Check this regularly to see if any associate scout positions near you pop up.
Another option is to get to know scouts in your area, either by going to games and striking up conversations with them, or by making connections and networking from your internship with an organization. If you make your desire to become an associate scout clear, and you're a hard worker, you'll be noticed eventually.

, As an associate scout, you will need to recognize players who have the skills required for professional baseball. Pay attention to advice from your supervising scout and read books on player evaluation. Your player evaluation skills are going to improve mostly through pure practice. By seeing batter after batter, pitcher after pitcher, and catcher after catcher, you'll slowly get better at noticing minute differences between their techniques, skills, and results.A scout has to know not just how to evaluate a player's current skills, but more importantly, how to see potential in player and project where their skills will end up. To do so, scouts judge position players in five basic areas, known as the five tools. A player who is great in all five tools is considered a five-tool player, and is a scout's dream.Those tools are:

Hitting average, which refers to how consistently a player can hit the ball and hit it accurately.
Hitting power, which refers to how high and far a player can hit the ball.
Fielding, which refers to a player's effectiveness on the field, his agility, footwork, and quick reaction time.
Arm strength, which refers to a player's strength when throwing a ball.
Speed, which refers to a player's running speed.


When scouting pitchers, scouts always sit behind the home plate, so they can get a good view of the plate from the batter and pitcher's perspective. They look for velocity first and command of the ball second, because usually, command can be improved through training much further than velocity can.

, Associate scouts need to report how players are progressing and describe the skills of new prospects in a timely fashion. You'll need to know the rating system for players inside and out. Scouts give two numbers for each category in their reports, one for their current rating, and one for their prospective future rating. Some of the categories scouts report on include hitting power, pitching velocity, fielding ability, and running speed.Scouts use a 20-80 scale to rate players on the five tools. Fifty and above is major league status. Scouts generally look for players who are above major league status in at least two of the five tools.For pitchers, scouts rate the player's velocity with each of their pitches, with their fastball being the most important. That's because fastball skill is much more innate, whereas one can improve one's skill with a curveball or changeup. In addition, scout's measure a player's command of the ball, and their control. Command is their ability to put the ball where the catcher wants it. Control is their ability to consistently hit the strike zone.

, Show your supervising scout and the organization he works for that you've got what it takes to be a professional scout. Being good at making decisions, talking to people, digging up information, and being organized and aggressive could open up a paid position as an area scout.Understand that it could take a number of years to be promoted to an area scout because the positions open sporadically. In this position, you are responsible for reviewing all amateur baseball players in a geographical region, such as Oklahoma and Kansas or Northern Florida and Georgia.

, Once you officially become a scout, there is room for advancement. If you continue to refine your ability to pick bright, young baseball stars, your next promotion could be to area supervisor and eventually national cross-checker. Keys to success include your ability as a scout, your passion for the job, how well you make connections within the industry, and your ambition for advancement."

Take into account performance.,
Understand your betting options.,
Diversify your bets.,
Seek out dimeline odds.,
Seek out betting exchanges for moneyline bets.",How to Bet on Baseball1," There are many playing factors that you must consider when placing a bet including:


Performance of the the starting pitcher.
The strength of a team’s bullpen.
A team’s record at home vs away.
A team’s record in head-to-head play.
A team offensive output.;
, Baseball betting lines are available everyday. You may choose from a variety of options depending on where you place your bet. Options typically include betting on moneylines, totals, runlines, and futures., Don’t settle on just one place to bet, often called a sportsbook. Place different wagers at different sportsbooks to ensure you are getting the best odds. Seek out the sportsbook that will give you the best payout for your bet. Shop around to find the best payouts.If you find that a sportsbook in a casino 30 minutes away is paying 5 cents better than your favourite local sportsbook, it's best to go with the one 30 minutes away.
Maximize your dollar. Join at least one betting exchange in addition to your favourite dimeline sportsbook. A betting exchange is similar to a sportsbook except players determine their own betting lines with one another. In other words, you will determine the payout with the person you are betting against.

, Dimeline odds ensures that the odds on favorite and the underdog are separated by 10 cents on the dollar, thus the term dimeline. For example, if the favored team is given -150 odds, then a line of +140 will be given to the underdog, which is a 10 cent difference.If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. Dimelines work in your favour because the sportsbook can’t over-shade the favourite without exposing themselves on the back side with a large underdog line. If a sportsbook offers 15 or 20 cent odds, the favourite and underdog will be separated by 15 or 20 cents. This puts you at a disadvantage so be weary. Choosing a dimeline book ensures that your winnings will be higher over the long term, regardless of who you bet.

, Betting exchanges cut out the middle man and let bettors from around the world offer their own money lines directly to other bettors. This results in lines that are more favourable than any sportsbook.Additionally, a betting exchange won’t straddle the line. This means it won’t always separate the favourite and the underdog by exactly 10 or 20 cents. It may even be common to find no or almost no separation between the favourite and the underdog. You can’t get better than equal odds.

"
"
Understand how a moneyline bet works.,
Strategize who has the best odds of winning.,
Bet the moneyline.,
Understand the 5-inning line.",How to Bet on Baseball2," A moneyline bet is simply picking which team will win the game. If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. There is no point spread to consider.For example, if you are betting the Seattle Mariners hosting the New York York Yankees, the moneyline may appear Seattle +170 New York -200. This means that New York is favoured to win and Seattle is the underdog so you get more money if you bet on Seattle and they win. So if you bet $200 on New York you will win $100. However, if you bet $100 on Seattle you could win $170.

, Strategizing is known as handicapping and takes in many factors. Keep in mind that even the best teams will still lose about 40% of their regular season games so it isn’t as easy as betting on the favourite. Watch for things like good pitchers on bad teams, underdogs who play well on their home field, and small favourites over underdogs.Keeping a keen eye during the season allows you to make informed bets. Steadily build your winnings with each well placed bet.

, Once you have chosen the team who you think will win, find a legal sportsbook online or, if gambling is legal at your location, place a bet at a casino, pub, or wherever else sports gambling is accepted.


Research which sportsbook gives the best return to your bet as not all of them set the moneyline the same. The payout is adjusted based on the odds set at the point of betting., This is basically the same as the moneyline but only factors in the score of 5 innings of play. It is similar to placing a bet for the winner of the first half of basketball or football. The odds are usually very similar to the regular moneyline odds; however, the starting pitcher is a significant factor in determining the odds."
"
Determine how betting totals work.,
Handicap the game.,
Place the bet.,
Bet team totals.",How to Bet on Baseball3," The total betting line is also called the Over/Under Total and means that you are wagering on the total number of runs scored. An oddsmaker will establish a betting line and you must determine whether the total number of runs by both teams will be over or under this set line.For example, if the Seattle Mariners are playing the New York Yankees the line can be set at 8.5o - 130, 8.5u +110. this means that it is favoured that both teams will score over 8.5 runs. So you must bet $130 to win $100. The minus sign in front of the $130 means that it is favoured that both teams will score at least 8.5 runs.

, There are many factors to consider before placing a wager. When betting totals you must consider offensive output, pitching, stadium, and weather. Some stadiums produce more runs than others and open fields can be affected by the weather.

, Find a legal sportsbook online or a casino, pub, or other sports betting establishment. Calculate the best payout for your game before placing your bet. Some sportsbooks may offer better odds than others.

, Team totals are exactly as it sounds. Bet on the total amount of runs a single team will make in a single game rather than the total amount of runs produced by both teams. For example, Seattle may have a Team Total of 4 over - 125. So if you wager $125 that Seattle scores over 4 runs, you win $100."
"
Understand the runline.,
Strategize before placing your bet.,
Place your bet.",How to Bet on Baseball4," Similar to a point spread in football, the run line is how many runs a team will win by; however, the MLB runline will usually be set at 1.5. The odds will be set based on this number. In some cases there will be alternative run lines set at 2.5 or more.For example, a runline can be seen as Seattle -1 1/2 +140. This means that Seattle must win by at least two or more runs for you to win your bet. The +140 represents the payout odds so if you bet $100, you will win $140., Runlines are different than totals and moneylines. Evenly matched teams may payout better odds but be difficult to handicap. Pitching is a good starting point for your game analysis.


Make note of alternate runlines as those are runlines that have been flipped. This makes the favourite the underdog and vice versa. In certain scenarios, like when you feel the underdog has a good chance of covering the runline, you can increase your payout.

For example: Team Moneyline Runline Alternate Runline New York Yankees -150 -1.5 (-110) +1.5 (-250) Seattle Mariners +140 +1.5 (+100) -1.5 (+220) Wagering -1.5 on Seattle you receive +220 rather than +100 on a +1.5 runline., Find a legal sports book at your location or online. Keep in mind that most sportsbook set the Runline at 1.5 so research which sportsbook gives the best payout.

Watch the entire season to bet Futures.,
Have fun with prop bets.,
Maximize a bet with a parlay.",How to Bet on Baseball5," Baseball futures are wagers that are available for the entirety of the season. You may place your wager during the offseason, regular season, pennant races, and the post season. The odds will be updated and posted each week.Baseball future bets include who will win the world series, who will win the pennant, who will win the Cy Young award, etc. Keep in mind that the odds change each day as the season progresses. Future bets are challenging because performance, injuries, and personnel moves can all dramatically change your odds of winning and where the sportsbooks set the betting lines.

, Not all sportsbooks offer prop bets. Prop bets aren’t usually related to the score of the game but rather the stats of individual players. For example, a prop bet could be which player will have the most RBIs, runs, and home runs in the game?You will see the players name and the payout of the bet. For example, Ken Griffey Jr. (SEA) -110
Prop bets are fun because you may bet on your favourite players. That can also be very profitable if you catch a player on a streak.

, A baseball parlay means that you combine two or more bets to create a greater payoff. All of the parts of your wager must win for you to win your parlay. This is especially useful if you put little down. There are many MLB games in a day so each parlay can increase your payout.For example, you may bet the moneyline of one game and parlay the total of another game to increase the payout odds of that single bet.

Stretch well.,
Do a round-off into a back handspring.,
Bring your arms up to your ears and set high into the air.,
Keep your toes pointed and initiate a flip in a hollowed-out position.,
Keep your arms to either side of your face.,
Begin to wrap.,
Keep your arms in this position until you start you see the ground.,
Stick your landing.",How to Perform a Full Twisting Layout," It's important to stretch out your body, especially your back, before you do a full twisting layout. Remember that, if you want to complete the full twisting layout, then you have to be able to do a round off, a back handspring, a back tuck, and a back layout. When you stretch, you should focus on your back and your wrists, though you should stretch your arms, neck, and legs as well. Here are some stretches you can do:


Do a simple backbend to stretch your back.
Curl up into a ball on the floor and roll up and down on your back, to roll it out.
Stretch your wrists and ankles by holding onto them and rolling them clockwise five times, and then rolling them in the opposite direction another five times.;
, Back and front layouts are typically done after another skill that helps build momentum; to complete the full twisting layout most effectively, you should do a round off and then begin to do a back handspring, so that you generate enough speed and momentum to propel your body into the air for long enough to do a full twisting layout. Here's what you have to do:


To do a round off, here's what you need to do:

Hurtle forward with your arms up by your ears.
Place your hands down on the ground together.
Swing your feet over your head.
Keep your feet together until you plant them down on the other side of your hands.
Land facing the opposite direction where you started from, with your arms up over your head, near your ears.


To do a back handspring immediately afterwards, you need to use the momentum of the roundoff to help you generate even more speed. Here's what you do:

Get in a seated position with your arms swinging up over your head.
Push through your toes to lift your arms up even more.
Fall backwards, taking care not to arch your back too much.
Plant your hands on the floor, with your fingers facing away from you.
Swing your legs over your hands, so you're in a hand stand for a second.
Keep your feet together as you plant them on the floor.
Pop up with your hands above your head.



, After you pound off the floor from your back handspring, your arms should pop up over your head. This is called the set, the move that helps you transition into the full twisting layout with the best form and speed possible.

, In the hollowed-out position, your arms should be at your sides and your toes should be pointed. Remember that, just as in doing a regular back layout, you need to focus on achieving as much height as possible so you have time to complete the skill with your legs straight.

, This will help you maintain your balance as you begin to twist. Your core (abdominal area) should be tight throughout this process.

, Right when you start to see the ceiling, you should take your lead arm (whichever arm you're twisting towards), and drop it behind you, as if you were elbowing a person behind you. Take your other arm and bring it toward that arm, following the same direction you're twisting towards, as if you were passing a heavy ball you were holding with both hands to the person to the left of you. This will help your entire body complete the turn.

, Then, open and lift your arms, remembering to keep your entire body straight. Extend your knees and ankles and continue to keep your core tight.

, Once you have completed the rotation and are turned in the direction that you began the twist from, land on both feet and lift your arms up to complete the full-twisting layout. If you're not quite there and have only made it halfway around, then you can land in the opposite direction that you started from, doing the half twisting layout instead.


If you're having trouble reaching this point, you can work on improving your half-twist, even turning your body halfway after you land to get used to the sensation of making a full turn in the air.

Make up your mind when tryouts come around.,
Don't let that scare you off.,
Show school spirit.,
Know the traditional requirements for pom squads.",How to Make Your School's Pom Squad," That's pretty much all to it. Usually the styles of dances for poms are jazz and hip hop. You may also want to know basic ballet, modern, lyrical, and contemporary. For flexibility you should be able to do at the very least splits. Try to learn how to do oversplits and basic contortion.;
, Take jazz dance class, hip hop dance class, or both. If you are unable to do so, the Internet is a big help. Watch videos and copy what you see. Learn basics of other forms of dance too.

, Practice everyday and on a daily basis. Do workouts based on what your pom squad needs.

, You need to think, ""Do I really want to do this, even though it's hard work?"" If you make the squad, you have to be prepared to perform at half time for every varsity soccer, football and basketball game. You also have to pay a fee, so be aware if your family is tight on money. Once you make the squad, you won't be getting out until the end of the season.

, Joining a pom squad is more good than it is bad. Usually the school holds clinics, held so that people trying out learn the same routine that they will perform at the actual tryout day. Sometimes there are cut-outs throughout the try out period, these are for separating out the possible students that could make the squad from those girls who aren't really quite there yet.

, Have a drenched attitude (but don't be crazy about it) and smile, facial expressions are key. Also wear your hair in a ponytail, wear simple but attractive makeup (attractive not attracting), and wear your school's colors. Your outfit should consist of sweat shorts or work out shorts and a tight fitting tank top. Remember not to be too covered up but don't be too showy either. The judges are looking for girls with a wholesome attitude.

, You should be able to be good at kicking, jumps, turns, leaps, hip hop, jazz, lyrical, kickline, movement fluidity, grace, etc.

, In cheerleading, your teammates will become like a second family to you and the memories you make will last you a lifetime. All squad members will share in the excitement of when you win and the disappointment of when you lose. As a cheer group, they will laugh together, sweat together, and probably even cry together. And as your cheer squad grows and grows together, they will find themselves thinking and reacting as one. There is nothing in the world that can compare to the bond that a cheerleading squad has. Of course, there's going to be fighting and arguing. Just try personally not to talk about people behind their backs, and all of that drama stuff, and it will help to improve the squad.

Don’t get discouraged.",How to Make the Middle School Cheer Squad," You’ll want to learn the language that your coach or teammates will be speaking so you can understand exactly what they mean. Search online or watch a few cheerleading videos to get an idea of the basics.

Tumbling refers to gymnastic moves performed on the floor, such as round-offs or back handsprings.
Stunting refers to the way a team builds their tricks, such as in pyramids or basket tosses. The backspot and bases are the people holding up the flyer, who does tricks in the air.
Jumps have different names depending on how to do them. A toe touch is a jump in which you jump up and spread your legs in the air, like a split, while touching your toes; a herkie is a jump in which one leg is stretched out in front of you while the other is bent at the knee and faces behind you.;
, Stretching is a very important part of cheerleading. It loosens your muscles in preparation for jumps, tumbling, and stunts. Flexibility also plays a big part in which role you’ll have on the team; the more flexible you are, the more versatile you’ll be, allowing you to participate in tumbling, jumps, and stunts., Most cheers will be variations of the same movements. If you spend a bit of time learning the basics, such as a high V, low V, daggers, T, and broken T, you’ll have an edge when it comes time to try out. Remember to keep your motions stiff.

Make sure your arms are straight and your muscles are tense.
Keep your joints (elbows, wrists) stiff and straight unless the motion requires them to be bent.
For most motions, your arms should be slightly in front of you.
Tighten your fists, and be sure to keep your thumbs on the outside of your fingers, not tucked in.

, Learn how to do a cartwheel and a roundoff so you can show the coach your skills. If you have mastered those moves, try a back walkover, back handspring, or back tuck. Be careful, and don’t try these moves alone if you have no experience. Tumbling is dangerous and you can easily hurt yourself if you don’t have the right form., It’s a great idea to learn a few basic jumps before tryouts. Try the toe touch and the herkie. Work on your form as well as the height of your jump., Find a dance or cheer routine online and practice it yourself. You will likely have to learn a dance as well as a few cheers at tryouts, so this will give you some experience. There are lots of tutorials online that will teach you how to do a routine step by step., Cheerleaders have to be both loud and clear. You’ll need to speak from your diaphragm rather than your throat. Practice shouting a cheer while also carefully enunciating your words. If you don’t know any cheers yet, just make one up.A great way to strengthen your voice is to lay on the floor on your stomach and grip your toes with your hands behind you. Try yelling or singing this way, and you’ll see the way it exercises your diaphragm!

, Cheerleading is a big commitment and you’ll need to show your parents and the coach that you can handle it. Be sure to stay on top of your school work; complete all your homework, study for tests, and turn everything in on time. In most cases, cheerleaders need to achieve a certain GPA in order to stay on the team, so make your schoolwork a priority!, Cheer requires flexibility, strength, and endurance. You should go running, swimming, or lift weights to prepare for tryouts. Playing other sports will also help you get into shape, so join another team if you think you can handle it., Drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Be sure to eat a variety of foods, including protein, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. Stay away from salty and sugary snacks as well as soda and energy drinks., It’s important to get eight to ten hours of sleep each night.Your body needs time to rest and recuperate, especially if you’ve been exercising and working hard on learning the basics of cheerleading., Arrive on time and prepared for the tryout. Bring water and a snack for the break time. Avoid checking your phone or other distractions so you can show the coach that you will be a dedicated cheerleader., Be sure to smile and keep a positive attitude. Cheerleaders are known for their peppy personalities and energetic attitudes. If you make a mistake, move past it. Everyone is likely to mess up when learning something new. Simply smile and find your place, as this will show the coach that you don’t give up when things are difficult., You should wear shorts and a t-shirt or tank top so that you can move freely. Wear sturdy sneakers or special cheerleading shoes if you have them. Braid your hair or put it up in a ponytail or bun to keep it off your face. Wear your school colors if you are able, and/or add a ribbon in your school colors to your hair., Confidence is key for cheerleading. Even if you are new to the sport, if you learn a few basics before tryouts you can be confident in your skills. You should also be nice to others who are trying out and offer to help if you think you know something they can learn from., Give the coach your full attention at all times. It may be tempting to talk to your friends or others who are trying out, but you should show the coach respect. You’ll also need to pay close attention to the instructions you are given so you can remember everything later., Don’t be afraid to speak up if you have a question or would like some help with a move. Asking a question shows you want to understand, which is admirable. The coach will be likely be happy to explain something to you or help you adjust your movement., Give 100% during your tryout. Even if you feel silly or awkward, try your hardest to do what the coach asks of you. Though you may be new to the moves, the coach will appreciate your dedication and willingness to try., If the dance, cheers, or stunts are harder than you expected, or even if you don’t make the squad, don’t get discouraged. Practice the dance and cheers as much as you can before tryouts are over. If you don’t make the team you can always work on your skills so that you will be more prepared the next year. Consider joining a dance team or a gymnastics team to improve your skills as well as have some fun. You could also try another sport."

When possible, go for fresh fruits and veggies over canned or frozen varieties. You should also get in low-fat dairy products, lean meats like chicken or fish, beans, eggs, and nuts.
You do not have to give up your favorite foods to eat healthy. An occasional treat or indulgence is fine, as long as it does not come at the expense of a diet that's healthy overall. If you want to go out for ice cream with friends now and then, feel free to do so. Just make sure that most of your daily calories come from fresh, healthy food.
Protein is particularly important for those training for a cheerleader body. You need protein for aerobics and weight training. Make sure you get some lean meats every day, like fish and chicken. You should also strive for complex, protein-rich carbohydrates, like beans, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat bread.;
, Cheerleaders usually have lean figures. You should make time for four one-hour aerobics sessions each week. Aerobic activities tend to burn the most calories. Aerobic activities include things like:Biking
Running
Jogging
Swimming
Many sports where you run around, such as soccer, tennis, and rugby

, Weight training is also important if you want to look like a cheerleader. Cheerleaders engage in a lot of physical activity during their routines, so their bodies are often very toned. Incorporate some weight training into your weekly fitness regimen.Most people see significant improvement with just one or two 30 minute weight training sessions a week. Make sure to space these sessions out, however. You should not engage in activities like weight lifting more than one day in a row.
Start slow when lifting weights. As a beginner, you may only be able to lift a few pounds. That's okay. It's better to start slow than risk straining yourself. You should also warm up before you begin. Take a brisk 30 minute walk before you start training.
You don't necessarily need to lift weights to weight train. Activities like push-ups, sit-ups, and Pilates allow you to use your body as a weight.

, If you're going to make any significant changes to your lifestyle, you should talk to a doctor first. Exercise and a balanced diet are important for your health. However, you want to make sure your dietary needs are met and that you're not overdoing exercise. Make an appointment with a doctor to talk about your diet and fitness goals.

, As cheerleaders engage in a lot of aerobic activity, some of their hair is usually up in a ponytail. If you want to look like a cheerleader, you should keep at least part of your hair pulled back.Many cheerleaders only have part of their hair pulled back. They may pull the hair in front back into a partial pony tail. If your hair is too thin or short for a partial ponytail, simply pull all your hair back into a classic ponytail.
Some people advise straightening your hair, if it's curly, to look like a cheerleader. However, many cheerleaders do have curly hair.

, When it comes to make-up, the most important aspect is foundation. Use a few layers of a light foundation that matches your skin tone. Use your fingers, a sponge, or a brush to spread the foundation over your face. Work on evening out your skin tone, targeting red marks, acne, and other imperfections.If you want a bit more make-up, consider adding a touch of bronzer to your cheekbones. This can make your cheekbones look more defined, giving your face a slimmer overall look.
Do not use too much foundation. You want your skin to look even and natural. Foundation should not look caked on or excessive.

, While people may associate cheerleaders with a lot of flashy make-up, most cheerleaders keep make-up fairly minimal. Due to the excessive amount of physical activity involved in cheerleading, most cheerleaders go for light, natural looking make-up shades.Apply a light, natural shade of eyeshadow, like a beige or peach shade. You should also add a bit of eyeliner to make your eyes pop. Use enough that it stays on all day, but not too much to the point it becomes overwhelming.
A nice lipstick can have a nice effect. Consider a girly shade, like pink or purple. You may want to add a bit of lip gloss over the lipstick so your lips shine a bit.
Some cheerleaders do apply a sparkly shade of eyeshadow. This can be a fun touch, as long as you add a layer of primer on your eyelids. This will help the eyeshadow stay in place and keep it from spreading on your cheeks and face., If you want to embody the cheerleader look, go for preppy clothes. Seek out skirts, sun dresses, blazers, leggings, cardigans, tank tops, and flattering jeans. Pick bright colors and fun patterns, like polka dots, rainbows, and stripes.


If you're on a budget, go to a secondhand store to shop. There are often a wide-variety of skirts at secondhand stores that can help with your cheerleader look.
Many people associate cheerleaders with images from high school. You can look for something like a plaid skirt and blazer combo, which may remind people of the school girl image.

, It's a good idea to put a bow in your hair. Many cheerleader's ponytails are tied by ribbons or bows. Take a large, bright colored ribbon and wrap it around your ponytail. Tie it an attractive looking bow-shape.If you're not into bows or ribbons, consider a headband or barrette instead.

, Cheerleaders are known for their fun, perky attitude. Try to stay positive in your day-to-day interactions if you want to give off the cheerleader vibe.Compliment friends, classmates, co-workers, and family members. Even a small compliment goes a long way. Mention a little thing, like, ""I really love your blouse!"" or ""Thanks for asking me how my day was!""
Try to see the bright side of situations. When faced with a challenge, try to look at it as an opportunity to grow and change.

, Cheerleaders are known for being high energy. Try to work on being energetic to help with your cheerleader image. Eating right and exercising, as discussed, can help with your overall energy. However, work on getting high quality sleep each night. This can also keep your energy up.


Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, including weekends. Your body will naturally adapt to a regular sleep/wake cycle. You can also try having a bed time ritual, liking reading every night before bed. This can signal to your brain that it's time for sleep. Getting more rest will help you have more cheerleader energy.Caffeine can be used, in moderation, for an energy spike if you're feeling tired. A cup of coffee or tea can help you get through an afternoon slump. However, don't overdo it. Around 4 cups of brewed coffee a day contains more than enough caffeine for most adults.You should avoid relying on energy drinks or soda for caffeine, as the added sugar can cause weight gain and other health problems.

, Cheerleaders are known for being enthusiastic. If you want to give off a cheerleader vibe, work on being a personal cheerleader for those around you. Support people at work, school, and your personal life. If a friend is going to ask someone out on a date, let that friend know you're rooting for him or her. If a colleague has a presentation coming up, tell that colleague you're confident he or she will do great."

Choose your tissue paper and materials.,
Grab a stack of tissue paper.,
Start cutting strips into your tissue paper.,
Grab your popsicle stick and unfold the tissue paper, leaving it in a pile.,
Wrap a rubber band around the base and fluff away.",How to Make Cheerleading Pom Poms1," This kind of pom is great for cheering on your team from the stands -- especially if you have your team's colors. Get at least two different colors and enough tissue paper to fill the hands of all your family members. You'll need:


Tissue paper (in its just-bought state -- no scraps)
Popsicle sticks
Rubber bands
Scissors;
, Generally speaking, tissue paper comes in quite long pieces in a tri-fold arrangement. Generally. If yours doesn't or isn't already folded, do fold it up until it's about six inches (15 cm) across -- it'll be easier and quicker to work with that way.


If your tissue paper is regulation size (that is to say, just short of 2 feet (.6 m) long), cut it in half length-wise once folded. If your pom pom is 2 feet (0.6 m) long, that's one droopy pom pom!

, But don't cut all the way! You want strips about 1"" (2.5 cm) wide along the length of your paper that stop about 3"" (7.5 cm) from the bottom. This uncut part is the base of your pom pom and will go near the handle.


They don't have to be even. Eyeballing it is just fine. The only thing you need to be concerned with is ripping!
You can cut as many pieces of tissue paper at once as you think your scissors can handle. Half a dozen sheets at a time shouldn't phase a normal pair, but once you get too bulky you risk having jagged edges and creating tears.
Cut as many pieces as you need. 8-12 sheets make for a fluffy pom pom.

, You should now have a whole bunch of pieces that look like the fringe on a cowboy's chaps (sort of). Take the stick (the thicker the stick, the better) and place it at the edge of the pile, overlapping the 3"" or so you left uncut.


It is as this point that if you have any pieces of shiny, decorative paper you add them in. Simply cut them to size and line them up with the tissue paper.
Start wrapping the top of the stick over and over with the tissue paper. If your stick is too short or too thin (you need to be able to hold onto it easily), use multiple sticks. Wrap it over and over and over until you reach the other side of the tissue paper and your pom pom is virtually formed.

, Tada! Your pom pom! If you don't trust the rubber band, tape is your second best bet -- glue just gets messy and tissue paper does not take well to it.


Shake the pom pom out like you would in the stands. It'll fluff out a bit as you loosen it up.
Decorate the handle with glitter glue, markers, stickers, or any other spirited embellishments you have laying about the house.

"

Take ten trash bags and layer them on top of one another.,
Cut off the drawstring at the top.,
Make slits on both sides toward the center.,
Gather the uncut center and wrap it with tape.,
Fluff and crinkle the ends.",How to Make Cheerleading Pom Poms2," Trash bags don't come in all colors, but generally an accent color can be found, like yellow, black, or white. This method works great for squads that need impromptu sets as the material matches that of many professional poms.


Place them on a flat surface. You'll be using scissors, so you may want to avoid shaggy carpet or a nice hardwood floor.

, Any edge that doesn't match the rest of the trash bag needs to be gotten rid of.


Once all the rough edges or areas are cut off, fold the bags in half, width-wise. That is, fold them so they're half as long.
Cut off the folded edge. This gives you a pile of 40 pieces of trash bag. Keep the bags lined up.

, Leave about 3"" (7.5 cm) in the middle, uncut. That's where your handle will go. Do this on both sides -- this is a double-sided pom pom.


If you want thinner strips, cut more slits. If you want thicker strips, cut fewer. Again, make sure to keep your pile aligned.

, Electrical or duct works best -- any sturdy tape will do. Wrap it around a few times to get it secure.


Electrical tape may be a bit narrow and duct may be a bit wide, depending on your measurements. If either is the case, adjust the tape (by cutting it or adding more) so that it covers the entire uncut center.

, The more you fluff and crinkle, the more voluminous your pom pom will be. Grab small sections and scrunch them up; don't crinkle the whole end in one handful.


If you'd like a bigger pom pom, start over but with more trash bags. But don't write off the possibility that you didn't fluff enough -- your pom pom should double in size.

Lay old newspapers on a flat surface.,
Paint the toilet roll your squad's colour.,
Start cutting strands of wool.,
Plait the groups of two together until you have at least twelve plaits.,
Check if your toilet roll is dry.",How to Make Cheerleading Pom Poms3," Assemble all the things you'll need in this designated area. You'll need the following materials:


Toilet roll
Scissors
Wool in your squads colours
Craft glue
Paint in your squads colours
Masking tape

, If your squad has more than one colour, paint one side of the toilet roll one colour and the other side the other colour.


If you're worried about not having straight lines, use a zigzag or wave pattern. This is easier on the eye if your colours aren't exactly even.
Stand the roll on its end off to the side and let it dry.

, If your squad has two colours, cut out at least 12 strands of each colour that measure 15 cm (6 inches) in length. If your wool is thinner, cut more strands.


If you have two colours, make sure you have an even amount of each color. Pair each color up with it's opposite, having at least 12 groups of two.

, Twist and braid the wool pieces to give them volume. If you'd like to use three pieces per plait, you can, but one colour will be more dominant than the other.


Tie a knot at the end of each plait. Put a weight down or a piece of tape on the unknotted end to keep it together.

, If it is, get the craft glue and squeeze a small blob of it on the inside of the top of the toilet roll. Take one of the plaits and stick the top of it into the glue and hold for fifteen to twenty seconds. Now do the same to all of the plaits until you have them drooping over the side of the toilet roll.


If you'd like, you can make twelve more plaits and add them onto the other end of the toilet roll creating a double sided pom pom.
Let it dry by putting to the side and waiting for half and hour.

For extra security (or instead of glue) you can put small pieces of masking tape inside the toilet roll where the plaits are attached.


After half an hour, give it a bit of a shake to see if it is strong and do a mini cheer routine.

Do your hair and makeup.",How to Make a Cheerleader Costume," Making a pleated skirt from scratch can be very difficult to do properly, as pleats are a complicated sewing procedure. If you don't have one of your own, you can purchase one from a school uniform store or large department store like Walmart. Even if it’s not technically a “cheerleader” skirt, many school uniforms still call for pleated skirts. If you don't want to spend money on a new skirt, visit consignment stores in your area. These skirts are worn by students of all ages — from kindergarten through high school. You may be able to find an outgrown or unneeded pleated skirt that fits you for a fraction of the original price.;
, Wear whatever undergarments you'll be wearing with your costume, but don't take these measurements over other clothes.


Waist: Decide where you want the skirt's waistband to sit. Most cheerleader skirts reach fairly high up, to around the navel. Use a measuring tape to measure your waist at that level, holding it snugly. Make sure not to suck your stomach in, so the skirt won't be too tight while you're wearing it. Make a mark with a pen or sticker to mark your chosen waistline on your body.
Length: Measure from the mark or sticker on your waistline to wherever you want the skirt to fall on your leg.

, You can purchase fabric at many craft and design stores. The length of the fabric should be your length measurement, plus an inch or so for the hem and waistband. For the width, multiply the waist measurement by three (to allow for the pleats), then add 2 inch for the seam and zipper., If you wait until after you’ve turned the flat fabric into a tubular skirt and created the pleats, hemming the bottom of the skirt will be very difficult. Your hem measurement should be about 1 cm above the bottom edge of the fabric.


Using a pencil, make light marks all along the fabric to show where the hem should fall. Make accurate 1 cm measurements throughout, so your hem will be even.
Fold the bottom of the fabric up so the edge just touches the marks you’ve made on the inside of the skirt. Pin the fabric into place with sewing pins.
Either thread a needle and sew the hemline by hand or use your sewing machine to create your hem.

, Once you’ve hemmed the bottom of the fabric, lay it out flat with the hem pointing toward you. The left and right sides of the fabric, from this position, will be the edges that are sewn together to form the seam of the skirt. You’ve given yourself 2 inches of extra width, so measure 1” on each edge (left and right) of the fabric and mark your seam allowance with a pencil. Just as with the hem markings, make a series of accurate measurements from the top to bottom of the fabric to give yourself a line you can follow later.Mark a vertical line down the midpoint of the fabric’s width at this point as well. To find the midpoint, measure the entire width of the fabric and divide it by half. Mark your vertical line at that half-measurement.
All marks should be made on the “inside” of the skirt.

, Look at the pleat marks you’ve made, and think of them as falling in a 1-2-3, 1-2-3 pattern. Place a pin through each “1” pleat mark at the un-hemmed top edge of the fabric.


Pull the 1” seam and zipper allowance on the right side of the fabric down and pin it out of the way.

, Pinch the fabric at the first “1” pin (1-1) and pull it over to the next “1” pin (1-2). Remove the pin 1-1 and pin the fabric into place at that spot with pin 1-2. This creates a pinned pleat. Repeat this process by pinching the fabric at the third pin (1-3) and pulling it over to pin 1-4. Remove pin 1-3 and pin the fabric into place at that spot with pin 1-4. Continue doing this until you reach the edge of your fabric.

, Iron over the pleats to create firm creases.

, Just as with the hemline, you can either sew this by hand with a needle or use a sewing machine if you have one. Just make sure to sew in the opposite direction in which you created your pleats to make sure your pleats don’t bunch up.

, Sew down each pleat in a straight line from waistline to the 2” mark to create a fitted waistline at the top of the skirt. Otherwise, the skirt will flow more like an A-line skirt.

, The length should be the thickness of your desired waistband (an inch to 1.5 inches should suffice) multiplied by 2. Fold this fabric in half along its vertical axis so you have a wide piece of fabric folded over to half its length. The “inside” of the fabric should be facing out. Sew the two long edges of the fabric together with a needle or sewing machine.


When you’ve finished, turn the fabric right-side-out like you would with a sock. This will be the waistband for the top of your skirt.
Iron this flat as well.

, Lay the waistband over the outside (what people will see when you’re wearing it) of the skirt, and pin it into place from left to right. The top of the waistband should line up neatly with the raw edge of the skirt fabric. Using a sewing needle or sewing machine, stitch these two pieces of fabric together along the top edge.

, Fold your skirt fabric over so that the “outside” parts touch each other. You should be looking at the inside of the skirt from your position. Unpin the seam allowance that you tucked away earlier. Arrange it so the raw edge of seam allowance lines up with the raw edge on the other side of the skirt fabric.Pin those two raw edges together down the entire length of the seam allowance. The extra seam allowance should still extend out to the side of the pins.


Lay the zipper along the seam allowance where it will be inserted, then mark where the bottom of the zipper ends.

, This will create a firm seam for the skirt. However, create a loose, temporary seam along the top length of the skirt, where the zipper still needs to be inserted.

, Press the loose, top part of the seam open and lay your zipper along it, where it will be inserted. Make sure the zipper’s teeth are lined up with the seam, and that the zipper is facing outward. When you pin the zipper into place, you should be looking at the inside fabric of the skirt and the back of the zipper. The pins should all be on one side of the zipper — either the left or the right. Sew down the unpinned length of the zipper. Then, remove the pins and sew up that side.


Then, turn the skirt right-side-out. Snip through the loose stitches you created along the top of the skirt to reveal the zipper.

, The easiest way to accomplish this is with snap fasteners that can be purchased online or at any arts and crafts store. They can also be called “press studs.” Simply sew them into place using needle and thread. Be sure that they’re placed properly so they close neatly.


With this final step, you’ve created your own pleated cheerleader skirt!

, A cheerleading costume isn't complete without the pom poms. The best material to use for durable, puffy pom poms is plastic or vinyl tablecloth. For two-color pom poms, buy two tablecloths — one in each of your desired colors. You will also need a pair of scissors, electrical or duct tape, and a ruler.


You can find these materials in the party section in grocery stores or at most party or dollar stores.
You can also buy premade pom poms if you don't want to make them yourself.

, Remove it from its packaging and arrange it so that the cloth is folded in half. It should have a large width and short height. Cut along the folded end to separate the fabric into two pieces. Keeping the two pieces in place, fold them over again so you’re looking at 4 layers of fabric that are the same width, but even shorter in height. Cut along the folded end again, so you have 4 pieces of fabric stacked on top of each other.

, Your 4 pieces of fabric should still be stacked on top of each other. Now, fold them so that you have 8 layers of fabric that are the same height, but half the width of what you ended the last step with. Cut along the short folded edge to create 8 strips of fabric.


Fold and repeat this process once more so that you end up with 16 pieces of fabric that are close to being squares. Depending on the dimensions of your original tablecloth, they may still be a little rectangular.

, You should end up with 32 squares of fabric — 16 in each color.

, To create pom poms that have both colors in them, you want layer the colors. Put down a sheet of Color A, then one of Color B, then Color A, then Color B. Make two stacks — one for each pom pom. Each stack should have 16 squares — 8 in Color A and 8 in Color B.


Line up the edges of the squares as best as you can. It’s unlikely they’ll line up perfectly, but that’s ok.

, Place each stack of squares, with the edges lined up, on a flat surface. Tape each one down to the surface by placing long strips of masking tape along their centers.Each square should be bisected by tape.


Lay a ruler down perpendicular to the tape so that it creates a straight line down to the edge of the fabric on one side. Cut along the ruler up to the tape, but don’t cut through the tape. Do this all along the edge of the fabric, creating evenly sized tassels.
Repeat this process on the other side of the tape.

, Remove the masking tape from your two stacks of fabric and position them so that there’s a spine pointing up from your position. The tassels should be out to the left and right of each stack. Fold each stack like an accordion — folding up, then down, then up, then down. It may help to fold two length up, then one length back.

, Holding your accordion of layers together tightly, wrap a piece of electrical tape around the center to secure it. The tape should be applied as tightly as possible, so go slowly and be deliberate in your movements.


You can also add a ribbon or strap around the tape. This will act as a handle for you to hold on to once you've fluffed the tassels.

, At this point, the tassels are laying fairly flat against once another. Go through your pom pom and pull the tassels in different directions, creating more volume. Continue this until you have a rounded, fluffy pom pom.


This step will take a little while to complete, but be patient. You will have great pom poms when you're done., If you want to go for a vintage look, choose a tight sweater. You can also wear a tank top with thick straps if the weather is too warm for a sweater. Ideally, you have a top from with the team's logo on it, but that may not be the case. Use markers to write your team's name or draw its logo onto your top.

, If you want to add something extra to your costume, try adding the logo of your favorite team to your plain shirt or tank top. Download or create the image you want on the shirt, then print it onto the transfer paper. Cut out your image and iron it on to the shirt, following the directions for the transfer paper.

, Once you have your base outfit, you need to finish off your outfit with shoes and socks. Cheerleaders wear short white ankle socks with their uniforms. They will look good with any outfit you choose, no matter the color. Pick tennis shoes or small sneakers. If you don't have shoes that match the colors on your uniform, plain white sneakers will look good with anything.You can add flare to your shoes by adding small pom poms that match your costume to your shoelaces., Put your hair in either a high ponytail or in pigtails. It gets your hair out of your way and gives your looks extra bounce. For your makeup, apply your foundation and powder like you normally do. Add a light blush to your cheeks. Also put on mascara and a shimmering white or bronze eye shadow color. Finish it off with a light pink lipstick or lip gloss.You can add some words on your cheeks, something like your team's name or generic phrases such as ""Go Team"" or ""Go, Fight, Win."" These can be drawn in makeup pencils or face paint.
You can also add glitter embellishments to your makeup or bows in your hair that match your costume. Anything that makes you look like you have spirit is appropriate for a cheerleader costume."

, Using either an X-acto knife or scissors, cut out each length to the 1/2 inch (1.2cm) mark. Do not cut any further, as there must be a gap between the cut and the folded edge.


To help keep the cuts straight, use a ruler to cut along.

, The middle section will be uncut and intact, with tassel pieces each side of the unfolded sheet.

, Keep rolling until all of the paper is in a roll, tassel pieces still out to the sides.

, Then, fold it in half to bring all of the tassels together. Glue the folded part together, for added strength; be sure to glue it as a loop, for threading on the garland string. When held by the folded portion, the tassels will all fall downward.

, Below the loop portion, glue or stick on a little piece of ribbon, Washi tape, lace or colorful paper to create a neat band. Choose the item that gets wrapped here in a color that matches the tassel.

, Then repeat as many times with other pieces of tissue paper as you need tassels.

, This forms the tassel garland.

, Tie onto hooks or tie on something high up, to decorate the room with the tassels garland.

Purchase as many plastic megaphones as expected guests.,
Attach the name of each guest to one megaphone.,
Make the candy sticks.,
Slide the candy sticks into the megaphone.,
Arrange the megaphones on a side table, in a neat row.",How to Make Cheerleading Party Decorations2," Either use all the same color, or a variety of colors, as preferred.


These are available from party stores. They're not the real thing, just inexpensive copies.

, Use stickers, paper labels, etc., as you prefer. If you want to, you can use the same method as for decoupage to add letter cut-outs using magazine paper, etc.


Add other decorative elements as wished, such as star or heart stickers, etc.

, Attach a piece of wrapped candy or candy bar to a pipe cleaner. Glue or tape the candy to one end of the pipe cleaner, leaving the rest of the pipe cleaner free. Repeat with different candies; you'll need around five to ten candy sticks per megaphone.

,


Place the megaphone large end facing down on a flat surface.
Thread the candy sticks, pipe cleaner end down first, into the hole at the top of the megaphone.
Continue until there are enough forming a pretty bundle. Push down firmly so that they sit tight.
If you want to ensure that the candy sticks remain in place, attach a rubber band to the sticks from the other end of the megaphone (the large opening end). Hold the megaphone to the side, roll a rubber band as high as it will go, then fasten it with several loops until it's secure and the candy sticks don't move in and out of the top hole.
Tie some curly ribbon around the base of the candies topside of the megaphone, and let the curls dangle down.
Repeat for the remaining megaphones.

, They look lovely as decorations and when guests leave, they can simply find the one with their name on it, pick it up and take it home with them.

Make a megaphone from paper card.,
Wrap the poster board around a cone shaped object such as a plastic sand bucket, a floral styrofoam cone, or an upside down terracotta flowerpot.,
While still wrapped around the cone form, decide how tall you want the megaphone to be.,
Cut the plaster gauze into strips.,
Allow this to thoroughly dry.,
Take the megaphone off the cone form.,
Once this is dry, apply several layers of a water-based sealer.

,
Paint and decorate the megaphone as desired.",How to Make Cheerleading Party Decorations3," Use thick but pliable poster card or board to make a basic megaphone shape. Cereal cardboard is ideal.

, Tape the edges down where they meet, on the inside and the outside. The poster board will naturally form a cone shape.

, Measure this length from the floor to the desired length and mark it on the poster board. Make more marks to this same height all the way around the top of the poster board.


Cut around those marks to create the mouthpiece end of the megaphone.
Repeat this along the bottom edge of the megaphone to create a nice opened end of your poster board cone.

, Following the package directions, dip each gauze strip into the water to activate the plaster and then apply each one, overlapping as you go, from top to bottom until you have covered the entire cone.


Two layers of gauze are enough for a nice sturdy yet lightweight megaphone.

, Perhaps leave to dry overnight, if necessary.

, To finish the top and bottom edges, cut several thinner strips of the plaster gauze, wet them down, then apply them over the edges.

,, Use colors of the party, as well as lettering and designs. The finished megaphone can be used to decorate the table as a centerpiece or hung as a decoration.

Check the width of the paper.,
Arrange the paper on the table.,
Choose paint or markers to decorate the paper with.,
Mark sections across the paper for yard lines and end zones.,
Paint or mark the lines across the width of the paper tablecloth.

,
Paint, stamp or stencil the yard numbers for each yard marker, except for the end zones.,
Allow to dry.",How to Make Cheerleading Party Decorations4,", If it is the same as the table, there is no need to adjust the paper. If it is thinner, you'll need to run a second length alongside the first length, taped together underneath the side that will serve as the tabletop portion. Also, cut the paper to the length of the table.

, Tape it down so that it cannot move when bumped. The rest of the work will be done on the table, so this is best left to setting up time, making allowance for sufficient drying time if using paint.

, Either should be white; paint will probably take longer to dry, depending on what type you're using.

, Do this all the way down the table. Keep each section the same size.


If the packing paper has section marks, you may be able to use these to mark sections.

,, For the end zones, write or stencil the words ""End Zone"".

, The table can now be decorated with cheerleading related objects, food, place name tags, etc.

",How to Look Great for Cheer Competitions," That way, it won't get messed up. Put your deodorant on too, so that it doesn't get on your uniform.


Try not to get food on your pretty uniform, it doesn't look good.
If you accidentally get a stain, no sweat! Just take a bit of ""Oxy Clean"" and water and place it on the spot. Dry and rinse it once more, the stain should come off.;
, If you need to use perfume, spray on a scent that your team won't mind since they have to be with you the whole day.

, Feeling good can help you to perform better. Take a shower the night before and shave. When you wake up, wash your face, then try the following:


Do your hair and take pride in it. You don't want a ponytail that is bumpy and will get loose. Maybe tease your bangs a bit and smooth over with mousse.
Wear your hair and makeup in the same style that your cheer squad is wearing theirs. Decide beforehand what hairstyle you're doing.






Do your makeup. Take care to not pack on the make-up, or leave it unblended and unsymmetrical. Use pretty skin type pinks on your face. Use some glitter too. Pluck or wax your eyebrows.
Before you put on that special shade of lipstick, try this tip: Take a damp washcloth and rub it back and forth on you lips. This takes off any dead skin and freshens up your skin. Do not rub too hard though, as that can make you lips sore.
Brush your teeth; cheerleaders need to smile, therefore, they need clean teeth. If you want you teeth whiter, try baking soda or whitening strips.
Make sure that your nails are not painted and are clean cut.

, Use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser or a soft foam nail file; these work well well on shoes to clean off dirt and other marks. Or, try putting the shoes in the dryer or washer. Bleach can also work but it is a risky this to work with.


Tuck your shoelaces in, especially if you have long ones.

, While you compete, you can't wear any jewelry that your team doesn't. It can also be dangerous if it gets caught or scratches someone. And your team gets judged on how they look, matching wise, and that would get points off your routine.

If you are a beginner, try stepping into your stunt first.,
If you are intermediate or advanced, you can jump into your stunt.,
To come down from your stunt, either grab your frontspotter's hands(if you have one) or your bases' hands(they will have to let go with one hand and rest your foot on their shoulder, so stay locked!),
You have completed a stunt, congratulations!

,
To take it a step further, you can ""cradle"" down from your stunt instead.",How to Improve Your Cheerleading Flying," Your bases should be on either side of you, a few inches in front, and your backspottter should be directly behind you, holding your waist tightly.


Step each foot into your bases' hands. The moment both your feet are in their hands, stand up straight. Try not to look down or else you will lose your balance.






Tighten every muscle in your body: Your legs and butt mostly.






Look straight ahead or up; never look down, you will fall. Your backspotter should be gripping your ankles tightly, and your bases should be gripping your feet.






Keep a counting rhythm: 1-2-step3 (your dominant foot)-step4(your less dominant foot)-straighten5-6-7-8.

,, Stay locked as your bases and backspotter throw you up, and do a sort of pike in midair while putting your hands up in goalposts against your ears. throw your arms down in a sort of vertical right angle, and your bases will catch your legs and back, and your backspotter will catch your handle-like arms.

Stretch before and after you do a workout, including jumps.,
Stretch.,
Know the types of jumps.,
Practice jump drills.,
Stay in shape.,
Use weights.",How to Improve Cheer Jumps," Do jumps over a soft surface and always wear sneakers or other gym appropriate shoes.;
, Always stretch before jumping and during any other free time. You can even stretch while you watch TV. The following are only a few of many exercises that will help stretch the important muscles used for jumping:

Sitting Straddle: Sit on the floor with your legs out in the shape of a ""V"" as far as possible. First, lean to your left foot and grab around the foot. You should feel it stretching your side and the back muscles of your thigh. Then, switch to the right side. Finally lean down the middle by pushing your hands forward as far as possible without having the legs or feet turn inwards.






Sitting Toe touch: Sit on the floor with your legs beside you. Point your toes and lean to each side holding for about 10 seconds. Grab your feet if possible and pull your head to your knees. Flex your feet so that your toes point up and stretch side to side again. The stretch will be in the back of your calves (the back of the bottom part of your legs).






Sitting Pike: Sit on the floor with your legs stretched in front of you, knees extended outwards, and your feet touching each other. Stretch in front of you holding for 10 seconds.. Lean forward as far as possible, getting your face close your feet. Then, still keeping your feet together, try holding it longer, or for another 10 seconds.







, As a main part of cheerleading, jumps should be practiced as often as possible. Great jumps make a better cheerleader. Jumps are always done in eight counts. Some popular jumps include the t-jump, spread eagle, hurdler- front and side, shushunova, around the world, double hook, and double 9. Here are a few examples of how to do important jumps:


Toe-Touch. Begin with feet shoulder width apart and hands on your hips. Hold this position for ""5,6,7,8"". On ""1"", snap your feet together and put your arms up in a tight V. On ""2"", swing your arms down so that they cross each other in front of you, and bend your knees. When your arms are fully crossed your knees should be in a deep bend. As you swing your arms out, begin to jump up. Hit the full toe-touch on ""3"". It should be in the same position as the ""toe-touch stretch"". Put your arms in a ""T"". Come down on ""4"" with hands at your side, feet together, and knees bent. Snap back out to the starting position and hold for ""5,6,7,8"". This allows you to do many jumps over again.







Pike. Begin in the ""prep position"" (feet shoulder width apart and hands on your hips). Hold for ""5,6,7,8"". On ""1"", turn to either the left or the right and put your arms straight up next to your ears. On ""2"", swing your arms down and out as far as possible while bending your knees and jump. On ""3"", hit the jump with the same position as the ""pike stretch"". With your hands in a fists, reach for your toes. Make sure to bring your feet up as high as possible. Come down and land on ""4"". Pop back to ""prep position"" facing forward again for ""5,6,7,8"".







Herkie-left and right. Begin in the ""prep position"" for ""5,6,7,8"". On ""1"", hit the ""V"" position with your arms and snap your feet together. On ""2"", swing down like you would with the ""toe-touch"". On ""3"", hit a ""T"" with your arms. Your right leg should be out as if in a ""toe-touch"", but your left leg should be bent at the knee so that your foot is behind you as if it is resting on a table. On ""4"", snap down and land. Pop back to ""prep position"" and hold ""5,6,7,8"". You can also do this with your left leg out and your right bent.







, Work the jumps above into various practice routines.


Individual Drill: Start with 3 jumps then build up to 5 or more in a row. For example, do 2 t-jumps followed by 3 toe touches







Forearm Lifts: get into partners, and now get your partner to hold his/her arms in front of them, at a right angle, as if holding a tray, and then place your hands on your partners forearms and jump

Lifts: Get into partners, partner number one should stand behind partner number 2 and hold on to their waist as they jump, assisting the lift of the jump







Team practice: Get into lines and jump one after the other.

, Jumps require muscle strength and flexibility, thus you should always be working to strengthen your muscles.

Do V Snap Ups, V Sits, and leg pulses for good hip flexor strength. Focus on both legs together and individual legs.






Sit on the floor with legs in straddle position. Lift your legs up one at a time and place them back down. Keep your hands between your legs on the floor. Repeat at least ten times on each leg and then again 10 times with both legs together.
Do ab crunches. This will strengthen your abs to further help your jumping technique.






Cheerleading can be dehydrating. Drink plenty of water and get plenty of sleep.







, Put on ankle weights. These will make it harder to do your jumps and will work your leg muscles so when you take them off your jumps are better.


Repeatedly do each jump with weights.
Take off the weights and do the jumps again. Look in a mirror while jumping to see how they improve. Also, when doing toe touches, make sure to have your knees pointed back and your hips open.

"
Assess your spirit level.,
If the teams you cheer for (usually basketball and football) outright suck, you need to understand that not everyone can be on top of their game all the time.,
To be more peppy for games, and energetic for practices, make sure you eat a good breakfast.,
Practice!,
Overact Many girls do not show much pep because they are afraid of looking dumb.,
During games, yell chants and cheers.",How to Have Spirit in Cheerleading," Many people tend to think that cheerleaders absolutely love the school and the team, but that is not always true. If you dislike your school (but love cheering), then the first step to having more pep and spirit in cheerleading is to love your school. And how exactly do you do that? Here are some examples;

Make a list of about 20 (or more) things you love about not only your high/middle school, but about being in high school in general. It can be little things, like how you love the full sized lockers versus the smaller, half lockers you had in middle school. Or how you love the size of the school, because everyone is so close, its like a second (rather 3rd if you consider your squad second!) family. Make a mental note of the list or bring it with you to practices and games, and read it when ever you feel down, or dreading the event. Just simply liking your school can raise pep levels to new heights.



 


If you do already enjoy not only attending your school, but also school in general, but the fault is with the teams you cheer, make a list of the reasons why you don't like the team. You may find that your reasons for disliking the team are not because of the team as a whole. Maybe you got into an argument with one of the players, or one of the players is an old ex, and because of your dislike of them, you penalize the whole team, when really its just that one person. If you find that this is the case, remind yourself every time you start dreading going to a game that it's just one person, and the whole team isn't like that.;
, If the losing streak seems to be a running tradition at your school, you can talk to the coach of teams about how its definitely discouraging the cheerleaders. Cheerleaders are meant to cheer on the team, no matter how they're doing, but constantly yelling ""Defense!"" and encouraging a consistently losing team is tiring.

, It's a myth that loading up on carbs right before any game will make you preform better, because actually, it just gives you more energy for a short while. But what happens when that energetic high runs out? You crash and do a lot worse, and being lethargic and lazy are two things that do not equate to being spirited for cheerleading.


Some suggest eating complex carbs the night before a big game, or competition. Complex carbs include spaghetti, potato dishes, and other starches- in other words, most grains.
From personal experience, some coaches suggest ""hydro-loading""- the healthy, albeit long, practice of drinking water until the urine is clear. Obviously, do not drink gallons upon gallons of water, and hold your pee, but do make sure to drink a lot of water during the day. Many say 6-8 cups, but actually you need to drink about half of your body weight.
1 hour or less before competition/game:






fruit or vegetable juice such as orange, tomato, or V-8
fresh fruit such as apples, watermelon, peaches, grapes, bananas, or oranges
Energy gels
up to 1 1/2 cups of a sports drink.
Stretches


2 to 3 hours before competition/game:

fresh fruit
fruit or vegetable juices
bread, bagels
low-fat yogurt
sports drink


3 to 4 hours before competition/game:

fresh fruit
fruit or vegetable juices
bread, bagels
pasta with tomato sauce
baked potatoes
energy bar
cereal with low-fat milk
low-fat yogurt
toast/bread with limited peanut butter, lean meat, or low-fat cheese
30 oz of a sports drink



, If you don't show much spirit in cheerleading because you are not confident in your skills, practice, practice, practice! If you think your heel-stretches/scales are not as high as they could be, stretch! If you think your motions need to be sharper and tighter, practice in front of a mirror. If your having trouble with the dance, download the song off of iTunes or burn it to a CD, and dance until you can do it (flawlessly) in your sleep. If you don't think you can do it, or you're not good at it, attending games and cheering will be dreadful for you, and because your wishing you where else where, not much spirit and enthusiasm will come from you.

, While it may feel unnatural and ultimately humiliating to make the ever famed facials (sticking out your tongue, winking,raising your brows, etc...), do them with confidence and enthusiasm. It's better to be known as the hyper, peppy girl rather than the worst cheerleader- someone who is supposed to transfer happiness and spirit to the team and crowd- ever.


Motions should be tight, and sharp. It may feel unnatural, but they are not supposed to be loose and floppy. The dancing portion of cheerleading is the less restrictive, more loose portion.







, Do motions and dances along with them. Adding in some theatrical moments would make it humorous to watch for the crowd, and fun for you and the team to do. Yell with your chest voice, not your high pitch, screaming ""OMG, a spider!"" voice.

Practice at least a split.,
Be confident.,
Smile and have a good attitude.,
Have good form.,
Be clean.,
Be loud.,
Know some tumbling.,
Work on your jumps.,
Have spirit.",How to Get on the Cheerleading Squad Even if You Can't Do Jumps," You may not be able to do a good jump but at least try to be flexible. You should do the following stretches twice a day: Pike, straddle (right, left, center), butterfly, lunge, floor lunge, split (right, left, center), split against a wall, bridge, shoulder and arm stretches, etc. You should be able to do an over split and back bend.;
, Just because you can't do the jumps doesn't mean you have to pout about it! Raise your self esteem so you can be a better you.

, One of the purposes of a cheerleader is to be positive and happy and have fun and cheer for your team. The crowd is influenced by your attitude and so are the players! Never frown during tryouts and keep a smile on your face even if the other girls aren't.

, They mainly judge you on your form because they know you can work on the jumps, and don't forget to be sharp on your dances and cheers. Whenever you practice, tense up the muscles in your arms and legs when practicing the moves. Make them snappy and clean.

, The way you dress also shows your personality. If you dress sloppily then they will think you don't take this seriously, but if you dress cleanly then they'll know you want this! For tryouts, wear a club or cheer shirt, dance shorts, white cheer shoes with white ankle socks, your hair in a ponytail with a bow, and a little tattoo on your cheek or hand that has your school name or mascot.

, Let them hear you and you'll stick out. Even when people are being quiet, make sure that you are the loudest. You should be loud and proud. Don't sing the cheers, speak them loudly. Remember, the audience should hear you a football field away.

, If you can't do any jumps, you have to do tumbling. Usually you don't have to do tumbling, but it can count as extra points. So, you should know how to do a back bend, cartwheel, round off, handstand, and possibly walking on your hands and a back handspring. Usually if you are in middle school and you do a back handspring, you have landed a spot on the team if you can also do some other tumbling, a split, cheer well, and jump okay.

, Even if you can't execute the jump, you can at least try. Do straddle leg lifts, squat jumps, toe raises, squats, and splits. If you are slightly overweight, lose the extra flab. Practice on a trampoline, while jumping into your pool, or by using bedposts to help you jump higher in the air. At least be able to do a tuck jump, which is like a squat jump except you tuck your knees into your chest and bring your arms in a semicircle underneath your legs.

, That is the whole propose of cheerleading! Wear your school colors, participate in pep rallies, and love your school!"

'B'-Balance: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your shooting foot slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot.,
'First E'-Eyes: Choose a target - it could be the front of the rim, the centre of the hoop, or the basket as a whole, and focus only on that.,
'Second E'-Elbow: Cock your elbow back to a 90° angle and look at the back of your wrist.,
'F'-Flick or Follow-through: Straighten your elbow and release the ball by flicking your wrist, which gives the ball some backspin.",How to Put Some B.E.E.F.

Warm up the ball.,
Take advantage of the warranty for balls under a year old.,
Pump the ball as normal.",How to Pump a Spalding Neverflat Basketball1," The Neverflat ball won't lose as much air as a normal basketball, but it can still deflate a little in cold weather. If you stored it outside or in a cold garage and it feels flat, dribble it until it warms up., Spalding basketballs are covered by a limited warranty for one year after purchase.Pumping a Neverflat ball will break the warranty.If the ball went flat and there's no obvious sign of damage, tell Spalding about the defect to request a refund or replacement. There are two ways to do this:


Call 1–800–SPALDING (USA phone number) and ask for a return authorization.
Send the basketball and the sales slip to Spalding Consumer Relations / One Fruit of the Loom Drive / Bowling Green, KY 42103. Include your name, address, telephone number, and description of defect.

, If the warranty has expired or doesn't apply, you can pump a Neverflat basketball just like any other basketball. Despite the name, all Neverflat balls will need pumping occasionally, especially after the first year. If you're not sure how to inflate a basketball, keep reading.

"
"
Choose a small pump.,
Attach the air pump needle.,
Push up the basketball cap.,
Insert the needle into the hole.,
Pump the ball two or three times.,
Check the pressure gauge.,
Test buoyancy.,
Pump or let out air to adjust.",How to Pump a Spalding Neverflat Basketball2," Anything designed for basketballs or bicycles will work fine. High pressure pumps designed for car tires are not recommended. They give less control over the pressure and can damage your basketball.

, This needle fits onto the end of the air pump, allowing you to fit it to the tiny hole in the basketball. It should come with the air pump.

, Look for a round, black rubber cap on the basketball. Push the cap up enough that you can bend it aside, exposing the hole underneath.


This will release air and break the one-year warranty on Neverflat basketballs.

, Screw the needle in until it is firmly attached. Be careful, as you may accidentally puncture the basketball if too much force is used in the wrong place. Young children should ask an adult for help to avoid injury from needles or an exploding ball.


If you're having trouble, wet the needle end with a little saliva or glycerin.
If you're using a bicycle pump, find the plastic tab on the end of the tube and pinch it closed.

, At this stage, it's better to pump it too little than too much. Take the needle out of the ball quickly to prevent air from escaping.


Never continue without removing the needle. The next step can send the needle flying out, which could injure someone.
If using a bicycle pump, pull the plastic tab to reinflate it before you remove the needle.

, Neverflat basketballs should be inflated to about 8 psi. If your pump has a gauge, keep pumping until it reaches this level. Otherwise, keep reading to find out how to test it yourself.

, Press the ball gently. If it feels about right, press as hard as you can and see how much it sinks. Ideally, the ball should compress about 1/5 inches (5.5 mm). If you can only compress it 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) or less, the ball could explode when thrown.


For another test, stand on the court and hold the basketball above your head. Drop the ball. It should bounce back to your hip, or to your elbow (once you've lowered your arm). Too high a bounce is just as bad as too low.

, Keep pumping until the ball responds correctly to your test. If the ball is too hard, bend the valve to let out some air. When you're done, just withdraw the needle. The cap should fall back on its own.

Your primary source of energy comes in the form of carbohydrates. The meals you consume approximately 12 to 15 hours before a basketball game should be high in carbs, which will replenish your body’s store of carbohydrates, and low in fat, so that your meal is easily digested.


The night before a game, consume a high-carb, low-fat dinner. Meal options include lean meat (fish or chicken), potatoes, pasta with sauce, and/or bread.
The morning of your game, eat a basic, filling breakfast. Your breakfast could consist of bagels, cereal with low-fat milk, whole fruit, pancakes, waffles, and/or oatmeal.
The afternoon before your game, eat a light lunch. This meal could consist of low-fat sandwiches made with lean meats and whole-grain bread, pasta with sauce, salad, and/or whole fruits.
Do not try a new food before a game—it may upset your stomach. Instead, try to eat the same meals before each game.;
, Throughout a basketball practice and game, your body sweats, which decreases its store of water. In order to perform at the top of your game, you need to rehydrate your body. Instead of grabbing a drink only when you are thirsty, you should try to drink water consistently throughout the day.


As an athlete, you should strive to drink 2 liters, or half a gallon, of water everyday.You should also drink an additional 500 ml, or 16.9 fl ounces, of water per every hour of exercise., Before you go to bed, gather and pack everything you will need for the basketball game. Pack your basketball uniform, warm-ups, shoes, and socks. Include any undergarments, braces, and sports pads you may need for the game in the bag. Add a water bottle, a sports drink, and a pre-game snack to your sports bag., As a player, it is your responsibility to arrive at the site of the game on time. In addition to knowing when and where the game is being played, you also need to figure out how you are getting to the site. When you know these details in advance, you can make transportation arrangements earlier. If you do not know when and where your basketball game is being played, ask your coach or teammate for these details or look up this information.


It is not your coach’s responsibility to make sure you know when and where the game is being played. If you do not know, don’t wait for someone to tell you—ask someone. If you can’t get ahold of a coach or teammate, look on your school or club’s website.
When you know these details in advance, you ask off of work in advance or let your teachers know you will be missing their class., In order to perform at the highest level possible, you need to get a great night’s sleep before a basketball game (and every practice). On the night before a game, allocate at least 8 to 9 hours for sleep. This may require you to plan ahead.


If you have a big test or assignment for school, start studying for it or working on it earlier in the week so you’re not up late cramming or doing homework the night before a game. Write all of your assignments and test dates down in your planner. Check your planner everyday to ensure that your are staying on track or ahead in school.
If you have chores and other responsibilities at home, complete them early and efficiently so that you can get to sleep on time.
Once you are in bed for the night, put away your phone, computer, and tablet., When you arrive at the gym, find your coach and let them know that you are present. This prevents your coach from wondering if they can add you to the starting-line up and/or include you in their strategy for the game. If you appear out of nowhere, your coach may have rightly assumed that you were not coming to the game.


Forgetting to check in with the coach may result in you sitting the bench or getting less playing time than normal.
It is your responsibility to find the coach, not the coach’s responsibility to find you.
If you are running late, text or call your coach., After checking-in with your coach, head to the locker room. Remove your street clothes, shoes, and any banned jewelry and place them in your sports bag. Put on your undergarments and sports pads, followed by your uniform, warm-ups, socks, braces, and shoes.


If you have any injuries that require special treatment, set up a time to visit the athletic trainer.
Place all of your valuables and your gym bag in a locked locker., Throughout the game, your body will sweat and become dehydrated. In order to replenish your body’s stores of water, you need to drink water throughout the game. Grab an empty water bottle and fill it up at the drinking fountain or bring a bottle of water from home.


Throughout the basketball game, try to drink between 4 to 8 ounces of water every 15 minutes.
You can alternate between drinking water and a sports drink. Sports drinks provide your body with much needed electrolytes., Prior to taking the floor to warm-up, most coaches will hold a team meeting in the locker room. Coaches use this meeting to discuss the game plan. They also use this time to get players focused and to remind them of what makes the team successful.


During this meeting, your coach might go over plays, the starting-line up, and/or substitution patterns.
In order to motivate and focus players, your coach may reminisce about what has made your team successful in the past., While it is essential that players are physically ready to play a basketball games, it is also important that players are mentally prepared to compete. Since everyone struggles in different ways, there is no “right” way to mentally prepare for a basketball game. General strategies, which you may adopt and adapt to meet your needs, include:


Relax your mind to relax your body. When your mind's at ease, your body is less tense. You can use meditation to clear your mind of negative and/or stressful thoughts. Before a game, find a quiet place to sit. Once comfortable, close your eyes and take the next 10 to 20 minutes to just focus on breathing in and out. As thoughts come into your head, acknowledge them and then let them pass.
Stop overthinking. Don’t focus on the mechanics of shooting a basketball during your game—just shoot it! You can work to improve your shot during practice.
Stop being afraid of failure. Fear leads to anxiety, which causes our bodies to tense up and our minds to second guess every decision. Instead of focusing on potential failures, practice radical acceptance—acknowledge that everyone, even professional basketball players, miss shots and plays.
Get in your “zone.” Your “zone” is your sweet spot, where everything just feels right. In order to enter your zone, you must clear your head and focus on the task at hand. This is easier to achieve if you are on top of your schoolwork, tasks at work, and or responsibilities at home. When you manage your time well, you can just focus on the game instead of thinking about everything you have to get done when the final buzzer sounds., A light jog, followed by some stretching, will prepare your body for the physical exertion to come. This portion of the warm-up may be done as a team or independently. You can jog and stretch in an auxiliary gym or hallways.


Jog for 5 to 10 minutes. During the jog, you should only break a little sweat.
Once your muscles are loose from the jog, stretch them out. Basic stretches include:

Wall Lat Stretch: Stand 2 to 3 feet in front of a wall. Place your hands on the wall and lean forward. Step your right foot approximately 1 foot away from the wall and drop your head between your hands. Bring your right foot forward and pick up your head. Repeat on the left side.


Hamstring Rocker. Stand with your legs in a split stance (one foot in front of the other). Bend forwards and place one hand on each side of the front foot. Straighten your front leg as you lift up your hips. Bend your front leg as you drive your hips towards the ground. Repeat 10 times on each leg., Just prior to taking the court, you and your teammates should complete a series of dynamic warm-ups. Dynamic warm-up exercises are designed to elevate your body temperature and keep your body loose. They are done across the gym floor or hallway with little rest in-between each exercise. Examples of dynamic warm-ups include:


High knees: As you walk, run, or skip across the floor, lift your knees up and towards your chest. Do not bend or lean forwards at the hips.
Butt Kicks: As you walk, run, or skip across the floor, quickly flex your knees and try to pull your heels up towards your bottom.
Defensive slides: Assume your defensive stance—knees bent, bottom out, chest forwards, and arms up—and slide across the floor., After running onto the court with your team, your coach and assistant coaches will oversee a series of warm-up drills and shooting exercises. These drills and exercises are selected by the coach and completed as a team. They may include:


Offensive or defensive drills.
Ball handling exercises (for point guards)
Shooting drills, including lay-ups, free throws, three-pointers, and field-goals., Once the warm-up is complete, you and your teammates may head over to the bench or into the locker rooms. When you are all gathered in a huddle, your coach will provide you with final instructions and notify you of any changes to the game strategy. Your coach may also provide your team with a few inspiring words, after which all the players may place their hands in the center of the huddle and yell and team cheer.


Make sure to listen to all of your coach’s instructions.
Don’t argue with your coach."

Before your opponents inbound the basketball, identify who exactly it is you are to defend.,
Identify whether your match up is right-handed or left-handed.,
Know how much time remains and always keep it in the back of your mind!,
Generally, play an arms length away, one hand high to defend the shot another low to swipe at the ball or deflect a pass.,
If he cocks back to shoot the ball, contest the shot with your hand opposite of the shooter.,
When you are positive the shot is being taken, jump to meet the ball and swat it to a place where you can get it, or, if you must, out of bounds.

",How to Play Tight Perimeter Defense in Basketball,";
, This is key.

, Knowing how much time is left on the clock allows you to better know when to aggressively go for a block attempt and when to stay grounded.
If there is enough time and your player is dribbling, you may attempt a steal, but use caution! A foul, unless you have one to give, is not a good idea in this situation. Try to swipe at the ball as it hits his hand and is headed back towards the floor. One of the best times to try to go for a steal is when the offensive player is crossing over. You could also miss the steal completely, and he would be able to get by you easily. Also notice the player's attention, if it's on you or his team.

, Too close and you're more prone to be driven on, too far and the offensive player could just pull up for a shot.

, For example, if the player is left-handed, put up your right hand, right-handed, left hand.
You do not always have to go for the block while playing perimeter defense, especially when your unsure if they are really shooting. Sometimes it is better to just close out on the shooter and give he or she the least amount of room possible to get off the shot without fouling. This is done by stepping up to them when shoot and getting as tall as possible, with your hands straight up or you can use your hands to cover the shooters eyes.

Make sure that you and your teammates know who you are guarding.,
Stay low.,
Be aware of the ball.,
Keep your eye on your man's belly button.,
First you must extend your arm to give space between you and the person with the ball so he doesn't blow you by and and go for a lay-up.",How to Play Good Defense for Basketball," You don't want to leave anyone on the team open. Point and yell ""I've got 33"" for example.;
, You don't have to overdo it, just keep your knees bend and be ready to move if the person you're defending tries to run away. As long as you aren't too low you'll be faster than him every time.

, If the person you're guarding has the ball, keep one hand above the ball and one hand on the side. Your hands don't need to touch the ball, or even be right next to it. Just keep them near it. If he goes right, keep your left hand on the side, and right hand above. Reverse this if he goes left.


Let's say your man puts the ball above his head. This is what we call the ""Dork Position"". To get the ball away from him, put your hand on your his stomach, so he has no way to bring it down. Then, reach up and slap the ball out of his hands. Sprint after it, and grab it. Easy turnover.
If your man tries to drive, you can stop him by 'bumping the drive'. You do this by put most of your weight on the foot opposite of the way your man is trying to drive. Then push off, hard. you will end up in the path of your man. Now, put your chest out and bump him. Not to hard,but hard enough to displace him.

, While he can fake moves with nearly every other part of his body, he can't fake with his belly button.

Man to man in the open and Post defense.,
First you must develop the proper defensive stance, find out if your opponent is right handed or left handed and try to place one foot and one arm forward to try to force him to his weak side.,
You will then slide with him to wherever he goes all the while being aware of when he crosses over because that is your time to steal the ball.

Play “baseketball.” Basketball is like a shooting drill plus baseball scoring and trash talking.",How to Play Basketball," All you need to play basketball is a ball of the appropriate size and a net that it fits through, set at a challenging-enough height. The specific requirements for regulation basketball are included below, but the history of basketball is the history of making do with what you have. The first basketball hoop was a peach crate nailed to a railing. Use empty boxes, soccer balls, or whatever is available if you don’t have access to a hoop.Basketballs are typically available in four sizes: youth, intermediate, and adult sizes for people of varying sexes. Made of rubber materials and synthetic leather, basketballs are widely available at sporting goods stores. Find a ball that you can comfortably shoot without wobbling your wrist. At most gyms, youth centers, and other athletic places, you can borrow basketballs to practice.
Regulation hoops are ten feet high and 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter, typically backed with a plexiglass board off which players may bounce shots. While full-court basketball is played with two hoops, one at each end of a 94-foot long court, it’s only necessary to have one hoop to play a half-court pick-up game, or to shoot around with friends.;
, For a full-court game, basketball is played by two teams of five players each. While it's also common to play half-court ball with teams of three, however many people you've got playing, it's important to have an even number of players on each team. Alternate basketball games for uneven numbers are included in the last section.

, In basketball, an offensive player can score between one and three points with a shot, depending on where the shot is taken on the floor.Extending in a half-circle, about 20 feet (6.1 m) from the hoop on most courts, should be the ""three-point line,"" beyond which shots are worth an extra point. Inside that arc, all shots are worth two points.
Foul shots are worth one point each and are taken from the free-throw line, which is 15 feet (4.6 m) from the hoop. Players will be awarded between one and three free throws if they are fouled during a shooting attempt, or fouled after the other team has accumulated too many fouls.

, When you have the ball, you have to either be stationary, with one foot planted on the floor to pivot from, or you have to be dribbling the ball, bouncing it up and down on the floor. When you're planted, you can pivot around on one foot, but that foot has to remain planted if you're not dribbling. You can still jump to shoot or pass, but when you come back down you need to have gotten rid of the ball.


When you start dribbling, you must dribble constantly as you move, until you pass, shoot, or stop dribbling to plant on your pivot foot. If you stop dribbling, you cannot re-start dribbling, which is a foul called a ""double-dribble."" It's also important to avoid ""over/under"" dribbles, in which you pick up the ball from underneath and turn it over to dribble it down. Learn to dribble properly in the following section.
If you're driving in to shoot, you can pick up the ball and take two steps without dribbling before you shoot or pass. More than two steps will result in a traveling violation. If you've been dribbling and you stop, you cannot take two steps.

, If you've got control of the ball on offense, you need to crouch in a low position to guard and protect the ball while you dribble. In a proper dribbling stance, you should be crouched, knees flexed and shoulder-width apart, standing on the balls of your feet.


As you're learning, bounce the ball constantly with each hand, switching back and forth between your left and your right to get a feel for handling with both of your hands, staying crouched, and point your opposite hip toward the basket., To control the ball properly and control is securely, it's important to dribble with your fingertips, not the palm of your hand. When beginners first touch the basketball, it's common to slap or chop at it with the palm of the hand, rather than gripping and pushing with the fingertips. With some practice, you'll be able to get a good feel for how much force to put on the ball to get it to pop right back to your hand.


Just start bouncing the ball, standing still at first. Flex your wrist to bounce the ball and try to keep your elbow in to your hip and move your elbow as little as possible. Like many things, dribbling should be all in the wrist.
Make sure the ball is inflated to the proper specs, or it’ll be difficult to bounce up properly. Follow the directions on the ball you've got and add a little air, if necessary.

, It's difficult to control the ball at first, and beginning players have a hard time keeping it down and controlled without looking at it constantly. But practice dribbling as low to the ground as is comfortable. Dribbles that come all the way up to your chest are easy for defenders to pick off. Try to keep it at your waist, no higher.

, If there's one thing coaches will harp on when you're learning to ball, it's this. As you're learning to play, it's critical to keep your head up and look around, instead of looking straight down at the ball as you bounce it. Good ball players can see their teammates, opponents, and the hoop at the same time. Practice dribbling without looking at the ball and your skills will improve immensely. It's hard to know where to go and where to pass when you've got your eyes locked on your sneakers.


Staying low will give you less opportunity to make a bad dribble and lose control of the ball. Aside from being more difficult to swipe, it'll also be more difficult for you to screw up your dribble.

, Basketball isn't played from a standing position most of the time, so it's important to start dribbling on the move. Start by walking as you dribble, at a comfortable lope. When you're comfortable dribbling and walking, start jogging, and eventually start trying to do short sprints while you dribble. Don't worry about going super-fast, just worry about controlling the ball.


Set up some cones or chairs in the driveway and practice dribbling around them in figure-8s, going as quick as you can, but focusing on controlling the ball. Keep it low, keep your head up, and control the ball as you dribble quickly.

, When you start learning to dribble, it'll be most comfortable to dribble with your dominant hand, the hand that you use to write. Unless you want to always go to one side, though–which will make you a very predictable ball player–you'll need to diversify your ball-handling skills.


Practice doing drills with your dominant hand to learn the fundamentals, but spend a part of each dribbling session dribbling with your weak hand, too. Try the same drills, going around chairs, walking and dribbling, then eventually running. Great ball players are just as good from both sides.

, Don't listen to the ball hogs: a great pass is always better than a mediocre shot. Learning to make crisp and accurate passes is an essential part of the basketball game. You should get comfortable making passes that go straight to your teammate without making them move for it.


Make chest passes. Take the ball on either side, in both hands, as if you were trying to squeeze the air out of it. Bring it in to your chest, then flick both hands outward to pass the ball to a teammate standing a comfortable distance away, without letting the ball touch the ground. Both wrists should flick out, away from you, as if you were swimming the breast-stroke.
Make bounce passes. Hold the ball in the same way, as if you were trying to squeeze it. About halfway between you and your teammate, bounce the ball into the ground and to the other player. Practice making the pass so it only bounces once and comes up comfortably to your teammate's chest. Practice one-handed and two-handed bounce passes.
For a throw-in (out of bounds pass) throw it either over your head or bounce pass. In most events, pass to a point guard behind the line.

, Every time you want to shoot, it's important to ""square up,"" which means you need to point both sets of toes so they're pointing straight at the hoop, then align your hips so you're aiming your front-side parallel with the hoop. Your shots will be more accurate when you square up, if you're following the correct fundamental techniques for shooting.


When you're getting ready to take a shot, stop dribbling and take the ball in both hands, and square up to the hoop. Practice your pick-up step, in which you take one last dribble and turn your hips in one fluid motion.

, Your shooting hand is your dominant hand, the hand you write with and the hand it feels most comfortable to dribble with. Keep your shooting elbow in tight to your hip, and keep the ball balanced on your finger-tips on the bottom of the basketball. Bring it up even with your chin and bend your knees, crouching.


Your power will come with your shooting hand, but you can stabilize the ball and balance it using your other hand. Touch the ball gently with your other hand on the side of the ball. The whole power from the shot should be coming from your other hand, though.
To practice your shot motion, lay on the ground with the ball and hold the ball straight up with your shooting hand. Practice rolling the ball straight up into the air a few inches with backspin, coming straight back down into your hand.

, When you've got the ball in the proper shooting position, extend your shooting elbow straight up and forward, rolling your wrist forward, as if you were trying to reach into a cookie jar on a high shelf. Continue extending your shooting arm, up and out, toward the hoop. Let the ball pop forward when your arm extends to the end, rolling backward as you release it. Keep following through with your hand, putting it in the cookie jar, after you've released the ball.

, To get extra power from your shot, crouch down and pop up with your legs as you shoot. When your arm gets to the highest point, you should jump slightly, extending your legs and putting some extra power under the shot with your jump.


Don't jump forward, toward the hoop, jump straight up. This is a common mistake with beginners. You want to jump straight up in the air and arc the ball towards its destination, not launch it forward.
Free-throws are generally taken without jumping, and you don't have to jump to shoot. However, it's difficult to get the ball into the hoop using arm strength alone, so most shots taken will be ""jump shots.""

, Most of your first couple of shots will probably clang off the rim or the backboard loudly. Not a problem! Shooting a ball into a hoop that high isn't easy, and it takes a lot of practice. It can be difficult to know exactly where to aim: the red square on the backboard? The top of the hoop? It can be helpful for some beginners to visualize a small coin balancing on the front lip of the rim, and that what you're trying to do is knock it off with your shot.


Most beginners aim too high, and this exercise trains the eye to lower the ""sight picture"" of the shot, aiming more at the rim. If your shots tend to be too low, change the exercise so that you're aiming at the back of the rim, where it connects to the backboard. This will do more to correct your aim.

, Lay-ups are an important part of playing basketball and a great fundamental drill to learn. Good basketball players should have lay-ups locked down so well they'll never miss one in a game situation. it should be an easy two points.


Start at the corner of the free-throw line on your dominant side. Dribble in toward the hoop from an angle, and pull up when you get near the second to last line on the side of the lane-marker. About there, take your steps and jump off the foot closest to the hoop (if you're dribbling righty, jump off your left foot). Bounce the ball off the backboard, just at the top corner of the square on the back, and into the hoop.
It helps some beginners to imagine a string tying your dominant hand to your dominant knee, to help remember which foot to jump from. As you drive in, let your shooting hand ""pull"" up the knee on that side, jumping off the other knee.
When you've got the mechanics down, try lay-ups on the opposite side, using your other hand. It'll feel awkward at first, but being able to drive the lane on both sides will make you a much better basketball player.

, Shooting practice is a great way to get a little exercise and have some fun. Just shooting around is one of the best parts of basketball practice, so there's little excuse to skip it. Try shooting from all around the court, inside the key, from different angles. Dribble around while you shoot, so you're killing two birds with one stone. Practice shooting when you're tired, and when you're fresh.


Practice shooting free throws. Good basketball players should be able to make free throws almost automatic. Take them over and over again until you can memorize the shooting motion and commit it to muscle memory.
Don't waste valuable practice time shooting half-court hail-marys or NBA-distance three-pointers. Get your fundamentals down and practice knocking back 10 in a row inside they key, before you work on making miracles.

, When you're playing defense, your goal is to keep your opponents from scoring. That means you need to disrupt passes, try to steal the ball if possible, and block shots. It's your job to be annoying, sticky, and disruptive to the other team's ability to pass and score points.


Most teams will play ""man-to-man"" defense, which usually means that you'll be matched to another player on the opposing team, who you'll guard for the rest of the game. This is, in most cases, the player who also plays your position.
In more advanced basketball, sometimes a ""zone"" defense is used, in which you'll be given an area of the court to guard, and you'll pick up any player who moves into it. Think of it like an imaginary bubble that you're trying to protect.

, Basketball isn't all about offense, and your game needs to be fluid on both sides of the ball. To learn to play sticky defense, learn to get low and get wide. Crouch, with your feet more than shoulder-width apart and put your arms straight out at your sides, extending and making yourself as wide as possible. Stand on the balls of your feet and make sideways movements to guard the player with the ball. Lock your eyes on the ball.


Aim your lead hip toward the side-line, and your back hip toward the hoop that you're defending. You want to make it as difficult as possible for the person you're guarding to get between you and the hoop, so it's more effective to ""push"" them by aligning your hips properly. With some practice, this will become second-nature.

, The hardest thing about playing defense is staying in your defensive crouch and trying to stick to the offensive player like glue. It's hard to move side-to-side quickly, so the more experienced you are at doing the side-to-side shuffle step, the better a defensive player you'll be. Practice running sideways, taking a big step to the side in one direction, crossing your trailing foot just behind your lead foot, and pushing off again. Then, go back the other way. Practice this until your legs are sore.


Most coaches will train players by dribbling from side to side, and defenders switching their positioning depending on how the offense moves. You can practice this yourself, sliding around laterally in the driveway at home.

, Beginning basketball players often make a common mistake: jumping in the air too much. It's tempting to Try to block your opponent's shot by jumping in the air with your arms outstretched every time it looks like they're going to shoot, but train yourself to keep your feet on the ground as much as possible. It's very easy to pump-fake, going up for a shot and pulling it back down as soon as you take off into the air, leaving you vulnerable and useless as a defender.


Instead, train yourself to stand up very straight when you see your opponent pull it down to shoot, and throw your arms straight up in the air 90 degrees. This will be just as disruptive as a jump, and you'll still be locked down ready to play defense, if need be.

, Another essential part of playing defense is training yourself to grab the rebounds when they come. If your opponents have taken a shot that's failed, don't let them have a second chance for it. Post-up down by the basket and grab the ball when it bounces free. If it's up for grabs, be the one to grab it.

, While charging into a defender will earn you a foul on offense, most fouls that happen are called on the defense. In your attempts to be a disruptive presence on the court, you've also got to learn where the line is and avoid crossing it, or you're going to get a foul called.


Hitting, pushing, or slapping at the arms of opposing players will be a foul every time. Keep your eyes focused on the ball. If you touch the ball, it can't be a foul.
Reaching out and grabbing an opponent will earn you a foul. If you've gotten beat off the ball, you can't cheat by reaching out for the jersey and grabbing it.

, If you're on a basketball team, the major positions have specific rules and roles that govern each job. To improve your skills, it's a good idea to learn the specifics of each position and learn what place you might fill on the court.


Centers are the big players who guard the hoop. The center is usually the tallest and most physical player on the court, whose job revolves around grabbing rebounds, posting up near the hoop for easy tip-in shots, and guarding the hoop on defense. Famous centers include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, and Yao Ming.
Forwards are the second-biggest players on the court, physical enough to play defense and go down low, but dexterous enough to shoot from the outside. Good forwards make excellent cuts and are powerful physical presences in the arc. Famous forwards include Charles Barkley, Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, and LeBron James.
Guards are the architects of the offense. The guards are the players that carry the ball down court, set up plays, and shoot from the outside. The guards typically score the most points and are valued for quickness, accurate passing, and sniper-like shooting. Great Guards include Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Magic Johnson.

, If you want to be a better basketball player, practice your fundamentals. Good dribbling, shooting, and defensive skills are the best way to spend time becoming a good player. Don't practice making behind-the-back passes, or lowering the hoop so you can practice your 360 dunks until you can shoot lay-ups from both hands, 10 times out of 10, and you can make 20 free throws in a row.

, Good basketball teams can keep the ball moving at all times, keeping the defense off balance and on their heels. When your team has the ball, keep your passes quick and crisp to move the ball around and find an open lane to the hoop.


It's a common misconception that basketball needs to be played by virtuosic ballers who all dunk non-stop and hog the ball. Good players pass, selfish players dribble around constantly and lose the ball. Practice your passes.

, One of the most unheralded basketball skills is the rebound. Because lots of shots miss, the ball will end up somewhere unpredictable, bouncing off in one direction or another, sometimes straight up in the air. When the ball goes wild, both teams have a chance for getting control of it, meaning that the ability to out-jump your opponents and grab it is very valuable. When you practice shooting, practice running up on the hoop to grab your own rebound, if possible.


If you play down low, as a forward or a center, practice ""boxing out"" the other players with your backside, muscling them away from the prime real-estate. Get low and stay wide, keep your arms out, and keep your eyes on the ball to give yourself the best chance of grabbing the board.

, As you learn to work as a team, you'll eventually want to start working out plays and formations, most of which involve some kind of pick and roll. Setting a pick means using your body as a barrier, for one of your teammates to run a defender up against. Most of the time, forwards will set picks for guards, though any player may set a pick on offense.

, When your teammate has the ball, you need to move around. Don't just stand there flat-footed waiting for a pass! Make cuts under the hoop, Try to shake your defender, and get open. Give your team supporting options by moving around and staying fluid. Find open space and look for the open shot.

, Legend has it that His Airness himself, Michael Jordan, took games of horse just as seriously as practice.


Horse can be played with any number of players. The first player takes a shot from anywhere on the court. If the shot is made, the next player must make the shot from the same place. If the shot is missed, that player receives the first letter in the word ""pig"" or ""horse"" (the only difference is the number of letters. Each shot results in another letter. The game continues until the losing player has spelled out the entire word.

, 21 is the perfect game to play when you've got an un-even number of players, though it's perfect for three. In 21, every player plays against every other player, in an attempt to be the first to 21 points. Every shot inside the arc is worth one point, and every shot outside is worth two.


After scoring a basket, the player may shoot free-throws (worth one point each) until one is missed. If you score once and then shoot 20 straight free-throws, you win the game.
If you miss a shot and another player tips it in, rebounding and shooting in one fluid motion. Your point-total goes back to zero (if you have less than 15 points) and back down to 15, if you've got between 20 and 15. If the 15th free throw is missed, the player goes back down to zero.

, A good game for practicing free-throws and playing with a big group of people is knockout. All players should line up at the free throw line. The first person in line shoots a free throw. If the shot is missed, the player must grab the rebound and keep shooting the ball until making a shot. As soon as a basket is scored, the player returns to the end of the line. As soon as the first player's ball touches the rim, the second player may shoot. If the second player in line scores a basket before the first player, the first player is knocked out. As soon as one player scores, the next person in line may shoot.

, Invented for the film of the same name by the South Park creators, basketball is basically two teams that alternate trying to score points from three different ""bases,"" while the other team tries to psych them out. Each missed shot is an out.

, This section sets out some basic things that you should be aware of, to help you judge the worthiness of the shoes when shopping.

, The tread on a shoe is the most important thing, be sure to pick a shoe with good court tread. A good court tread will often have zigzags and spirals/circles.

, They are lighter but have less ankle support and stability.
For post players and power players, a high top shoe gives great balance and support but is much heavier. High tops are a good choice to prevent ankle twisting.
For something in between, pick a mid-top shoe.

, Drive hard and fast laterally and brush up against your teammate so that there is no way the defender can go over the pick. His only choice is to go under the pick (leaving you open) or switch (giving the big man an open lane).

,, Pivot towards the basket leaving the switched defender in the dust. Both players need to be quick and remain more or less parallel with at least ten feet of space between them.

Wear shin guards as often as possible.",How to Wear Soccer Socks," Soccer is a very physical game that is often played outdoors. Between the rain and your sweat, your socks may get extremely moist. Many brands have technology to wick away sweat and moisture. Hygiene, odour issues, and performance can all be affected by extreme moisture. Each brand has its own patented technology:Puma technology is referred to as DryCell, CoolPlus Yarn, and CoolCell.
Nike technology is referred to as Dri-Fit.
Adidas technology is referred to as ClimaCool and ClimaLite.
Under Armour technology is referred to as ArmourDry and HeatGear;
, Each player is comfortable with a different sock length. In an official match, you may need to keep your socks at least above your shin guard. In practice you may find that a shorter length allows for more movement. Cold weather may also affect your decision. Here are some helpful descriptions that you may come across:OTC stand for socks that come over the calf. These socks are the longest you can get and usually are worn above your knee.
Crew refers to socks that cover slightly above your calf.
Low-cut refers to socks that are below your calf and slightly above your ankle.
No-show refers to socks that are below your ankle and basically cannot be seen with your shoes on.

, Invest in higher end technology that creates strategic support, cushioning, and comfort for each foot. These socks will usually have an L or R to indicate which foot to place the sock on to., Choose from a variety of technological specifications including: ribbed ankle support, anti-odor technology, mesh ventilation, achilles cushioning, and arch support. For example, you may need achilles cushioning if you have been injured or find that your shoes irritate that area when you perform certain movements., Team administrators and coaches may have the added responsibility of choosing team colours. They should also consider construction and sweat control as these socks will need to be durable and prevent player issues with hygiene and performance. Think about the ratio of synthetic material against natural material before making your final decision.Synthetic materials provide more stretch and can help to manage sweat and moisture. Synthetic materials include polyester and spandex. Natural materials can provide warmth and increased cushioning. These materials include cotton and hemp. A blend of both synthetic and natural materials tend to work best. Also factor in your team’s budget before making the final purchase., If you don’t wear shin guards while practicing, you have a lot more sock options. Crew socks are very popular for training. No-show and low-cut socks are popular for cardio or gym training.You must choose the right size and correct material to meet your comfort and fit needs. Training can be grueling and the wrong fit can lead to painful blisters. Your skin may also get easily irritated by certain material.

, If you are on a team, you will need two pairs for both your home and away soccer kits. If you play in tournaments, you will most likely play in several games in one day or over a weekend. Training may require at least five pairs depending on how often you intend to train during the week. High-level players may train every day or even two or three times in a single day.You can get blisters, athlete’s foot, or severe foot damage if you continuously wear your used socks without cleaning them. Keep in mind that you will also need extra socks for cold weather, if you damage a pair, or if a fresh pair helps with your performance. You may also lose a single sock in the laundry or use specific pairs for specific activities. For example, you may use a special pair for shoot outs.

, Players at every position prefer different socks lengths. If you are a forward and attack aggressively, you may want your socks to be lower or to have added achilles support for your quick movements and ball handling. Goalies may prefer socks that are thicker and longer when playing in colder weather.

, Match play usually requires you to have socks that completely cover your shin guards. You can pull your socks above your knees or fold them under. It is personal preference as long as you abide by the rules of your league.Pulling your socks above your knees may be advantageous in cold weather but may prove cumbersome for some players.

, Some shin guards have built-in ankle protection and require you to attach them to your leg first before you put your socks on over them. If your shin guards don’t have built-in ankle protection, put your socks and cleats on first. As you put your socks over your shin guards, adjust your guards.Younger players usually prefer shin guards with built-in ankle protection.

, Set your shin guard so that it won’t inhibit your performance. You can lock it into place by wrapping tape at both the top and bottom. There are also guard sleeves that are worn under your sock and hug your guard against your leg.Different brands may have guard sleeves together with your shin guards upon purchase while others are sold separately.

, Players may wear two pairs of socks as the double layer may help to prevent blisters. Simply take a second pair of socks and wear it over your shin guard and first pair of socks. The second pair of socks must be the right size to both accommodate the first layer and not be too large that it slides.Socks that fit too small may cut off circulation to your feet; in contrast, socks that are too large may cause your feet to slide within your shoe, which creates blisters.

, Many players take their team issued socks and cut off the foot. Take the remaining top portion of sock and wear it over your prefered type of sock. This way you are able to still represent your team colours while benefiting from the technology of non-team issued socks in your cleat.Ask your league if there are any colour requirements for your socks as some may want both the foot portion and the calf portion to be the same colour for official matches.

, Your shin guards should be both durable and lightweight. They are normally made from a combination of shock-resistant polypropylene, foam and plastic. Ensure that they won’t negatively impact your performance and are able to withstand a hard tackle., Bulky shin guards may negatively affect your performance making it difficult to handle the ball or move. If they feel like ankle weights, they may be too too heavy. You also want to make sure that they aren’t flimsy and solid enough to protect you from a tackle., While beginners may opt for them, detachable ankle socks or lower ankle pads may feel uncomfortable or restrictive for more seasoned players. These pads may also soak up a lot of moisture. Many players prefer shin guards with a velcro strap at both the bottom and top to set it in place., Prevent your shin guard from sliding down your leg or getting loose by wrapping tape around the bottom. Avoid letting your your shin guard push against the top of your foot and ankle. Many shin guards only have velcro for the top so that you can tape the bottom to your preference.Refresh your tape during half time when you’re playing a match to make sure that it stays in place. If you have a team trainer, ask to tape your feet and ankles to help prevent injury.

, Get use to playing with shin guards so that you feel comfortable with them on during an official match. While you may train without them, increase your performance by doing any soccer related movements with them on."

Keep your cleats down.,

Get up quickly.,
Dribble up the field after stealing the ball.,
Locate the ball and chase it down if necessary.",How to Slide Tackle in Soccer," The most common time to slide tackle is when you are chasing the ball beside your opponent. You can tackle from the front, or coming toward them as well, but never tackle from the back. Slide tackling from the back is illegal and will earn you a red card.


If you aren’t keeping pace with them and they start to get ahead of you, don’t slide tackle as you’ll be more likely to get carded for tackling behind. Your opponent should be at most about one step ahead of you, as you’ll make up that ground with the slide.
Slide tackling is only recommended as a last resort if your opponent is getting too close to scoring. If you can get the ball away by other means, you should do that instead of a slide tackle.;
, This is standard advice for most sports. What makes it useful when performing a slide tackle is that if your opponent happens to guess at your intentions, they may try to pull the ball away from you. If you keep your eyes fixed on the ball, you have a better chance of stealing it away during your tackle.You’ll want to perform the slide when the ball is either out away from your opponent, or at least being kicked with the leg closest to you. This will give you the best chance of stealing it.

, A slide tackle is useful for knocking the ball away from your opponent, especially out of bounds if you want to slow the play down. You can also use it as a steal to gain possession of the ball. What you want to do with the ball will slightly affect the technique you use for the tackle.If you simply want to kick the ball away from your opponent, you don’t need to worry as much about your exact foot placement. If you want to hook the ball toward you and keep possession of it, then you need to have good control of how your foot connects with the ball.

, A slide tackle is often good to knock the ball out of bounds, so the middle of the field may not be the best spot. It is also a good idea to have help nearby to assist after you knock the ball clear.You need to know if you are close to the out of bounds or the middle of the field and if you have teammates nearby or if you are alone. Watch the ball but have the rest of the area in your side view so you know what you’re dealing with.
If you intend to steal the ball away but you are too close to the out of bounds line you may lose the ball unintentionally, so be extra careful in this case.

, Each leg has a purpose during the slide tackle, and the leg closest to the other player is there to help you get up quickly after the tackle. As you begin your slide, bend the near leg and tuck it under your butt.Your foot should go slightly out to the side of your body so that you don’t land directly on it.
Immediately after the tackle, your bent leg will help you pop back up onto your feet.

, If it works to position yourself in this way, you should use your dominant leg to connect with the ball because you’ll have more control. You should do this at the same time that you bend your other leg.An effective slide tackle needs to be one fluid motion that includes bending one leg, extending the other, sliding onto the ground and connecting with the ball.

, You don’t want to slide so that your butt is parallel to the ground, rather you want to be angled onto the hip of the extended leg. This positioning gives you better control over your foot., One of the main dangers of the slide tackle is hitting your opponent with the cleats of your shoe. Never make a slide with your cleats up. This will earn you a penalty, and could possibly injure the other player.Pointing the toes of the foot that will make contact with the ball is one of the best ways to avoid having your cleats up. It’s also the best form for hooking the ball, so there are two benefits.

, The only way for a slide tackle to be legal is if your foot hits the ball before it hits the player. Make contact either at the center of the ball or slightly on the top half. If you hit the ball too low it is likely to roll over your foot and cause you to lose control of it.Best case scenario is that you make contact with your laces as this gives you more control. Never make contact with the bottom of your foot.
This is the point when timing is most important because you can easily miss the ball and make contact with the other player, which is not what you want to do.
To knock the ball away, simply make good contact with your laces and your opponent should lose control. You can try to knock it out of bounds, or you can try to knock the ball toward one of your opponents

, If you are knocking the ball away, you don’t necessarily need to do this. To hook the ball, once your laces connect, pull your foot back toward yourself to pop the ball away from your opponent. Make a slight swinging motion and pop your foot at the same time.


This is the trickiest part of the slide tackle as you may end up knocking it away even if you wanted to keep it.
If you successfully pull the ball away, it’s important to get up and start dribbling it immediately before your opponent has time to react and steal it back.

, Part of the riskiness of a slide tackle is that it leaves you off your feet and out of the play for at least a few seconds. It is important to get up as quickly as possible and either start dribbling the ball, if you kept it, or get back in position to help your teammates.Use your bent leg to push back up onto your feet quickly. It’s also helpful to use the arm on the same side of your body that kicked the ball to push yourself up.

, If the goal of your slide tackle is to steal the ball from your opponent, then it is important to keep possession as soon as you steal it. After you hop up, start dribbling away from the person you stole the ball from.


Quickly scan the field to find your opponents. Try to get a pass off if you aren’t in good field position.

, If your slide tackle knocked the ball away from your opponent, it may have gone out of bounds, to another player, or it may be sitting in the open. If it went out of bounds or another player recovered it, there isn’t much you can do. If the ball is in the open, get to it as fast as possible.


A slide tackle that launches the ball across the field may not be the most helpful tactic, but if it does happen, you still have time to recover.
If you locate the ball, make a quick decision about what you need to do to get back into the action.

Research the types of fantasy basketball.,
Research the types of leagues.,
Learn about the categories.,
Look into the types of drafts.",How to Play Fantasy Basketball1," As with the majority of fantasy sports, fantasy basketball is presented in several different forms:


In rotisserie fantasy basketball, stat categories award points based on the number of teams in the league (for example, in a 12-team league, categories award points from 1 to 12 depending on where teams rank in that category). If you rank second in assists, that would be worth 11 points to your team. The owner with the highest point total at the end of the season is declared the winner.

Points-based is the simplest style of fantasy basketball, awarding different point totals for various achievements (points scored, rebounds, blocks, or others). The team that collects the most points wins.

Head-to-head pits one team owner against another on a weekly basis. Their rosters compete against one another in various statistical categories, with each team earning a “win” for finishing ahead of the opponent in a category. Rather than accumulate points, team owners aim to finish with the best “win-loss record” at season’s end.

Salary-based is a fantasy game in which owners are given a fixed amount of fictional money and must use it to build a team. Each player in the NBA is tagged with a predetermined “salary.” Users are not allowed to exceed the “salary cap.”;
, It is important to establish how much commitment you’re willing to put into playing fantasy basketball before deciding on what kind of league you’re interested in entering:



Single-year leagues are the simplest form of fantasy basketball. You draft a team, make roster moves throughout the season and go for the championship. The following year, you start completely from scratch. This style of league is ideal for anyone looking for something easy to track and requiring the minimum amount of commitment.

Keeper leagues allow fantasy players to keep a maximum number of NBA stars on their roster from one season to the next. Some leagues mandate that each team keep the same number of players, while others set a range of players per team. The following year’s draft includes any player not retained.
In dynasty leagues, teams remain the same from year to year, with the only roster changes coming in the form of player adds, player drops, and trades. Each year, the annual draft consists exclusively of rookies. This league requires a great deal of attention and commitment.

, While each league varies, most use the same 9 categories:



Points scored is fairly straightforward. It’s the number of points a player records.

Field goal percentage refers to a player’s success rate on made shots. If he converts 3 of 5 attempts, his field goal percentage is 60.

3-point percentage is similar to field goal percentage but is limited to how a player performs from beyond the 3-point line.

Free throw percentage measures a player’s success rate on foul shots.

Rebounds are tallied whenever a player grabs a missed shot attempt.

Assists are counted whenever a player makes a pass that results in a successful basket—but only if the scoring player takes no more than one step before making the shot.

Steals occur whenever the offensive team loses control of the ball to an opposing player. The player who forces the turnover through contact with the ball is given the steal.

Blocks refer to any shot attempt that is successfully deflected by an opposing player.

Turnovers are defined by any possession in which the offensive team loses control of the ball without registering a shot. In fantasy basketball, you want this to be a low number.

, The type of draft you conduct will shape how you conduct your research and ultimately decide on a strategy:



Straight drafts can be conducted either online or in person. In a straight draft, the order is established and users select NBA players one at a time. The order can either be regular (people own the same pick in every round) or serpentine (straight draft order is used for odd-numbered rounds, while the opposite is used for even-numbered rounds). Players are selected until all teams’ empty slots are filled.

Auto drafts are conducted online, with teams selected automatically rather than by the competing team owners. The drafting program makes selections based either by the site’s player rankings or by pre-rankings established by the team owner. This type of draft is ideal for those who are unable to agree on a mutual date for a live draft.

Auction drafts do not follow a specific draft order. Instead, a player is offered up for bid by one team owner, and everyone then bids on the player until a final price is established. Teams are limited to predetermined budgets and must fill every spot on their roster without running out of money.

Read up on the players.,
Conduct your draft.,
Set your optimal lineup.",How to Play Fantasy Basketball2," Most of the largest sports websites have their own fantasy basketball sections, complete with “mock” drafts (conducted by fantasy experts to provide insight into possible draft trends), columns on overrated and underrated players, and projected statistics for the coming season. Magazines are also helpful, but generally wind up being dated by the time your draft is held.

, The draft is one of the most entertaining days of the fantasy year, as team owners gather to pick what they hope will be the winning roster—and engage in a little good-natured trash talk along the way. Stick to your strategy, but be willing to make minor adjustments as warranted. Make sure you fill every position with the best player available, and do your best to achieve proper balance in every category. Most of all, have fun!

, Most leagues will allow you to carry more players than you need, with the extra bodies ending up on your “bench.” You’ll need to decide what your optimal lineup is and make sure it is set up in time for the start of the season.

Replace underperforming or injured players.,
Make trades to improve your team.,
Scour the Internet for tips, warnings, and trends.,
Enjoy the season!",How to Play Fantasy Basketball3," Nearly every fantasy basketball team runs into injuries or poor performances along the way. Unless you have an empty slot on your bench, you will need to drop someone if you’re looking to add a free agent. Scour the pool of available players regularly and don’t be afraid to take a chance on players who are running hot or who suddenly find themselves with more playing time than they were originally expected to get. Being proactive will help your chances of winning.

, Team owners will often find themselves strong in one area, weak in another, or both. This is the time to talk trade. If you’re dealing from an area of surplus—for example, you lead the league in rebounds by a significant margin—then your best option is to deal some of your excess for help in other areas. Conversely, if you’re weak somewhere but well-balanced everywhere else, you should find a way to trade for help in that area. Trading isn’t always easy, but if you make enough offers and keep communication lines open, you should succeed in making your team better.

, Fantasy basketball experts don’t stop working once the draft season is over. They’re working all year long to provide owners with up-to-the-minute news on injuries, playing time situations, and other key developments. Leagues aren’t won on draft day, so continue following fantasy writers and analysts on a weekly basis and adjust your roster accordingly.

, Fantasy basketball is designed to add appeal and excitement to the NBA season. Don’t take it too seriously.

Measure your leg.,
Choose the right style.,
Visit a sporting goods store and find the size and style you want.,
Try the shin guard on.,
Ask a store employee if you have any problems.,
Slide the shin guards past your ankle and up your shin.,
Position the shin guards correctly.,
Fasten all straps securely.,
Tape your shin guards if necessary.,
Put your sock over the shin guards.,
Put your cleats on.,
Read any cleaning instructions that come with your shin guards.,
Dry out shin guards after use.,
Scrub your shin guards with soap and warm water.,
Allow your shin guards to dry completely before using them again.,
Sprinkle baking soda in your shin guards to fight odor.,
Inspect your shin guards regularly for cracks or other damage.",How to Wear Shin Guards," An improperly fitting pair of shin guards can impede athletic performance. It can also be dangerous- shin guards that are too small won't fully cover your leg and leave you open to physical impact; shin guards that are too big can trip you and cause an injury. Therefore picking the right size is essential for good performance and safety.


Measure from two inches below the knee to just above the bend of your ankle. This is the area that your shin guard should cover. The length of this measurement determines the ideal size for your shin guard.;
, There are two primary styles of shin guard. Each offers unique levels of protection and flexibility.Slip-in Shin Guards. These are usually a protective plate inside a compression sleeve. They slip over the shin like a large sock. This style offers a wider range of motion but less protection. It is usually recommended for more advanced players.
Ankle shin guards. This style consists of a protective plate that straps around the shin attached to padding that wraps around the ankle. These are usually recommended for younger or less experienced players because they offer more protection.

, Stores like Modell's, Dicks, and Sports Authority are general sporting goods stores that have equipment for numerous sports. If you're an advanced player looking for a very specific type of shin guard, you may want to try a store that specializes in the sport you play. Using the measurement you took of your leg, find the right size and style shin guard.


Shin guards can vary greatly in price. A general rule is that more expensive shin guards will offer better protection, but this isn't always true. Beginner players usually don't need the most expensive equipment, just adequate protection. A store employee should be able to talk you through your options and find the best pair of shin guards for the right price.

, Make sure your shin guard fits properly. Remember, the right size shin guard should cover from right above your ankle to about two inches below your knee.If your initial leg measurement was too big or small, find another pair that fits you better. Also walk around with the shin guards on. Make sure they're comfortable and don't inhibit your movement. You want good protection that still allows you to play effectively.









Try walking and running with the shin guards on. They shouldn't get in the way or slow you down.
Do the motions you would do while playing your sport. For example, if you play soccer, try kicking a ball. The shin guards shouldn't impede your kicking at all.

, They can offer you tips and advice on the best pair of shin guards for you.

, This should be the first thing you put on. Shin guards are worn under the socks, so don't put them on yet.








, Make sure they are centered on your shin, not off to the side. They should protect from your ankle to below your knee. If your shin guards have ankle pads, they should cover the bony sections on both sides of your ankle. Be sure your shin guards are properly positioned before moving on, or you risk a serious injury.







, Most shin guards have straps at the top to secure the guard to your leg. Make sure that these are snug enough to keep your shin guard in place, but not so tight that they restrict your circulation.









If your foot starts to itch, swell, feel numb or discolor, your shin guards are probably too tight. Loosen them right away to avoid injuring your leg.

, Slip-in shin guards and shin guards without ankle pads usually need extra security to keep them in place. Even some shin guards with good straps fall out of place during intense games.









Slip-in shin guards have no straps and usually have to be taped at both ends. Wrap athletic tape around the top and bottom of your shin guards. Test your shin guards and make sure they don't easily push up or down.If your shin guards have straps, you should still test them. Push them around and make sure they are secure on your leg. If they move around, you can tape them up just like slip-in shin guards.Keep extra tape with you during games. You may need to replace your tape during breaks or half time.

, Your socks don't just cover your shin guards, but help keep them in place as well. You'll want a sock that is snug on your leg, but also not so tight that it cuts off your circulation.








Pull your socks all the way up to make sure they're snug enough. If you have fabric left that stretches above your knee, roll it down to further secure your shin guards.

, If your cleats are the right size for you, they should not get in the way of your shin guards.








, Some kinds of shin guards have particular cleaning demands and can get ruined if you don't follow directions. If your shin guards don't have any restrictions, you can follow these steps to keep your shin guards clean and infection-free.


How often you should wash your shin guards is really a matter of how often you use them. If you use them on a regular basis, cleaning at least once a month will be necessary to fight odor and bacteria buildup., Sweat buildup on shin guards is not only unsanitary, but can damage them over time. Instead of leaving them in your athletic bag after a game or practice, leave them out to dry., Athletic equipment is a breeding ground for bacteria, which can cause a serious infection if you get cut. Soap and water will help kill any bacteria that might be colonizing your shin guards and protect you from infection.







, Leaving them outside in the sun should dry them up quickly.

, You'll probably notice that after just a few uses, your shin guards start to smell like sweat. After your shin guards are dry, add some baking soda to help fight unpleasant odor.







, A damaged pair of shin guards will not only offer poor protection, but can hurt you. If they break while you're using them, the plastic can cause a bad cut. If you find any cracks in your shin guards, it's time to replace them."

Mix lukewarm water and glove cleaner.,
Submerge your gloves.,
Refill your bucket and rinse the gloves.,
Repeat your rinse.,
Allow the gloves to air dry.",How to Wash Goalkeeper Gloves1," Your first wash is very important. This is because gloves are impregnated with certain chemicals to preserve them before they are sold. As a result, gloves are stiffer when you buy them. To reduce stiffness, purchase a glove cleaner – this will help you remove chemicals and soften your gloves.


Some glove cleaners include Uhlsport glove wash, gloveGlu glove wash, and Reusch glove wash.;
, Fill a bucket with a gallon of lukewarm water and add an appropriate amount of glove cleaner. The package should specify how much. If it does not, you should apply a liberal amount of glove cleaner to the glove., Dip your gloves into the bucket of water. Move them around in the water. Gently rub the cleaner into the gloves. Allow the gloves to sit in the water for a minute or so.


After you submerge your gloves, set them aside on a paper towel for a minute., Drain the original bucket and refill it with lukewarm water. Take the gloves and submerge them again. Massage the gloves and move them around so you can get any residual cleaner off.

, If you noticed that the rinse bucket was very soapy or had a dark color to it, you’ll need to rinse your gloves again. Simply empty and refill your bucket and submerge your gloves again. It might take several rinses to get all the chemical residue off your gloves. Your goal, ultimately, is to rinse your gloves until the rinsing water appears clear., After you’ve rinsed off the chemical preservative and glove cleaner, you should set your gloves aside to dry for 24 hours. Then, place them on a drying rack so they dry as quickly as possible.


Never put your gloves in a dryer to dry. This will ruin them.

Allow your gloves to dry.",How to Wash Goalkeeper Gloves2," Your gloves will accumulate a lot of dirt and grime after each game. As a result, you should wash them after every game.


You probably don’t need to wash your gloves after every use (like a light practice). Judge based on how much use your gloves get., To do routine washing, take your glove cleaner solution and apply it liberally all over the gloves. This includes the top of the gloves and the palms. Make sure to get complete coverage., Rinse and soak the gloves under a light stream of water (in the shower or sink) until you are sure that all the glove cleaner has been removed from your gloves. This is important, as any glove cleaner residue could dry your gloves out and lead to cracking or other problems.


You may have to wash your gloves a second time. Wash them until you get all cleaner residue and dirt off them., If you don’t have time to wash your gloves after every game, you can just do a quick wash. Either soak your gloves in a bucket or rinse them under a sink or hose.

Lower your butt slightly into an athletic crouch.,
Bring your right foot around the front of the ball, clockwise.,
Spring off your left foot as you're landing, transferring weight to the right foot.,
Land your right foot 1-2 feet to the right of the ball.,
Use the outside of your left foot to push the ball to the left, around your defender.,
Change speed after your touch to blow by the defender.",How to Do the Scissors Soccer Move1," A good scissors is simple and fluid, and it is much easier to understand the smaller steps once you know the total goal. For a right-footed fake, you bring your right foot around the ball, faking a touch with the outside of your foot to the right. Instead of touching, however, you loop around the front of the ball, land on your right foot, then use the outside of your left foot to go to the left of the defender.









Go online and watch experts like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo performing the move at top speed to get a great example of perfected scissor moves.

NOTE: These steps explain a right-footed scissors, where you step over the ball with your right foot, then push off to the left. For the inverse, simply reverse the feet.;
, If this is the first time performing the move, practice without the ball moving or at a very slow jog. If jogging, take a light touch so that the ball is rolling forward as you approach it. You want to keep the ball close to you throughout the move.While you can practice the first few standing still, you should work on both still and moving scissors to be effective in a game.

, You never want to come down completely on your feet with a heavy landing. You need to be able to spring in either direction in an instant.

, Your knees are bent and you're leaning forward slightly at the waist. You want an even, relaxed, and quick posture.







, Leave your toe pointing down so there is a smaller area needed to get around the ball. This also prevents a defender from poking the ball out. If you're using your left foot, go counter-clockwise.








, As you come around the ball, shift your weight towards the right. This both fakes out the defender and allows you to land on the right foot, which you push off of to go left.

, You need room to get your left foot around the ball and touch it away from your defender. Make sure you're landing on the balls of your feet, not your heels, so you can spring up quickly.


As you land, begin bringing your left foot to the right side of the ball., This touch should be diagonally forward and to the left. As you perfect it, try to cut down the time needed to land and spring off your right foot -- the faster the better.









This touch might be somewhat large -- it should be big enough to get the ball quickly past the defender but still allow you to catch it before anyone else.

, A change of speed is essential to pull off any move, and the scissors is no different. Use your left-footed touch to burst into a quick sprint, blowing by your defender before they realize the fake."
"
Practice the looping fake around the ball with both feet to increase your speed.,
Get your head and shoulders involved for a more dramatic fake.,
Keep your fake as close to the ball as possible.,
Practice performing scissors at faster and faster runs.,
Use the move effectively when defenders approach at an angle.,
String several fakes together for a double or triple scissors.,
Add an extra touch to the left to master the ""advanced"" scissors.",How to Do the Scissors Soccer Move2," Set the ball in front of you, get up on the balls of your feet, and practice alternating loops around the front of the ball. Simply keep doing the scissor part of the move without pushing the ball away. Focus on speed and precision, getting your feet quickly around the ball and landing on your toes each time.









As you get better, add the final touch as well. Scissor, then touch to the left with the outside of the foot like a normal move. Then use the inside of your left foot to gently touch the ball towards your right side. From here, perform a left-sided scissors, alternating back and forth., A good player sells the move with their entire body, not just their feet. A good way to do this is with your upper body. If you're faking right, turn your head and your eyes to the right as well, drawing the defender more to this side of the body. As you perform the scissors to the right, dip your shoulders to follow your feet to the right, making the jump to the left even more devastating.


Your hips will dictate which way you go. Keep them facing the defender to stay light and agile.
As a defender, watch a player's hips when they perform a move. This helps avoid falling for head fakes.

, The shorter your arc around the ball the faster you can perform it. By keeping your toe pointed down and practicing a short, quick scissor around the front of the ball you shorten the time it takes to perform the move and get around the defender. The faster your fake, the more effective you will be.

, As you master the move, start doing it from faster motion. Keep the ball in front of you as you dribble, picking up speed as you practice the move at game tempo. Note how fast you need the ball to be rolling as you do. The ball needs to have enough momentum to keep rolling forward as you scissor over it.


It's okay to slow down slightly before the move -- even desired -- as it allows your burst of speed right after the scissors to blow by the defender.

, The scissors can be performed whenever, but it is best when a defender is coming at you diagonally. This means their momentum is already carrying them to one side, making your fake twice as effective. Say the defender is coming at you diagonally from the left side of your body:


If the angle is shallow (they are more in front of you than to the side), fake to the right and go left, away from their momentum.
If the angle is wide (they are more to the side of you), fake to the left, towards their body, then push the ball forward and right to send them harmlessly behind you., As you get better you don't have to stick to just one fake. Watch Cristiano Ronaldo for a masterclass in the multiple-scissors, which leaves most defenders as a puddle of weak knees. To perform it, simply spring back off your right foot into a left-footed scissors, wrapping around the front of the ball instead of pushing it away with the outside of your foot. You can then land on your left foot and touch off with your right, or do another scissors.


This move takes a bit more time, and the ball generally needs a bit of extra forward speed to stay under your body.

, In a traditional scissors the ball doesn't move until you do, which smart defenders can read and intercept. The advanced scissors adds one extra touch at the beginning of the move to throw off the defender's timing. To pull it off:


Use your right foot to take a touch across your body, towards the left foot.
Keep your right foot in the air after the touch.
Immediately after the touch, wrap your right foot around the ball like normal. The ball should still be moving across your body.
Land on your right foot as the ball reaches your left foot.
Take a big touch with the outside of your left foot to blow by the defender."
"
Use a well inflated, full-size ball to practice.,
Place your ball about 30 feet (10 meters) away from the goal.,
Set up for your normal free kick run-up.,
Approach the ball like you would for a normal strike with your laces.,
Place your plant foot even with the ball, roughly six inches to the side.,
Strike the ball with your laces, right below the very center of the ball.,
Stop your follow through as soon as you hit the ball.",How to Knuckle a Soccer Ball1," You want it to be nice and hard, and it absolutely must be regulation size. Hitting a knuckle requires you hit the ball firmly near the center and resist following through -- a flat, small ball will be easy to hit off to the sides and it will stay on your foot for longer, causing spin.


Perfecting this shot takes a lot of practice -- so having 5-10 balls to hit in a row will make your life much easier.
It doesn't matter what brand of ball you use to practice, as long as it is full-sized and well pumped.;
, While you don't have to shoot at a goal, this is a good target to start with. Don't worry about placement of your shot just yet -- you want to get the motion down first. As long as you hit in at the goal now you can work on accuracy later.

, If you normally take four steps back and two to the left, you should use the same set-up here. The only difference would be to stand upright, keeping yourself balanced on the balls of both feet. As you hit the ball, you want to keep your chest up straight as much as possible, so it is best to start like this too.


Note how knuckleball experts Christiano Rinaldo and Gareth Bale stand before a free-kick. They stand tall, with their chests almost puffed out., Keep your torso up, but otherwise approach the ball like you were taking a normal free-kick. You'll be hitting the ball with your laces for maximum power and to avoid spin., After your run-up, you want to place your non-kicking foot as close to the ball as you can get it. Your instep (where the inside edge of your foot curves slightly) should be in the middle of the ball. Your toe needs to point in the direction you want the ball to go., You want to hit the ball as close to dead center as possible, going just slightly lower than center to hit the ball higher in the air (to, for example, get the ball over a wall).


Keep your ankle locked firmly -- a wobbly ankle introduces spin.
You want your toes pointed straight down. You'll make contact by ""punching"" the ball with the top of your laces., This is the key to a good knuckle, and the hardest part to master. You do not want to follow through on the ball anymore than your momentum makes you. As soon as you make contact, stop driving your leg. You'll feel your shin continue through the ball, but everything above the knee should be mostly quiet. Some players find this easiest if they hop after the strike. As you make contact, pop off your plant foot. Land on your shooting foot first, placing it right where the ball used to be.


This is why keeping your torso up, straight, and balanced is so important. It keeps your momentum straight, allowing you to pull off of the shot without adding spin.
You want to feel almost like you're slapping the ball. It will take conscience effort to pull your foot back, but the hard part is ensuring you only pull back after you hit the ball."
"
Practice the hop step without a ball.,
Don't worry about power until you can hit the ball without spin.,
Keep your body compact, still, and strong.,
Slightly turn your foot out for added power, striking with the bone on the inside-top of your foot.,
Practice the shot daily, adding challenges as you grow comfortable.",How to Knuckle a Soccer Ball2," While not all knuckle-ballers take this hop-step, it is incredibly helpful to keep the ball from spinning, especially on free kicks. Think of it as a slight scissor kick. If you're kicking with your right foot, you'd approach and place the left near the ball. As your right leg comes down, pull your left foot up and back, leaving your torso up to stay balanced. You then kick the ball and land on your right foot, placing it almost where the left was. You'll look like your running in place, or snapping your feet past each other like a broken set of scissors., Many players want to go out, learn the knuckle, and start ripping pro-level free kicks in the same afternoon. Most of those players won't be able to do it. Instead, start learning with a simple 1-step run up, only 10-20 yards away from the goal. Work on a comfortably plant foot distance and resisting your follow-through motion. The ball may not zig-zag much at this speed, but you'll be able tell if it is spinning or not. Once you can hit the ball without spin it's time to move on to full strikes., You want your kicking motion to be as economical as possible. Your plant foot and torso should be set comfortably, with your ankles and knees locked in position. Your run-up should be well-contained and calm, without lots of twisting, moving, or adjusting. Your kicking leg needs to be strong from quad to ankle, without excess movement. Think about straight lines -- any curves or excess side-to-side movement makes it more likely you hit the ball at an angle, causing spin., The bone in between your laces and instep is the hardest area of your foot. You can feel it with your hand, running from your ankle to big toe. Once you have the basic kick down, work on turning your ankle out slightly to make contact with this rock-hard bone. However, you must keep the rest of your shooting motion straight, hitting the ball in the dead center.

, No matter how easy and effortless he makes it look, Gareth Bale is the first to admit that the shot took years to perfect. His advice? Start shooting on an open net, then add mannequins or a wall in front of you. Finally, add a keeper to work on accuracy. above all, hit a few knuckleballs every day, focusing on perfecting the technique so that it becomes second nature."

, Your front leg should now be on the ball, and your back leg should be on the ground. You'll probably get off balance a tad, but that's okay. Once you've reached perfect balance, move on to the next step.

, Try to go a little faster, but not to the point where you lose balance. Do steps one and two twice.

, Do it at a quick pace now, but don't lose your balance. Tap the ball lightly. Do it five times.

Select key moments where the trick is appropriate.",How to Perform a Rai Flick," As you are approaching a nearby defender, dribble the ball between your left and right feet. The trickery of the Rai Flick is in full effect when you are directly in front of the defender. As you are dribbling the ball, get within about 3 feet of the defender, right in front of him/her. If this is your first time practicing the trick, it is better to use a cardboard cut-out or an object as representative of the defender. Otherwise, you could wind up hurting someone as you practice., After you have dribbled the ball, stop about three feet in front of the nearby defender. You will want to position the soccer ball between your two feet. It is best if the ball is near the middle/back of your feet rather than the front of your feet. Your two feet should come together tightly around the ball. The more control you have over the ball, the greater ""lift"" you will be able to achieve., Your upper body (chest, arms, head, etc.) should begin to move forward fairly fast. By moving your torso forward, you will create extra room behind your body to swing your legs up. Make sure that you maintain control of the ball between your feet as you do so., As your torso is leaning forwards, you will want to kick your entire body upwards. As your body jumps upwards, your legs should do one of the following options: swing backwards, or swing to the side. The option you choose will depend on your position on the field. If the net is directly behind the defender, you will want to swing your legs backwards in order to get the ball directly behind the defender. If the net is to the side, or you plan on passing the ball to a teammate, swing your legs to the side.Option 1 Behind the Back: Move your torso forward and jump using both of your legs to lift the ball up in the air behind you in an arc in order to get the ball overtop of the defender.
Option 2 Around the Side: Move your torso forward and jump bringing both legs over to the side of your body and flick the ball over the defender. If you choose this option, it is best to swing your legs towards the dominant side of your body (right handed, right side; left handed, left side).
Whatever option you choose, always maintain pressure with your feet against the ball. You do not want to lose control until you release it.

, You will want to release the ball when your legs have swung upwards at least 90 degrees (waist level). This is important because if you release it too early, the ball will go backwards or in a different reaction. Once your legs have kicked up at the position of your waist, let the ball go by releasing the pressure created by your feet. The ball should fly in the air, creating an arch, and land on the other side of the defender.After you have released the ball, make sure to stabilize your body, and land safely on both feet. You may have to stretch your arms slightly in order to maintain your balance.

, Move around the defender and find where the ball landed. Maintain control of the ball and begin dribbling again. You can either take the ball directly to the net, or pass it to one of your teammates., In order to master the Rai Flick it will take a lot of practice. Use a cardboard cut-out or an object representing a defender before you move on to practicing with teammates. You will also need to perform the steps fairly fast in order to garner enough acceleration and velocity to swing the ball above and around the defender. It is fine to take it slow at first, but you will need to graduate to a fairly fast pace in order to capture the real trickery and illusion of the Rai Flick., Dribble the ball downfield towards the opponent's goal. In order to perform the Rai Flick in a real game you need to make sure of the following criteria: there are few people around you, there are few people behind the opposing defender, and you have a sightline towards the goal.You need room around you in order to perform the move, otherwise you could hit someone with the ball, or hit your legs on a nearby defender.
The goal line should be in your vision so you know what direction to swing the ball towards.

, As you are dribbling the ball, direct your body position towards a single defender. You want to square up with their shoulders, as you move no less than three feet away from them. Instead of going around the defender, you will go full speed towards him/her. Once you get close enough, slow down, and maintain control of the ball between your feet., Your momentum carrying you towards the defender is what you will use to perform the trick. Maintain control of the ball between your feet. Move your torso forward, jump upwards, and kick your legs back or too the side. When your legs have reached mid-waist level, free the ball by releasing the pressure between your feet.#*If there is space to the side of the defender, swing the ball to the side. If there are defenders surrounding him/her, swing the ball overtop of them.


Try your best to direct the ball towards the goal.

, After you have flicked the ball overtop of the defender, the surprise of the Flick should stop them in their place. Use this split second to jolt around him/her. Quickly find where the ball is and reclaim it. Maintain control, using your feet, and continue on dribbling towards the goal. You can also use the Rai Flick as a way to pass the ball towards a teammate. Just make sure that either your eyes or hands are signaling your teammate as to what you are about to do., The whole point of the move is that it is a trick play. You want to catch the defender off guard, as they come too close to you. Only perform the move a few times per game. The move is also a great way to pass the ball when you are being double/triple teamed. Choose your spots, know your surroundings, and perform the move as fast as possible.

Start by exercising a lot, try going to a gym at least 3 hours a week as soccer players need to have good control over their muscles.,
Start with the ball on the ground, put your dominant foot on top of the ball and roll it back so that the ball is balanced on top of your foot.

Get back up quickly.",How to Do a Scorpion Kick in Soccer," This move was first used by a goalie and is normally used for defense. For practicing, stand in front of the goal along the goal line. For real games, keep in mind that you won’t be standing in one spot. A shot could come from anywhere and you need to be ready to defend it.
, Stand with feet shoulder width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your hands out in front of you for balance and being ready to catch a ball. This will prepare you for jumping and moving quickly to be ready to do a scorpion kick., Spring up into the air and aim your body forward. A good rule of thumb is that your body goes where your nose goes, so move your head forward to make your body horizontal as you fall. It may be disconcerting at first to dive out onto solid ground, so think of diving as if you were going to do a belly flop into a pool., As you begin to reach the end of your dive, kick both legs up behind you. Arch your back so that you can get your feet into the air as high as possible.Keep your feet together so that you don’t kick the ball crookedly. Your knees may bow out so that you can bring your feet higher above your head, but the key is to keep your feet together for maximum kicking power.Align your shoulders, hips, and feet in a straight line so that your feet are straight as well.
Squeezing your leg muscles and glutes will help train your body to stay straight.

, Use your hands to guide your chest down to the ground and then roll the rest of your body down as well. After your hands and chest reach the ground, you want to follow through with your hips, then knees, then feet. This will take the edge off the impact of hitting the ground.

Landing improperly after the dive is how injuries can occur if you’re not careful.
Practice on soft grass or a gym mat if you’re concerned about hurting yourself.
Perfecting your technique before using this trick in a game will help prevent injuries as well.

, As the ball comes toward you, it should be roughly as high as your head. When you dive, your feet should be coming up to where your head was. You may need to move yourself to be in line with the ball. It should come down towards you at an angle, not directly above you or directly at you.Getting the timing and ball positioning just right is the trickiest part of this save.
Have a friend or coach toss the ball for you so you can get used to where you you want the ball to be in order to kick it.
For practicing on your own, you can balance the ball behind your neck and as you dive forward, then pop it behind you to catch it with your feet., You want to hit the ball with both of your heels and not the balls of your feet.The most power will come from your heels and it’s easier to angle them up. If you hit the ball with the balls of your feet, you’re more likely to angle the ball down towards your head and not out away from the goal., Complete the kick by continuing to stretch your legs behind your back after your kick the ball. Following through is a technique used in many sports and it helps to direct the ball where you’re aiming it., When using this kick offensively, be aware that the ball could be coming from any direction around you. Pay attention to where the ball is coming from and where the goal is. You want to intercept the ball in its path and kick it towards the goal., This kick is usually used for defending a goal because the ball is normally up in the air already. For scoring, have a teammate or friend cross the ball in front of the goal or pop the ball into the air for you., If you’re up on offense and have shot the ball toward the goal, you’ll need to get back on your feet to continue playing. There’s a chance your shot was blocked and if you’re the closest player, you may need to be ready to kick it back into the goal to save the score."

Leap over the top of the ball.,
Land your feet properly.,
Hit the ball with the inside of your dominant foot.,
Sprint after the chop.,
Dribble down the field.,
Be on the attack.,
Chop on the wing.,
Make sure the defender is moving.",How to Do a Ronaldo Chop," This isn’t a big jump, more of a hop-step to let you get your feet in the right position for the trick.This is a trick you do while running, so you may need to slow down slightly before your leap in order to keep the ball close by. Don't take too much time to slow down, maybe a step or two, or else the defender will know something is coming.
If you go too high, the defender will take advantage, and knock the ball away.;
, Each of your feet will do something different here, so they need to be positioned in the right way. Make sure you know which foot is your dominant one (the one you use for passing and shooting) before doing this trick.Your non-dominant foot should land in front of the ball. Make sure it is between the ball and the defender, so you can shield the ball and prevent him from tackling it away.
Your dominant foot should swing out to the side, landing at a 45 degree angle from the direction you are running in. This is the foot you will use to hit the ball. If your foot is facing forward, you will push the ball sideways, which isn’t good. You want to keep going forward, towards the goal.
If you get confident using your dominant foot, you can try practicing with your other leg. This can give you more options on the field, and make you more unpredictable on the attack.

, Your foot should swing behind your other leg.This should happen at the same moment your feet land on the ground, to keep things moving quickly. This should push the ball forward, but at a different angle than you were moving before.


Keep your contact with the ball light, just a tap, and no follow-through. You are only changing the ball’s direction, not sending it somewhere else on the field.As you practice, you should become more consistent with the direction of your kick. This will help you know how to move your body following the move.
With some extra practice, you can begin to change the angle of your foot slightly to create even greater changes in direction. This is especially useful if you see certain parts of the field you want to run towards, which won’t always be in the same direction.

, Once you make your move, and go the other way, the defender will be confused and take a moment to catch up. Don’t waste any time, start running as fast as you can in this new direction to find space and set up your next move., This is a quick move for changing direction, and is only effective if you are already running one way. Standing still removes the element of surprise., This is not a trick you should try in your own defensive end. You want to be facing a defender who is moving backwards, or at least trying to cut you off. This will make it easier for the Chop to put him off-balance., This is a popular move for wingers, since you will probably be isolated against a single defender when you attack, and will have room to move when you cut back. The center of the field is much more crowded, and you may change direction right into another defender., This move works because it happens very quickly. A defender running towards you won’t be able to change his momentum, meaning he’ll be going the wrong way. If the defender is standing still, he can track your movement, and follow you more quickly."

, As a defender approaches you when you are dribbling the ball forward, tap the ball with the toe of one foot to stop the ball from moving.


Use the foot that is closest to the defender; for example, if the defender is approaching you on your right side, use your right foot to tap the ball. This move works equally well on both sides, although you might have more proficiency on your dominant side.

, Once you've tapped your foot on the ball to stop it from moving, spin around so that your back is facing the defender. This creates a barrier between the ball and the oncoming defender.

, While you are turning with the ball, keep your arms up so you force the defender to maintain physical distance away from you. If your arms are out a little bit, they will also help you keep your balance when you spin., As you complete the spin, take the foot off the top of the ball and plant it on the ground.

, After you plant your right foot on the ground, continue spinning and lift up your left leg in preparation to put your left foot on top of the ball.

, When your right foot is planted firmly on the ground, put your left toe on top of the ball to redirect its movement.

, As your left foot is on top of the ball, continue to turn your body in a circle, completing another 180 degrees. You will end up facing the same direction as when you started the Maradona.


You can also stop spinning after you’ve done a total of 270 degrees so that you can redirect which way you travel with the ball., As you complete the second 180 degree turn, use your left foot to drag the ball, pulling it behind you.If the defender keeps stealing the ball away, try pulling the ball further back so that it stays out of the defender’s reach. Make sure you are not just spinning on top of the ball while the ball remains stationary. The ball should move with you., The Maradona will slow down your pace as you turn and deflect the defender from the ball. As you come out of the Maradona, speed up your pace and race past your opponent.

, With this move, take your time and make sure you are in control of the ball at all times. It is easy to lose control of the ball during the Maradona move because you are trying to move too fast.While pro players can do this move quickly and effectively, it is an advanced move and therefore more difficult to perfect for amateur players.

, There are several parts to the Maradona, from tapping your foot on the ball to stepping away from it to dragging your other foot across the ball. But the most effective Maradona moves will put this all into one smooth motion.It will take a lot of practice to hone your skills, however, so be patient and keep working at it.

Learn different uses for the rabona.",How to Do a Rabona," Your kicking foot will usually be your dominant foot. For most people, your dominant foot is correlative with your dominant hand, meaning that if you're right-handed you will kick with your right foot. However, that isn't always the case. Some people are right-handed but kick with the left foot, or vice versa, and some people are ambidextrous, meaning they can alternate fluidly between using the right and left hand or foot.Though you may favor one foot over the other, studies have shown that both dominant and non-dominant feet are capable of equal kicking strength.Find which foot you are more comfortable with, and build up the balance and muscle strength to rely on that foot.;
, It is important that your non-dominant foot remains firmly planted on the ground. This sets up your entire posture and range of movement for the kick.The positioning and firmness of your planted foot also helps your body maintain balance during the kick., The ball should be sitting on the outside of your non-kicking foot. If you are going to kick with the right foot, then the ball should be about one foot (20-30 cm) to the outside (left) of your left foot. If you are going to kick with the left foot, then the ball should be to the outside of your right foot.The distance between your dominant foot and the ball ensures that you get a long wind-up for the kick, creating more power in your shot.
Your planted foot needs to be facing the target in order to ensure an accurate shot.
If you have trouble making clean contact with the ball then your planted foot is probably too close to the ball or too far in front of the ball. Make sure that it is in the right position., This is important, as it gives you the balance you need to execute the kick.Your body should be leaning slightly backwards and to the side away from the ball when you strike. This helps you to maintain balance and gain power and lift with your kick.

, Look at a spot towards the underside of the ball when aiming. This is a very difficult shot so it is important to strike accurately. Keep your eyes on the ball at all times.Striking the ball on the underside helps create lift and height on your shot., As you swing your dominant leg around behind your planted leg, try to bring your foot all the way up to your bottom by bending your knee. Lifting your foot as high as possible will greatly increase the power of your strike.Keep your non-kicking leg slightly bent to maintain balance and to help you strike the ball cleanly.
Try to use as big of a windup as possible., You should be striking the ball with the outside of your foot. When you kick with the top outside part of your soccer boot, your kick gains power and accuracy., The follow through can be particularly difficult for the rabona because your non-kicking leg will be in the way. It can sometimes help to lift both feet off the ground as you complete your strike., Kicking the underside of the ball helps to provide lift and height on your shot. Ensure that you make contact with the ball in one smooth motion. The rabona should feel natural and comfortable.If you are having trouble getting lift and height on the ball, then you are probably hitting the top or middle of the ball. Make sure you are making contact with the underside of the ball and practice until striking the bottom of the ball becomes comfortable., The rabona relies on a strong core to maintain balance and generate enough power as you twist to strike the ball.Strengthen your core by completing abs and back exercises such as sit-ups and planks., The rabona is a very difficult shot that can take months and even years to master. As you practice, this move will feel more comfortable, and you will become a better player for your efforts.

, It will take a while to master the rabona from a stationary position, but once you've gotten it down you'll need to build the move into a usable soccer technique, and that means being able to do it in motion.


Slowly dribble towards your target and then attempt the rabona. It may feel different to attempt this shot while in motion but make sure your technique is the same as when the ball was in one place.
Check that your feet are placed correctly and that you maintain balance through the strike.

, Once you can complete the rabona while in motion work on increasing your speed.


Try dribbling the ball at a run before completing the rabona. You can also start trying the rabona from different angles to become more fluid in your movements and turn this trick into a useful game skill.

, Set up four cones as a square target for practicing your aim. Continue practicing the rabona until you can reliably kick the ball so that it lands in this square.Once you can reliably use a rabona to kick the ball into the square made of cones, try aiming into a trashcan. This is a much harder target that will help you to perfect your aim and create a more accurate lift with the rabona., The rabona can be used if you are on the wrong side of the ball or are at an awkward angle from which to shoot. The rabona is also useful when you do not have much space in which to attempt a shot or pass.


Use the rabona to trick the defense or goalie. The rabona can also be used as a fake for goalies or defense. For example, the defense or goalie may think you are going to shoot with your left foot but you instead complete a rabona with your right foot. This can get the goalie’s or defense’s weight shifted in the wrong direction, opening up space for your shot or pass.
Work on adding a fake to the beginning of your rabona. If you want to complete a rabona using your right foot as the kicking foot, then stop the ball with your right foot. Draw the ball backwards with your right foot towards the outside of your left foot and then swing your right foot around to the backside. This fake will trick the defense or goalie and open up space for your kick.

Practice balancing your foot on the ball.,
Balance with one foot and hop with the other.,
Place alternating feet on the top of the ball.",How to Do the Maradona2," Place the toe of one foot on top of the ball. Make sure your body weight is resting with your back leg. Balance your foot lightly and keep the ball still.Switch feet so that your other foot can rest lightly on top of the ball. This is especially important to alternate feet, since many people have a dominant foot or leg that they will favor. Practice your balance for both feet.

, Once you’re able to balance with one toe resting on the top of the ball, start doing little hops with your other foot. Keep your foot resting lightly on top of the ball while you hop.Hop 10 times and then switch legs and try the exercise again.

, Lightly rest the toe of one foot on top of the ball. Remove this foot and put the toe of the other foot on top of the ball. As you get the hang of it, switch your feet at a quicker speed. The goal is to move quickly so that only one foot is on the ground at a time and you’ll add a little hop to switch feet back and forth."

Practice the Maradona with the ball.,
Practice the Maradona with another player.",How to Do the Maradona3," Place three cones in a V shape about 5 yards apart from each other. This will give you plenty of space to work up a ball dribble and set up the Maradona move.

, The first step to perfecting the Maradona is to get your body accustomed to the movement and spin. Start at the first cone and pretend to dribble a ball toward an imaginary defender at the second cone. When you want to start the Maradona, tap the ground with your dominant foot, turn, and step that foot in between you and the defender. Tap your other foot on the ground and spin to complete the Maradona, heading for the third cone., Start at the first cone and dribble the ball toward the second cone. Imagine the second cone is a defender and do the Maradona. Dribble the ball to the third cone and back to the first cone.

, Working with another person is much different than using a cone to imagine the position of a defender. Have the other player stand still while you approach, do the Maradona, and accelerate away.Ask the other player to start moving around, running toward you at an angle or from the side. Have them try to steal the ball away from you.

Use when a defender approaches you from an angle or side.,
Use the Maradona when the defender is in motion.,
Do not do this move in the defensive part of the field.",How to Do the Maradona4," When a defender is coming toward you to steal the ball, you can use the Maradona to quickly change direction. This move works best when a defender is coming at you from an angle or from the side.Tap the ball with the foot closest to the defender and then place that foot in between the ball and the defender.
Turn your body so that you are in between the ball and the defender. Drag the ball with your other foot and spin around, continuing to move the ball away from the defender.

, The Maradona will redirect the movement of the ball, so if a defender is already in motion, they are expecting the ball to travel in a particular direction. When you redirect the ball, there is a delay while the defender corrects their movement., When you are close to your team’s goal (the goal protected by your goalkeeper), you don’t want to risk the ball being picked up by the other team. If you are an expert at the Maradona, you can probably ensure that the ball won’t be stolen away from you during this move. But if you are still learning the move, it’s best kept for moving the ball past a defender on your approach to the goal."

The Maradona turn is famous for its effectiveness in moving the soccer ball past a defender, especially in sticky situations. It’s a stylish spinning move that when done properly can be virtually impossible to defend against. Watch slow motion videos to acquaint yourself with the basic tactics of the move.;
, Approach the ball as if you were dribbling. Visualize a defender approaching as you attack their territory. Go through each motion of the move slowly and deliberately.

, The Maradona is all about stopping suddenly, then redirecting the ball in a different direction. The movements of the actual turn should be relatively slow compared to the pace of your dribbling down the field. Stop the ball with your foot on top of it and drag it back toward you.

, Take your foot off the ball and place it on the ground next to the ball, between the ball and and imaginary defender, turning your body so that the defender is on your side. Get your arm on that side up, to shield against the defender.

, Grab the ball with your non-dominant foot. As you spin, drag the ball into the space behind you. Keep the ball within your personal space, but far enough behind you that the defender won’t be able to reach it past your body.

, After you drag the ball behind you, spin and retake forward possession, dribbling the ball off in a angle down the field and past the defender. The key to using the Maradona turn in play is the dynamic speeds throughout. Imagine the whole move as approaching a defender fast, slowing and executing the turn, then bam! You’re sprinting past the confused defender as you continue down the field.

Put as much power on it as possible.",How to Do a Bicycle Kick," To do a bicycle kick properly, you'll basically need to fall backward and kick the ball up and over your head, in the opposite direction from where you were facing. It's an unexpected and spectacular play when done properly, because you're facing the other direction.









Most bicycle kicks are done inside the penalty box, upon receiving some kind of cross or other pass, in an attempt to score. It's usually not something most players intend to do, but something that you might end up having to do in the moment.;
, To start the motion of the classic bicycle kick, lift the knee of your non-dominant foot and push off the ground with your kicking foot. The higher you can lift your non-kicking foot the better, because this will help you get the momentum necessary to get your kicking foot up and over properly.









Depending on where you are on the field and how close you are to the ball, you may want to kick with one or the other feet, but you want to push off with the same foot you want to kick with.

, As you raise your leg, throw your momentum backward, as if you’re trying to get away from the ball and flop back down on the ground. Be careful not to throw your head back too quickly, or to dip your body into a full-on flip. Stay focused on the kick and making contact with the ball, not falling back super-fast.









Think of the scene in The Matrix, in which Neo's trying to get out of the way of a flurry of bullets by bending backward. That's what you're going for, but faster.

, As your momentum carries you backward, “bicycle” your legs, bringing your non-kicking foot back down toward the ground, and bringing your kicking leg, which you jumped off, up toward the ball to make contact.









This rotation of the feet is where the kick gets its name, using your non-kicking leg to propel you and give you leverage to kick the ball backward.

, Use the ridge on the hardest part of the top of your foot, if possible, driving the ball straight over your head and back behind you. Ideally, you want to kick the ball flush on the opposite side of the ball from the goal, and not on the bottom of the ball, which might end up sending the ball straight up in the air.









It’s very difficult to make contact with a ball clean during a bicycle kick, which is why it's more commonly used as an improvised maneuver at the last minute. Keep your eye on it closely and try to get the best touch on it you can.

, Put your arms out to your sides to brace your fall and catch yourself with your arms as wide as possible to take the bump pressure off your back and your hips. Be very careful not to rotate backward too quickly,









Some players prefer taking the bump with the side, rather than flat-backing. Practice some bicycle kicks and get a feel for what works best for you and your style of play.

, Obviously, falling onto your back to do a kick isn't without its hazards. To decrease the possibility of hurting yourself by falling onto your back, only practice on the grass to make the impact as gentle as possible. Falling flat back onto dirt patches or concrete is a good way to hurt yourself. This isn't an indoor soccer maneuver.








, If you're going to practice bicycle kicks, make sure you catch yourself carefully, practicing throwing your arms out to your side to brace for impact an automatic move. Practice until you can do it without thinking.








, A bicycle kick is a sweet bit of icing on the cake of your soccer skills, but it shouldn’t be something that you practice regularly. Spending a bit of time at the end of practice taking some bike shots is fine, but spend more time working on your footwork, shooting the ball, and developing the craft of soccer.








, It’s hard to practice bicycle kicks solo, because they’re pretty much just punts. Have a teammate feed you passes from a variety of directions and try to practice getting a good touch on it without having to trap it first. Redirectional kicks like bicycle kicks are very difficult to pull off, making them worthy of practicing for intermediate and advanced players looking to improve their game.









If you don’t have anyone to practice with, try bouncing the ball off a hard surface so it comes back in your direction, or make it part of a juggling routine.

, While spectacular, bicycle kicks are low-probability strikes. You’re shooting the ball blind, making it more likely that you’ll miss the shot, foul a defender, or miss the strike completely. When you’re in the box with your back to the goal, look for an open teammate first.If no one is open, consider trapping the ball to your feet first and juking around the defenders, or trying to get a more clean strike on the ball. Putting a little redirectional tap on it with a bicycle kick might be ok, but you’ll get more power out of a strike off the ground.

, Most bicycle kicks are done in the penalty area when your team has the ball and is trying to score. Any time you’re deep in your opponent’s territory and trying to get in scoring position, do a double check and make sure you’ve got the defense between your position and the goal.

, If you're in good position to try for a bicycle kick, make sure you're not going to get tangled up with any pesky defenders while you're doing it. Since a bicycle kick involves sticking your cleated foot way up in the air, which makes it more likely that you might kick another player and be carded. Be careful to avoid getting flagged for a high kick.

, If you're going to pull the trigger, make sure you get behind the ball all the way. Redirecting the ball with a little tap would be better if you could make it a little more accurate by trapping the ball first and actually looking at the goal. The bicycle kick is about surprise and power, meaning that you've got to forcefully bash the ball so it doesn't matter where it ends up, as long as it ends up on goal.

Work on the movement.,
Incorporate the ball.,
Practice faster.,
Practice with a dribble.,
Practice with cones.",How to Do a Maradona in Soccer2," Start by practicing the body motion without a ball. This will help you understand the basic body motion of the move, which looks extremely complicated at high speed. It’s not. It’s fairly simple when done slowly. Slow it down and imagine the ball on the ground at first.


Practice each component of the Maradona as described above in individual steps.
Work on getting your body used to the technique before you move on to incorporating the ball.
At first, go nice and slow, placing your foot on “top” of the imaginary ball, and the other positions where you manipulate the ball as you go through each motion.

, Now that you’ve gotten the body motion down, practice the actual footwork on the ball. As with the motion work, go slow at first. Treat each component of the move as an individual step. Repeat the approach, the stopping of the ball, the switching of feet on the ball, the spinning of your body, and the movement of the ball into the space behind you as individual moves, then put them all together.

, When you have the basic ball maneuver down at a slow speed, increase your pace. Take great care as you increase your speed to retain control throughout. The Maradona isn’t meant to be executed at high speed. It’s a move of finesse- rushing it will only result in you losing possession of the ball or tripping over it, possibly twisting an ankle.


As you go faster, keep in mind the specific movements-each movement is its own step.
If it starts to get sloppy, slow it back down and continue practicing each motion slowly.

, Once you are able to do the Maradona with some regularity and speed, start dribbling, and practice the Maradona technique in the midst of dribbling. Once you execute the maneuver, dribble away in the new direction.

, When you feel comfortable doing the Maradona with a dribble, use cones to get the feel for using it in a specific place in relation to a defender. Using cones to represent sedentary people or positions on the field will help you ability to execute moves where they matter most- right in the spot they’re called for. It won’t so you any good if you can do the Maradona Turn, but not at the correct moment. Get three cones.
Place two of the cones approximately five yards apart.
Place the third cone another five yards out, at an approximately 45 degree angle from the middle cone.
Starting at the first cone, dribble toward the second, and execute the Maradona as if the second cone were a defender. Spin past the “defender” and continue dribbling on to the third cone.
Repeat numerous times for practice. "
"
Be aware of angle of the approaching defender.,
Use the Maradona on a run.,
Move from a stopped position.,
Slow it down.",How to Do a Maradona in Soccer3," The Maradona works best when the defender is approaching from an angle or from the side, rather than straight on. Diego Maradona himself used it countless times to escape seemingly impossible situations, in corners of the field or when surrounded by defenders. If a defender is approaching head on, it can be used to take the ball in a different direction.


One of the reasons the Maradona Turn is so effective is that it can be used in tight spaces.
When getting crowded on other sides by multiple defenders the move can be used to re-direct the ball out of a tight spot.

, The Maradona Turn is perfect to use when a defender is approaching fast, especially if they’re about to tackle. When you're moving fast down the field and an approaching defender or multiple defenders move to stop you, the sudden shift in speed of the Maradona will confuse your attacker(s).

, When the ball is stopped and you need to get it moving out of a tight place, and effective Maradona Turn can break you out of a stuck position inside the opposing team’s territory. Use it suddenly when you've been stopped by defenders, then take the ball off into open ground.

, The Maradona is meant to used with dynamic speed, not at top speed. Once again, the speed dynamics are what make the move so effective. When you’re attacking fast against multiple defenders, then stop on a dime, execute the turn almost casually, then speed off toward the goal, leaving the defenders bewildered and in your dust, it’s not only a highly effective maneuver, it’s one of the more stylish and artistic moves in soccer.


Use the move to de-accelerate, then re-accelerate in a different direction.
Be sure to pull the ball far enough behind you that it’s out of the defender’s reach, but where you can keep it in your own space and control.

, Velcro). Closure is up to personal preference and doesn't affect glove performance. If you aren't sure which sort of closure you want, it is suggested you shop at a soccer or sport specialty shop rather than online, as you'll be able to try the gloves on and decide which system you prefer.

, Durability, or performance? If durability is more valuable, it is suggested to go with a glove that is dimpled or has textured latex on the palms. However, they don't perform as well, and if you hold performance over durability, it isn't suggested to buy that sort of glove.

, If you are shopping at a store, it is highly suggested to try the gloves on, too.


Use a tape measure to measure around the widest part of your palm (not including your thumb).






Repeat with your other hand. One will be larger. Add one inch (roughly three centimeters) to the larger measurement. You have just measured your palm.






Measure your hand from right above the wrist to tip of your longest finger. Some glove makers also use this finger measurement.







, The best place to get gloves would be a soccer specialty store, if there is one in your area, or, if you don't have one, a sports store.Sometimes online stores have better selection and lower prices but you can't try them on. Once you're in the store, make sure to try on the glove you want. Move your fingers around quite a bit, maybe hold and toss a soccer ball with it. Just don't anger the manager.

Play on smooth or soft surfaces.",How to Inflate a Soccer Ball," They are easy to find and you can buy one at any sporting goods store. Invest in a good quality pump, air gauge, and keep a supply of pump needles on hand. Some pumps have an air gauge built in. If yours doesn't, make sure you get a low pressure gauge.You'll also need some silicone or glycerin oil for lubrication.;
, Check the manufacturer's manual to find the recommended air pressure level for your soccer ball. The recommended air pressure will be expressed either in lbs, psi, or bar, and typically will be between 6 lbs and 8 lbs.If the recommended pressure of your soccer ball is expressed in a different unit than what your air gauge reads, you'll need to convert. To convert bar to psi, multiple by 14.5037, or divide by the same amount to convert the other way. To convert bar to lbs, multiply by 10, or divide by the same amount to convert the other way.

, Use either silicone or glycerin oil, and place a few drops in and around the valve in the soccer ball. This helps maintain the valve, and helps with the needle insertion. Lubricate the needle with the same oil. , It should slide right into the end of the air pump. Lock the needle in with the locking mechanism of the pump. Put the needle tip into the opening of the soccer ball valve., The ball will start to inflate. Go slowly so you don't over-inflate the ball and put unnecessary pressure on the seams. , If your air pump has a built in gauge, just stop once the level on the gauge reaches the recommended air pressure. If your pump doesn't have a gauge, you'll have to pull out the needle and check the pressure with the gauge regularly once it starts to feel firm., Avoid kicking it hard against walls. Never sit or stand on your soccer ball. This puts too much pressure on the stitching of the ball and can cause it to become warped or eventually burst., Ideally, you'll want to check the air pressure of your soccer ball with a gauge every couple of days. The more often it's used, the more often the pressure should be checked. Balls with butyl bladders will retain air much longer than balls with latex bladders., Although not necessary, manufacturers recommend that after a match, you should let a little air out of the your soccer ball. This reduces the stress on the ball when it's not in use. Just don't forget to re-inflate it before using it again., Although quite sturdy, soccer balls are vulnerable to exposure to sharp and abrasive surfaces. Stick to playing either on smooth wooden floors, grass, or turf. Surfaces like gravel and asphalt can damage the ball."

Decide on the right lace placement.",How to Choose Soccer Cleats," If you’ll be playing on a natural grass pitch where it doesn’t rain too regularly, you should use a pair of firm ground shoes. Firm ground shoes usually have ten or more long studs that are distributed evenly throughout the bottom rim of the shoe. They provide a sufficient amount of traction for normal playing conditions. The studs can either be conical or blade shaped.


Conical studs are rounded at the bottom. They allow a player to have flexibility of motion.
Blade shaped studs become thinner at the bottom of the shoe. They’re designed to dig into the pitch and give a player better traction. However, they don’t offer quite as much flexibility as conical studs because it’s harder to remove them from the ground.Firm ground shoes are the safest shoes to buy if you don’t know what type of field you’ll be playing on. They’re considered acceptable for many different playing conditions.;
, If you’ll be playing on a pitch where it rains often you’ll need to wear a pair of soft ground cleats. The studs on a soft ground cleat are similar to those on a firm ground cleat. However, there is usually only about six of them and they are strategically placed so the shoe can offer maximum traction.


The studs on a soft ground cleats can also be conical or blade shaped.
On soft ground shoes, there will be two blades in the back of the shoe on either side of the heel and four blades positioned on the front of the shoe (two on either side about an inch from each other) to maintain balance.
Soft ground shoes should only be used on soft surfaces. Wearing them in other conditions can lead to injury., Hard ground shoes are designed to give players traction and balance on surfaces where much of the grass has been worn down leaving only the rigid ground beneath it. The bottom of a hard ground cleats is covered in small, flat studs. Unlike those of firm ground and soft ground cleats, the studs on a hard ground cleat are spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe.


Hard ground cleats are not designed to dig into the ground. Rather, they offer grip to help a player balance on a solid surface.
Their names may sound similar, but hard ground shoes are not appropriate for firm ground pitches.

, Many soccer leagues are starting to play on turf. It’s easy and cheap to maintain and it stays the same in almost every kind of weather. If turf cleats have studs at all, they’ll be very tiny and spread out over the entire bottom of the shoe. Rather than studs, they may simply have a slightly elevated pattern on the bottom that allows them to offer traction on the turf.Don’t wear turf cleats on any other surface than turf. They don’t have studs long or sharp enough to grip different surfaces.

, If you’re a forward, your main concern on the pitch is to score goals. You’ll need a shoe with a clean strike zone so you can connect with the ball effectively. The strike zone of a soccer cleat is the part that ideally should make contact with the ball. The strike zone or vamp of the shoe is located on the upper front part of the shoe.As a forward, you may also want to get lighter shoes so you can make explosive movements. Look for shoes that weigh anywhere from five to eight ounces.

, If you're a midfielder, you’ll spend most of a match running up and down the field. You’ll need shoes that won’t irritate your feet after spending ninety minutes sprinting back and forth. Make sure you pick shoes with comfortable insoles and midsoles in them with plenty of support for your heels.The insoles are the soft cushions inside of the shoes. Some soccer cleats have removable insoles.
The midsoles are cushions that are built into the shoe.

, If you have a defensive position, your shoes will take a lot of punishment. Get shoes with a tough outsole that can withstand the damage. You’ll need to be able to stop on a dime and change directions easily while tracking opposing forwards. Consider getting shoes with great traction.


You might also want your shoes to have a large strike zone for clearing the ball effectively.
The outsole is the bottom of the shoe that takes damage as you start and stop.

, If you’re a keeper, traction will be the most important part of your shoe. Find shoes that can handle your back and forth motion.You’ll need to be able to dig in your feet and jump from side to side easily. A sizable strike zone will also will also benefit your ability to perform kick-outs and back passes.

, Soccer cleats can be made from a variety of different fabrics. High quality kangaroo leather cleats will mold to your feet after playing in them for a while and they are very durable. However, they are a bit heavier than shoes made from synthetic materials. On the other hand, shoes made using mesh are usually very light weight, but they’re not good for playing in wet conditions as they can allow water to seep into your socks. Try on shoes made from a few different materials before deciding which one you like.Cleats made from calf or goat leather are less expensive than ones made from kangaroo leather and can give you a similar feel.
Some companies are developing synthetic leather strains in response to animal activists. The benefit of artificial leather is that different qualities, like water resistance, can be added to the material.

, You want your shoes to feel snug, but not too tight. There should be about the width of a baby’s finger between your toe and the front of your shoe. If you can feel your toes scraping against the front of the shoe, then they’re too small. If you can fit your entire thumb between your toes and the front, then the shoes are too big.If you have wide feet, you might have to do some searching for shoes that fit you comfortably. Different brands make shoes for different foot widths. For example: Nike designs very thin shoes while Adidas makes shoes that are a little wider.
Wearing shoes that don’t fit you properly can be very painful in a soccer match and can give you blisters on your feet. Long term, they can even cause bunions to form.

, If you plan on playing soccer competitively, you should purchase shoes that are either top-tier or mid-tier as far as quality. The top-tier cleats are the ones that the pros wear. They’re designed to accommodate peak performance play. However, they’re not built to last as professional soccer players often get new shoes every few matches. Mid-tier shoes are cheaper, more durable and often offer performance that is close to that of top-tier shoes.Top-tier shoes usually cost one hundred and fifty dollars or more.
Mid-tier shoes range from eighty to one hundred and fifty dollars.
Low-tier shoes cost from forty to eighty dollars and should only be worn if you’re playing soccer for fun.
Be careful about buying shoes that are originally priced under forty dollars. The quality is often very poor and can increase your risk of injury.

, Modern soccer cleats don’t always have their shoelaces in the center. Some cleats are being designed with their laces toward the outside of the shoe to create a larger strike zone. If you’re used to your laces being central, it can take some time to get used to having them on the side. The lace placement can alter the fit and feeling of the shoe.


If you like your cleats to feel tight, you may want to stick with central laces. Side laced shoes can have a looser feel.

Hit the cleats against each other, sole facing sole, to remove as much excess dirt, grass, and mud, as possible., Use a soft-bristled brush or a cleat specific cleaning tool to scrub the bottoms of the cleats.This will loosen any dry clumps of built up grass and mud on the sole and between the spikes.


When cleaning the sides of the sole that are close to the upper of the shoe, consider switching brushes, and using a toothbrush. A toothbrush will still have abrasive bristles to loosen dirt, but it will be more controllable and easy to focus in on the area you’re scrubbing.
Be careful not to use a stick to remove grass and dirt from the soles of your cleats. A stick could scratch the soles and damage your shoes., The cleaning solution should consist of warm water and a small amount of cleaning solution.Cleaning solutions like dish soap or hand soap work really well. Fill up a container with about two cups of warm water and add about a tablespoon of soap. Mix the water and soap around with the toothbrush until the mixture starts to become sudsy.


You don’t want to add a lot of soap to the cleaning solution, especially if you are planning on cleaning leather cleats. A small amount of soap will suffice.

, Now that you’ve mixed your soapy solution, dip the soft-bristled brush you used earlier to dry clean the soles in the soapy solution and scrub the soles of the shoes.When the brush becomes filled with dirt and grass, run it under a stream of clean water from a sink, dip it into the soapy solution again, and continue scrubbing.


Again, you can use a smaller toothbrush to wet clean the cleats when you move to the upper sides of the shoe, near the top portion of the shoe. The toothbrush will allow you to continue cleaning the sides of the soles, with the precision of a smaller scrub brush.

, Dip a paper towel into the soapy solution and wipe the soles of the shoes to remove any last bits of dirt and grass. The paper towel will gather any remaining debris, and allow you to use your fingers with the paper towel, and reach the areas in between the spikes.

, Unlace the laces from the cleats, and dip them in the soapy solution. Let the laces sit for approximately 10 minutes, then use your fingers and toothbrush to gently scrub the laces and remove dirt build up.After scrubbing the laces, run them under clean water, and lay them out on a towel, on a flat surface, to dry.
You could even lay the laces out in sunlight, but keep in mind that sunlight could possible fade the coloring of the laces., Dip your soft-bristled scrub brush or toothbrush in the soapy water, and scrub the tops of the cleats.Start scrubbing at the middle area of the cleats, near the laces, and work your way down to the sides of the shoe. This will allow the watery dirt to naturally fall downward to the sides of the cleats.


Don’t forget to scrub the tongue of the cleat as well. With the laces removed, you can scrub all areas of the cleat’s tongue.
It may be helpful to insert one hand into the cleat while the other hand scrubs the sides of the cleat.An alternative and equally effective cleaning method for cleaning the upper portions of cleats, is using a cleaning eraser sponge.

, Dip a cleaning eraser sponge into the soapy solution. Wring it out with your hands until most of the water is gone from the eraser. Hold onto the shoe and use the eraser to rub areas of the top portion of the cleat.Be sure to rub the tongue area of the shoe as well, now that it’s more accessible with the laces removed.

, Use a paper towel, or clean, dry rag to dry off the cleats and collect any dirty, soapy water that may be remaining. Dry all parts of the cleats: the tongue, the sides, and the soles.Consider stuffing the inside of the cleats with newspaper to absorb any water that may have made it’s way inside the cleat.

, Once your laces and cleats are completely dry, relace the cleats loosely, put on the cleats, and then make lacing adjustments to make the lacing tighter or looser.

Measure your hands for perfectly fitting gloves, but the following is a general sizing guide for junior and senior players.
For junior players: Size 4 or 5 is for a small junior goalie who is between 7 and 9 years old and wears size Youth Small goalkeeper gear. Size 6 or 7 is for a medium to larger junior goalie who is between 10 and 12 years old and wears Youth Medium or Large goalkeeper gear.For senior players: Size 7 is for a small adult or large youth keeper; Size 8 for a small to medium-sized adult keeper; Size 9 is for a medium-sized adult keeper; Size 10 is for a medium to larger adult-sized keep; Size 11 is for a large-sized keeper; Size 12 is for a large keeper who has very large hands.Visit a local sports store to try on gloves to give you an idea what size you need.;
, If you want goalie gloves that allow you to play most optimally, measure both of your hands because each hand can be a different size. This will also help ensure that your gloves don’t fall apart quickly.


For the best fit, measure the circumference of the widest part of the palm excluding the thumb and round this number up to the next highest inch. Add 1"" to this measurement for your glove size.Every person has one hand that is larger. Measure both hands and order according to the measurements of your bigger hand.
Sizing gloves is not an exact science because every goalkeeper's hand is different. There are also usually slight variations in size between different manufacturers and the quality of the gloves.Goalkeeping gloves should be worn slightly larger than hand size. The gap between your fingers and the top of the glove should be no less than a ¼ inch, with ideal ½ inch being the ideal space. A gap of an inch or more is too much and can affect the way you play.For example, improperly sized fingers can stress the latex material of gloves and also cause premature breakdown or tears of the gloves’ seams., Goalkeeper gloves are made up of two main parts, the backhand and the palm, which are often different materials. Learning about the different material options will help you choose the right gloves for your needs.


Your glove should be made of the cut and materials best suited for the surface(s) on which you play, as well as on local weather conditions and your budget. For example, all palms are made of latex, but only the best types of goalie gloves will have latex backhands, a feature you should consider if you frequently play goalie. Less expensive gloves will have one layer of foam on the backhand and generally do a good job of protecting your hand., In addition to coming in different materials, goalie gloves also come in come in different cuts depending on how the palm material is constructed.Decide which one is best for your needs and hand size.


Flat, or traditional, cut gloves have a single piece of flat foam and are a looser fit with a boxier appearance and exterior stitching.Roll or Gunn cut gloves have a so-called “rolled” finger construction, where the seams roll because they are on the back of the finger. This cut has a snug fit and allows for a larger contact area with the ball.On a negative cut, the seam is on the inside of the glove. It has the most snug fit, and is an excellent option for female goalies as well as those goalkeepers with smaller hands.Hybrid gloves incorporate several cuts, usually a combination of rolled or cut Gunn with either the flat or negative cut., The area of a glove most important to a goalie is the palm grip because it allows him to grasp the ball. In general, more expensive gloves have better grip and less expensive model will offer better durability. There are reasons to consider both types of gloves depending on your needs.Less expensive gloves are a good option for young or beginning players. These models show players the necessity of technique, not tackiness, to defend shots on goal.–
Softer palms have better grip, while rougher palms are more durable. Gloves with rougher palms contain more rubber than tacky latex and are a good option for indoor play.Glove palms come in different thicknesses, with 3mm and 4mm the most common measurement. Thinner palms allow you to feel the ball more, but if you want greater protection, then consider thicker palms.Consider your playing surface when choosing a palm grip. Surfaces like artificial grass can wear down latex quickly. a thicker palm grip would counteract this. Most companies make goalie gloves specifically designed to withstand wet, dry and indoor conditions.It’s important to know the conditions for which your gloves are suited: dry conditions, wet conditions, hard ground, or natural surfaces. This is important information for their care. For example, soft and tacky professional-grade latex palms considered “all weather” or “dry weather” are moistened for play.Wet weather gloves require soaking before a match and possibly again at half time., Since you will be playing with your goalie gloves each game, consider how long a pair will last when you buy them. You may want to get two pairs- one for practice and one for games- so that they last longer.


Gloves will last on average 12 –14 games depending on how well you care for and put stress on them. After this, consider using them as practice gloves.Consider buying one pair for games and another for practice, but decide based on your budget., Once you’ve learned about all of the different goalie gloves available, you’re ready to buy a pair or pairs. You have many options of places you can purchase your gloves, from sports stores to specialty soccer retailers.


There are many options for buying gloves if you are not a professional player or looking for the highest quality models. You can purchase them at large retailers and specialty sports stores both in-store and online.
If you are a serious and experienced goalie, you can buy high-quality models at sports stores or online at specialty soccer retailers.

, Latex begins to deteriorate as soon as you use it, and the more often you play, the quicker your goalie gloves will wear down. But by caring for your gloves properly, you can decrease the speed at which you have to replace them.Soft and tacky latex palm grips, like that in professional grade gloves, gives exceptional grip at the expense of durability. Very tacky game gloves can show signs of wear, including flaking, during the first use.

, Ensure that your game gloves stay in optimal shape by using training gloves. You can either use an old pair or game gloves or buy an inexpensive pair, which has the benefit of forcing you to work on your technique.Buy a relatively inexpensive training glove that has less palm grip but more durability. Not only will this save your game gloves, but it will refine your technical skills.You can convert old match gloves to training gloves once you have a new pair. It’s important to maintain one quality pair for matches and another for training., Your gloves will get the most use during a match, so caring for them during the match is important. This is particularly important with “all weather” or “wet weather” models.


Many areas of a soccer field can be dirty or muddy depending on the weather. If you warm up in these areas, it can reduce the efficacy of your gloves, so consider warming up someplace where there is less dirt. You can also use your training gloves for the warm up period.
Softer latex gloves need moistened with water as the palm dries, but very soft latex palms can become slippery if they’re too moist. Figure out the correct balance before a match so you don’t hamper your efforts to defend shots on goal.

, Using your gloves will make them dirty no matter how carefully you play. Dirt and sweat breakdown the glove’s latex and will eventually affect your game. By cleaning your gloves after every use or every few uses, you will extend their life.Clean each of your gloves separately and delicately.
Put on one glove and run it under lukewarm water. Use a mild detergent or glove specific cleaner to clean off dirt, grime, and sweat.Rinse until the water runs clear and then press out excess water. Don’t wring out your gloves, which can tear the seams.Hang your gloves to dry naturally without the aid of anything that will accelerate the drying process like a hair dryer or the sun, which will cause them to dry out and deteriorate more quickly.You can roll newspaper and place it in the fingers to help them keep their shape and dry more quickly., After you’ve played a game or washed your gloves, it’s important to store your gloves properly. Most gloves will come with a bag specifically made for storing them.Store your gloves in a cool and reasonably moist environment.You don’t want the gloves or the storage area to be wet because this can promote the growth of bacteria or mold, which will break down your gloves.
Don’t just throw your gloves in a bag and forget about them until the next game. Wipe them off if necessary and then place them in their storage bag. If they’re especially sweaty, allow them to dry a bit before you place them in the storage bag.Don’t place them with palms together when you store your gloves since they can stick together and then rip when you try to separate them.

, Your goalie gloves are a close and contained space that are exposed to sweat and bacteria that can promote odor. By properly cleaning and storing them, you’ll inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold that make your gloves smell.


Making sure to clean your gloves with a disinfectant will help remove sweat and bacteria so they don’t smell.
Airing out your gloves properly will ensure that they do get moldy or promote the growth of odor-causing bacteria. This means that you should allow your gloves to dry thoroughly after each game and cleaning.

Choose a colour other than your team's.,

Choose a style.",How to Choose a Goalie Pinnie," You may think this step is crazy, but it's true. If you're wearing a blue goalie pinnie, and your team's colour is blue, you won't be allowed to wear that pinnie in play. This is because the referee can't easily tell who can pick up the ball, and neither can the other team. This gives you an unfair advantage, which is why it is illegal. So pick a colour that's very different from your team's.;
, A goalie pinnie shouldn't be like another layer. It should just be a light garment. You can get a heavier one for the winter, and a lighter one for this summer, because this helps some people.

, Many pinnies have padding on the side of the arms, but many don't. If you dive a lot, you should get this handy padding. If you don't, it's not as recommended that you get it. But if you are planning on learning soon, you should get the padding.

, During winter, it is recommended that you get a fitting pinnie. During summer, you may want a slightly looser pinnie. You can also change the length of the pinnie if you'd prefer a longer shirt.

, Pinnies can be long sleeved or t-shirt style. You should choose according to the season and the weather. If you'd like, you could even get one of each; one for warm days, and one for cold days. This way, you'll never be caught off guard.

Pick the right type for its intended use.,
Factor in where you will be playing.,
Select the right size.,
Decide how much you're willing to spend.,
Test each ball.",How to Choose a Soccer Ball1," Choose a ball that is specifically designed for the type of play for which it will be used most often. Ask yourself if this is for the occasional fun game, regular training, or official matches. From there, decide between:Premium match balls
Match balls
Training balls
Mini/skills balls;
, First, determine whether you will be playing inside or outside. Next, consider the surface on which you will be playing. If it isn’t natural grass, buy a ball that is appropriate for that surface. Choose between:Indoor balls
Beach/street balls
Turf balls for artificial grass

, If you are purchasing a ball to train for league soccer, buy the appropriate size ball for your age group. Refer to your coach or league officials to find out the exact size needed. This may vary from league to league, but they generally follow these guidelines:#5: ages 12 and over
#4: ages 8 to 12
#3: ages 7 and under
#2 and #1: not used in matches, but can be used for fun or to develop footwork, Soccer balls range in price from a few bucks to a few hundred. If you're purchasing a ball, consider what use it is intended for. Also think about how often you expect to use it.If you're just looking for a ball to kick around once in a while, a cheap one should suffice.
For children, purchasing a cheaper ball is usually a good idea even if they're in a league, since they will age out of the current size needed.
For extensive use, it's usually worth investing in a quality ball, since they are more durable.
Do a little research about specific balls if you're willing to spend a lot of money, since the most expensive aren't necessarily the best.

, If you're simply trying to choose the best ball to play with (as opposed to buying one), take a few from the bag, closet, or wherever. Inspect the seams to make sure they're intact. Discard any that are missing panels or have loose ones, since these will affect the ball's play. Then give them a few test kicks and dribbles. Pick whichever one goes where you intended it to go, at the speed that you wanted it to travel.If you have a pump handy, don't immediately discard any under-inflated balls. Balls with latex bladders are often considered the best, but they do lose air more quickly than others.

Choose shin guards with attached ankle protection for players 12 years old and under.,
Consider slide-in shin guards for older players.,
Size shin guards based on your height.,
Ensure the guard protects a few inches under the knee to just above the ankle.,
Get a guard that comfortably molds to the width of your leg.,
Try on shin guards with a soccer sock before buying.",How to Buy Youth Soccer Shin Guards1," There are two basic types of shin guards. One type has attached ankle straps, which wrap under the foot and provides support and ankle protection. The other type simply slides under your socks and protect just your shins. For players under 12 the added ankle support is crucial for safety and comfort.Currently, there are some hybrid guards that come down to cover the ankle but don't actually wrap around it. These tend to be more expensive, however, as they need a very precise fit.;
, As players grow more serious about soccer, they tend to find the ankle-guards too bulky, as they can limit your foot's range of motion. By ages 10-12, many youth players switch to slide-ins, which you simply push under the socks. They do not cover your ankles. While slightly less protective, the added speed is essential for higher levels of competition.

, Shin guards come in the standard sizes from x-small all the way to XL, but just because you wear a large jersey doesn't mean you need a large guard. For the most part, let height be your guide:



Small: 0 - 5'2"" (0 - 160cm)

Medium: 5'2"" - 5'10"" (160cm - 180cm)

Large: 5'10"" - 6'4"" (180cm - 195cm)

X-Large: 6'4"" + (195cm and up), While the guide above is best for 90% of players, everyone is different. As a rule of thumb, you want the guard to cover from below the knee to right before your ankle bends.

, Professional players actually have guards that are custom-molded to their shins. While this is overkill for youth soccer, the basic idea is a good one -- you want snug, complete protection around your shins. When looking at your legs from the front, the shinguard should cover the entire width of your leg.


Most shin guards can be lightly bent with your fingers to curve them to your leg. Do not yank on them, however, as this can cause them to weaken., The best way to buy guards is to see what feels comfortable. When going to the store, bring a pair of long soccer socks with you. Slide the guards on and walk around a bit, even jogging if possible, and see if they stay snugly in place. They should be comfortable and cover the majority of your leg.

Check the bonding.,
Count the number of panels.,
Feel its weight and hardness.,
Check the bladder’s material.,
Decide between outside materials.",How to Choose a Soccer Ball2," Inspect between the panels on the outside of the ball. Make sure they are sewn together. Avoid glue and other bonds, which weaken more easily. Save yourself the trouble of replacing balls regularly by sticking to ones that are stitched, since they are more durable.Premium balls tend to be stitched by hand, while cheaper balls are stitched by machine., Depending on the type of ball, this may be anywhere from 6 to 32. As reference, consider the balls used by the U.S. Major League Soccer, which have 18. Expect the number of panels to affect the ball’s play. Based on your preference, choose:A lower number for more speed.
A higher number for easier control.

, Pick a ball that is less likely to hurt you and other players when kicked, caught, or headbutted. Avoid balls that feel especially heavy or rock-hard. At the same time, avoid very soft balls, since these are more likely to bounce and go off-target.Ideally, choose the lightest ball you can find. If this is for league play or training, refer to their guidelines about acceptable weight.
#5 balls typically weigh between 14 and 16 ounces (397 to 454 g).
#4 balls should weigh be between 12 and 13 ounces (340 to 369 g).
#3 balls should be between 11 and 12 ounces (312 to 340 g).

, Refer to the product description. Expect the bladder inside the ball to be made of either butyl or latex. For the best play, opt for latex, since latex balls are more responsive to footwork than butyl.One drawback to latex is that they need to be refilled with air more frequently than butyl.

, Expect most modern balls to be covered in either PU (polyurethane) or PVC (polyvinyl carbonate). Choose between them based on your needs, since each offers different strong points. However, be aware that the quality of material in each case may vary, meaning that not all PVC balls are equal to each other; ditto with PU balls.PU: more responsive to foot work; generally used for match balls.
PVC: more durable; used for training and indoor balls.
Leather: still used in some construction, but frowned upon due to its absorption of water.

Research before purchasing.,
Look for official approval.,
Refer to your league’s guidelines.",How to Choose a Soccer Ball3," Expect product descriptions on packaging to lack key information.Go online to research different brands and models before buying. Check the following:More detailed product descriptions on manufacturer’s websites.
Customer reviews, ratings, and top sellers.
Soccer forums for discussions about the best balls.

, If you’re in doubt about the quality of a particular ball, check to see what organizations have approved it. Rely on their extensive testing to determine which balls are deemed appropriate for official play. Such organizations include:FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association,"" or ""International Federation of Association Football"")
NFHS (National Federation of High Schools)
NCAA (National Collegiate Athletics Association)

, If you are playing within an organized league, find out what specifications their match balls must meet. Make sure you are purchasing a ball of the correct size, weight, materials, and construction. Even if you are only looking to buy a training ball, find out what match balls they use so you can train with a similar ball.Practicing with a training ball that resembles their match ball as closely as possible will minimize the variations that may occur when the two different balls are in play.

Get a bigger, bulkier shinguard as a defender.,
Look for lighter, faster guards for forwards and midfielders.,
Get light, minimal-protection guards as a goalie.,
Get plastic shin guards for the best price and carbon fiber for the best protection.,
Buy a sleeve or straps to keep shin guards in place all game long.,
Purchase NOCSAE approved guards if you're playing for middle or high school soccer teams.",How to Buy Youth Soccer Shin Guards2," When you're back protecting the box you're getting a lot more action coming at you, from hard shots to attacking players. As such, defenders tend to prefer something with a bit more protection than a striker. For youth defenders, it's not a bad idea to keep using ankle guards or something with ankle protection., When you're sprinting at the goal, you want something small that in no way limits your mobility. If there is any difference between strikers and midfielders, it is that forwards and strikers sometimes opt for added ankle protection, like longer shin guards, to protect against tackling defenders., The last thing you want to do in net is keep adjusting or worrying about your guards. Since they're generally much less needed in the box, keepers tend to get the smallest guards they can get away with.

, These are the two most common shin guard materials. Both will work great, but depending on your needs as a player one may be better than the other. Plastic is generally most budget-friendly for less serious players, whereas carbon fiber is both lighter and stronger for high-level play.


Carbon fiber is recognizable by the distinctive ""cross-hatching"" pattern it has, where the materially looks like a tightly woven basket.

, No player wants to constantly look down and readjust their shin guards. If you're wearing slide-ins, you may want a thin, breathable sleeve that slides on under your socks. You can then slide the shin guard into the sleeve, pulling the sock over both. Some players prefer simple Velcro straps, as well, which can go above or underneath your sock.


In a pinch, athletic wrapped above and below the shin guard and sock can keep them in place all game long.

, The National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, NOCSAE, must approve all US high school shin guards. This is only true for games through your actual school, not for high-school aged players on other teams. There should be a NOCSAE seal or stamp on the shin guard or attached tag.


All NOCSAE approved guards will be clearly labeled on the packaging when you go shopping. No stamp, no approval."

Kick your shot to the side away from where you want it to curve.",How to Curve a Soccer Ball," Approach the ball at an angle. You will plant your non kicking foot about 12-16 inches away from the ball.


Set up slightly off center from where you would if you wanted to kick the ball straight.
A right footed kicker should approach the ball from left to right and a left footed kicker from right to left.
Begin your approach 7-10 feet back with enough room for 3 strides before kicking.;
, In order to make the ball curve, you have to make the ball spin in flight. Spinning the ball is achieved by applying more force to one side than the other.

, To make the ball curve to the left you need to kick it on the right side to apply counter-clockwise spin. Kicking the ball on the left side will make it spin clockwise and curve right., The amount of spin on the ball will vary based upon how hard you kick and where you strike the ball.Practice different strengths of kicks to see which gives you the most spin.
Strike the ball in different positions to vary the amount of spin you give the ball.

, Place a cone 20-30 feet in front of where the ball is placed. Use this as a guide to practice curving the ball around the cone.


Place the cone directly in front of your kicking path.
Aim the ball to the side of the cone.
Try to get the ball to curve back around the cone after passing it.

, As you strike the ball aim for a spot that is near the bottom of the ball to provide lift. Depending on which side of the ball you kick, you will get different directions of spin, and consequently, different directions of curve.


Clockwise spin, from a kick to the left side of the ball, will create a curve to the right.
Counter-clockwise spin, from a kick to the right side of the ball, will curve the ball to the left.

, As you move your leg forward and strike the ball, add extra spin by pushing the ball around with your foot.While your foot is in contact with the ball bring your leg across your body to give the ball extra spin.

, There are many times when curving a soccer ball can be useful during a game. Try kicking the ball with spin from various field positions to practice for game time:Corner Kicks
Free Kicks
Penalty Kicks

, How much spin you put on the ball depends on how much curve you want your shot to take.


Curving around a wall of defenders requires lots of spin.
Curving the ball to fool a goalie on a free kick may require less spin.
To score on your own corner kick takes a large curve.

, The Magnus Effect causes a ball to curve or bend in the direction it is spinning. If you want the ball to curve right, it should spin to the right., If you are planning to curve the ball to the left, kick the ball a little to the left of your target to account for the curve. Conversely, if you plan to curve the ball to the right, you should aim left of your target.

Master dribbling skills.,
Dribble the ball on one side.,
Lie with your hands and eyes.,
Feint in the wrong direction.,
Drop the ball out of reach.,
Cross the ball to your opposite side.,
Follow through with your empty hand.",How to Crossover1," Learn these before you try a crossover. You'll need to be able to dribble with both hands and pass the ball between them, without looking at the ball.;
, The goal of the crossover is to fool the defending player so you can slip past. If you plan to move to the left, start by dribbling with your right hand. If you plan to move to the right, dribble on your left side instead.


Dribble hard to keep possession. The ball should return to your hand right away after it hits the floor.
This is most convincing when you start out on your best side, dribbling with your dominant hand.

, For this trick to work, you have to sell it with your body language. Keep your eyes focused in the direction you don't plan on moving. Keep your feet and shoulders aligned toward that direction as well, but be ready to pivot at a moment's notice.


Make occasional eye contact with the defender.
Keep your knees bent. Straight legs will slow you down.

, Hesitate for a split second, then make a tiny lunge in the direction you've been looking. Ideally, the defender will reflexively move to block you, leaving him off-balance.


Lift the leg on the side you're pretending to move.

, When the defender moves toward you, reverse the feinting motion. Drop the ball down out of their reach, and hunch low to the ground. The ball should land directly below your nose. For the rest of the crossover, the ball should remain below your waist, and preferably below your knees.

, Keeping your hands below your waist, cross the ball to your undefended side. You can either pass the ball between your legs, or just in front of your knee. Keep your head up as you do this.


This is the most difficult part of the crossover. Practice while standing still, with your legs apart and your eyes on the ball. Once you've mastered that, practice with your eyes straight ahead. Finish by practicing while jogging, then running.

, The hand that was originally dribbling should follow through after passing, barely touching your opposite knee. If you can make this part of one, smooth motion with the crossover, you probably have the correct technique.

Be realistic.,
Place the ball on the ground on the right side of 18-yard line for righties and on the left side for lefties.

When kicking the ball, kick as though you slightly roll it just along the outside of your kicking foot's toe-to-ball of feet.

","How to Bend or ""Curve"" a Soccer Ball"," Curving a soccer ball is actually a lot harder to do than you might think. This will require plenty of ongoing practice, preferably with friends or other team players.
,,, If you want it to swerve to the right, kick the ball on the left side and vice versa for swerving it to the left. It is much easier to start out with curving the ball to the left.

, Aim for a bottom-right panel on the ball. Place your planting foot (left foot if you kick with right, and vice versa) at a 45 degree angle towards the ball. Take your footwear off and look at your foot. Feel the inside of your shooting foot. Feel just below the end of your big toe bone. Now move another 3⁄4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) towards your ankle. This is where you should make contact with the ball. When you actually kick, your kicking foot should wrapped around to the left side of your body (for righties).


Hit the ball with the inside of your foot. When smacking the ball with the inside of the foot, be sure to follow through with your foot.

,, Step 7.

Take your approach at a slight angle from the ball.,
Mind your planting foot as you begin to kick the ball.,
Keep the hand that's on the planting side of the body out for balance.,
Hit the ball with the inside of your foot, just where your toe ends and your foot begins.,
Do not move your planting foot.,
Meanwhile, follow through by swinging your kicking leg in towards the goal after the ball is kicked.,
If you want lift on your ball, strike it from underneath it.",How to Bend a Soccer Ball1," Approach the ball as you would normally, except prepare to hit the ball with the inside of your striking foot.


Generally, your body alignment will not be facing the goal. If you're kicking the ball with your inside right foot, your body will be faced slightly to the right of the target. If you're kicking the ball with your inside left foot, your body will be faced slightly to the left of the target.;
, Your planting foot is the foot that you aren't kicking with, the foot that will be the anchor to your kicking foot. Plant your non-kicking foot facing slightly towards the direction of the initial bend, so that when you strike the ball with the inside of your foot, both feet are almost parallel(~.3 m) away. Place it far enough away so that you can easily hit the ball with the inside of your foot, but close enough so that you don't have to strain to get there, taking power away from your shot.

, You're moving through the ball, and your body is curving slightly as it kicks the ball. Keeping your planting-side handout and up while you kick will help add power to your shot and give you balance on the follow-through.

, The ball will roll back along the inside of your foot. You should be striking the ball in the bottom left corner if you're shooting the ball with your right foot.









Look at the ball straight on as if it were a circle and imagine a cross (+) across the center of it. For a right-footed strike, hit the bottom right quadrant of the ball. For a left-footed strike, hit the bottom left quadrant of the ball.

, This foot should still be pointing down the original red line. Keep it balanced and firm with the help of your arms.








, Try to bring your kicking leg across your body, so that you exaggerate the outside-inside swinging motion and are sure to follow through with your kick.








, There should be sufficient lift to take the ball up and over the wall. As your foot comes across and around, you create ball spin, which will make the ball bend and dip! You can increase the height at which the ball rises by leaning your shoulders back during contact. Remember to put enough spin and dip on it to bring it goal-wards again.


Lean back if you want the ball to go up or lean forwards if you want to curl the ball downwards. This technique can be performed using any kick with the same results.

Approach the ball.,
Plant your non-kicking foot to the side of the ball.Although a lot of attention is given to the kicking foot in soccer technique, the non-kicking foot is arguably just as important.,
Angle your toe downward.Approach the ball, and keep your toes as down to the ground as possible.,
Scoop the ball.,
Launch the ball upward.,
Lean your body back as you kick.As you scoop and finally launch the ball upward, shift some of your weight backward.,
Trick your opponents.One variation on chipping is the false kick.,

Decide whether chipping is appropriate.,
Keep an eye out for backspin.Backspin refers to the spinning motion of the ball itself while it's in the air.,
Wear proper soccer shoes.Executing a proper chip in soccer requires having a sleek enough shoe to get under the ball with.,
Practice using both feet.",How to Chip a Soccer Ball," Executing a chip usually occurs in situations where there isn't much room to navigate yourself or the ball in. For the sake of practice however, it's a good idea to get a bit of a running start. By running towards the ball, you'll be working on your timing. Run towards the ball as if you were about to kick it. It's a good idea to know which foot you're planning on chipping the ball with beforehand.









Although you can chip a ball dead-ahead, it helps to approach the ball at a slight angle.This will give your ball backspin, which leads to better control.;
, As you're coming in with your kicking foot, keep your non-kicking foot planted firmly, approximately half a foot to the side and back of your ball.


Depending on whether you're using your right or left foot to kick with, your non-kicking will go to the back-left or back-right of the ball. If facing forward is north, you can think of it as Southwest and Southeast.

, In order to properly scoop beneath the ball, you'll need your foot low. It may help to think of your kicking foot like a wedge you're trying to slide underneath the ball.

, The trick to proper chipping lies in the way you come from under the ball. Bring your foot in under the ball, either from the side or dead-ahead.You should aim to get the fronts of your laces under the ball. Planting your aim to the left or right of the ball will result in the ball flying in a different direction.









Practicing scooping is made easier if the ball is rolling towards you. This allows you to focus on the placement and angle of your foot, rather than the motion itself.It's a good idea to practice with straightforward scoops if you're new to it. You can practice scooping by running up to the ball and planting your feet under it, without going through with the kicking motion. It's important you get this step figured out first before moving on.

, When you have your foot wedged in beneath the soccer ball, launch the ball up with a swift upward motion. Bring your knee and shoe up and aim to launch it up and forward. If done with the proper scooping motion and force, this should result in a long arc. If you are looking to gauge the effectiveness of your chip launches, try to measure the distance in terms of yards. 15-20 yards is a good place to start, although some of the best soccer players manage to get over 60 with a chip.








It's important not to confuse this with a forceful kick. Launching the ball upward should be done in a swift motion, but you should be using finesse rather than force to launch it up. Soccer balls aren't heavy, so it won't take a lot to get it in the air., This will improve the lift of the ball, resulting in a more powerful chip.








, If you're about to chip a ball, you should rush up to it as if you were about to kick it normally. Then, at the last second, revert to your chipping form and launch it upward. This is a perfect tactic if you're trying to get the ball into the net. If the opposing goalie falls for your ruse, he'll try to defend a different attack than the one you're sending at him.








, Even if you're not playing competitively yet, it's helpful to have another person practicing with you while you're working on your soccer chips. After you have the basic chip figured out, having a real person to aim and pass your ball towards will help you deduce the amount of force and propulsion needed to launch the ball a given distance. When you're playing competitively, you'll need the calculations between force and distance to come naturally, so lots of practice is recommended before you take to the field against another team.









If you don't have another person to practice with, you should try practicing chipping the ball at different distances. For example, you might begin by trying to chip the ball at a distance of 20 yards. If you manage to achieve that distance regularly, increase the distance by 10 yards. Push yourself as far as you think you'll be able to go. From there, you should mix up the distances and train your calculations., Chipping is seen as an advanced kicking technique compared to other passes. The amount of control and backspin needed to succeed doesn't make it preferable if you have a chance to pass normally. Rather, chipping the ball should be used in situations where you're surrounded by other players, or need to get the ball directly past the opposition. If the ball's launched in a high enough arc, it will be impossible for others to get it until it comes back down.








It's important to remember that this goes both ways. If you chip a ball, your teammates won't be able to get the ball either until it lands. Because of this, it's a good idea to use it tactically.

, For the sake of chipping, backspin is a sign that you've executed the technique successfully. Backspin allows you and your teammates to control the ball more easily. It also results in a more potent arc.


You can improve your backspin by emphasizing wedging your feet directly beneath the ball, as well as approaching the ball at a slight angle.

, Most regular street shoes are too bulky to chip effectively with. Even if you're only playing for fun, it's recommended you pick up a pair of soccer-specific shoes. Your performance on the field can improve purely on the basis of what you're wearing.

, In sports, it's important to be as versatile as you can. Particularly in a competitive setting, there are going to be plenty of circumstances where it's not opportune to use your preferred kicking foot. Although most players have a foot they prefer, the most sensible athletes make sure to balance their training across both sides of the body.

Keep the hand that's on the planting side of the body out for balance and power.,
Hit the ball with the outside of your foot, bringing your striking foot across your body.,
Follow through by swinging your kicking leg across your body, much like you would on an inside bend kick.",How to Bend a Soccer Ball2," For a right-footed kick, this means approaching the ball and aiming just to the left of your target.

, Aim your planting foot to the left of your target. Your planting foot is going to be farther back and farther away from the wall than you would be trying and inside-bend shot.


Keep your planting foot stationary as you prepare to kick the ball and then eventually kick it. Moving your planting foot will interfere with the continuous motion of your kicking foot, leeching power from your shot.

, Again, having a hand out for support and balance is important here. Your hand doesn't need to be all the way up in the air but it shouldn't be completely on the side of your body.

, If you're putting a cross (+) on the ball and you're approaching to hit with the right foot, you're going to want to hit the bottom middle, or bottom left, of the ball.

, The motion is similar, but the results are different because you're striking the ball with the outside of your foot.


Right-footed players are trying to get the ball to spin clockwise by hitting it on the outside of their foot and then moving the foot left, across their body.
Left-footed players are trying to get the ball to spin counter-clockwise by hitting it on the outside of their foot and then moving the foot right, across their body.

Stretch out your hamstring first.",How to Punt a Soccer Ball," The only player on the soccer field who will ever pick up the ball for a punt is the goalie. There is no circumstance in soccer that allows any other player to punt the ball. While you might be called on occasionally in practice to pick up the ball and punt it, it's not a skill that you need to practice unless you're the goalie.


Punts must be made within the 18 yard (16.5 m) box. When you pick up the ball, you can punt anywhere inside your box. If you want to take it outside of the box, you've got to drop it on the ground.;
, When you pick up the ball, hold it in both hands gently, at a height about even with your waist. It doesn't need to be perfect, but it's usually easiest to punt the ball by dropping it from waist-height and no higher. Your arms should be out straight from your body, with the ball held in your fingers.


You'll see many goalies dribbling the ball before they punt it, or holding it in one hand while they gesture, but you should hold onto the ball securely with two hands as you complete your pre-punt steps. Don't try to get fancy. Just hold the ball.
Punting a soccer ball will happen pretty fast, which means a lot of steps will have to happen at once. Most goalies will have the ball in one hand as they take the steps and extend and drop it in one big fluid motion. Practice blending all these steps together to make it comfortable for you., Take your lead step with the step you'll eventually kick with. Your dominant foot should be used to punt the ball, which is the foot you'd normally kick with. If you're right-footed, take your first step with your right foot.


Some goalies will elect to take multiple steps, but all you need is two. One lead step and one plant step is all that’s necessary, before bringing your lead leg up and following through with the punt. Practice some to see what is most comfortable and powerful for you.

, This will provide your pivot point, form which you'll lift your kicking leg and launch the ball into play. Your two lead-up steps should happen quickly, and be spread fairly far apart, as if you were about to take off running. This will put more power into your kick. The lead steps should happen at the speed of a jog, regardless of how many steps you choose to take in your lead-up.


As you plant, your kicking leg should be cocked back behind you, trailing from your initial step. You'll swing it forward to kick with.

, When you plant your pivot foot and leg, imagine your kicking foot is attached by a magnet to the ball. Rotate your hip so your leg comes up perpendicular to the ground, swinging into the ball and making contact. Keep your eyes locked on the ball at all times and stay focused.The punt should come from the hip. try to picture your kicking leg as a club that you’re whipping up into the ball as it falls, cranking from your hip joint.
Rather than coming straight up, many soccer players will cross their leg over their plant leg. A lot of the punt has to do with where you want it to go and what feels most comfortable for you. Practice punting and making the ball go where you want, not on the ""perfect"" technique.

, The moment just before you start to bring your kicking leg up and swing freely into the ball, remember to drop it straight down in front of you. Just let go. Never toss the ball up to attempt to punt it, or throw it out in front of you. Let your momentum carry you into the ball naturally, don't try to get fancy by throwing it anywhere specifically. The odds of your missing it become much greater if you toss it. Drop it instead.

, As you're swinging your leg into the kick, point the toes of your kicking foot. The ball should make contact with the hardest part of your foot, just along the laces. As soon as it does, point your foot up, so it makes a right-angle with your shin, as if you were standing normally. This will help to put more lift and distance into your kick.


Never try to kick the ball with your instep, the tips of your toes, or with any other part of your foot. This will cause the ball to skew off in unpredictable directions.

, When you’re finished, your foot should come up and point straight in the direction where you want the ball to go, lifting you off the ground gently. You shouldn't have to jump, necessarily, but be careful to let your body follow through with the kick so you don't hyper-extend your hamstring and stretch out your leg uncomfortably. Land gently on your pivot leg, turning your attention immediately back to your goalkeeping duties.

, Ideally, a punt is an essential transition from defense into offense for your team. If you were quick enough to make a big save, help your team by transitioning quickly and efficiently back into offense, putting the ball into play for your team. Look for open players and open spaces where your players will be able to run onto the ball.


You want to be quick, but not too quick. Wait until the opposing players clear out of the box and give you enough room to make your punt. Everyone should be heading back downfield to get on defense, and your players should be streaking downfield to get open on offense.

, You don't just want to punt randomly, or send the ball back immediately to the other team. Look for open spaces that your teammates will be able to run onto the ball. The momentum should be carrying the ball in the appropriate direction, allowing you to have the advantage, as long as an opponent doesn't get a head or a foot on it. Look for open space and send the ball toward it.

, Think of a punt as the first play of an offensive movement. Don't just send the ball straight up into the air because it's fun. try to make something happen with it. Eventually, you want the ball to be going toward your opponent's goal, not straight up in the air. It's harder for your teammates to control a very high-arcing punt, so focus on keeping your punts long and accurate, not super-high and out of control.


If your punts tend to go extremely high, focus on letting the ball drop down a little farther before you make contact with it. Most goalies drop the ball almost all the way to the ground before making contact. Start dropping the ball slightly earlier in your punt to get the timing correct.

, One excellent way of controlling wild punts is in working on your back-spin, making the ball arc and head downfield, but stop rolling upon landing, giving your punt a more reliable accuracy. This is done by bringing your toe up as soon as you make contact with the ball, creating a right angle with your foot and your shin. If you can punt like this, it'll be a lot easier for your teammates to control the punt eventually.

, Instead of punting, you can also roll the ball to one of your teammates after the opposition has cleared out, or you can throw the ball to your teammates as they’re transitioning into offense. This can sometimes be a much-quicker, though less powerful, way of getting the ball into play. If your opponents defenders are pushed way up toward the midfield, punting might turn the ball right back over to them. It might be smarter to roll the ball to one of your defenders and transition into offense that way.


It's also common for some goalies to toss the ball onto the ground and take an impromptu free-kick. You'll definitely want to make sure that all of your opponents have cleared out completely if you try this, because they'll be able to come in for a challenge as soon as you put the ball on the ground.

, Because you’ll be stretching your kicking leg somewhat high to complete a punt, it’s important to stretch out thoroughly before attempting or practicing punts, and never attempt to punt “cold.” Always follow through with your kicks to keep your hamstrings safe and loose.

Understand our ""natural kick"".,
Start the soccer player by learning the angle kick.

,
The angle kick starts with the player approaching the ball from an angle.,
Pointing the toe at a ""4 o'clock"" angle and keeping the leg slightly bent through the entire kick will ""shorten the leg"" so the player does not stub their toe.,
Next we introduce the straight kick.

,
Stand upright and place your foot on the ground in front of you.,
You strike the soccer ball with the laces in full, not just a part of them.,
During the straight kick the leg travels straight back and straight forward.,
Standing with the ball next to your plant foot, draw back your kicking foot with your toe pointed to the ground.

,
Your foot should go straight back.,
Repeat both kicks in SLOW MOTION and do them over and over.",How to Cure Toe Kick in Soccer," A child doesn’t change anything about their natural walking or running stride when they first start to kick a soccer ball. It is almost like the soccer ball just happens to get in the way of their natural stride. As we walk or run as humans our toe naturally points forward as it moves forward. Keeping the toe down would cause us to walk or run looking like a Clydesdale horse. Also, when we bring our leg forward there is VERY little clearance between the bottom of the foot and the ground. Pointing the toe down will cause it to hit the ground, often causing serious injury.;
,, The leg comes back behind the player, returns OUT to the ball and then swings back around in front. The ball is struck with the ""sweet spot"" which is slightly on the inside of our foot, just above the big toe.

, The player MUST maintain eye contact on the ball while performing the kick.

,, Then hold a soccer ball over your foot. Let it fall and watch where it strikes your foot. It will hit the very top of your foot. This is where you strike the ball with a straight kick.

, The laces travel directly towards your target and the foot is not tilted or angled in any way.

, It does not come from behind you or wrap around you in the front after the kick.

,, Allow your leg to bend at the knee, but do not allow your toe position to change. This will cause your toe to ""point to the sky"" when it reaches the fully back position. Now allow your leg to swing forward maintaining the bend in your knee and the toe down position.

, DO NOT perform them at full speed until the soccer player has learn how to shorten their leg by maintaining the bend in their leg and raising their hip slightly. You can also get more info about plant foot positioning at Blast The Ball.

Find a flat surface, like a field or driveway.,
Place the soccer ball on your preferred foot.

,
Hold your leg stiff.

,
Put your foot in such a way that your toe is trying to touch your shin; this will help the ball stay in place.

,
Move your foot the opposite way the ball is moving.,
Hold it against your toe parts, so the ball can't move forward.,
Roll it on your foot once you get more practice and feel confident.

",How to Balance a Soccer Ball on Your Foot,";
,,,, This would balance the ball on your foot correctly.

, Your foot and toes are forcing it back, so if you balance it like that, it won't fall off your foot.

,"
"
Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest.,
Keep your knees slightly bent.,
Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach.,
Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet.",How to Juggle a Soccer Ball1," Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces.









Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot.
If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick.Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball.
Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick.;
, Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground.








It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest keys to balancing is to keep you knees bent and your eyes on the ball.

, You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it!








, Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet.









You can ""catch"" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.

"
"
Drop the ball and let it bounce.,
Let the ball drop and then kick it up with your left foot.,
Catch the ball once you have kicked it once with both feet.",How to Juggle a Soccer Ball2," Kick it up with your right foot. Try to keep the kick controlled and aim to kick the ball straight up in the air. Try to kick it no higher than your waist.








, Again, try to keep your kick light and controlled so that the ball only goes up to your waist. Smaller kicks are easier to control and better for learning how to alternate feet. Be prepared for the fact that you will probably move around a lot while you learn how to alternate feet.







, Readjust if you have moved around and then drop the ball again. When you have kicked the ball with both feet twice, catch the ball. Then try kicking it three times with both feet, then four times etc. You'll have mastered this step when you can stand in one place and keep juggling the ball between your feet indefinitely.








"
"
Place the ball at your feet.,
Position yourself so you can kick the ball up with your other foot.,
Keep the foot you are kicking with near the ground.",How to Juggle a Soccer Ball3," Take your dominant kicking foot, and place it on top of the ball. Roll your foot down the ball just strong enough to create a backspin on the ball. Place your toe underneath the ball, and allow the ball to roll up your foot. Immediately kick the ball straight up, as if you were going to catch it with your hands.








, Do this as the ball comes back down. Alternate feet and continue to juggle as you learned how to do in the previous section. Every time the ball drops, do not pick it up--use your foot to roll the ball up on your laces and start juggling again.








, Moving your leg up too high while you kick the ball will make you lose control of the ball. The power behind the ball comes from your foot, not from your leg.








"
"
Lift one knee so that it is perpendicular to your body.,
Hold the ball above your thigh.,
Juggle with your thighs the way you would juggle with your feet.,
Alternate between thighs.,
Alternate between your thighs and feet.",How to Juggle a Soccer Ball4," Doing this will keep your thigh flat. A flat surface is much easier to juggle off of then an angular surface.









Try to juggle with your thighs only after you have mastered juggling with your feet. Juggling with your thighs is a way to add versatility to your juggling skills. It will also allow you to keep the ball more in control.

, Let the ball drop onto the middle part of your thigh. If you bounce the ball off of your knee, it is almost guaranteed to go flying out of reach., Begin by bouncing the ball off your thigh and catching it. Repeat this process until you are able to control the direction of the ball and how high it goes with your thigh. Switch to the other thigh and repeat the process.








, Do this when you feel confident that you can control the ball with both thighs.








, Try kicking the ball with both feet and then both thighs. When you can do this without dropping the ball, try to bounce the ball off of each foot and thigh twice, then three times, and so on.







"
"
Juggle the ball with your head.,
Use your shoulders.,
Practice using your head, shoulders, and chest.",How to Juggle a Soccer Ball5," Throw or kick the ball above your head and then bounce it off of your forehead. Angle your face up so that the ball will hit on the top of your forehead. Keep your neck relaxed and bend your knees. Bending your knees will help you to stay balanced while you focus on the ball above you.








You can use the top of your head to juggle but you will have much less control of the ball. It can also hurt to juggle with the top of your head--try to avoid doing this.

, While shoulders are hard to juggle with because they are not flat, you can use them to direct the ball where you want it to go. When you kick the ball up to your shoulder, move your shoulder upward and in the direction you would like the ball to go. For instance, you can kick the ball up with your right foot and then hit the ball with your right shoulder so that it arcs over your body and falls so that you can kick the ball up with your left foot.








Make sure to only use your shoulders and not your upper arm. Hitting the ball with any part of your arm besides your shoulders is considered a ‘handball’.

, Use the pattern of foot-chest-thigh-shoulder-head and repeat to get comfortable with using your shoulders and head.









Practice these techniques with a friend to create a variety of game-like scenarios.
When you feel comfortable with this pattern, switch it up and practice another pattern such as head-chest-foot-shoulder-thigh.

Use your dominant foot to roll the ball up your opposite leg.,
Follow through with your foot.,
Land on your dominant foot as you kick the ball with your heel.",How to Do a Rainbow in Soccer1," If you're right handed, press the ball against your left ankle with your right foot. Raise your right foot and roll the ball up the side of your left leg. Do this quickly and with some force.









If you don't roll the ball up quickly and with force, it will drop back to the ground before you have time to complete the move.;
, Once the ball rolls up to knee level, follow through with your foot so that the ball gets some air as it rolls off of your leg. You want the ball to be positioned just over your heel. So if you used your right foot to roll the ball up your left leg, guide the ball off of your leg once it reaches the knee; it should float down just behind your left heel.








, Now the foot you used to roll the ball should land on the ground. At the same time, use the heel of your other foot to kick the ball upward with your heel. For right-handers, that means your right foot will hit the ground as your left heel kicks the ball, arcing it over your head.









This process must happen very quickly in order to work properly. Practice rolling and kicking over and over until you're able to move your legs fast enough to get it right.
You want to strike the underside of the ball in an upward motion to get it to arc up and over your head. Practice until the ball lands right in front of your body.
Lean forward a bit as you land and kick. This will help the ball move in the right direction.

Move with the ball.,
Talk.,
Stay in front of your opponent.,
Move the line.,
When attempting to do sliding tackles, proceed with caution; if you miss, you will leave your defense open.,
When coming to your opponent make sure that you are ready to stop the ball from any direction.,
Expect a pass.,
Practice changing direction.,
When passed by an opponent with the ball always continue defending, because your laying back can lead to a goal being scored.

,
Be fast.,
Prevent goal access:


If your opponent receives the ball, stay in front of him as he turns his body toward the goal.,
Defend instead of reaching in.,
Use your team support.,
Guessing your opponent's next move is useful, but what's better is to know the various moves available for your opponent and be ready to respond to prevent him/her from using any of those.

,
Be aggressive and intimidating legally.,
Watch your opponent.,
Contain as best as you can.,
Know the speed and abilities of the opposing players.,
Occasionally glance instantly around.,
Use deception.,
Watch how the ball is being carried.,
Stay between your player and the goal.,
Wait until the player makes a mistake.,
If your player gets by you and is one on one with the goalie, stay in close pursuit trying to get in front and in case they make a mistake, just being there will put pressure on them.,
Always think one move ahead.",How to Play Defense in Soccer," You may think that you should watch the ball when your player you are defending doesn't have the ball. Don't do that. A part about defense is watching the forwards on the other team, for clues of where the ball is. You can't have anyone get the open slip on you. Once the ball's behind you, it's gone. Always keep your eyes on those forwards.;
, You need to talk as a team to know who is marking who and know what to do. Communication is especially important if you have a main defensive role, like centre back or goalkeeper. If there is a new guy, talk to get him up to what is happening; don't let the other team have an advantage over your new guy.

, Try to stay in the carrier's space.

, If the ball is on their side move up to half to draw them offsides. But don't go past half as you'll be offsides. Again, communication and practice are vital to be able to play a high line. If you attempt to play a high line and you haven't practiced it, it will probably end in being out of position.

, In addition, it is very common for a slide tackle to get someone a yellow card.

, For example: You are in front of your opponent - he sends the ball left, intercept it by being in your ready-stance, keeping your arms extended to the sides for balance.

, One may go between your legs or over your head, so make sure you are not tensed up. Be loose and alive, to match the opponent's moves in any direction. A way to eliminate the pass when the opponent stops to pass -- between your legs or over your head -- is by keeping your legs staggered (feet not side by side), and in an athletic stance with your knees bent a little, ready to spring.

, Be ready to send the second foot. For example: You are in front of an opponent, and you think he is going to pass left, however when he moved you took your left foot to the left but he passed right; you must be ready to launch toward the right.

,, If someone tries to pass to your opponent, get to the ball first and look for passes that you can intercept.

,






Block. If the opponent has the ball and is facing the goal, don't give him or her room to shoot. Stay within a couple feet. If he or she shoots, be prepared to dive in and block it, whether it be with foot or your body.






If your opponent moves, move with him or her. Stay on your toes. If you must give your opponent room, ""herd"" him or her towards the sideline or onto his weaker foot (the one that is already extended).






Don't let your opponent get past you. Stay on your toes, and be ready to sprint at any time by staying in an athletic stance.







, So, usually, don't stab or swipe at the ball. You will be off balance, out of position. Your opponent can dribble right past you if you are lurching forward. Just stay close and on guard.

, If you have a teammate behind you (supporting you), you can look to try to take the ball from your opponent. If not, don't try.

,, Make your opponent think only about you, not what else is going on around the field.

, When you are on the sidelines, study his or her 1-on-1 moves and habits.

, If there aren't a lot of defenders in your half of the field, contain your opponent, slowing him or her down and making time for help to arrive. If there are plenty of defenders/support in your half of the field, you can be a little more assertive.

, Know how they compare to yours, and take risks accordingly.

, Be aware of other players in your field of view. Try to anticipate where your opponent would like to pass, if he can.

, Deception is as powerful as speed. If your opponent thinks you're passive, you can surprise him or her by acting instantly, not showing your trickiness all the time.

, Instead of watching your opponent's feet watch the ball.

, To defend your goal, stay ahead of the opponent.

, If he gets overextended or off balance, then attack.

, Think before fouling them. Understand that if you do take down your opponent, most of the time this will result in a yellow card. With a few tackles (mainly the ones that deny the other player a chance to score), you will be ejected from the game with a red card. Red cards tend to include multiple-game suspensions in many leagues, so before you foul the player from behind, remember what the consequences are! In addition, taking down and potentially injuring a player who has beaten you fairly is not good for your team, as you may be suspended for one or more games.

, To be ready to go where the action will probably need to go. They will be trying to get the ball to a better position to a more open area, away from the sideline, away from the crowded area and such.

Dribble the ball fairly quickly towards a defender.,

Bring your non dominant foot behind the ball.,
Use your dominant foot to sweep the ball up the opposite leg.,
Lean forward and kick the ball up with your heel.,
Finished.








",How to Do a Rainbow in Soccer2," You can use the rainbow to switch the direction of the ball right when a defender is trying to steal it.








, This is important because if you don't lean forward, the ball will go backwards.








, The ball should now be positioned between your feet, ready for the rainbow technique to begin.








, Use a motion that will cause the ball to roll off the leg at the knee and drop down toward the heel.








, Do this as you land on your dominant foot. The ball should arc up and over the defender, and they will likely be confused about where it went, and you can run around the defender and continue moving with the ball.

Learning to set goals will give a keeper the ability to develop a clear course of action on where they want to go (performance level) and how to get there.,
Make the performance goals realistic; goals that challenge you but are attainable.,
Detail the performance based goals in short and long terms.,
It is important to write your goals down on a paper.,
Goals should be set for practice and for competition.,
The next step in goal setting is to identify a keeper’s support and feedback network.,
The time for self-assessment is after practice and especially after games.,
Look at this example of goal setting


Long Term Goal: Dominate the box on crosses.,
Recognize that each time a keeper steps on the pitch it is a learning experience, whether it be a practice or game.",How to Set Goals As a Goalkeeper in Soccer," The first stage of this is to set “Performance” based goals rather than “Outcome” goals. Outcome goals are not entirely under our control. An example of this could be number of saves. Performance goals are something keepers can control. Such as “ I am going to attack floated crosses played in the air above my head at my highest point”. There is nothing wrong with a keeper stating a goal such as “ I want to make All Conference or All State”. Ambition is great. More importantly is the “how” will that goal be attained.;
, If a goal is too easy there will be nothing learned or gained by the exercise. An unrealistic goal may also be a detriment since the satisfaction of an accomplishment may never be felt or measured. Set goals in measurable and behavioral terms. “This training session I want to ……” or “This game I will organize and communicate effectively with my central defenders.”

, Short term range goals provide the opportunity to see immediate improvement. Short term goals help to motivate and are steps toward your longer range goal. Longer range goals could be season goals our yearly goals. An example of a Long term yearly goal could be “ Before I return to camp next year I would like to become better at timing and patience when coming out on breakaways”

, Seeing them in writing helps keep a clear focus. In my mind, it also makes them real if they are on paper. Weightlifters keep a journal that documents their daily workouts to track their progress. Keepers can modify this technique and write down each practice goal as it progresses or builds to a short term goal for a specified date. This allows them to track their progress, reflect on where they started, how far they have come, and also helps detail training exercises that worked well to achieve the desired result. This technique helps make their commitment to achieving the goal stronger and also creates a sense of accomplishment at competition. Once these goals have been identified it is not only important to document them but to also identify target dates. “By When”. Again be challenging but reasonable when selecting a date. Don’t expect to be proficient with breakaways within a week.

, Practice goals as mentioned are often critical to achieving game goals. The daily practice goals should be positive statements. “Today I am going help improve my catching and absorbing of harder shots at the body to limit my number of rebounds”

, Keepers are under constant scrutiny from fans, teammates, coaches, and the opposition. Keepers should identify a support network that can help achieve their goals. Identify who amongst the network can provide constructive feedback. Obtaining feedback from others helps keepers attain a sense of accomplishment and helps keep the focus clear. Often we are our own worst critics, which is why keepers rely on others also for positive feedback. In the right mindset and at the right time self-assessment is vital to a keeper’s individual development. It too can keep the mind focused and driven.

, Teammates feed off of a keeper's emotion as do the other team. Other than excitement a keeper should not show much emotion. If a soft goal is conceded it must be filed away in a keeper’s head for after the game. The best way to deal with the situation and the resulting emotions is to correct the mistake in their head quickly, file it away, and then begin focusing their energy on the next play. That goal is gone. To help prevent another mistake it is important to stay in the present. No need to think about the past goal or anticipate the future. After the game the keeper can sit with their support network, coaches, and reflect on the mistakes to identify development opportunities and goals before the next game.

, By October 15th






Short range goal: “ I am going to attack floated crosses played in the air above my head at my highest point”






By: September 30th.






Day 1, Sept 23rd: Work on driving the appropriate knee up and landing on two feet. Attack the ball above my head at my highest point. Hand Services from shorter distance
Day 2, Sept 24th: Continue with using the appropriate knee and attacking the ball at my highest point. Introduce pressure and harder services.

This will build by day until the Sept 30th. Long term and short term goals should stay constant within a date range but the daily goals should be written down and crossed off when completed or accomplished.





, Goal Setting will help prepare a keeper for match play and guide their technical as well as tactical development. Each keeper learns and progresses differently. The introduction of goal setting techniques will help young keepers focus their energy on one technical element rather than trying to be Tim Howard after one session. The result will be a sense of accomplishment and noticeable growth. At times we are our own worst critics. As coaches, we are also responsible for providing positive feedback and managing expectations.

Set up the playing field.,
Have goalkeeper 1 pass the ball to the closest player.,
Have each defensive player mark an offense player.,
Have each defender extend their arm fully to each offense player.,
Have one player pressure to win the ball.,
Coach the defenders on the back-up plan.,
Emphasize that communication is the key.,
If the ball is won by the defense, have them kick it out of bounds.,
Repeat.",How to Run a 3v3 Drill to Coach Defenders in Counter Attacks (Soccer)," This practice session should take place in a 25–30 yards (22.9–27.4 m) in length and 15-20 yards width field. The goal size should be 4’h x 6’w for a better scoring opportunity. No goal area, penalty area, or penalty spot is suggested due to the small size of the field, but the center radius should be 3 yard radius, corner arc 2’ radius, and a 5’ flags. This will be a 3v3 practice and 2 goalkeepers.;
, Since it will be a 3v3 practice all 3 players must be close to the goalkeeper when he is ready to give out the ball, while the other 3 players will play the defensive role.

, When the counterattack starts the offense players will try to rotate and pass the ball around to wait for an open chance to either shot or pass to an open player.

, The distance suggested to be between the defender and attacker is an arm distance to allow the defender rotate directions in case of a sudden movement or switch by the attacker. Each defender must keep in mind that he/she should be blocking the goal area to protect it from a shooting opportunity. Force the offense player towards the direction desired which should be away from goalkeeper 2.

, The player pressuring should be the closest in distance to the attacker and the 2nd and 3rd defenders should be covering and support. This action of support and cover should move as a wave like across the area as a continuous motion.


For example: if the defender who is pressuring the attacker with ball is in a distance of an arm length then the next defender who is in front of the next attacker should be two arm’s length away and the third defender and attacker should be three arm’s length away, to have an overview of how the fellow defender is doing and the attacker in front of him

, If you can’t win the ball, your intention is to make the offense lose ball. Some defenders will try to tackle or get too close to the attacker and that puts the defense in risk if the attacker got through this defender. So keep pressuring until offense player decides to pass at that moment you can cut off the pass or your fellow defender who was covering you can cut the ball before getting to the other attacker.

, All defenders should communicate to let each other know who is covering and what’s going on exactly. Communication is the key to success.

, Attackers will keep passing unless they get the chance to shot or the ball gets cut off, so try your best as a defender to make the attacker not think of the next move. If the ball is won by defenders it will go out of bounds, if the attackers shot it will be with the goalkeeper wither scored or not.

, After the this practice is done, repeat it with the other 3 players and goalkeeper 2.

Talk to your teammates.",How to Read a Soccer Penalty Shot if You're a Goalie1," Before a shooter makes his penalty kick, he’ll likely size up the situation and decided on a direction in which to take his shot. Watching the shooter’s eyes can cue you in to where he plans to kick the soccer ball.


If a shooter continually looks at a certain area of the goal, this could be where he intends to kick the ball.A shooter’s eye may also give smaller clues. For example, if he looks up to the sky, then he is likely going to kick the ball high between the goal posts.Professional players will also use their eyes as a way to fake out a goalie so she or he jumps in the wrong direction. For this reason, look at other cues like body positioning.;
, Is it coming directly at you or wide from the side? By watching how a kicker is approaching the goal, you can gather valuable clues about direction in which he will kick.


If a kicker approaches from the side, it often indicates that he will kick towards the opposite corner of the goal.
If the kicker is coming directly at you, however, it is more difficult to read where he will shoot because it is easier for him to pivot and shoot in different directions from this approach., Just like the eyes, how the kicker positions his body will likely cue you in to where he intends to kick. Since body positioning is more obvious than the eyes, this may be an easier way to read penalty shots for new or less experienced goalies.


Watch the kicker’s plant foot. The plant foot is the foot with which the player does not kick, but rather “plants” into the ground. The ball will follow the trajectory towards which the plant foot points.Watch the kicker’s hips. Since the hips can’t usually go in a different direction than the feet, the ball will also follow the direction of the kicker’s hips.Watch the kicker’s head. Looking at the kicker’s head can also give you clue about the direction he intends to shoot the ball. If he drops his head and then pulls back his leg, this usually indicates a cross-body shot. On the other hand, if the kicker holds his head straight, it may mean he will shoot the ball to the opposite corner., If you’re a goalie with fast reflexes or even want to work on your reaction time, watching where the ball goes after it is kicked is another way to read penalty shots. This is a riskier and less reliable tactic than reading the player, but sometimes it’s your only option.


Following the ball is called reactionary defending. It requires that you not only have good reflexes but also confidence in your skills to follow the ball after the shooter kicks it.If you can watch the ball and the player’s body positioning, which will require some practice, you are more likely to save the ball.

, Once a kicker has made a shot on goal, you need to react to the play based on the clues you’ve gathered from watching the player’s body positioning and the ball. How you react depends on where the ball is traveling.


Always commit to the play no matter what happens. Hesitation will cause you to make mistakes, including letting the ball in to the goal.
If the ball is kicked low, dive in that direction and catch it with your hands.
If the ball goes high, you’ll want to jump instead of diving. You can also opt to punch the ball outside of the goal area if it is too high to catch.
If there are a lot of the opposite team’s defenders in the goal area and you need to clear the ball quickly, kick it out as far as you can.
Make sure to always keep your eyes on the ball so that you don’t accidentally lose it.
You want to react quickly, but not too quickly.Because penalty kicks are often weaker shots, a goalkeeper can often save the ball if they wait and simply react to the shot., Part of reading penalty shots is inherently instinctive. As you become a more experienced player, you’ll be able to anticipate where penalty kicks are going more effectively. But even if you’re a newer player, using your instincts for plays can be beneficial to your team.Don’t discount your instincts when anticipating shots on goal. Your brain may be catching subliminal and subtle cues and sending them to you as a “gut reaction.”, Recent studies have shown that goalies can use optional illusions to influence the accuracy of penalty shots.This tactic can ease the work of reading a kicker or the ball.


Stand off center. One study has shown that by standing marginally to one side of the goal will influence the perception of the kicker to kick to the side with more open. But this allows the goalie to strategically dive to this in order to save the ball.Making yourself larger in the goal will also throw off a penalty kicker. For example, if you hold your arms up in the air, the kicker will perceive you as larger and the goal smaller, which will plant a kernel of doubt in his mind about the ability to make the goal., There is usually a quick pause before any penalty shots are taken. Use this time to your benefit by asking your teammates if they’ve noticed any patterns in the kicker’s play that would help you to anticipate where or how he will kick.

Know the penalty shot statistics.,
Study the opposite team before the match.,
Learn about kinesiology.",How to Read a Soccer Penalty Shot if You're a Goalie2," The general tendency of a kicker is to shoot the ball opposite the goalie. Knowing this tendency can help you more effectively anticipate where a kicker will shoot the ball.


One study showed that almost 70% of penalty kicks taken went to the side opposite the kicker's dominant foot: right-footed players kicked to their left and the keeper's right and vice versa.This mimics the natural swing of the foot across the body because it is difficult to shoot to the opposite corner using an instep kick.
If you can’t read the player or the ball, it’s best to assume that you should go right for a right-footed kicker and left for a left footer., Just as it’s important to pay attention to the other team’s players during the game, it’s also wise to study them before you meet them on the field. This will give you an idea of how they generally play and also highlight any playing patterns by individual players.


Watch videos of the other teams matches to acquaint yourself with their playing style.
If you are near your opposing team or cannot get a video of them playing, visit one of their games.
Studying the motions of a player on a computer can also improve your ability to read the movements a shooter makes because these give away clues about how they will play., Knowing how to anticipate any body’s movement is something that can help any goalkeeper defend shots on goal. By learning the principles of kinesiology, or the study of movement, you can become a much more effective goalie, especially against penalty kicks.


Most colleges offer courses in kinesiology, though you can also find online courses at places like the University of Utah or Sam Houston State University.

Use a good ball.,
Find your kicking foot.,
Practice your approach steps.,
Plant your non-kicking foot beside the ball.,
Swing your kicking leg forward.,
Use the top of your foot for shots and the side for passes.,
Follow through.",How to Kick a Ball1," Whatever you're playing, even if you're just goofing around with your friends and not playing an organized sport, you should make sure your balls are inflated to the proper specifications, and that you're using the right kind of ball. Kicking a well-inflated ball is important to keep the ball from getting wrecked and your foot from getting bruised.


Soccer balls, kickballs, footballs, and foam-style Nerf balls are all appropriate for kicking off the ground. You can use this to take shots, American football kickoffs, and other plays in sports that involve kicking a round or oblong ball off the ground. Do not kick basketballs.;
, When you kick a ball, most of the time you'll want to do it with your dominant foot, usually the foot on the same side of your body that you write with. This is your kicking foot and the other foot is your plant foot.


Practice on your non-dominant foot too, to become a better kicker. Even if you’re not playing an organized sport, being an ambidextrous kicker is a cool trick. For soccer especially, learning to kick with both feet is desirable.

, Taking a few pre-kick steps helps to increase the power behind your kicks as well as your accuracy. Learning to coordinate your steps, plant your foot, and approach the ball properly is one of the most important parts of kicking a ball. Using the right technique will always allow you to kick a ball farther than a super-strong leg. To approach the ball properly:


Lead with your non-kicking foot. Take a few steps back from the ball and step toward it with your non-kicking foot. Take one more step with your kicking foot, lining it up behind the ball. Your last step will be with your non-kicking, or ""plant"" foot, just beside the ball you're about to kick.
A common mistake a lot of kickers make is taking too many steps back to kick the ball. 15 steps won't give you more power than three, if you use the right mechanics, but it will make it more likely that you'll stumble, or whiff the ball.

, Your other foot should be planted a few inches to the side of the ball you're about to kick, with your kicking leg cocked back behind you and ready to strike.


Plant your foot forward to keep the ball low. If your plant foot is slightly ahead and to the side of the ball, you'll be able to put lots of power behind your kick, and it'll stay low to the ground.
Plant your foot behind the ball to chip it up. If your plant foot is slightly behind and to the side of the ball, you'll be able to put a little more air into the kick, but perhaps slightly less power.

, The power from a kick comes from your hip. Your kicking leg should be cocked back behind you when you plant your other foot beside the ball, and should extend and swing forward simultaneously to make contact with the ball.


Imagine a magnet that connects your foot to the ball, drawing your kicking foot ever closer until you make contact.

, Whether you’re kicking a soccer ball or a kickball, the technique may be basically the same, but you’ll need to use a different part of your foot depending on your purposes. Using the laces on the top of your foot, your toe pointed down, helps you to put power behind it, while the in-step of your foot is perfect for accuracy.


If you want power, kick the ball with the hardest part of your foot, the seam that runs just to the side of your laces. Point your toe and strike the ball with the top of your foot.
If you want accuracy, use the instep of your foot. You'll need to rotate your ankle to the side slightly to use your foot as a kind of mallet, striking with the arch on the side of your foot.

, Drive through the ball and extend your kicking leg, pointing your toe where you want the ball to end up. When you're striking the ball hard, it's important to follow through with your kick, rather than stabbing at the ball.


Imagine that you're kicking through the ball, as if you were trying to punch through it, or kick the opposite side of the ball to the one you're actually kicking.
Depending on the kind of kick you’re taking and the power behind it, you might land on your kicking foot by taking a little hop forward and letting your momentum carry you, or you might hop up and land on your plant foot.

Use an appropriate type of ball for punting.,
Hold the ball at waist height.,
Take your first step with your kicking foot.,
Plant your other foot and cock your kicking leg.,
Bring your leg up as you drop the ball straight down.,
Follow through and hop.",How to Kick a Ball2," Punting involves picking up and dropping the ball to kick it high and far into the air. It's a common part of soccer, football, and other sports. Use this technique for punting a soccer ball, rugby ball, American football, or any other kind of ball that you pick up and drop to kick.Never try to punt an especially heavy ball like a medicine ball or another weighted ball. If you try to kick something too heavy with this technique, you can twist your ankle or otherwise hurt your foot.

, Pick the ball up and hold it somewhere around your waist-height. The punt is a way of getting the ball very far and very high, usually to transfer the possession of the ball in football or send the ball up the field in soccer. Make sure you've got enough space to kick the ball, since it's going to go a long ways without trying very hard.


Never drop the ball from very high, or toss the ball up before trying to kick it. Hold it gently with both hands, just out from your body comfortably at about your waist-level.

, The basic punt step involves only two steps. In most game situations, you won't have more space than a few steps, so it's important to distill all your movements into a fairly small space. To punt correctly take full-stride steps, starting with your kicking leg.

, After taking that first step, you're ready to plant and swing. Plant your non-kicking foot on the ground, keeping it flexed and ready to spring. Keep your eye locked on the ball to make sure that you strike it correctly. Don't look at any other players or gameplay happening around you. Just focus on the ball.


Bend your kicking knee and pull your leg back behind you to strike the ball. Keep your kicking toe pointed.
As you do this motion, extend the ball straight out from your body. It'll take some practice to get it completely right, but most people need to stretch their arms out all the way to drop the ball and contact perfectly.
Some kickers prefer a locked plant leg for power, while others prefer a more flexed knee to help make sure your strike the ball accurately and securely. Practice, experimenting some with both methods of punting to get a sense of what feels right for you.

, After you plant your leg, start swinging your kicking foot forward. When your leg starts to swing back around and come straight up toward the ball, drop the ball straight down simultaneously. Don't toss it out in front of you, toss it up, or otherwise put any spin on it. Just drop it straight down as gently as possible.


If you're kicking an oblong ball, you've got to keep the point of the ball pointing straight back at your body, not perpendicular with yourself.

, As soon as your foot contacts the ball, keep completing the kicking motion, swinging your leg forward and up in an arc. Point your toe in the direction that you want the ball to go. (And make sure.. PRACTICE=PERFECT!)

Kick with the outside of your foot.,
Try a heel kick.,
Try a rainbow kick.,
Try a bicycle kick.",How to Kick a Ball3," For a good quick fake-out, use the outside of your foot instead of the inside of your foot to slice the ball in the opposite direction. This is a trick commonly used in soccer.


Bend your ankle so that your toe is pointed toward your plant foot and strike the ball with the outside edge of your foot, just behind your little toe. When you strike the ball, straighten out your foot to make it go in the other direction.

, This might not be the most practical way to kick a ball off the ground, but doing a spinning heel kick can be a great fake-out when you're messing around with your friends. It's hard to control, but with some practice you can learn to strike the ball accurately almost every time.


As you step toward a ball on the ground, plant your non-kicking foot on the opposite side of the ball that you normally would, twisting your body around as you do it. Swing your kicking foot around, sweeping into the ball with your heel. If you're right-footed, you would turn clockwise and if you're left-footed you would turn counter-clockwise.

, Rainbows are one of the cornerstones of fancy soccer footwork. If you want to really improve your skills, pulling off a rainbow can help impress your teammates. There's not much cause to use it in a game, but it's an intimidating way to practice in front of the other team.


As you're dribbling around, step with your kicking foot in front of the ball, stopping the ball with your heel. Use the instep of your non-kicking foot to trap the ball against your heel. In one fluid motion, do a little hop step with both feet, flicking the ball up and over your head, back in front of your body.
It'll take some practice to get the right amount of hop and power into the kick to get it to go where you want it to go. Practice while stationary at first, then gradually try to do it at speed.

, Done properly, a bicycle kick can be one of the most spectacular shots in all of soccer. Think of it like a backwards punt, done when you've got your back facing the directions in which you want the ball to travel. To pull of a bicycle kick, lean your body backward and gently fall onto your back while you bring your kicking leg up for a kick. Strike the ball over your head as you fall, so it goes back behind you.


You need to be extremely careful not to flat-back and hurt yourself, and to tuck your chin so you don't hit the back of your head hard on the ground. Do this on soft grassy surfaces and be extremely careful.

Rest after the injury.,
Put ice packs on the injured toe.,
Apply a heat wrap to the injured toe.,
Bind or tape the injured foot.,
Administer an over-the-counter oral painkiller.,
Wear a boot or other stiff-soled shoe after the injury.,
Plan to spend at least three weeks recovering.,
Visit a doctor for a full diagnosis.,
Describe to your doctor what you felt and heard when you injured your toe.,
Comply with your doctor’s directions for x-rays or surgery.,
Wear athletic shoes that fit properly.,
Use extra caution when playing on artificial turf.,
Avoid repeated instances of soccer toe.",How to Treat Soccer Toe," If you have soccer toe, the first symptoms the injured player will notice will be pain, swelling, and limited movement in the injured foot and toe.It’s important for the player to rest the injured area so that the injury is not worsened and the body can begin to heal.


Once the player is at home resting, they should elevate the injured foot (at least while ice packs are applied), to moderate blood flow to the foot.;
, Ice should be applied immediately to reduce swelling in the injured area. Soccer toe is not only painful, but it also is usually accompanied by swelling. Ice will help minimize the swelling by constricting the blood vessels. Apply ice to the injured area for 15–20 minutes, several times a day.The injured player should be completely off the foot for at least 3–4 days. Use crutches if necessary., After the initial ice pack, switch to a warm heat pack. The warm heat pack will dilate the blood vessels, rushing blood into the area, which promotes the healing process. After about 20 minutes, return to an ice pack to prevent swelling. Repeat the ice-heat therapy for a couple of hours.


This step is optional, as the application of heat is less important than icing the injury.
The application of heat to the injured toe/foot can also reduce pain., Adhesive athletic tape exists for this purpose, and can be easily found in a pharmacy or athletic-equipment store. Tightly wrap the tape around the injured area of the player’s foot, but be careful not to wrap so tightly as to cause pain or restrict bloodflow. Compression is an important step when treating soccer toe; it limits further swelling and supports the injured toe and ligament, so that further strain will not be put on them.If the injured player is suffering from a more severe type of turf toe, a doctor may tape the injured toe to the adjacent toe, to further restrict the injured toe’s movement., A painkiller such as ibuprofen will reduce swelling and combat the pain that the injured player will be experiencing. If over-the-counter medications do not provide enough pain relief, or do not adequately combat the swelling, your doctor may order a prescription-strength painkiller., While you’re recovering from soccer toe, it’s important to keep the ligaments behind your big toe relatively immobile during daily life.Find a hard soled boot, or even a hard-soled shoe with a Morton’s Extension under the toe and ligament. This prevents the toe from bending unnecessarily until it is completely healed.


It’s also common practice to tape the injured toe. This will restrict mobility and prevent the ligaments from being over-extended while healing.
Taping a player’s toe can also be done before a soccer game, as a preventative measure against turf toe.

, Ligaments heal slowly, and a player can easily reinjure the area by returning to the field too quickly after sustaining an injury. Taking three weeks to recover will keep you from experiencing further pain while playing, and will let your joint capsule heal.To speed up your recovery, you can try the Tennis Ball Massage: sit in a chair with a tennis ball on the ground in front of you. Place your injured foot on top of the ball, and roll your foot back and forth. Do this for 5 minutes, once or twice a day, to keep your ligaments flexible and encourage healing., There are several stages of soccer toe, and the injury gets progressively worse as you move up through the stages.Only a doctor will be able to accurately diagnose the extent of the damage. Turf toe is not particularly difficult to diagnose, but it’s important to find out quickly how serious your case of turf toe is.


Soccer toe, type 1: The ligament that attaches the big toe to the foot and its joint capsule has been stretched too far.
Soccer toe, type 2: The ligament that attaches the big toe to the foot and its joint capsule is partially torn. This will take more than the standard week to heal. This is more serious and more painful.
Soccer toe, type 3: The ligament and the joint capsule have been completely torn. This is very severe, very painful and will take weeks to heal. This can wreak havoc on a player’s season because it is the kind of nagging injury that doesn’t seem to ever go away.

, This will help with a proper diagnosis. An audible and painful “pop” or “crack” is usually heard and felt when a player suffers the soccer toe injury. When talking to your doctor, say something like: “I was turning quickly to run for the ball, and heard a sound like a ‘snap’ from near my big toe.”
“I kicked the ball wrong and hit it with my toe. It bent back too far, and I heard a sound like a crunch from my toe.”
Your doctor will also likely ask for a patient medical history, to find out if the feet or toes have been injured previously (including prior cases of turf toe)., These are uncommon, but in severe cases of soccer toe, you may need to sit for an x-ray or have surgery performed.If the doctor suspects that your toe may be broken—a more serious injury than turf toe—they will take an x-ray to examine the bone.


Surgery is only performed in rare cases when the ligament has completely torn and needs to be repaired. Surgery may also be needed to remove any bone spurs that have developed from repeated injuries to the area., Soccer toe is usually caused from an ill-fitting soccer shoe: either a shoe is too small and does not absorb shocks to the player’s feet and toes, or the shoe is too large, and the player’s foot slides in the shoe, slamming the toes into the front of the shoe.


Wearing an athletic shoe with a stiff sole can prevent ligament hyperextension and cushion the player’s toes from contact with the soccer ball.Soft, flexible athletic shoes increase a player’s risk for turf toe, as the shoes do very little to limit the movement of the player’s big toe., Artificial turf on soccer fields is made of a harder substance than grass, and consequently, players’ cleats are more likely to stick in the artificial turf.This will place extra strain on the players’ feet and tendons.


Even if cleats don’t stick in the turf, the added friction from the artificial turf will cause players to use more force when running and will increase the likelihood of ligament hyperextension.

, Although a single occurrence of soccer toe is not considered medically serious, if a player contracts soccer toe multiple times, the ligaments and soft tissue in the player’s foot are at risk of serious damage.Under these circumstances, turf toe can become a chronic condition, leading to joint pain and permanent loss of movement.


Players who suffer from chronic turf toe are also at a higher risk for arthritis in the area.

Train for your position to get the most out of your fitness.,
Play games and scrimmages to train your whole body at once.,
Replace the majority of long distance runs with interval training for better results.,
Build agility and reaction speed with plyometric exercises and direction changing workouts.,
Use slow, long distance runs and endurance activities to recover and build endurance 1-2 a week.,
Build your upper body to fight defenders, win headers, and become a harder player to tackle.,
Push yourself as hard as you can in practices, scrimmages, and drills to get ""match fitness.""",How to Train for Soccer1," Different soccer players have different training needs to be successful. A goalie, after all, doesn't need to be able to run for as long as a center midfielder. But even similar positions, like outside defenders and midfielders, can focus on slightly different training regimens:



Goalies: Need quick, powerful reactions and very little long-distance stamina. Focus on strength, reactions, and a slim, quick figure.

Defenders: Need upper/lower body strength and sprinting speed. Rarely required to jog or run for long, continuous times, they need to be able to get to every ball and win it in the air or on the ground.

Midfielders: Need to be able to run for days. They should have exceptional stamina and above-average speed. Quickness and strong foot skills are a must.

Forwards: Need a balance of speed and strength, like defenders, but must also be able to jog for days to confuse defenders and open up offensive space.;
, The best way to get in soccer shape is to play soccer. While you will need to work on additional training as well, games force you to work on endurance, strength, speed, and agility in real-life situations. As long as you're exhausted at the end of the game, you've gotten a good training session in.


When playing games for fun, move around and play multiple positions. This will help you learn the game and build full-body fitness.

, Interval training is when you alternate hard sprints or effort with short rest periods, teaching your body to get to top speed and recover your energy quickly. It is much more game-realistic than an hour of jogging, and is proven to get faster results.A sample workout might look like this (note that there is no ""rest"" period. Jogging is your rest).


Jog for 5-10 minutes to warm up.
Sprint for 30 seconds.
Jog for 1 minute (1:30 if struggling)
Alternate sprinting/jogging for 9 more sprints.
Jog for 5-10 minutes to cool down.
Lower the rest period as you get better, eventually aiming for a 30-second sprint and jog.

, Being quick on your feet is essential to becoming a killer player. There are endless exercises to try, but some classics include:



Cone Runs: Stagger the cones in a zig-zag, then run the course, focusing on sharp turns around each cone.

Suicides: Mark off to lines roughly 20 yards apart. Sprint to the end, touch the line, and sprint back. Focus on maintaining speed and balance as you change directions as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Ladder drills: Focus on light, fast feet. Make up different patterns to train agility -- both feet in each hole, down and back, sideways, etc.

Hurdles or Box Jumps: Focus on landing on your toes and springing back up quickly and efficiently. You want to land, compress, and shoot back up quickly, as if winning a header., A long, slow run is not a great way to train for soccer on its own, but it still has a place in your workout. Use it on off days to move and stretch your muscles when you can't fully work out. Swim and bike to activate different muscles and give your joints a rest from the pounding of constant running. No matter what your style, aim for a simple, easy pace and try to run for at least 30 minutes to an hour.

, Full-body strength allows you to fight hard for loose balls, resist tackles, and muscle for position on crosses and clears. Soccer players want to stay lean, but still strong, and light strength training will make you a formidable opponent anywhere on the field. Work on the following muscle groups 2-4 times a week, choosing 2-3 exercises for each group.



Chest and Back: Your chest and back muscles will help you create and keep space in the box or in the air. A strong back, furthermore, increases balance on the ball and overall strength.

Tone your arms: Bicep curls, dips, tricep push-ups (your hands form a diamond under your chest), and pull-ups all build solid muscle from home. Toning your arms helps push away defenders and attackers and keep balance on the ball.Abs and Core: Sit-ups, crunches, and planks are an essential part of your workout, and can be performed daily. You transfer power between you upper and lower body through your core -- any crosses, shots, long passes, or headers require rock-solid muscles.

, You will have to do dedicated fitness to truly train for soccer. That said, the fastest way to get to match fitness is to actually push yourself as if you were in a match. Whenever you do drills or play games, work until you're exhausted. It is far more fun than doing sprints later on to get strong, and far more game realistic.When you're tired, focus the most on your foot skills. The players that stay technically proficient even when they get tired are the ones that win last-minute games.
Training in practice ensures you're training for your specific position. Even in pick-up games or scrimmages, the only way you get better is by working hard.
Having a dedicated training partner can help ensure you always work hard, and a little bit of competition is great motivation.

Watch for the flag up.,
Watch for ball out-of-play and restarts.,
Watch for offside.,
Watch for substitutions.,
Watch for the goal signal.,
Watch for the penalty kick signal.,
Watch for the miscellaneous signal.",How to Understand Soccer Assistant Referee Signals," This is the most basic signal the assistant will make. By putting the flag up, they are indicating to the referee that play needs to be stopped for some reason. Typically, when the assistant sees something, they will put up the flag, flick it to get the referee's attention (especially for a foul), and after the referee blows the whistle the assistant will indicate what they saw. If the referee does not see the flag, the other assistant will typically ""mirror"" the signal to help attract the referee's eye.;
, One of the two main jobs of the assistant is to indicate when the ball is out of bounds and how the game should proceed. Once the referee has blown the whistle, the assistant will indicate how to proceed:


If the assistant raises the flag, at a 45 degree angle and points it horizontally along the touch line, they are indicating for a throw-in. The team attacking in the direction they are pointing takes the throw.
If the assistant stands near the goal line and points at the goal, they are signalling for a goal kick.
If the assistant stands near the goal line and points at a downward 45 degree angle toward the corner flag, they are signalling for a corner kick.

, This is initially indicated by a flag straight up in the air, to indicate to the referee that play must be halted. When the referee's calls the offside with a whistle, the assistant then holds the flag in one of three positions in front of them to indicate where on the field the offside occurred and thus where the ball should be placed for the free kick. But if the referee gives you a waving gesture it means there was no advantage in play so it continues and you lower your flag.


If they hold the flag up at a 45 degree angle, they are signalling for an offside on the far side of the field (from them).
If they hold the flag straight horizontally, they are signalling for an offside in the middle of the field.
If they hold the flag down at a 45 degree angle, they are signalling for an offside on the near side of the field.

, If the assistant holds his flag above his head with both hands, he is indicating to the referee that a substitution is being performed and that play should not be started until it is finished.

, When the assistant thinks a goal has been scored, they will lower the flag, optionally may point to center with their hand and sprint back to the center line. If they want to dispute the goal, however, they will put the flag up and stay where they are.

, The official signal is to raise the flag, flick it, then lower the flag, holding it horizontally across the waist (sometimes called, ""skirting""). Many crews see this as too visible and will modify the signal. This can vary from region to region. Generally, if a foul is called by the referee and it is inside the penalty area the AR will move toward the corner flag. If the AR stays where they are then it indicates the foul was outside the penalty area. The referee can then determine the appropriate restart. Other possible signals for penalty kicks include holding the flag horizontally across the waist (without the initial flag raise and flick) or running to the corner flag and hiding their flag behind their back.

, When the assistant simply keeps the flag straight up after the whistle is blown, he is indicating he needs to talk to the referee. The assistant may show this signal if, for example, a player begins abusing him or he sees outside interference. In particular, if he wishes to indicate that a player deserves a yellow or red card, he will place his hand over his chest badge.

Switch to the other side of the field every other practice, so you get experience playing from other angles and forcing yourself to take shots with the other foot.





;
, The most basic juke-move in the dribbler’s arsenal is the Matthews, followed up quickly by the reverse-Matthews. Learning to integrate these little jukes into your basic dribbling will significantly improve your game. It’s the easiest to learn–you might even be doing it already without knowing it. Practice the Matthews slowly and gradually bring it up to game speed.


To do the Matthews, you make two quick touches on the ball with your dominant foot. On your first touch, bring the ball in across your body with your in-step, and with the second, kick it back away from you to that side with the side of that same foot. This is often done while stationary, facing off with a defender, and can be a great way to make space.






To do the reverse-Matthews, you’ll also make two quick touches on the ball with your dominant foot, but in the opposite order. Fake like you’re going to one side by touching with the outside of your foot, then bring it back in across your body with your in-step. At high-speed, it’s a great fake out., Rollovers are a great way to vary your touches and keep a tremendous amount of control on the ball. Learning to do rollovers quickly and with an economy of movement will keep your defender off balance, making it very difficult to tell where you’re going. It’s also an extremely easy touch.


To do a rollover, use the instep of your dominant foot to roll up and over the ball in toward your body. Don’t kick it, but roll it. To go back in the other direction, use your other foot, rolling it back the other way. Practice doing this going forward, around cones to get the timing right.






To do a reverse rollover, you pull the ball back toward you while moving backwards. Start with your dominant foot on top of the ball, then step back, rolling the ball toward you and moving quickly enough so that you’ll be ahead of it. Then, pull back with the other foot. This can be a great way to change direction and make space.







, Maybe the flashiest move in the soccer player’s dribbling arsenal is the step-over, in which you juke to one side quickly before cutting back in the other direction. To complete the move, start dribbling forward at a normal pace.


With your dominant foot, step over the ball from your weak side to your strong side. In other words, if you're right-footed, step over the ball as it's moving, from your left to your right. Plant your dominant foot and use the outside of your opposite foot to kick the ball in the opposite direction quickly. The step should fake-out the defender, leaving them flatfooted and mis-directed, and you can cut around in the opposite direction.






In a double step-over, you'll step over the ball with both feet before going in the original direction. If you're right-footed, step over the ball with your right foot from the left to the right, then with your left foot from the right to the left, then use the outside of your right foot to kick it back to your right. Lightning speed!







, No, you don’t walk up to a defender and headbutt them in the chest. Instead, this is a 360 spin with the ball that’ll leave your opponent in the dust. It's easy in practice, but somewhat more difficult to pull off in a game. Still, used correctly, it can be a devastating move. Use this when an opponent is coming straight for you.As you're dribbling at a comfortable speed, step on the ball with your dominant foot to stop it and pivot your body 180 degrees in that direction. If you step on the ball with your right foot, swing around your left shoulder until you're facing the opposite direction.






Then, continue swinging around another 180 degrees, but switching your touch on the ball. Use your other foot to do a reverse roll-over, pulling the ball back with you and you turn and head in your original direction.







, A rainbow is super-flashy, awe-inspiring, and almost completely useless in a real game situation. Still, it's a cool skill to learn and practice your touch. Who knows when it might come in handy?


To do a rainbow, step with the heel of your dominant foot in front of the ball and use the instep of your other foot to trap the ball against the back of your leg. Use the heel of your dominant foot to flick the ball up and forward, preferably directly in front of you.






Practice the move stationary, and then work on doing it at an easy forward dribble. If you can do it at game-speed you'll be a great dribbler.







, A rabona is kind of like a one-footed rainbow and a step-over combined, and is a common little chipping cut used as a part of freestyle dribbling exhibitions and occasionally in games.


To do a rabona, step with your non-dominant foot over the ball toward your dominant side, and use the inseam of your dominant foot to make a short little stabbing kick up and in the opposite direction, back toward your non-dominant side.







, One of the best ways to keep the defense off-balance is to make smart passes. Work on dribbling with your head up at all times to keep track of where your opponents are spaced on the field and fake out the defense by looking one direction and making a sharp pass to an open teammate in the opposite direction. Make enough no-look passes and you'll be the Steve Nash of soccer.

Work on your close ball control with juggling and drills.,
Look up when you dribble, not at the ball.,
Work on aerial ball control and trapping with your whole body.,
Practice hitting different parts of the ball for better control.,
Lean into your weakness, like your ""opposite foot,"" and focus on fixing them.",How to Train for Soccer2," Control is a very important part of soccer. The best way to practice control is to juggle and practice dribbling a ball. Keep the ball as close to your body as possible and try to get as many touches on the ball as you can to keep the ball under control.



Juggling: Use your whole body (other than arms and hands) to keep the ball from hitting the ground. How many touches can you get?

Cone Workouts: Set up a pattern of cones, then dribble through them as fast as you can without touching a cone. If you touch a cone, you have to do another lap.

Close Touch Drills: Bounce the ball between your feet quickly. Leave the ball in place and toe tap it with each foot rapidly, rolling it slightly under your sole. Roll ball to either side of you, then chop it back to the other foot. Basically, use every part of your foot to practice keeping the ball close., The more of the field you can see as you dribble, the better you next pass, move, or shot will be. Focus on keeping your head up at all times when dribbling to greatly increase your touch and your skills.


Practice picking your head up with every dribbling drill you do, especially in practice., Winning balls out of the air is essential, but it's not always going to be clean and easy. With a partner, hit crosses back and forth to each other, letting them bounce, catching them out of the air, and driving them at different heights. Work on using as few touches as possible to get the ball ready to hit back. Move quickly, but without sacrificing quality -- you want to work at game pace, but not if it becomes sloppy.

, The way you strike a soccer ball depends on what you're trying to do with it. Train your foot to hit the ball in different ways to greatly increase your control and expand your offensive arsenal.


Use the inside of your foot for short, controlled passes.
Hit the ball with your laces on the lower, outside thirds of the ball to spin or curl it. You should use the outside of your foot to curl the opposite direction.
Hit the ball with your laces in the dead center of the ball, avoiding a follow through, to hit a knuckleball.
Hit the ball on the lower third with a small, minimal follow through to chip the ball with backspin, preventing it from skipping off., Soccer rewards ""complete players"" more than most sports, since the free-flowing game requires all players to defend, attack, cross, shoot, and pass with both feet. The better you get with both feet, in every area of control, the more dangerous you become on the field. Common areas people neglect include:



Your opposite foot gives you literally twice as many options on the ball if it is good enough to use. You become much harder to defend and way less predictable.

Trapping, or stopping the ball, is essential from the air and ground. Your first touch should stop the ball within a foot or so of your body, or into space if you're trapping on the run. Have a friend hit crosses and work on bringing them down smoothly.

"
"
Kick a knuckle ball.,
Don’t shoot it.,
Go under the wall.,
Make a short pass around the wall for a shot.,
Coordinate a swarm with teammates.",How to Trick People in Soccer2," Point the ball's valve, where the air-pump is inserted, directly back toward you. Fluff the grass so the ball sits as high and soft on it as possible. Take several steps to drop back, and kick the ball head-on, flush with the valve, as flat as possible. Use the top of your laces and put no English or spin on the ball whatsoever.


Struck correctly, a knuckle ball will feint slightly through the air, not spinning, but dipping up and down unpredictably. If you can get it over the wall, it can be very hard for a goalie to trap, and can even slip through the hands suddenly. It almost defies physics.







, If you're within striking distance, everyone will expect that you'll take a shot on goal. Instead, try to curve it around the wall for a higher-probability assisting goal, or chip it up softly over the wall for a chance at a header. Or even just make a sharp pass to an unmarked teammate off the wall. Put the ball into play rather than trying to bend it like Beckham.

, Too often, defenders who form a wall to defend a free kick will jump up in the air instinctively when the ball is kicked. This is especially true if you're close to the goal and have taken several shots at the wall before, trying to get over it. One sneaky trick is to aim as low as possible, to skid the ball under the wall, hopefully going under the defenders to break the defense and let a teammate get a shot on it.

, Look to pass into space next to the wall and let a teammate run onto the ball rather than trying to get it up in the air. Use the angles opened up by the wall to make a surprising pass, rather than trying to use power to muscle the ball into the box.

, You can sometimes juke out the defenders forming the wall, and even get the goalie to hop out of position prematurely, by organizing between two and four teammates to take fake free kicks, running toward the ball in a coordinated way, but jumping over it instead and running on to take a pass if necessary. After they swarm toward the goal, take the chip over the wall as your teammates run onto the ball.


Alternatively, you can have a teammate make a short touch back to you, who can take cross the ball in, shoot it, or work a pass around from a new angle to get the ball back into play.







"
"
Sell it shamelessly.,
Fall down when someone challenges your possession hard.,
Go up in the air for a challenge and fake an elbow.,
try to dive when you’re in the opponent’s 18-yard box.,
Only dive on defense when you’ve got support.",How to Trick People in Soccer3," Diving is all in the acting. Soccer moves so fast that it's almost impossible for the referee to see everything, meaning that constant fouls by your opponent might go unnoticed a lot of the time. The goalie can't be everywhere. To make sure little touches and elbows get noticed, then, you've got to sell them like you're Brad Pitt going for an Oscar moment.


Flop to the ground, comically howling in pain. Grab your ankle or jaw, or whatever place your opponent supposedly hid, as if it were broken in half. Roll around on the ground comically, a look of pained desperation on your face. Make it look bad.






Keep holding the position until you hear a whistle. When your teammates come up, or your opponents start complaining that you're faking, resist the urge to break out of character. You're hurt. Mortally wounded perhaps. Stick to it until the foul is called and you can get up.







, The best time to sell an injury is when you've got the ball and the defense comes in hard. Even if they get the ball clean, throwing your legs out behind you as if they went straight for your shins is the best time to sell.


Let the momentum of your opponent affect the power with which you throw your legs out. It'll always be better if the other player is running very fast, so the sell can be seamless. You need to make sure that your opponent is moving quickly, so when you kick your legs out from under yourself it looks more realistic.






Kick your legs in the direction your opponent was running. So, if you're both running toward each other, kick your legs out behind your. If you're running parallel, your legs need to go out in front of you.







, If you both go up for the ball together, elbows will be flying around. Even if one doesn't hit you, come down howling and holding your jaw, your eye, or your teeth as if you'd just been cold-cocked.

, The best place on the field to dive is when you're in possession and you've crossed into your opponent's 18 yard (16.5 m) box. If you're taking the ball in unsupported and being defended heavily, make a big show of getting injured. Any penalties called while you've got the ball in the box will result in a penalty kick for your team, which is a high-probability opportunity.


Don't flop if a good offensive opportunity is presenting itself. If your teammate is streaking toward an open net and is open for the cross, don't fall down so you can try to get a penalty kick. Make the pass and get the clean goal.







, If you're playing defense and you get beaten off the ball, a good way to stop play and give your teammates a change to catch up is to sell an injury. Fake like your opponent stole the ball by stabbing your ankle, rather than getting the ball clean. Play should be whistled dead, effectively stopping a fast-break and giving your teammates a chance to catch up.


It's best to only do this if you've got defensive support, and other teammates can make up for it if your fake doesn't fake out the refs. You don't want to end up flopping on the ground and howling while the offense streaks for the goal and the ref calls nothing.






If you don't have support, it's sometimes a better idea to foul the other player to stop a fast-break. If it looks especially dire, you can halt play and give up a free kick, but take away the possibility of a fast break goal.

Enact a full-on penalty area defensive drill.",How to Defend in Soccer," Defenders in professional soccer are generally the tallest players on their team and are more solid than their teammates. This is because, as a defender, your objective is to protect your goal from shots by any means. This will require:


Strength, both for fending off aggressive opponents and to clear the ball once you regain possession.Weight train your legs to improve your ball clearing power and header potential. Don't neglect your upper body or you may be unable to jostle your way to the ball when going for a header.Balance, for staying upright, tackling, and responding to on-field developments. Train your balance through specific exercises, like squats, and improve your core strength to encourage greater full body stability.;
, All soccer players are expected to be high endurance runners, but defenders should be tireless.You should develop this characteristic throughout your career in the sport if you wish to become an exceptional defender.


To achieve this end, you might consider taking up swimming or cycling.
Give extra focus to the development and performance of your legs. Strong legs will enable you to challenge opponents for headers more easily.
Improve your vertical jump height.
Jump rope to make you a stronger header contender., Positioning is essential for every defender, as poor positioning can allow unnecessary shot through your defensive line.As a defender, you are the last line of defense before the goalie. You must keep a wide awareness of the situation on the field as it develops, including:


The position of opposing strikers.
Midfielders adding pressure to the opposing team's attack.
The position of your defensive line.

, As a defensive player, you'll be expected to have excellent ball handling skills. A sloppy pass or poor control can lead to repossession of the ball by the other team, which could end disastrously for yours.


You should drill regularly with other defenders to maintain your ball handling skills and develop your adaptability to the defensive styles of different players.

, Experts consistently recommend that you watch the hips and the ball when on the defense.Talented strikers have many tricks to use against defenders, like body feints, but you can see through these by watching the challenging player's hips. This will often clue you in as to where he is headed.


It's important to keep a close eye on the ball and not be fooled by fancy footwork; strikers that rely on tricky feet will be undone if you refuse to be distracted.

, The dimensions of the soccer field are unchanging, and the directions from which an opponent can approach your net limited. You should train your mind to instantly analyze the approach of any player on the opposing team. Ask yourself:


How will he shoot on net?
Does he have any support he might pass to?
How might his fellow strikers support him?
How will his fellow strikers shoot on net?

, Defenders should never give up, even in the worst situations.When the defense gives up, the goalie is without support, which can be dangerous for the goalie physically and for your team in terms of points.


As a defender, you will need to be willing to sacrifice whatever necessary to stop goals, including your body.
For example, if a player is about to shoot, you have to be willing to throw your body, legs or even your face in the way to block it.
Defenders need to be highly competitive with a will to succeed, and never give in no matter how bad the situation looks.

, If the striker you are covering prefers quick, agile plays, you'll want to play very aggressive defense and stick with him closely to prevent him from taking advantage of any gaps. Players that rely on tricks of footwork to confound defense can be undone by careful attention, on your part, to his hips and the ball.


You might also consider setting a trap for offensive players by allowing a gap to form in the defense.If you attempt a trapping maneuver, you need to be sure of the other player's abilities as well as your own. If he surprises you with a sprint that is faster than you expected, you may be left in the dust and him with a shot on net.

, First and foremost, your responsibility as a defender is to protect the net. You should keep yourself between the strikers of the other team and the net at all times, but there may be occasions where you need to cut off a dangerous pass to an open player.It's important for you as a defender to keep your awareness sharp and make judgement calls as best you can. If you react slowly to changes on-field, your defense will suffer.

, You should leave roughly an arms length of space between you and your opponent.


Wait until the right moment to steal the ball away by back stepping until your opponent makes a mistake.

, It's easy for the opposition to evade a defender that approaches head on, so you should avoid running straight at opposition strikers. When confronting an offensive player, try to approach at an angle that forces the opposition to use his non-dominant foot.You can better ensure the right hip angle by leading with one foot while you cover an offensive player. This way you can turn easily in response to developments on the field.

, If you see teammate midfielders on the approach, adjust your cut off angle to bring the pressure of another defender down on the attacking player you're covering.,


Defenders that want the keeper to get the ball, or receive a passback, should vocalize their expectations.
Get to know your teammates. Communication is easier when the defenders and other players know each other.

, Set up a grid for you and your practice partner that is about seven by twenty yards long. Both you and your partner should start at opposite ends of the grid, with your partner in possession of the ball. Your partner should then attempt to drive the ball to the other side of the grid. The goal of the defending player (that's you) is to:


Win the ball from the attacker.
Force the attacker out of bounds., You'll need a larger grid for this exercise. One that is approximately 25 yards by 40 should do nicely. This will allow for more breakaway plays between players, which will more closely model a real game scenario. Split a group of four players into two pairs and have each pair defend one side of the grid.Each pair of players should attempt to win the ball from attackers or force attacking players out of bounds. To keep this drill fun, you might consider alternating between offense and defense between pairs.

, Mark off a 44 by 30 yard box that encompasses the entirety of the net and penalty area, extending a ways beyond the penalty area towards midfield. You'll need two teammates at the edge of the 18 yard box for crossing the ball, two ""attacking"" players in front of the net, and three defenders (including yourself).One of the attackers should pass the ball to one of the wing players.
The wing player will read the field and, when prepared, cross the ball to an attacking player.
Defenders should coordinate to stop the attack on net and clear the ball or regain possession., Measure out a 35 by 35 yard area for this exercise that includes a full size net at one end.To perform this drill, you'll need an attacking ""team"" with five players in a 3-2 formation, with three players acting as midfielders and two as the forwards.The defending ""team"" will need four players, including a goalkeeper, in a 3-1 formation.The lead attacker should begin the drill with possession of the ball, just inside the boundary of the grid, opposite the net.
Defenders should work to either regain possession of the ball and clear it or force the attackers out of bounds.

Warm up before the game, to get every muscle ready to make a save.",How to Make a Good Save in Soccer1,"

Stretch. Stretch the muscles in your legs, which are most important.



 


A simple warm-up that is used by even professional goalkeepers is this: Have a teammate throw a ball at you, with you standing in the middle of the goal. Then, before touching the ball, you have to touch one post, then you can try stop it.






Another good way is to simulate an attack - Have a couple strikers play down the field, slowly making their way to you. Then, they can try to score. This will give you chance to practice those dives.






Practice hand-eye co-ordination. Do this by having a teammate punt (Like a drop-kick but not letting it hit the ground) the ball near you, and try to catch it.






A practice game before the game is actually really good. You can practice every skill you will need on the field, so you'll have plenty of chances to make a good save.

If you take your eyes off it for anything other than a quick glance at the goalposts or your players, you might lose sight of it. This can lead to a ball slipping past you easily.

,


Are they playing offensive or defensive?
You can tell what way they're playing by watching how they move around. Are they constantly tackling and doing whatever they can to score a goal? Or do they have 4 defenders that are constantly trying to stop your team scoring? Some things are more subtler, like the other team's positioning.
If they're playing offensive, then you need to stay alert. Goalkeepers can be not really alert when the opposing team is scoring, if they're fast enough.
If they're playing defensive, be more alert about how your team is positioned. It's better to not have to make a save at all by having your defenders in the right position, especially with a defensive opposition, than having to make a save every minute or so.

,


They might be constantly crossing to each other, or just staying close and weaving the ball through your players.
Watch how they move around, kick the ball, pass it.
Do they have any specialties? Do they have a big kick, or do they trick their way around players? Things like this can really help.

"
Know when to come out at the player, and when to stay put.,
Know what type of save you should make.,
Out of those types of saves, make a decision.",How to Make a Good Save in Soccer3,"

This is hard to create a how-to for. Knowing when to come out is more of an instinct that you will gain as a goalkeeper.






There is a little trick, though. Closing the angle. If you're fast enough, and it's 1 on 1, run out most of the time. It will either scare the player off, having them jump away from the ball, letting you pick it up, or, they'll kick, and it will go wide, unless they're really good at curving the ball around someone.






Knowing when to stay put, or when to close the angle, is a good trick to have up your sleeve, because most times it will end up as a goal saved, or a goal scored.







,

There are more types of saves than just a diving save. There are:






Blocking Saves: These are just saves you make by just blocking the ball. You do this by getting your body in front of the ball, and trying to catch it. If you don't catch it, no need to worry: The ball still got you in the chest, you have another chance!






Ground Saves: These are when the ball just slides along the ground. To make the save, you dive onto the ground, sliding in the direction of the ball. Be careful with this type of save; it can be dangerous, if you land wrong.






Rotation Dive, or 'Windmill' Dive: These are one of the most difficult dives known, being for when a ball is coming right beside you. Normally a reaction kick save will be the only way to save it, but occasionally, you can do a windmill dive. Gravity won't allow you to fall fast enough to reach a ball right beside you in time, so you have to force yourself to the ground. Do this save by swinging your body around at the ball, hopefully deflecting or catching it. Be careful, because you can land wrong and injure your shoulder or head.






Diving Save: This is a save that is for when a ball is in the air, coming into the goal. You have to know what way the ball is going, and dive to that side, throwing yourself into the air. Your legs need to be strong to get that ball in the corner, or get the ball that's a bit high.






Rolling Ball Save: This save is just for when the ball is rolling towards you, not that threateningly. To do this, you move towards the ball, collapsing to the ground with not enough space between your legs to have the ball go through. You then scoop the ball up with your arms. This save is not dangerous at all.






Reaction Kick Save: This save is more instinctive. The ball is coming at you, and you kick your foot out to the side, stopping the ball, and clearing it at the same time. You don't have to always use your hands as a goalkeeper. Most of the best keepers use a mixture of both.







,


Is the ball up high, to the side, or just slowly coming towards you? A goalkeeper shouldn't need to think about it once they know every type of save, and what each is good for.

, Don't ever use cold water or boiling water. A good mix is 1/3 of the tub cold water and 2/3 of the tub very hot water. To test the temperature, stick your hand in the tub. Your hand shouldn't get cold and it shouldn't burn either. It should be about the temperature of a relaxing bath.

, Put only a drop of water to the water. If you don't have any dish soap don't worry about it., Do this for about ten seconds, we're only trying to get the glove nice and wet. If there are clumps of mud on the glove, feel free to get it off now too, you may need to replace the water after though. Take the glove out of the water. It's more effective if you clean one finger at a time.

, You now want to rub the glove whilst under water. Do this finger by finger. Do this with your knuckle or thumb as you can apply lots of pressure to the latex part of the glove. Rub it until all of the mud is off the glove. Then repeat with the other glove., After the cleaning process, your gloves should be dripping wet. The best way for your gloves to dry is naturally but to get all the excess water out, you need to use a towel.


Get one glove and place it in the middle of an old face towel. A bath towel will be far too big. If that's all you have, fold it in half or quarters until it's small enough to work with.
Fold the towel in half with the glove in the middle. It should look like a burger, with the towel being the bun and the glove being the burger.
Walk or jump on top of the gloves, which should be covered with the towel. This should squeeze out and excess water.

Dive for penalty shots.",How to Be Fearless as a Soccer Goalie," Becoming a fearless goalie starts with practicing and perfecting basic soccer playing skills so you are more comfortable on the field. As the goalkeeper you are the last line of defense for your team. During your training focus on your reflexes, reaction time, as well as your overall agility.For reflex training, have your teammates line up in front of the goal each with their own ball. Have each of them kick the ball from different distances and at different speeds so that you have a variety of situations to deal with. This will get you used to high intensity game play, as well as work on the reflexes needed to be a fearless goalie.
To practice your reaction time, have your coach line up two rows of balls in front of the goal, one row closer to the goal than the other. Your coach will kick the balls into the goal (the closer ones will come off the ground a bit while the farther ones will stay lower, creating an erratic pattern). Your job is to keep all the balls from getting into the goal.;
, As with most sports, keeping your eye on the ball is key. When training, use a smaller ball than your standard soccer ball. This will help you focus better and make it easier for you to catch, block, and maneuver the larger soccer ball once you're in the game., Having quick feet is very important for the goalkeeper. You have to be able to move back and forth, jump, and move out of the way very quickly. Make sure you master the two most common forms of footwork used by goalies, side-to-side and crossover.Side-to-side. Train for this kind of footwork by keeping the ball between your feet and quickly kicking it back and forth between the insides of your feet. Once comfortable with that movement start to practice keeping the ball moving from side to side between your feet while moving your whole body forward and backward.Crossover. This involves swiftly crossing one foot in front of the other to get the ball.To practice this, bounce the ball off the top of your cleats about knee height back and forth, and then to waist height. Cross your right leg over the ball as it’s descending from waist height and try to catch the ball again with your other foot.Mastering these soccer drills during your training will help you gain confidence in your soccer playing abilities, and confidence leads to fearlessness!, Looking at your opponent's head specifically is key to helping you predict where the ball might be heading.If the player is looking down, there's a 99% chance that the ball will not leave the ground. If the player is looking straight ahead, the ball might come off the ground a bit, but will come at you straight and hard. If the player is leaning back as they kick the ball, the ball is going to leave the ground.Pay attention to the position of your opponent's body and feet if you approach them. Most people are right-footed, and will likely kick it to your right hand side. Try to swing your right foot around, with the inside of your foot facing the ball to block it. This will help you anticipate what your opponent is likely to do, with less fear of unknown outcomes.
No one likes getting hit by an unexpected ball, having a good idea of where the ball is likely to come at you helps you brace for it and be less fearful of getting hit by it.

, Being the goalie is a tough job, stand confidently with your head up and shoulders back. Stay calm at all times and remember it is okay to get hit with the ball, so go for every shot! It’s easy to get discouraged by missing shots, so don't sweat it. Keep in mind how important your job is, and that all you can do is give it your best effortUnderstand that the goalie position is a very tough position. Accept the fact that you are going to get hit, kicked, and maybe even stepped on, but that it is all part of the game. Mentally preparing for the likelihood of physical injury will help you feel prepared for anything the game might throw at you, so you won't waste time thinking about the possibility of getting hurt and can focus on the game.

, Do not get scared and stand there waiting for your opponent to make a shot. If possible, attack and take control of the ball, this can help to startle them instead!, Being the goalie means you have the advantage of using your hands and arms. Don't be afraid to give it your all. Dive, lunge, and jump to block the ball if you have to.


If your opponent successfully gets the ball around you, run and slide diagonally toward their right hand side. If they try to kick it to the right, your feet will block it. If they kick it to the left, stretch your hands out to catch it. Try to keep your legs closer to your opponent than your face to avoid injury. Being fearless doesn't mean you purposefully jeopardize your own safety for the sake of the game.

, Never try to kick the ball past an approaching opponent, this leaves your goal more vulnerable. Always kick it away from them if possible.


Make sure you have a teammate who is able to receive the ball before kicking or throwing it back into play., Penalty shots can be one of the most intimidating aspects of goalkeeping, mastering them will make you less fearful of them.


Never wait for the penalty shot on your heels; stay in the middle of the goal on your toes at all times so you can react faster. Remember, the player will have a chance to run up to the ball so there's a good chance the ball is not going to stay on the ground.

, When diving to block the ball, try to keep your arms stretched out as far as you can and remain ready to receive the ball.


Never close your eyes as you lunge or dive for the ball.
If you can't catch the ball, grab it. Be aggressive and quickly scoop the ball up before the opposing team approaches and tries another shot at the goal.

, The attacking team will try to push down the wings. Ask for assistance from center backs if you must.

",How to Be an All Star Goal Keeper," This way you'll always be prepared for the shot. Never turn your back to the field.;
, Place both hands next to each other so that the thumbs are touching to create W shape. Use this when catching higher balls and it will be much more effective. Always keep your hands over top of the ball when you catch it so that it falls down to your feet if you can't hold on to it. It's much better to have the ball loose at your feet than to have it loose going through your hands into the net.

, In order for your teammates to know whether to rely on you or to help, you have to communicate. This also helps when a teammate is not doing their job.

, If you're always tense, getting hit with the ball will hurt more, than if you are relaxed.

, This helps shorten the open areas for the other team to shoot into.

, When a shot is taken, while you're in the goal, always move so you are in front of the ball.

",How to Be a Good Defender,";
, Make sure you know where you're going, where you have to go, and what you have to do when you get there.

, This is critical to a good defensive player. See the whole field; are you out numbered; is there a winger behind you; is there a defensive player who is able to make a dash?

, When you need to make a tackle, try to time your attack, so that your opponent is off balance, the fraction of a second, when you make your move is critical. If he is flat footed at that moment, or off balance, your chance of success improves dramatically. Go in hard and fast and go for and make sure you hit the ball. Also, you can thwart possible attacks by clearing any lose balls or intercepted passes.

, Deny the pass, deny the turn, and deny the shot. Position yourself to deny the pass; crouch, anticipate, act fast. If he gets the pass, do not let him turn to face you. The longer he has to keep his body between the ball and you the better. If he is able to turn and face you, stay between the ball and your goal and block his shot.

, Delay the offense until you have numeric superiority, then have someone back you up before you go in for a tackle. It is easy to beat 1 player but much more difficult to beat 2. Talk to your teammate; 2nd defender tell 1st when to go in to tackle.

, You control the offensive player, don’t let him control you. Fake a tackle (a sharp stabbing movement in and out) to keep him off balance and worried you will attack him at any time. Keep backing off as he makes his moves, the longer he is unable to beat you out right, the more frustrated he will be.

, Have a strong upper body, work out your muscles for your legs. You also have to work on being very fast. This helps a lot when defending.

, If he is able to turn you (So you are running alongside of him), you need to quickly get back to a position where your back is towards your goal. Stare at the center of his chest and don’t look at his legs or head movements. He can fake head motion or leg motion to get you going the wrong way but difficult to move his center of gravity.

, Some attackers are throw off their game if the defender is aggressive and play tough; but not dirty. That first tackle is critical and can set the tone for the remainder of the game. Let him know you are there and you are not a pushover.

These rules and regulations are discussed by and decided upon by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which is a committee within the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).FIFA governs every aspect of the game of internationally.FIFA publishes the official book of rules and regulations for soccer. It is updated regularly and the current version has 140 pages.You can find a copy of the rules and regulations of soccer at http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf .
The IAFB has established and recognized 17 standard and universal laws of soccer. This is because the FIFA rules and regulations often differ between countries and organizations. In addition, the FIFA rule book might be too complex for beginning players to understand.The 17 laws cover the following topics: the field of play, the soccer, the number of players, the players’ equipment, the referee, the assistant referees, the duration of the match, the start and restart of play, the ball in and out of play, the method of scoring, offside, fouls and misconduct, free kicks, penalty kicks, the throw in, goal kicks, and corner kicks.You can access the specifics of each of the seventeen standard laws at http://www.syossetsoccer.org/home/683808.html.
You can read more about how to play soccer at How to Play Soccer.;
, Each player on a soccer field, from forwards to midfielders to the goalie, has a specific set of rules and regulations related to their position. Knowing these laws will help you be a better goalie and teammate.

, Beyond the standard equipment any soccer player needs including cleats, shin guards, and a jersey, a goalkeeper must also follow the regulations on gear specific to his position on the field. From gloves to a special jersey, the equipment helps other players identify the goalie on the field.


Goalies must wear a uniform, long socks, shin guards, and soccer cleats.FIFA regulations also require that a goalie’s equipment be distinctive from other players and the officials to identify his position on the field.For example, most goalies will wear a team jersey that is a different color from the rest of the players.
Goalies also wear special gloves to help them grip the ball and protect their hands from shots on goal. You can find out more about goalie gloves at https://www.wikihow.com/Size-and-Take-Care-of-Goalkeeper-Gloves .

, Before you start playing and training as a goalie, purchase the proper equipment. From gloves to cleats and shin guards, each piece of equipment will ensure that you are prepared to play your best and safest.


You need the following equipment to play: goalie gloves, cleats, shin guards, socks, and a jersey.Goalie gloves, which are made of thick leather, cushion your hands when you catch or stop shots on goal. They also help you grip the ball better.
Cleats are special sneakers for soccer. They have hard stud on the bottom of the shoe that allows you to grip the turf on the field more effectively.
Shin guards protect your lower leg bones from being kicked by the hard cleats, which can be not only painful, but also injure you. You must wear socks that cover your shin guards completely, which also helps keep them in place.A goalie jersey may have padding in the shoulder and hip areas to protect you from the force of direct shots on goal. If you play for a team, it will often provide you with a proper goalie jersey for your team.
You can purchase all of the necessary soccer equipment at specialty sports stores or even at online retailer such as Soccerpro.com., It’s important for a goalkeeper to know where on the field he may play, from kicking the ball to throwing it with his hands. Knowing these rules will keep him from violating any of the rules of the game.


A goalkeeper may leave the goal box to join outfield players for defensive purposes, which often happens when a team needs to attack its opponents using full force.
The goalie may grip the soccer ball when he within his own penalty area. In certain situations, such a when a teammate deliberately kicks him the ball, he cannot handle.If the goalie commits such violations, the referees will grant the opposing team with an indirect free kick, which may be close to the goal.A goalkeeper may not control the soccer ball for more than six seconds. If he violates the rule, the opposing team are granted an indirect free kick.The rules consider possession whenever the goalie is holding the ball with his hands, or if the ball somewhere between his body and the ground.Goalies may take penalty kicks and participate in penalty shootouts.Coaches may substitute a goalkeeper so long as play follows the regulations for player substitution.If an opposing player is making a penalty kick, the goalie must remain not only on his goal line but also in between the goalposts. He may make any movement as long as he does not move forward before the ball is kicked.A goalie may be given a red card for violating the rules of the game. In this case, any outfield player or a substitute goalie can take over for the ejected goalkeeper., Because there are rules that govern soccer matches specific to certain countries and organizations, learn any differences there may be in your country or the organization for which you play. This will keep you from making mistakes that could cost your team the match.


For example, some organizations may require you to wear goalkeeper gloves whereas FIFA allows individual goalies to choose if they want to wear gloves.

, As a goalie, you are in the unique position among your teammates that you can see the entire field of play. By paying close to the game at all times, you not only help your team gain advantages, but also ensure that you’re prepared to defend the goal if the opposing team charges it.


Always keep your eye on the ball, even if it’s at the other end of the field. You wouldn’t want to be surprised if it is kicked to your end of the field.

, Since a goalie can see the entire field of play in soccer, it is important for him to effectively communicate what he sees to his teammates. This will help them know which opponents to watch or any patterns of play. The goalie can also provide motivation for tired or lagging teammates.Tell your teammates about certain opponents or patterns of play either during a time out or while they’re on the field. It’s important that they know these things because it not only helps them on the field, but also will help them do their job defending you and the goal area.
You can also develop and use hand gesture to cue your teammates about opponents or your own planned course of action.
Don't shout at your teammates too often. Be specific, concise, and decisive in your suggestions, but deliver the message in a polite manner. Remember, that you’re not the coach.

, If an opposing player is charging down the field to take a shot on goal, your job as goalie is to anticipate what move he’s going to make and then aggressively defend the goal. How you react in these situations can the difference between a save and the other team scoring.


Charge oncoming players to cut down the angle of their kicks and to make yourself bigger. Charging is also a useful tool to intimidate opposing players.
Moving your legs and standing on the tips of your toes will help you react more quickly to incoming plays. Those few split seconds often make a big difference in the outcome of a situation.
Make yourself larger inside the goal to intimidate charging players. You can do this by raising your hands above your head or holding them out to your side. This is also a psychological trick used to make a kicker unsure of where he is kicking the ball.
Reading the body language of players coming down the field. For example, if you notice a player planting his foot to kick, you can easily anticipate that the ball will follow the trajectory of the shot. Watching a player’s eyes can also give you cues about where he plans to kick the ball.

, Any ball traveling in the direction of the goalie can end up between the goal posts. It’s important to actively anticipate and attack any ball that comes towards you so that you don’t give the other team easy goals. Meaning, even if it is kicked higher than your height, jump!

, There are different ways to defend the goal area from catching the ball to kicking it or punching it out over the net. Choosing which defense strategy you use will depend on how the ball is approaching the goal area.


Catch the ball when you can. This will give you the option to punt it towards your teammates, giving them a chance at a goal.
When you catch a ball to save it from going in the goal, you have two options of how to play it: you can either throw it back to your teammates with your hands or directly kick it to one of your teammates further down the field.
There are times when it is not practical to catch the ball, for example if it is kicked too high or too fast. In these cases, you can deflect the ball with the palm of your hand or the tips of your fingers, or you can punch it over the net.
Kick the ball without first catching it only in an emergency situation, such as an immediate threat to the goal area.
If a ball is low to the ground or approaching you at a flat angle, dive for it and then get up quickly.
Get up quickly if you dive, catch or kick a ball. You never know when you'll need to make a second save.

, Soccer is a fast moving sport that requires a lot of running over the course of a 90-plus minute game. Even though you’re guarding the goal and may not be running as much as a forward, you still must be physically fit and prepare to run quickly in and out of the goal box and even on the field.


Running is one of the most important activities for a soccer player and a goalie. Aim to run at a decent pace for at least 90 minutes to ensure that your body is able to handle the rigors of the game.
You’ll also need to sprint in and out of the goal area to protect it from shots and potential shots on goal. It’s a good idea to train for this by running sprinting drills. For example, you could do 10 sprints of 100 meters so your body is prepared to accelerate quickly in and out of the goal.

, As a goalie, you need to be able to clear the ball from the goal area by both kicking and throwing it. In order to do this most effectively, you need to have strong legs and arms, which you can train with weight exercises.


Doing cardio work like running will strengthen your legs, but doing leg-specific weight exercises will increase your strength. Consider exercises such as squats, lunges, and leg presses, all of which will train your entire leg.
Since being a goalie also requires you to use your arms and hands, doing exercises to increase your upper body strength is also important. Consider exercises such as shoulder presses, bicep curls, chest presses, and wrist curls. Using an implement such as the Gripmaster will strengthen your fingers and wrists.
You can also consider strength and flexibility training exercises such as yoga. Top international teams such as Bayern München practice yoga not only to augment their strength training exercises, but also to increase flexibility and refine fine motor skills. In addition, yoga can train you to focus and relax more effectively., Being a successful soccer player and goalie requires more than being able to kick or throw a ball. Remember, a goalie is no different that a field player except that he is allowed to use his hands inside the goal box. You’ll need to train your fine and gross motor skills to most effectively handle the ball with your hands and feet.


To train fine and gross motor skills on your feet and legs, do drills that focus on activities such as dribbling a soccer ball going in different directions and punting it at different distances from your goal posts.For punts to clear a ball from the goal, practice having your planted foot and body face in the direction you want the ball to travel.
You should also train for the two basic steps a goalie uses: the shuffle and the crossover. Galloping sideways will train you for shuffling, while turning your legs in opposite directions from your hips will train you for doing a crossover.As a goalie, you’ll also need to train your hands for greater dexterity with the balls. Throwing and catching drills with your coaches or teammates will help you develop handwork skills., A goalie must be able to anticipate the opposing players’ move and react accordingly. Drills can help you speed up your reaction times, which may be the difference between effectively defending a shot on goal or failing to stop it before it enters the goal.One good exercise to train your reaction times is to kick a soccer ball at a wall with different parts of your foot and then trying to stop it from getting past your body.

, One of the primary jobs of a goalie is to understand the mindset of opposing players and anticipate their moves. By learning how to read opposing players’ moves, you will be able to more effectively anticipate what move they are about to make, which will help you block shots on goal and determine the course of the game.Playing soccer often will give you the practical experience to read the moves of other players. Often, there are patterns of play that you can detect from this.
Watching videos of other goalies and players can highlight additional tactics to help you more effectively anticipate the moves of both offensive and defensive players and then determine the proper course of play.One good drill to help you anticipate a player’s move is to practice mock shootouts and penalty kicks with a friend or your teammates. Even working with a couple of cones as a goal will help you practice this skill.
Practice your dive to save a ball on a bed or soft mattress.

, Part of being a goalie is anticipating shots on goal, which can come at different speeds and angles. Having a basic understanding that geometric and mathematical principles dictate where a ball will land can help you to more effectively anticipate plays.Always try to close angles so that an opposing player does not have many options from where they can shoot. For example, if the player is charging from the right, don't stand in the middle of the goal. Instead, face the ball with your body and stand close to the right post.A good rule of thumb for positioning yourself properly to angles is to pretend that there is a string extending from the ball to the very center of the goal. You want to position yourself on that string.
If a ball is kicked flat to the ground directly towards you, don't just reach your hands downward. Rather, hold your entire body low to the ground, which will allow you to dive forward if necessary.
If an opposing player is making a penalty shot, you also need to block the angle. Looking for cues in a player’s eyes or at his feet could help you figure out which angle to block.

, Playing on a soccer team, including as a goalie, requires that you have mental strength to get through the ups and downs of games. By working on your mental stamina, you can successfully navigate any obstacles that might be present not only at a game, but also within your team.It’s important to know that everything will never go perfectly in a game, or even in a practice. You need to be emotionally flexible and resilient in order to quickly rebound from setbacks so that they do not become a hindrance for your team.Having confidence in your skills will also help boost your mental stamina. This can come from knowing that you’ve trained hard or that you have a very strong and supportive team.
Cognitive exercises like pep talks and seeing the positive in any situation also strengthen your mind and prepare you for games. Visualization, which is where you envision a play without actually going through it, is another effective exercise.Talking to a sports therapist or psychologist can help you identify and in turn strengthen your game. For example, you may always feel guilty when your team loses. But soccer is a team sport and realizing that perhaps the fault isn’t always yours, and maybe with the defensive players, will help you be a stronger player.

When you lower back down, keep your chest just above the ground.Don't strain your fingers as you practice this exercise. Start slow and work your way up to multiple push-ups.

, Find a pull-up bar and grab it with your hands about shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip. Lift your torso up to the bar, pulling up with your back muscles.To further enhance your grip strength, try pull-ups using two towels. Find two towels and drape them over the pull-up bar. Grip the towels and perform a regular pull-up., Place your thumb on the straight groove that runs around the middle of the ball. Place your other four fingers on the groove just above the center groove.You can palm the ball from anywhere, but when you are starting out it may help to line your fingers up with the grooves.Don't worry if you can't stretch your pinky to the groove, just get it as close as possible., When palming a ball, your fingertips do more work than your palm. Grip the ball by pressing your fingertips into the ball.Your palm may not even touch the ball once you are able to properly palm a basketball. Your fingertips should be doing all the work., To help you build finger strength, spend time squeezing your fingertips into the ball.Remember to practice squeezing with both hands.

, Once you can palm a basketball, try to put your new skill to use. Thrust the ball out as if you were going to pass it, but use your fingertips to keep the ball in your hands.Get used to moving the ball around while palming it. This will help your overall ball control and allow you to keep building grip strength.

Grip the ball on both sides with your fingertips pointed towards your chin.,
Bring the ball towards your chest.,
Take a step with your dominant foot and throw the ball.,
Bounce the ball instead of throwing it in the air to perform a bounce pass.",How to Pass a Basketball1," Put your fingers on each side of the ball with your thumbs behind the ball and your fingers spread apart. Your elbows should be in front of you and pointed towards the ground. Adjust your hips so they are squared up, and your knees are slightly bent.


Pivoting will allow you to pass it to people who aren’t directly in front of you.Make sure to practice how to grip the ball, but don’t hold it in front of you for a long time in a game because it can be easily stolen.;
, Bend your elbows and make sure they are tucked in close to your body.The ball should be close or touching your chest. Make sure to maintain the same grip on the ball. Find an open teammate and position your upper body to face towards them.









You should have full control over the ball as you bring it towards your chest, and it should be safe from defenders.
If you don’t have a good grip, try putting your hands further apart on each side of the basketball.

, Follow through to your teammate by fully extending your arms. Make sure as you throw the ball you rotate your wrists so your thumbs point down which adds rotation to the ball.Try to achieve as little arc on the ball as possible as it’s thrown. The more direct the pass is, the less a defender will be likely to intercept it.









You should be throwing the pass into your teammate's chest, not at their head or feet.
Try to throw the pass accurately and with power.

, Though it may appear to be a different pass all together, a bounce pass is performed exactly the same way as a chest pass, except that you bounce the ball on the ground once before it reaches your teammate. To perform one, bounce the ball ½ to ¾ of the way from your teammate, and it's a great way to fake out your opponent.The ball should bounce and then arrive somewhere around your teammates chest.









Use a bounce pass if there is a defender between you and a teammate.
This pass is slower than most passes, so make sure you are not too far away from your teammate if you use it or it may be intercepted.

"
"
Put on leg pads, chest protector, girdle (your choice), a catching glove, blocker, cup, mask, and use a goalie stick.

,
Watch the puck at all times, not the players (beginners).,
On low shots, do not just fall to the ground.,
Always try to smother the puck, to keep yourself from giving up a rebound.,
Get up again -- get ready to stop another shot.,
For high shots follow the puck through the air with your eyes and get a hand on it.

,
Remember that there is never a shot that you can't stop.,
Remember that making a name for yourself is not important.",How to Play Goalie in Hockey1,", For more advanced goaltenders, watching the play is essential This is how you can predict what might happen next. For example, if a player is coming down the left wing on you, and there is a player at the right corner of your crease, you should play a bit further back in your net in case the player decides to pass the puck. By just watching the puck, you lose a lot of what is going on. As you develop, you should always be looking around you to see what a players options are. Your job is not to guess what will happen, but to know how many options the player with the puck has, and as you develop you will have a sense for what options the player will most likely take. That being said, you should never lose sight of the puck, and you should always be prepared for a shot.

, Fall on your knees with your feet spread out and knees together.You are supposed to create a wall of pads preventing the puck or ball from getting through or bouncing up over. Work with a coach because this butterfly position is very dangerous. Also have your paddle down or stick up.

, Many goals in hockey are scored on rebounds.

, Do it fast though because rebounds will most likely come out.

,, Never give up. Always believe you can win.

, If you win, popularity comes naturally."

Research the types of fantasy hockey.,
Research the types of leagues.,
Learn about the categories.,
Look into the types of drafts.",How to Play Fantasy Hockey1," As with the majority of fantasy sports, fantasy hockey is presented in several different forms:


In rotisserie fantasy hockey, stat categories award points based on the number of teams in the league (for example, in a 10-team league, categories award points from 1 to 10 depending on where teams rank in that category). If you rank fifth in assists, that would be worth 6 points to your team. The owner with the highest point total at the end of the season is declared the winner.

Points-based is the simplest style of fantasy hockey, awarding different point totals for various achievements (goals, penalty minutes, goalie wins, and others). The team that collects the most points wins.

Head-to-head pits one team owner against another on a weekly basis. Their rosters compete against one another in various statistical categories, with each team earning a “win” for finishing ahead of the opponent in a category. Rather than accumulate points, team owners aim to finish with the best “win-loss record” at season’s end.

Salary-based is a fantasy game in which owners are given a fixed amount of fictional money and must use it to build a team. Each player in the NHL is tagged with a predetermined “salary.” Users are not allowed to exceed the “salary cap.”;
, It is important to establish how much commitment you’re willing to put into playing fantasy hockey before deciding on what kind of league you’re interested in entering:



Single-year leagues are the simplest form of fantasy hockey. You draft a team, make roster moves throughout the season and go for the championship. The following year, you start completely from scratch. This style of league is ideal for anyone looking for something easy to track and requiring the minimum amount of commitment.

Keeper leagues allow fantasy players to keep a maximum number of NHL players on their roster from one season to the next. Some leagues mandate that each team keep the same number of players, while others set a range of players per team. The following year’s draft includes any player not retained.
In dynasty leagues, teams remain the same from year to year, with the only roster changes coming in the form of player adds, player drops and trades. Each year, the annual draft consists exclusively of rookies. This league requires a great deal of attention and commitment.

, While each league varies, most use some variation of 10 categories—six devoted to forwards and defenseman and four geared toward goaltenders:



Goals refer to any instance in which a player directs the puck into the net.

Assists are given to a maximum of 2 players who touch the puck prior to a teammate scoring a goal. Possession must be uninterrupted for an assist to be awarded.

Power play points are rewarded any time a player records a goal or an assist while his team has a man advantage.

Shorthanded points refer to any goals or assists accumulated while a player’s team is short a man.

Penalty minutes are accumulated whenever a player is given an infraction.

Plus-minus is a category that tracks which players are on the ice for goals in even-man situations (5-on-5, 4-on-4, or 3-on-3). A player on the ice when his team scores an even-man goal is given a plus-1, while opposing players are given a minus-1.

Goalie wins are awarded whenever a netminder is on the ice when his team scores the eventual winning goal.

Goals-against average is a stat tracking how many goals the netminder allows per 60 minutes of action.

Save percentage measures a goaltender’s success rate when it comes to stopping the puck; a perfect save percentage is 1.000.

Shutouts refer to any game in which a goaltender does not allow a goal.

, The type of draft you conduct will shape how you conduct your research and ultimately decide on a strategy:



Straight drafts can be conducted either online or in person. In a straight draft, the order is established, and users select NHL players one at a time. The order can either be regular (people own the same pick in every round) or serpentine (straight draft order is used for odd-numbered rounds, while the opposite is used for even-numbered rounds). Players are selected until all teams’ empty slots are filled.

Auto drafts are conducted online, with teams selected automatically rather than by the competing team owners. The drafting program makes selections based either by the site’s player rankings, or by pre-rankings established by the team owner. This type of draft is ideal for those who are unable to agree on a mutual date for a live draft.

Auction drafts do not follow a specific draft order. Instead, a player is offered up for bid by one team owner, and everyone then bids on the player until a final price is established. Teams are limited to predetermined budgets and must fill every spot on their roster without running out of money.

Put a hand on each side of the ball with your fingers spread apart.,
Bring the ball up over your head.,
Step forward with your dominant foot and throw the ball.",How to Pass a Basketball2," While some people prefer to to throw an overhead pass with one hand, utilizing both of your hands will make it so you have more control over the ball. Make sure that your thumb is behind the ball and that your fingers are tightly gripping the sides.









Use an overhead pass if there is a large distance between you and your teammate, if there is a potential for a break down the court, or you need to pass the ball over defenders' heads.The grip you use on an overhead pass is the same as you’d use for a chest or bounce pass.

, Lift the ball over your head so that your fingers are pointing towards the ceiling. Your elbows should be pointed forward, in front of you, with your legs slightly bent and your hips squared up. Make sure your dominant foot is slightly behind your other foot.









Do not put the ball behind your head. This is the perfect opportunity for the opposing team to steal the ball from behind you.Make sure you have identified your target before bringing the ball up over your head.

, Release the ball by bringing your arms down and snapping your wrists forward. Keep your elbows in, and aim for the chest of your target. If you need to really get the ball far down the court, a large arc on the ball is good, especially because you want to keep it over defenders heads. If you are closer to your teammate you should limit the arc because it can be easily stolen by a defender.









The bigger your step, the more power you put into your pass.
For more accuracy, use your wrists, as opposed to your arms.

Throw an overhead pass with one hand for a baseball pass.,
Throw a pass as the ball comes up from a dribble for a dribble pass.,
Toss the ball from behind your back for a behind-the-back pass.",How to Pass a Basketball3," A baseball pass is used if you want to throw the basketball far down the court to an open teammate. Take the basketball in on hand and bring it slightly behind your head, above your shoulder. Step with your non-dominant foot and throw with your dominant hand, much like you would with a baseball.









Baseball passes can easily be knocked out of your hand because you do not have full control over the ball.
Only use a baseball pass if you really need your basketball to go the extra distance.

, One of the drawbacks from a traditional overhead or chest pass is that you need to set up for the passes which gives the defender a clue on what you are doing. Dribble passes are ones that are made by transitioning from dribbling right into a pass without setting up for a chest or overhead pass. As your ball comes up when you are dribbling, instead of holding it and setting up, push the ball toward your teammate as it is coming up from the ground.









You do not have much control with this pass, so make sure to practice it before trying it in a game.
Step forward and follow through just as you would with any other pass. The foot you are stepping forward with should be on the same side of your body as the hand you're throwing the pass with.

, A behind-the-back pass is thrown by gripping the ball in one hand and wrapping your arm around your back. This is one of the most difficult passes to throw, and should only be used if you practice it enough. Square your hips as you normally would with one leg forward. Using the arm on the same side, bring the ball behind your back and snap your wrist so the pass gets distance.









Don't look at the teammate you plan on passing it to or else you will give yourself away, and the defender may know your attempting to throw a behind-the-back pass.This is a pass that’s used if there’s a defender that is right in your face.
It is harder to control the accuracy of this pass since it’s being performed behind your back, so you may turn the ball over.

"
There are two types of pads you can get.,
One type has a ""leg cradle"" and will make the goaltender feel like their pads are ""glued"" to their legs.,
The other type has no ""leg cradle"" and the pads fit very loose on their legs, however this can create ""pad slop"" (when the goalie moves to the right, the pad seems to want to move left).,
The feel of the pad totally depends on what the goaltender feels comfortable with.

",How to Play Goalie in Hockey2,";
, An example would be Vaughn pads.

, An example would be Reebok, Brians and Bauer.

,"
"
When you're deep in the net, your legs should be further than shoulder-width apart with the stick in between (to cover the 5-hole better) The further you step out of the net the less we need to spread the legs apart.

,
Point your toes inwards - this will allow your Butterfly to be more spread-out when you move into it.,Gloves should be forward (to the sides of your pads) and should extend beyond your pads

,
Stay comfortable in the net.",How to Play Goalie in Hockey3,", Don't worry about leaving too much 5-hole open (the space between pads), because with the toes pointed inwards and legs wide, a goaltender can quickly shut that hole down.

,, Don't be too tense or to loose.

"
"
If you have a proper stance (legs wide, toes pointed in), push your legs down to stop the puck.

,
Glove and blocker should be to the side of the body and in front of your pads.,
Your goal stick should be 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) in front of you depending on your height.,
Pads should lock together at the front with very little, if any space between them.

,
If a shot is from further out, the goaltender can move her/his gloves above and in front of the pads because it is easier for players to hit the top half of the net from further out.

",How to Play Goalie in Hockey4,", They should also be right above your pads (ie: just above the pad level, forming a wall). Elbows and upper arms should be tight to the body. The aim is to cover as much of the bottom of the net as possible, with as few holes as possible.

, This will allow shots to be deflected on an upwards angle away from the net (and will be more difficult for players to get the rebound). This also allows the goaltender to poke the puck quicker than if the stick is tight to pads.

,,"
"
Always try to deflect rebounds to the corner/side of the rink, this is done by angling the stick in front of you to direct rebounds upwards, or by angling your pad or blocker towards the corner by using a kicking motion (pads) or angling motion (blocker).,
If the goalie is in a butterfly position and the puck is deflected to the left of the goaltender, the goaltender should always get up on their ""powerleg"" (in this case the right leg).",How to Play Goalie in Hockey5," You can ""punch"" with your blocker if the shot is weaker, but it is usually wise not to.

, The reason why is that the goalie will be able to move to the next shot with greater speed than if they get up on their weak leg (in this case it would be the left leg). When this technique is mastered, rebounds become much easier, because the goaltender will automatically always get up on their power leg. This allows a goalie two options to get to the rebound: do a ""power slide"" or shuffle/t=push standing up.

"
"Decide what you are going to remember/do on the ice BEFORE you get to the rink, or at least before you step on the ice

,
Instead of judging why a goal went in during the game, wait until after the game.,
Try to use positive thinking.,
Ignore people who try to tell you how to play or what to do unless you trust them.,
If you begin to ""overthink"" what will happen on the ice or in the game, simplify your game.,
Have fun, it's why you liked the position in the first place.

",How to Play Goalie in Hockey6,", The goal is something you cannot change, and your focus should be on the moment, not in the past.

, ( ie: ""Don't drop into a butterfly so early"" can be changed to ""I will try my best to wait longer before I drop"")

, You do not have to fight or argue with them, but rather nod your head and say ""ya ya ya"" and then just go back to being you.

, Your job is to try your best to stop the puck, all else is secondary.

Read up on the players.,
Conduct your draft.,
Set your optimal lineup.",How to Play Fantasy Hockey2," Most of the largest sports websites have their own fantasy hockey sections, complete with “mock” drafts (conducted by fantasy experts to provide insight into possible draft trends), columns on overrated and underrated players, and projected statistics for the coming season. Magazines are also helpful, but generally wind up being dated by the time your draft is held.

, The draft is one of the most entertaining days of the fantasy year, as team owners gather to pick what they hope will be the winning roster - and engage in a little good-natured trash talk along the way. Stick to your strategy, but be willing to make minor adjustments as warranted. Make sure you fill every position with the best player available, and do your best to achieve proper balance in every category.

, Most leagues will allow you to carry more players than you need, with the extra bodies ending up on your “bench.” You’ll need to decide what your optimal lineup is and make sure it is set up in time for the start of the season.

"
"
Replace underperforming or injured players.,
Make trades to improve your team.,
Scour the Internet for tips, warnings, and trends.,
Enjoy the season!",How to Play Fantasy Hockey3," Nearly every fantasy hockey team runs into injuries or poor performances along the way. Unless you have an empty slot on your bench or specific slots for injured players, you will need to drop someone if you’re looking to add a free agent. Scour the pool of available players regularly and don’t be afraid to take a chance on players who are running hot, or who suddenly find themselves with more playing time than they were originally expected to get. Being proactive will help your chances of winning.

, Team owners will often find themselves strong in one area, weak in another, or both. This is the time to talk trade. If you’re dealing from an area of surplus—for example, you lead the league by a significant margin—then your best option is to deal some of your excess for help in other areas. Conversely, if you’re weak somewhere but well-balanced everywhere else, you should find a way to trade for help in that area. Trading isn’t always easy, but if you make enough offers and keep communication lines open, you should succeed in making your team better.

, Fantasy hockey experts don’t stop working once the draft season is over. They’re working all year long to provide owners with up-to-the-minute news on injuries, playing time situations, and other key developments. Leagues aren’t won on draft day, so continue following fantasy writers and analysts on a weekly basis, and adjust your roster accordingly.

, Fantasy hockey is designed to add appeal and excitement to the NHL season. Don’t take it too seriously, and you should find some level of enjoyment whether you finish first, second, or tenth.

Find a league in which to compete.",How to Play Broomball," An official broomball court is 200 feet (61 m) long and 85 feet wide, with your goals placed at either end. If you are playing outside, it is important to clear the ice of bumps, snow, and any other debris, if possible. A semi-circle, called the goal crease, should extend out around the goal. A player cannot make contact with the broomball while inside the goal crease, and the goaltender cannot leave this area., This step is optional if you are playing recreationally. The referee will start and stop the clock, call penalties, and conduct face-offs. Of course, this ref should be very knowledgeable about the official rules of broomball. The most up-to-date rule book can be found on the USA Broomball website., An official game of broomball consists of two halves of at least 30 minutes each. Teams should switch sides at the end of each half. Depending on the rules your team is following, an overtime can be called if there is a tie game at the end. Teams are allowed a minimum of two breaks between periods, and can use one sixty second time out per game., In a face-off, a player from each team meets in a circle in the middle of the rink. A referee drops the ball, and each player attempts to gain possession to start out the period. Every goal scored will also be followed by a face-off.


The players can’t touch each other at all before the ball is dropped. Their brooms cannot touch the ball until it has made contact with the ice.
If your court does not have a center-court circle, just make sure that the players not participating in the face-off are at least fifteen feet away.
If there is a stoppage of play for any reason, such as a penalty, the face-off will occur wherever the stoppage was called., This can be accomplished by running the ball or passing with your teammates. Passes made by a player’s broom or foot are allowed. The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner.


A goal is legal if it is hit into the goal with the broom, bounces off any player’s body into the goal, or enters the goal while a player is in the goal crease against their will (i.e. is dragged or pinned by another player).
A goal is illegal if it is hit deliberately into the goal with anything other than a broom, if the player’s broom is higher than their shoulders, if the player is within the goal crease, if it enters after a buzzer, or if it bounces into the goal off a referee., As a beginner, it’s always helpful to see what a game actually looks like. It’s not a sport that you’ll find regularly on ESPN, but luckily The International Federation of Broomball Associations offers videos of games online. Check these out, so you can see some experienced broomball athletes play a game start to finish.If your town has a broomball league, stop in and check out one of those games. You’ll get to see firsthand what it would be like to play there, and pick up some techniques.

, Unlike some sports, broomball requires several pieces of specific equipment. It’s important to decide how much you’re willing to spend, and scout out where you can buy this equipment in your area. There are several official broomball equipment sites if you have trouble locating the correct pieces. Additionally, you will need to research the cost of renting time in an ice rink or paying dues to a league.


If you’re hoping to save money, check websites like CraigsList to find used options.
If you’re not picky about having standard broomball equipment, some of the equipment can be swapped for things you already have. For example, you can use a soccer ball in place of a broomball, and you can use hockey nets instead of regulation size broomball nets., Once you’ve seen what a game of broomball entails, start conditioning! It’s a cardio-heavy sport, so running, cycling, or using the elliptical can help you prepare. Simple drills like hitting a broomball into a net or against a wall can help you get a feel for the equipment you will be using.

, Sticks are also called “brooms,” and they’re your most important piece of equipment. They can range anywhere from $20 to over $100. Brooms have shafts made of either wood or aluminum, but you may want to test both to decide which one feels better to you.

, There are different types of balls depending on your area of play. The outdoor ball could be mistaken for a soccer ball, though slightly smaller. The indoor broomball is the same size as the outdoor ball, but has a smooth exterior. Balls are typically sold for around $20, and it is recommended that each team has their own. Broomball nets are larger than standard hockey goals, measuring in at 6 feet (1.8 m) by 8 feet, while standard hockey goals are 4 feet (1.2 m) by 6 feet., Because broomball is played on ice, wearing the proper footwear is crucial! Normal sneakers will do OK, but shoes made specifically for broomball will provide a player with more traction. The sole is made of a thick neoprene foam that helps traction on ice. Like the balls, these shoes are specific to either indoor or outdoor play. Shoes are usually the most expensive broomball gear, so make sure you shop around!

, Unlike the other equipment, your helmet does not need to be broomball-specific. A standard hockey helmet is used in broomball, and you can also add a face shield if you choose. Some recreational players do not use helmets, but they are strongly recommended since you are playing on slippery ice.

, If not, form your own. Recruit friends, coworkers, and neighbors to play. If you’re hoping to create a more competitive team, posting flyers at parks and rinks, as well as looking online, can be good places to start.


You need at least 6 people to form a team- and 12 people for a game.
A standard team comprises three forwards, two defensemen, and one goalie.

, Make sure everyone understands the rules, which can be found here. Find times to meet and work on drills. The more you can scrimmage other teams, the better!

, This step, of course, is only for those who want to get more competitive. The USA Broomball website offers a search engine to find leagues near your town. While it isn’t as common as hockey or soccer, it is gaining popularity. There are both city and collegiate leagues in most states."

Maintain a good stance.,
Practice different blocking tactics.,
Practice skating.,
Focus on stopping the puck.,
Support your teammates.",How to Be a Goalkeeper1," Stand with your skates parallel to each other, a little more than shoulder width apart. Shift your weight slightly to the inside by bending your ankles a little, and push your knees forward.Keep your chest high. The shooter should be able to see the logo on your jersey. Not only does this add balance to your stance, it maximizes net coverage.To keep your chest at the correct level, keep your shoulders parallel.;
, Some professionals recommend that you always stay on your feet. Others will suggest ""butterfly"" goaltending, a method where you drop to your knees to block low shots. If you want to be successful goalie, vary your blocking tactics.To execute a butterfly block, think of driving your knees into the ice from your basic stance. Keep your butt off the heels of your skates. You want your upper body to be in much the same position as it is in your basic stance.When on your feet, you should be able to quickly move from side to side. Work on shuffling and skating backwards. As a goalie, you should be comfortable in the crease, or the area just in front of the net.Don't depend on any one tactic to block the puck. This can make you vulnerable and your opponents may soon figure out ways to score on you., Blocking shots is only a small part of a goalie's job. While you may block a lot of shots in a game, most of the time you will be positioning and recovering.You have to be a strong skater so you can follow the shooter and be quick in the crease., As a goalie, you should be well protected by a full set of gear. A puck can come in fast, but it's your job to stop it. When you practice, keep a clear head and focus on guarding the net.Have a coach or teammate take shots at you and try to focus on stopping the puck. Don't let the fear of getting hit get the better of you., The goalie is the last line of defense. When you find yourself defending a shot, it is because your teammates let the other team through. You may want to blame your teammates for this, but instead, encourage them.Encourage your teammates to work together when you see them struggling. Be there for them both physically and mentally."

Practice kicking and throwing the ball.,
Practice your footwork.,
Talk with your teammates.,
Train your reflexes.,
Work on reading your opponents.",How to Be a Goalkeeper2," As a goalie, it is your job to keep the other team from scoring. But once you're in control of the ball, you have to reinstate the attack, or put the ball back in play. To do that, you have to be able to kick or throw the ball with precision.Practice kicking the ball with accuracy up to at least 40 yards. Have a teammate stand at various distances and see how accurate your kicks are. Alternate between kicking and throwing.Always look for a teammate who is free, and don't just kick the ball back on to the field without a target in mind.You don't always have to lob the ball. You can roll it on the ground, or throw it low. The main goal is to get it back to a teammate., You may not be running up and down the field like the rest of your teammates, but that doesn't mean you can neglect your footwork. You need to be able to defend from all angles, and quickly change direction as the situation demands.Stay on your toes during games and practices. Don't lean back on your heels or you'll find it harder to make sudden movements.Practice moving from side to side without crossing your feet. Keep your shoulders and hips in line with the shooter as you move., Communication is key for being a strong goalie. It's your job as a goalie to let the rest of your team know when you are under pressure, or if they need to increase their defense.Aside from giving directions on the field, encourage the rest of your team to play better. Use a vocal tone that is positive, but firm.You can see the entire field and track the ball at the same time. Use this perspective to your advantage, and keep your teammates aware of what is going on on field.Shout out unguarded opponents, or marks, so your teammates know who to guard., A goalie needs solid reflexes to stop the ball. It isn't enough to just stand in front of the net. You need to be aware of the ball and where it is going.Have a coach or teammate line up a few balls about 5 metres (5.5 yd) away from the goal. Place the same number of balls about 11 metres (12.0 yd) away from the goal, parallel to the first row of balls. Have the coach kick these balls low, so that they hit the balls in front of them. The balls should be unpredictable. It is your job as the goalie to prevent any of them from entering the net.Stand on the goal line and face the net. Have your coach give a signal before he kicks, and then quickly turn around and try to stop the ball., It is important to focus on the ball, but it is just as important to be able to read your opponent. Watch the way their body moves as they dribble towards you. Pay attention to their feet, and watch their eyes.The supporting foot of your opponent can sometimes be an indicator of the direction they plan on shooting.If you can, try to study your opponents by watching videos of them in other games. Pay attention to how they move and respond to certain situations."

Practice a good stance.,
Practice seeing the ball.,
Study the shot menu.,
Buy good equipment.,
Be a leader.",How to Be a Goalkeeper3," For a good goalie stance, stand with your feet a little more than shoulder width apart. Bend your knees slightly, stay on the balls of your feet, and try not to lean forward.Grip the stick with your dominant hand at the top. Cradle the stick between your thumb and pointer finger. Keep the grip firm, but make sure you can rotate the stick. Place your bottom hand about a forearm's length below your top hand. The bottom hand should be loose enough to slide the stick up and down as needed.Hold your stick out in front of you, keeping your dominant hand even with your shoulder. Keep the stick in front of your helmet to protect your head., Try to empty your mind when you're playing goalie. The only thing you should focus on is seeing the ball.One way to help clear your mind is to only focus on the area 3 feet in front of you. Relax and clear your mind of everything going on around you. When someone shoots on you, focus on the ball and where it is going. This will train you to catch the ball, rather than guess where it is going., The ""shot menu"" in lacrosse refers to the 7 places on the field that a shot can come from. If you want to be a successful goalie, it's a good idea to practice saving shots from each of these angles.Shots can come from high, middle, and low angles, and from both sides of the goal. Some shooters even try bounce shots, which can be unpredictable.Have a teammate give you a variety of shots so you can get used to saving from multiple angles.

, Playing goalie can be dangerous. At some point you will definitely get hit by the ball. If you want to keep playing, then you should invest in good equipment to keep you safe.It is possible to get concussions playing lacrosse, so make sure you have a good helmet. Invest in a throat guard as well. The last thing you want is to get hit in the throat by a speeding ball.Get proper padding, such as gloves, shin guards, a chest protector, and a cup. While you want to stay protected, make sure you can still move in your gear. It isn't necessary to cover your shoulders and arms. You may get some bruises, but it won't hurt as bad as getting hit in the chest., You have a unique perspective of the game as a goalie. You should be able to watch your teammates and figure out their needs. Communicate with your team throughout the game to help them play better.Don't yell at your teammates, but you should use a strong voice when you make calls. Make sure you know everyone's name. If they have a nickname they prefer to go by, use that.If your teammates make mistakes, don't bring them down. Support your teammates and encourage everyone to work together.

Jump to snag rebounded balls.,
Glance down court.,
Make long outlet passes to the area between 3-point and free throw line.,
Draw the ball in close to your chin.,
Land in a stable, wide stance.,
Pivot to the outside and pass.",How to Outlet Pass1," Attack the ball at the highest point possible. Jump and meet the ball as high as you can in its arc off the rebound. The higher you jump, the better your chances of snatching the ball ahead of someone else.Pay attention to your peripheral vision as you snag the ball. Note the positions of players around the side court line. These players will be the ""outlet"" you pass to.;
, It can be difficult to coordinate all this movement in such a short period of time, which is why practicing the outlet pass is so important. As soon as you’ve secured the ball, but while you’re still in the air, try to turn your head to look down court at possible targets for an outlet pass., When making long outlet passes, aim for a spot on the court instead of a teammate. Try to pass so that nearby offensive teammates can pick up the pass on their drive to the net, like the area between 3-point and free throw line.The area between the 3-point and free throw line allows enough space for the ball to bounce once before going out of bounds, giving more time for your offense to retrieve it., This will prevent the opposing team’s defense from slapping the ball out of your hands. Once you secure the ball, draw it towards your body until it is under your chin.Your elbows should be pointed out. You should still be in the air while performing this motion., When you land, place your feet to form a wide base. Allow your legs to bend slightly at the knees upon impact. The hardest part about landing is maintaining the under-the-chin position of the ball throughout the motion.Landing in this fashion will minimize impact, which should help you keep the ball in position underneath your chin.

, Pivoting to the outside (away from the basket) will funnel your rebounded ball to safer territory. Pivot as soon as you land in the direction of the outlet you scoped out earlier, then pass the ball.Even a poor pass to an outlet can be recovered by your teammates. The heavier defense at your opponent’s net should be avoided, if possible."

Warm-up and stretch.,
Choose to strap your pads is completely your preference.,
Understand that the name of this technique is derived from the shape of your legs which must stretch out sideways, not behind you.

Always maintain an upright body position with your weight forward.

,
Spread your feet slightly wider than the basic stance.

Ensure the blade of your stick remains flat on the ice, but keep your stick covering your 5-hole.

",How to Make a Butterfly Save in Ice Hockey," Pay particular attention to your hip-flexors and knees.;
, Most butterfly goalies prefer to strap their pads a bit tighter at the bottom(not too tight or the pad will not roll) and looser as they get to the top. This is done to enable the pads to roll and easily make that ""wall"" of padding. Also having your toe strap too tight will not just make it harder for the pad to roll, you can seriously harm the muscle. It is important to make sure your toe strap is loose enough that your ankle can move around comfortably, but not so much that your pad is able to rotate on your leg.

Practice a lot.,
Encourage good sportsmanship from an early age.,

Travel.,
Continue advancing if it's warranted.",How to Make Your Child a Good Hockey Player," Don't expect him or her to go pro, as very few do. Encouraging your child to get better is because it's fun to be good at what you do. It's not for trying to get your child pro.


Make sure that your kid knows that hockey isn't always going to be fun and easy. You have to be the one to make sure that when it gets hard and miserable for your child, he/ she can count on you to make it fun again.;
, The younger, the better. There's a definite pattern — the better hockey players are the ones who started earlier.Take your child to open skates, learn to play programs, and stick and pucks. Emphasize practicing stick handling.

, This will give your child a huge advantage with selection for school teams. Enroll your child in a house league.


When you enroll in a club, try to get them to join with a group of friends - this will make it much more enjoyable.

, This will raise their morale and see that you treat their participation in the sport seriously.


Make sure their kit is not what you want, but what they want.
Don't spend too much, as they will be needing new kit all the time. Also make sure that their kit isn't way better/ way more expensive than the other kids at their club, as it will be embarrassing for them. However, if the child becomes the best player in a school club later on, then it's okay for them to have the best kit.

, Treat these as fun occasions out for the whole family.

, Encourage your child to practice. If he or she likes to play video games or go on the computer, limit it to either an hour a day or one day a week. Get your child to practice instead.


This is roller hockey's big advantage over ice, your street is a practice place. But roller hockey is also excellent training for ice hockey, so make use of both.

, This is key to being a good team player and having the support of other team members.

, Even if your child is one of the best, always encourage him/her to pass. Why? For one, everyone will like your child as a team player more. Also, unselfish players are much more valuable to a travel team than selfish ones. Passing is one of the most important skills.


Recognizing if someone is open or not is one skill, as is making the passes hard and accurate. Passing is how hockey is played. In the NHL, you rarely see someone hold onto the puck for more than 2 seconds. Teach your child to keep his or her head up.

, This means watching their matches. Cheer, but don't get super competitive and embarrass them.

, If your child is good, it may be a good idea to put her or him in travel, when she or he qualifies for 10u (8u travel is frankly a waste of money for the travelling and tournament fees).

, As your child moves up the age groups in travel, keep encouraging him/her, but don't put too much pressure on your child.

If you will be playing in skates or rollerblades, make sure to wear them or add inch or two to the length of your your hockey stick., Place the shaft of your stick parallel to your body and let the toe of blade touch the ground. The stick should be between your chin and nose. A long stick is anything above the nose and anything below the chin is short., The length of your hockey stick is a personal preference and your style of play may determine what length you need.


The dangler is a short hockey stick meant for skilled stick handlers. A short stick is easier to move around as it is lighter and easier to keep closer to the body. It also helps when pulling a deke.The grinder is an average hockey stick used by players who get into the corners, dig at pucks, and station themselves around the net. With an average length you may be able to poke check easier, intercept passes, or hammer a slapshot.The defensemen is a long hockey stick that allows you to reach and poke the puck away from attackers, intercept passes, or stop the puck before it leaves the offensive end. It will also provide more power to your slapshot.Stick length is completely a personal preference and there is no absolute rule in choosing. Don’t be afraid to experiment with what suits your game.

, It may be difficult to find the perfect length that's right for you so cut down your hockey stick to your preference. You may also add a wooden plug to the butt end of your stick to lengthen it. This is common amongst younger players who experience a growth spurt and need to lengthen their stick to match their height.Cutting your stick will affect the flex of your stick.

, If you are skating on ice or moving with the stick handle jutting out behind the top of your hand two to five inches then your stick is too long. The stick should be flat on the ice with both your hands free to pass, your body upright, and eyes looking ahead.If you find your back hurting it may be because your stick length is causing you to move in an unnatural manner to compensate.

, A stick that is too small or is not stiff enough may easily break. If a stick is too long or too stiff it may be difficult to handle the puck, pass, or shoot. Determine which stick fits your height and length., Sticks usually come in four sizes: youth, junior, intermediate, and senior. Each size has a larger flex and larger shaft circumference. Easily determine stick length by standing without your skates and placing the toe of the stick between your feet. Make sure it touches the ground and is vertical against your body so that it reaches your nose.If the stick is too long, mark where your nose in and cut the stick to length. The stick should come to your chin if you’re wearing skates. You may also insert an end plug if you cut the stick too short or if you experience a growth spurt. Stick length is a personal preference.Women use flexible senior sticks or whichever stick is most comfortable. Players 4 - 8 years old use youth sticks; ages 7 - 8 use junior; ages 10 - 15 use intermediate; and players aged 14 and older use senior sticks., Sticks can be composed of a variety of materials including: kevlar and graphite, fiberglass and carbon, fiberglass and wood, and wood. Before purchasing a stick ask:


Are you using the stick for street hockey or ice?
Is this stick right for your skill level?
Is this my first stick?
Has it been a long time since the last stick?
A heavier stick gives you a better feel for the puck. It will improve your shot as you practice and help with your stick handling, passing, and shooting on ice. Wood sticks are prefered for beginners or casual street hockey enthusiasts.
Sticks made out of a combination of carbon-fiber, graphite, kevlar, resin, fiberglass, or other high quality materials are meant to improve your performance. They will be more durable, lighter, and provide greater torque. The price will reflect the quality of your stick.
The lighter your stick the faster the energy transfer to your shots and passes. Manufacturers may also include technology in the blade for better feel.

, A one piece stick has the blade fused to the shaft. This is the most common stick as it guarantees the manufacturer's specifications. A two-piece stick means that the blade and shaft are separate units. You are able to mix and match to your personal preference and you are able to salvage one part if the other breaks., You want the shaft of your stick to bend a little to help with accuracy and puck speed. Manufacturers will offer a variety of flexibility in the form of different rating systems. The flex can be broken down into senior, intermediate, junior, or youth.Youth (Approximately 30 flex) 0-60lbs
Junior (Approximately 50 Flex) 60-100lbs
Intermediate (60-70 flex) 100-150lbs
Senior Mid (Approximately 75 flex) 150-170lbs
Senior Regular (Approximately 85 flex) 170-200lbs
Senior Stiff (Approximately 100 flex) 200+ lbsGenerally the higher the flex number, the stiffer your stick will be. Correct flex allows the player to bend the shaft during a wrist or slap shot. It is a measure of the weight required to create a 4 inch bend on the stick when it is supported by two points 48 inches apart.
The flex will change if you cut the size of the stick. Each inch that is cut may increase the stiffness of your stick by 10%.
Generally, the taller and heavier the player is, the greater the flex is needed for the stick.

, A stick with a smooth surface is known as a non-grip whereas a sticky textured surface is a grip. A non-grip may aid in passing, handling, and shooting because your hand can easily move up and down the shaft. However, if you find that moisture on your gloves or from the ice makes it difficult to handle your stick, you may need to choose a grip.Some sticks have a grip on the entirety of the stick while others have a grip strategically placed. You may also use a coating as your grip or choose a stick where the grip is incorporated into the texture. You want maximum control during your playing conditions so choose your preference accordingly.

, The kick point is where your stick will flex as you shoot or pass. Defenseman with a powerful slap shot and forwards who like to take one-timers should opt for a mid to low kick point. Players who are more agile and skilled in stickhandling that prefer wrist shots should opt for a lower kick point.Mid kick: this is the traditional flex profile that gives you the feel for the wood and composite.
Low kick: this is a flex point at the taper and towards the blade. It creates a quicker release.
Constant flex: this is designed to react to your bottom hand. The flex begins from the bottom hand and works down the rest of the shaft.
Dua-kick: this flexes in two points. If your bottom hand is lower down the shaft the stick will load more power higher in the shaft. If your bottom hand is higher up, the flex creates a more accurate and accurate.
High kick - this uses the entire stick to load energy. The flex is at the top of the shaft.

, If your hold the top of your stick with your right hand and use your left hand at the bottom of the shaft, you are a left handed player and need a left handed stick. The same applies to a right handed player but in reverse., Different manufacturers have different specs and pattern names for different curves. The pattern of your blade is completely up to your preference. You may have to try several before you find what’s best for you., The lie of a stick is the angle that the shaft takes when the bottom of the blade is sitting flat. The lie is part of the pattern and is up to your personal preference. The more vertical and upright your stick, the greater the lie. A stick normally has a range between 4.0 to 6.0 going up in half increments.The blade pattern can determine the curve type, curve depth, blade toe, face angle, blade length, and blade lie of your stick., You should note the weight, flex, and performance of your stick. This is all personal preference and will take time to understand the right combination for you. Don’t invest in a stick that’s beyond your skill level. Also factor in the amount of usage you plan to get."

Separate participants into passers and outlets.,
Position passers and outlets.,
Have passers secure the ball.,
Direct passes to land and pivot to the outside.,
Complete the pass and rotate through players.",How to Outlet Pass2," The number of passers and outlets does not have to be even. Players more likely to outlet should mostly outlet, and the same goes for the passers. However, all players should try both positions at least a few times.Players that have experience both as a passer and outlet will have a better understanding of the difficulties facing teammates in these positions, which can improve team cohesion.

, Passers should arrange themselves in a single line starting behind the free throw line. A single outlet should stand one or two steps from the sideline on both sides of the net. Extra outlets can wait at center court.

As players execute/receive outlet passes, they should rotate turns performing the exercise. After performing, players should not do it again until everyone else has a turn.

, To set themselves up, passers should bounce a ball off the backboard. Passers should then attack the ball, jumping to retrieve it at the highest point possible. When the ball is secured, passers should look down court for an outlet while drawing the ball beneath their chin.If there is a coach or a teammate directing this drill, have this person set up passers by bouncing the ball off the backboard for the passers.
As the ball is secured, coaches and teammates should pay attention to the passer’s form and execution. Help your teammates improve with pointers and suggestions., Passers should flex their knees a little bit when they land. Their elbows should be pointed off to each side and the ball should remain under their chin. A wide stance will provide the best stability. Passers should pivot away from the basket towards the direction of the outlet., After the pivot, the passer will pass the ball to the outlet.Players should rejoin fellow passers and outlets and repeat the drill after everyone else has practiced it. Continue in this fashion to drill outlet passing.

It may speed things up if there are two or three active balls. This way, while a ball is being passed, other players can be getting ready with spare balls to quickly execute their part in the drill."

Skate a few strides forward.,
Practice pushing from side to side and stopping.,
Rotate your hips in the direction you want to turn.,
Bend your knees deeply.,
Drag your skates across the ice to stop.,
Practice to build speed and finesse.",How to Hockey Stop1," Begin along the boards, holding the boards with your hands. Take it slow, at first. You don't want to pick up too much speed until you have gotten a feel for how to hockey stop. You should be looking forward, not down at your feet.;
, Spread your feet slightly apart, and keep your skates running parallel in the direction you're headed. You may find that you are able to stop your side-to-side motion with just your inside foot., Rotate your left hip to turn the left skate, and rotate your right hip to turn the right skate. At the same time, try to angle the skate blades slightly back to shave the ice. Be careful! If you dig in too much, you will ""catch an edge"" and fall forward.

, As you rotate your hips, be sure to bend your knees. Keep your weight low, and work on balance. Staying low will help you stop with less effort. It might also make the falls more bearable.The deeper the bend, the quicker the stop. If your knees aren't bent, you will almost always fall!

, First, identify the ""hollow"" or ""flat edge"" on each of your skates. All skates have an inside edge, an outside edge, and a ""flat edge,"" which is really the concave space between the two. The ""flat edge"" allows the skate to slide sideways across the ice without digging in. As you enter the stop, rotate your hips, bend your knees, and turn your skates to allow them to slide on their ""flat edges."" Hold this position until you stop.To clarify: reduce your weight off the outside skate, and turn both skates parallel to the direction you are travelling. Apply pressure to the inside edge of the outside skate and simultaneously to the outside edge of the inside skate.

, Keep working on your hockey stop. Gradually work up to skating faster and faster, and to stopping at high speeds. If you're playing competitive hockey, you'll often need to stop on a dime to change directions or avoid colliding with something.


Once you feel comfortable turning one direction to stop: practice turning the opposite direction, using the same technique.

"
"
Pick a direction to turn, and perfect it before trying the other direction.,
Find someone to hold one end of a hockey stick while you hold the other.,
Work up to a quick transition.,
Be persistent.",How to Hockey Stop2," Most skaters find it easier to turn in one direction. If turning right, your left skate should be on the outside. If turning left, your right skate should be on the outside.

, Have them pull to your side as you try to resist their motion. When done correctly, they will be able to slowly pull you to your side as you form small amounts of snow at your blades. This will help you become more familiar with proper body angle relative to the ground as well as general balance.

, One of the keys to stopping at speed is being able to quickly switch from a skating position to having both feet perpendicular to your line of travel. Start by having someone pull you. Then, practice transitioning from a ""gliding"" position to a ""stopping"" position. Once you are comfortable with this transition, work on skating and stopping: from low speeds to higher speeds.

, It takes time to train your knees, your hips, and your feet to work in sync – and that means a lot of time down on the ice. Chances are that you will fall a few times until you can get your balance right. Just keep trying and getting back up. With a bit of determination, you should be hockey stopping in no time!

Turn your body until the sliding foot is in front of you.",How to Hockey Stop3," Knees should be bent. Start slowly, at first, for safety.

, If you want to turn clockwise, you will be sliding on your left foot. If you want to turn counterclockwise, you will be sliding on your right foot.

, Your foot should be perpendicular to the direction you are traveling. This will create friction against the floor. Hold this position until you come to a stop.


Straighten the leg and angle the wheels so they slide on the floor. This friction is what will cause you to stop.
Keep the other leg bent at the knees as the skate rotates approximately 180 degrees. All your weight should be on this leg.

Get into hockey posture.,
Hold your stick correctly.,
Keep your eyes forward, looking peripherally at the puck.,
Master the stride.,
Keep your leg at an angle of at least 90 degrees or slightly lower (at top speed).,
Return skates across your center of gravity after fully extending stride.,
Retract your leg to cross this imaginary line after you fully extend.

,
Bring the retracting leg back in underneath and across the center of gravity.,
Complete a full extension of the stride.,Keep heels as close to the ice as possible while skating for maximum efficiency!",How to Hockey Powerskate," Bend knees to a position where the lower part of the upper leg is perpendicular to the ice (90 degrees). Skates are shoulder width apart. The back is straight, and the chest upright. Bend at the hips, shoulders back, the upper body leaning forward (50 degrees), and hold your stick with two hands.;
, If you are right-handed, place your left hand at the top of your stick (the butt end) and place your right elbow to your left hand. That is the standard distance your hands should be apart while stick handling and shooting wrist shots. Hold the stick slightly forward.

, If you lose sight of the puck, your head and neck might be too far back and your eyes up too high..

, From a moving position, keep a low knee bend and keep your feet moving. Acceleration becomes explosive because you are already in a stellar position where your knee bend is low and now you just have to move your feet faster. This allows for instant acceleration from gliding speed to top speed.

, The upper leg angle from which you can get the most powerful push is not 90 but around 120 degrees. Solid skaters should be in a position to push hardest at approximately 120 degrees (your butt should be really low). So if you retract your leg to an angle of 120 degrees to start from, and open up your knee bend to drive your leg hard, you would be past the knee angle (120 degrees) which will provide you with the most powerful leg drive.

, Grab your stick, blade side up, with your right hand, and place it between your chest pads. There you will see your center of gravity: the line from your naval to the floor/ice.

,, When a player retracts his leg across the center of gravity, all the energy he uses to pull that leg back in is used to help drive the other leg out when the retracting leg comes across the center of gravity, almost touching the heel of the other skate. During a sprint for the puck, then the legs should be retracted across the center of gravity.

, Fully retract your legs.

Instruct them on how to pass the puck.,
Talk to them about safety.",How to Introduce Kids to Ice Hockey," By watching a game, they’ll have the first-hand experience of watching professionals play. This will not only be instructional, but it may make the game seem exciting.


Take your kids to a live professional or semi-professional hockey game. For example, if you live in the Atlanta metropolitan area, you can take your kids to an Atlanta Gladiators game – a minor league ice hockey team.
Watch a professional hockey game on television. In North America, the National Hockey League’s regular season runs from October to April.
Attend a children’s hockey game. This way, your kids will be able to see people their own age playing and having fun.;
, By taking enough time to explain the rules before, after, or during a game, you’ll help kids learn the basics so they understand what they’re seeing and how to play in the future. Tell them that:


The rink is split up into three zones: the defending zone for each team and a middle or “neutral” zone.
Each team is only allowed to have five skaters and one goalie on the ice.
Two skaters play defense while three are offensive players.
The goalie is not allowed to allowed to cross the center line of the rink.
Pee Wee hockey players (below age 11) are not allowed to body check – which means using their body to stop an opponent from moving. In addition, no one is ever allowed to do a body check that meets another person’s head.
Major infractions or penalties include tripping, holding, using a stick to stop a player from moving, using a stick to hit someone in the head or face, elbowing, kneeing, or generally being rough., The single best way to introduce kids to ice hockey is to sign them up with a team or league. After they join a league, they’ll have others to play with, a coach to teach them, and the ability to participate in organized competitions.


Look for a local or regional league for them to play in.
Depending on your region, your public school system might have an ice hockey team.
Leagues and teams will depend on age. For instance, Pee Wee hockey is typically 12 years and younger., Knowing how to fall down is a necessity when playing ice hockey. Without knowing how to fall, a child could seriously hurt themselves. As a result, instruct your kid about how to fall. When falling, a child should:


Bend their knees.
Lean to the side.
Fall slowly when they are ready., After falling, a child will need to get back up to continue playing. This, though, could be just as difficult and dangerous as falling down. As a result, instruct your child about how to get back up. When they are ready they should:


Kneel on both knees.
Keep their back straight.
Put one skate on the ice
Push down with the same knee.
Push up and put the other skate on the ice., Once a child has learned how to fall and get back up, they need to master moving around the ice. It is important that they start small and start slow, so they don’t get hurt or discouraged. Tell your child to:


Stand steady and have them put their hands out in front and pointed down – to help with balance. This might look as if the child is pushing downward toward the floor.
Lift a single foot and put it down slightly in front of the other.
Lift the other foot and place it down in front of where it was.
Repeat and slowly increase the speed of their movements., As your child learns how to skate faster, it’ll be increasingly important that they can slow down and come to a stop. Thus, you need to make sure they can come to a stop without hurting themselves.


Instruct them how to shave ice, by standing steady and pushing their blades outward.
Tell them to advance to a medium speed and prepare to stop.
Have them bend their knees and move their hands downward in front of them as they prepare to slow.
To stop, tell them to bring their toes together and plow the ice.
Tell them to apply their weight to one leg and have the other leg push the skate outward to shave the ice., Holding a stick properly is one of the most important elements of playing ice hockey. If a child does not hold the stick properly, they won’t be able to take successful shots, may sustain injuries to themselves, or hurt others. Tell your child to:


Place the dominant hand on the top grip of the stick.
Put the other hand about an elbows-distance from the top hand, lower on the stick.
Always hold the stick low to the ground., Once a child has mastered holding a stick and skating, they should practice passing and shooting pucks. Ultimately, a child will need to follow a couple fundamental rules when shooting. Tell them to:


Skate toward the puck with their top hand facing out from their body.
Roll their wrist when they hit the puck.
Put power into the shot.
Make sure the blade stays low over the ice when taking a shot and afterward., As a very physical sport where contact between children and the ice may occur often, children should take ice hockey safety very seriously. Without following basic safety protocols, a child or someone else could be hurt. Children should:


Use a proper helmet. Helmets should be foam-lined and should fit properly.
Wear a face mask.
Use padding, like shoulder, chest, elbow, leg, knee, and shin pads.
Remember, “Heads up, Don’t Duck!” Hockey players should not duck their heads when they anticipate a collision. This could cause spinal cord injuries."
"
Have the right equipment.,
Skate (not too fast).,Extend your stick with the puck towards the defender, as if you are giving up.,
Quickly draw the puck back while skating toward the defender.",How to Deke in Hockey1," Since if you're playing on tar or ice, falling down without equipment will hurt. Make sure you have the equipment on when trying the deke.
, It is recommended to skate alongside the boards first.,, This makes him go for where the puck was, while you skate past him!

The deke is a great move, but it can be changed to anybody's style and pace, so you can add fancy tricks, fakes, whatever you want; as long as you can keep up, it's fine!

"
"
Identify whether a foot or the feet have the problem.,
Try loosening the top portion of the skate but not to the point where your foot can move around inside.,
Make a trip to your local skate shop: somewhere that sells only skates/hockey/figure skating equipment, they will be able to alter your boot correctly either by softening up some of the boot or by adding material such as a properly installed insole or padding.",How to Fix Lace Bite With Hockey Skates," One foot having the problem may indicate an injury or a differing fit from foot to foot that may be corrected. A refit may be done properly using specialty products and methods that are available and facilitated by carefully re mediating the fit of each shoe at the qualified skate shops.;
, Use this trying-on technique for a few pairs of skates. Try lacing up the boots tightly for the first 3 eyelets, snug but not really tight for the next 3, and as you move to the turn up the ankle lace it up tight to lock in your heel. The idea is to take pressure off the middle area of the foot while locking your heel in position.

,


If the store who sold you your skates does not have a specialty in skates but also sells tents, pajamas and tires -- chances are the person who sold you your skates didn't know exactly what they were doing. This could result in an improper fit and be the reason your feet hurt. Most hockey shops and dedicated skate shops have a machine that can heat up the skates and make the padding pliable and soft. You then lace the skate up tightly and sit down with the runners (blade) flat on the floor for 15 minutes. You should avoid walking or flexing the boot when you do this process. The boot will mold to your foot shape and retain a memory. This process is called Baking and greatly reduces break in time.

"
"
Practice stick handling.,
Move the puck back and forth.,
Try weaving the puck in different directions, so back, forth, right, left, etc.,
Make sure your feet can move quickly.,
You can stick handle!",How to Deke in Hockey2," The more practice you get, the better control you have. If you pretty much mastered stick handling or you're decent, adding the deke along with stick handling can help you in sticky situations., Try to keep the puck at a speed you can keep up with., Make sure you're stick handling works on a defender. Remember: you are there to try to score for your team, not to put on a fancy show!, If you can master all types of speeds, fast and slow, you will be very dangerous!, Remember to have fun while you play!"

Skate Hard.",How to Hockey Skate," Hockey skates are made to be tough and form to your foot and ankle and to add support to your skating. Remember that hockey skates should fit tightly to reduce movement while you are on the ice. A general rule to consider when buying a new pair of skates, is to wear the socks that you will wear while on the ice. Hockey skates generally run a size to a size and a half smaller than your shoe size.;
, Make sure that they fit well and don't wobble or buckle when you skate.

, Do not keep your blades straight when you push. Try turning them to the side so you have more surface area pushing you ahead.

, Squat as you skate, bending your knees as though sitting in a chair—this will cause your legs to get more of a stride helping you go faster. Also, you will survive a check better.

, Think about the positioning of your feet. Try to keep them shoulder length apart.

, Leaning back will cause you to place your weight towards the back of you, causing you to fall.

, Your body tends to go where your eyes go, so keep your eyes pointing in the direction you want to go.

, This will help you a lot, especially if you play defense. If you don't know how, start by pushing off the boards backwards. Once you get the feel try skating backwards, making an ""S"" motion with your skates.

, Hockey is about 85 percent skating. Skate hard and stop hard.

, Park close to the arena or near a landmark for easy access. Don't park to close to anyone else, the rush after the game could easily block you in the rink.

, At most hockey games, there is a counter that says reserved or reserved tickets. Go to the teller and say your first and last name, and ID.

, Most tickets have the row in numbers and the seat in letters, or vice versa. Find your section, row, and seat. Be sure to mind your manners when walking over people.

Match your backward speed to that of the attackers' forward speed.,Slowly move towards puck carrier but stay close to the middle of the two attackers

,
Allow them to come to you, but it is imperative not to get too close to your goalie.

Mix long, distance runs with interval workouts to strengthen your endurance. Run hills to strengthen legs. Do sprints to build quickness. Running will make those long shifts hurt a little less.;
, These will help with hitting and shooting. Do body weight exercises such as push ups, sit ups, planks, pull ups, or any other body weight strength exercises.

, Lifting weights is a wonderful way to build strength and size. Do bench presses, squats, deadlifts, curls, shoulder presses, and lunges. Make sure you are doing a reasonable amount of reps and a safe amount of weight. If you are younger, make sure you have and adult watching you to make sure you are doing it correctly. Lifting weights can be extremely beneficial to hockey. However, it can be detrimental if done incorrectly.

, Many hockey players don't incorporate flexibility training into their routines. Stretch before bed, do yoga, whatever it is, stretching is good for you regardless of where it comes from. Flexibility aids in skating and helps goalies in almost every way possible.

Serve a ball with no spin.,
Try putting spin on the ball.,
Learn the different types of spins.,
Learn the effects of putting spin on the ball.",How to Serve a Ping Pong Ball With a Topspin1," This ball will not travel as fast, but if you are just learning how to play ping pong, it is important you can do this first. Hit the ball near its equator, which is the line just through the exact center of the ball.
Make sure you hit it with your racket at a 90 degree angle to the ball.
The ball will travel forwards and have little to no spin.;
, You can do this after you have mastered a serve with out a spin. Brush your racket on the ball as you serve. This is rubbing the ball slightly as you hit it. The direction of your brush will put a different spin on the ball.
Spin is imparted onto a ball by using a tangential brushing action with your racket.
Do this with your racket at less than a 90 degree angle.
Use an upwards, downwards, or sideways movement.
The faster a racket brushes a ping pong ball, the faster it will spin.
The ball will spin faster and travel less distance with a good brush.
Using paddles or rackets with reverse rubbers can help you impart more spin on the ball, instead of using pimpled or anti-spin rubbers.

, There are three main types of spins in ping pong and each has their own technique during a serve. Topspin is produced by starting your stroke below the ball and brushing the racket on the ball in an upwards and forwards motion.
Backspin is made by starting your stroke above the ball and brushing the racket against the ball in a downwards and forwards motion.
Sidespin is produced by brushing your racket in a sideways motion as you hit the ball.

, Using different types of spin have different effects during a pin pong game. When you put topspin on a ball it increases the downwards pressure on the ball, so it will stay low after it hits the table. When this hits the opponents racket, the ball will rebound in an upward direction.
When you impart backspin onto a ball, it will bounce up more after it hits the table and not go as far forwards.
When a ball from backspin stroke makes contact with the other player’s racket, the ball rebounds in a downwards direction.
When you put side spin on a ball, it will bounce off your opponents racket in the same direction your racket was travelling when you hit the ball. For example, if you brushed left, the ball will rebound to the left.

"
"
Get into position for a serve.,
Throw the ball in to the air from an open palm.,
Hit the ball for your serve when it comes back down.,
Strike the top part of the ball, above the ball's equator.,
Brush the ball in an upward and forward motion as you strike, aiming to hit your side of the table as far from the net as possible.",How to Serve a Ping Pong Ball With a Topspin2," Where you stand will depend on which hand is your dominant hand. If you are right handed, you will stand at the backhand corner of the ping pong table. Put your right foot forward and bend your knees slightly. This is ready position for a serve.
You will have your racket in your right hand and will have the ball in your left hand, if you are right handed.
If you are left handed, you will stand at the front corner of the ping pong table. Put your left foot forwards and bend your knees slightly. You are now in ready position for a serve.
If you are left handed, you should serve with your racket in your left hand and the ball in your fight hand.

, International ping pong rules state that a ball must be thrown straight up into the air when it is served. You may not serve the ball directly from your hand. When you do this your hand should roughly be at chest level.
You must throw the ball into the air at least six inches, or about the height of the net.
You should not toss the ball up and forwards or up and backwards towards you. Aim to toss it straight up into the air.

, You should serve when it gets to about chest or belly level.


If you serve the ball too low, it won’t have enough height on the serve to go over the net.
If you serve the ball too high, it might bounce too high or too fast after your serve.
Hitting it about chest level or just below will allow the ball to accelerate forward and bounce off of the table and over the net.

, If you strike the ball in the wrong spot, it won’t spin or it won’t have the right type of spin. Keep your paddle at a less than 90 degree angle. Angle the paddle towards the net for a top spin.
Remember, hitting the the top part of the ball is the first part of putting topspin on a ping pong ball.
If you hit the ball at the equator, (right around the middle of the ball) it won’t have any spin, and might travel too far forward before hitting the table.
If you strike the ball from below you might put a backspin on it, but the goal here is to get a topspin.
A top spin will allow a ball to bounce on the table close to the server, away from the net.

, This will propel the ball forward quickly. Brushing is how you rub your paddle against the ball quickly as you serve or return. Brushing in different directions will cause different kinds of spin.
Remember, brushing your ball upwards and forwards will result in a topspin.
If you put a topspin on a ball during a ping pong game, it will stay low after it bounces on the table.
This will make the ball harder to hit for your opponent.
When your opponent hits a ball with a topspin, it will rebound in an upwards direction.

Remove when finished and clean.",How to Choose and Wear a Protective Cup for Sports," The jockstrap, brief or sliding-short will have a pouch to house the cup. There will be elastic, metal snaps or a Velcro closure to keep the cup in place in the pouch.

, This maximizes their protectiveness by completely encasing the male genitals and allowing the genitals to be held tightly against the body. However, if you want to wear something underneath, only a thin pair of nylon/spandex briefs should be worn. EXAMPLE: Under Armor Compression Shorts.

, A loose fitting cup will allow the impact of a blow or hit to slam the cup into the testicles, causing pain and possible injury. If your cup-jockstrap or cup-brief does not hold your cup firmly and tightly against your body you can wear a pair of tight fitting nylon/spandex athletic briefs over them.

Bounce the ball on your side before it goes over the net.,
Hit anywhere on the table if you’re playing singles.,
Hit the opposite diagonal if you’re playing doubles.,
Move your free arm away from the ball once you’ve served.",How to Serve in Table Tennis1," To start a legal serve, keep your hand completely open and flat after you pick up the ball. Let the ball sit there for a second or two, as your hand needs to be stationary, or still, before you throw it up into the air.Any illegal serve can result in the official calling it “incorrect.” While you may be warned one time during a match or if the official is unsure if the serve is legal, any clearly incorrect serves will lead your opponent to get your points!;
, The hand holding the ball (which will become your “free hand”) has to be above the table as you get ready to serve. The ball itself should remain behind the end of the table (your serve line).Your thumb can cross the serve line as long as the ball itself doesn’t.

, Unlike the ball, your racket can be hidden under the table. Doing this may help you hide the kind of serve you’re going to make. You’ll need to quickly bring your racket up once you throw the ball into the air to get ready to serve.Until you’ve practiced serving, leave your racket hand above the table. This tricky technique is legal, but it’s best reserved for more advanced players.

, This is the minimum height required by the officials. Any lower and it won’t be counted as a legal serve. The ball needs to be thrown up vertically rather than sideways or diagonally. Make sure that your throw makes the ball go almost straight up into the air. You can’t, for example, just drop the ball from a height of 6.3 inches (16 cm). This won’t be considered a vertical toss.

, Don’t hit the ball when it’s still going up in the air or when it’s at the top of your throw. Wait until it’s coming back down toward the table to avoid getting called out by the official., Hit the ball so that it lands on your side first. If it just sails over the net without bouncing, it’s an illegal serve.Practice until you get the proper amount of force needed to follow this rule. You want a serve that’s fast enough to trick your opponent, but not so strong that it misses your side of the table.
The ball can also go around the net so long as you can curve it enough to get it back onto your opponent’s side of the table. This is a pretty difficult skill, so aim straight over the net until you’re sure you can make a curving serve., Your opponent’s whole side is fair game if it’s just the two of you. This lets you really use the table. You can do short and long serves to make the match more difficult for your opponent., You’re restricted to the square that’s diagonal from you if you’re playing with partners. Anything that hits outside this square is illegal., It’s illegal to “hide” the the ball from the official or your opponent with your hand once you’ve served. Pull your free hand all the way back so you don’t get accused of doing this."

Use a closed racket for topsin.,
Graze the ball from the top for topspin.,
Use an open racket for backspin.,
Graze the ball from the bottom for backspin.,
Graze the ball on the sides to get sidespin.,
Use fast wrist actions to improve your spins.",How to Serve in Table Tennis2," Topspin is created by striking the ball with what’s called a “closed racket,” which means you hold the racket facing low toward the ground.These serves work best when they’re fast and hit the back of your opponent’s side of the table., Using a closed racket, brush the top of the ball in a quick forward motion with your racket. The ball will rise as it moves away from you and then curve downward., Backspin uses an “open racket,” which means you hold the racket facing up toward the ceiling.Backspin serves are also known as “under-spin” serves. These low, short serves can be super useful against players who like to attack the ball during the return., Using an open racket, brush the bottom of the ball in a quick forward motion with your racket. Keep the ball low and straight as it travels over the net., Hit the ball on the left to get it to rotate right, and on the right to get it to rotate left. This will cause the ball to bounce in those directions. These tricky serves can be very difficult to return, as your opponent won’t know which direction they need to run in to get the ball., Snapping your wrist gives you really quick contact with the ball, adding speed. This speed will add more spin to your serves, making your serves much more difficult to return. Practice developing this snap every time you serve."

Turn your arm across your body for backhand serves.",How to Serve in Table Tennis3," Your leading foot (right if you’re right-handed) should be slightly farther away from the table than your other foot. This will allow you to angle your body away from the table. You’ll use this position to get more power when you turn your body into the serve., Your stance should be strong and steady. Not only will this keep you balanced as you get ready to serve, it’ll also let you move quickly when you need to return the ball., Lean over from your waist, rather than your chest. Keep your shoulders back and open. Check your balance to make sure your lean makes you feel steadier., This position is perfect for getting your arm in position to use your wrist and forearm when you serve. Keep your arm loose and don’t lock your elbow., Move your racket back and slightly up after you throw the ball. Then bring your arm forward, turning your body and shoulder as you do so. This is a backspin serve, so hit the ball from the bottom with an open racket.Stay focused on the ball throughout the throw and serve.

, Move your racket back and slightly up after you throw the ball. Bring your arm forward by turning your body and shoulder. Right before you make contact with the ball, put your racket into a closed position and strike the top of the ball.Stay focused on the ball throughout the throw and serve.

, Backhand serves involve a different arm position. Position the racket in front of your body by turning your arm across your torso. These serves can also involve different kinds of spin.Serves with sidespin are usually delivered from the backhand position.Stay focused on the ball throughout the throw and serve.

They can add variety to a match that has contained lots of long, topspin serves., If your opponent doesn’t know which way you’re going to spin the ball, they’ll need to stand in the middle of their side. This will make it tough for them to return any sidespin serves., The longer the ball is in the air, the faster it’ll be coming down. This fast speed will allow you to put more spin onto the ball after you strike it. If you have more spin, your opponent may have a tougher time returning the ball., This serve puts a little sidespin on the ball. This will make the ball difficult to return with a backhand, as it’ll break away from your opponent and may not make it back over the net. Your racket should be in the closed position for this serve., This serve also puts sidespin onto the ball, this time from the opposite direction. Most players are more used to the standard forehand pendulum, so this serve may catch them off guard., Using an open racket, hit the ball from right to left. This serve will also add sidespin and make it difficult for your opponent to control their return., The best way to have a great serve game is to be prepared with lots of options. You’ll probably develop a specialty that becomes your favorite go-to serve. Be sure you also practice long and short serves, all the different spins, and different table placements. Run drills with a partner to get the feel for serving as you would in a match. You can use each other to practice all the different racket positions, striking motions, and spins.
You can also practice serving against the wall if you’re alone.

Interview team members.,
Choose members who have chemistry.,
Choose a diverse team.,
Choose team members who can get the job done.,
Establish cohesive goals and values.,
Designate roles and expectations.",How to Build a Successful Team1," Get to know each person and their background, experience, and abilities. Try to evaluate their temperament so that you have a full picture of who they are. Many times, people's skills are different than what's on paper, so doing a trial run with them may be effective. To do this, have a prospective team member work on a project or do a routine that's closely related to what they would be doing if they joined the team.


You should be able to see their abilities and get a good sense of their experience without referring to their references.
To learn more about interviewing skills, go to Interview Someone.;
, Team members should be able to get along and build bonds. Selecting a team with chemistry involves choosing people that can compliment each other. Don't pick team members who have the same strengths and weaknesses. Before selecting anyone, think of how you're going to use your team member's talents to achieve your end goal. To make sure that people get along, select people who have similar values and goals. For example, if you are developing an app, your team needs to work in cohesion to reach a desirable end result. Programmers will need to work with designers so that the app's design can also serve functional purposes.
A toxic personality can halt progress for the rest of the team and impede progress.
Team members should encourage each other to be successful and build on one another's successes.

, Building a diverse team allows more perspectives and introduces new and unique ideas. Make sure that you choose people from varying backgrounds, ethnicities, and perspectives. This will help your team approach problems from different viewpoints and can contribute to driving success and innovation on your team.Having a diverse team enhances creativity and group problem solving.Your team may also be able to achieve better unity through conflict. Conflict can make team members challenge one another which gives more perspectives on possible resolutions, removes feelings of apathy and gets people invested, and leads to making better decisions., When building a team, you must ensure that your members have the right skills and experience to be successful and complete the end goal. This means selecting team members who can fulfill their responsibilities. Require team members to get references and talk to past coaches or supervisors. Get a full evaluation of a person's ability before making them a part of your team.


If key team members don't have the appropriate skills or experience, it could hinder a portion of your project, thus delaying progress.

, While having a diverse team with different perspectives can drive success, it's important that all your team members can agree on your team's goals and values. When team members join, make it a point to establish the goals and values. Let team members know what their work is going towards, what the results should be, and how the team should work to achieve those goals.A team without an identifiable goal can work against each other and delay progress.
Examples of team goals can include being more productive this quarter than the last quarter, winning a championship, or being victorious in an important match.
Some examples of good team values include reliability, positivity, transparency, collaboration, and tolerance., Each member should continually strive to accomplish the team's overall goal, but should also be concentrated on a specific part of the project. While designated positions should be specific, it's also important to allow members to grow within their respective roles. Sometimes duties and responsibilities can be merged or transferred to another person more capable on the team.This requires close attention to the development and growth of individual team member skills.


On a sports team, this could mean designating who is on offense or defense and which role each member has on the team.
You may need to change roles or help support one role on the team.
When transferring someone out of their current role and into another process, you can say something like, ""You're doing a good job, but I think you'd be better at coding than design. I'm moving you over to Eric's team because I think you'd be better suited there. What do you think?""

Determine your strengths and weaknesses.,
Build respect and trust on the team.,
Improve your communication.,
Motivate your team.,
Set clear expectations.",How to Build a Successful Team2," Being an effective leader means realizing where you excel and where you could use improvement. For instance, you could be excellent at pushing deadlines and motivating employees, but poor at strategic planning. Make a concerted effort each day to work on the things that you are weak on.


Talk to the main members of your team or team managers to get an honest evaluation of your leadership. They may see problems in your leadership style that are not apparent to you. This is known as participative feedback.For instance, if your weakness is organizing, take at least an hour each day to organize your space.
If you are poor at communicating and motivating, search for local workshops that can help you or talk to other managers and team leaders that you know for strategies.
If your project is falling behind or your team is failing, you must take a step back, and self-assesses if you're a good leader.

, Being the leader does not mean that all the members will immediately like or respect you. Many times you must gain their trust and admiration with your knowledge, experience, and ability to settle conflict within the team.Get respect from your team members by showing your value and expertise. Resolve issues quickly and be knowledgeable in all aspects of what the team is doing.


A good leader will help fill in the gaps when the team is running behind.
Be sure to set the example on the team. If you have bad habits, chances are your team will replicate your behavior.

, As the leader of the team, you'll need to communicate to each member efficiently and clearly. Encourage transparency so that your team members tell the truth, then partake in active listening. Stop and actually listen to what team members have to say. They could be pointing out something that you've missed or they could shed light on things from their perspective.


Using silence as a communication tool will often have team members revealing much more than they originally intended about their feelings. Instead of talking, be silent and see what they have to say.
Internalize what your team members are telling you and think of solutions to their concerns or comments.
Talk to people in your team and keep regular communication with them.
Get to know members' habits and tendencies so that you can use it to the team's advantage.
Knowing your members will also help you guide their development., Drive your team towards success by giving them the encouragement that they need to do well. Motivation can come in the form of being inspired by your abilities, or by being rewarded for good work. Lead by example and show them that you're a capable leader who cares about them. Figure out what team members value the most and use it to motivate them.


You can encourage someone by saying something like, ""You did a great job blocking that game Darius. Keep up the good work, I'm seeing some serious improvement!""
Some team members want positive reinforcement while others prefer monetary incentives., Your team must know what's expected of them to stay productive and work towards an end goal. Before you allow your team to start working or practicing, sit each team member down and tell them what you expect from them. You will also need to set the expectation for behavior and values within the team.For instance, if you are leading a sales team you can say something like, ""We all want to make sales, and it's important to meet your quotas, however, we also need to maintain integrity. Never lie or mislead customers, rather, persuade them towards making a purchase.""

Use team building exercises.,
Encourage the team to settle problems internally.,
Have weekly team meetings.,
Coach team members who are underperforming.,
Dismiss members who violate the rules or chronically underperform.",How to Build a Successful Team3," Team building exercises can help improve communication between members and help solidify relationships within the team. Employ team building exercises if you find your team in constant unproductive conflict. Make sure that your team building exercises are not competitive and unify the team. Also, make sure that you do them on a weekly or monthly basis to be the most effective.An example of a team building exercise is called back-to-back drawing. Two team members stand back to back as one describes a shape or picture and the other member draws it without seeing the original image. This forces team members to work together to solve a problem.

, When members go to a superior about a problem or conflict, it can create distrust within the team. Instead of escalating problems, encourage the team to try to communicate with one another and solve problems by themselves. If a team member comes to you with a problem, suggest that they try to talk to the team member they are having problems with. When conflict arises and it doesn't devolve into destructive behavior it's known as constructive discord and can actually help the team.You can say something like, ""Eric, I appreciate you bringing this to me, but you should talk to Sharon about it first. I'm sure there's a good explanation for her actions.""
If there is a disagreement between team members, it's good to meditate and get to the bottom of the conflict before it gets emotional or personal.

, While having too many meetings can cost unnecessary time and money, weekly meetings can help bring your team together. This is particularly the case if everyone's jobs are different and members don't interact often. To have an effective meeting, make sure you create an agenda of items that you'll talk about beforehand. Restrict the session's length to be long enough to cover the essentials, and always make them goal oriented.Don't get bogged down in minute details or unnecessary things.
If you need to speak to a member specifically about something, save it for after the meeting.

, Take your underperforming team members aside to talk to them about their performance gap. A sign of a good leader is one that's able to identify issues in someone's working habits and come up with solutions to remedy them. Instead of dismissing the person from the team, explain the areas that you think they are underperforming in and think of tactics and strategies to improve their performance. Ask the team member if they understand what you talked about and follow it up with positive reinforcement for the things that they do well.Concentrate on the areas in which the person is underperforming, not their character or personality.
You can say something like, ""Jerry, I want to talk to you about your sales numbers. You haven't been meeting the quota for two weeks, so I'm concerned that you aren't working as efficiently as you can. I've taken a look at your call sheet and notice that you're not making as many calls as you should per day, which might explain the drop in sales. Do you think that this could be your problem?""

, Serious misconduct like harassment, assault, or theft should are grounds for immediate dismissal.Those that chronically underperform should also be dismissed if their behavior is persistent and shows no sign of improvement. Having an underperforming member could hinder your team from reaching their goals and have an affect on the entire team. Sit the person down privately and talk to them about their performance.


Focus on the facts and their lackluster performance and not the individual or their personal habits.
You can say something like ""John, there have been a number of complaints from customers about your demeanor. We've talked about the issue a couple of times, but I haven't seen any improvement. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to let you go because it's starting to interfere with the rest of the staff.""Before dismissing anyone, make sure that you read up on your team's bylaws or rules so that you follow the correct procedure.
Some companies require verbal or written warnings before a dismissal can take place.If you aren't in the position to fire anyone, talk to a supervisor about the misconduct or underperformance.
Make sure that before you cut anyone from the team that you have a conversation with them and allow them to grow and improve.

Explain to children the importance of working together.,
Use a team building game that asks children to guide one another.",How to Do Team Building Exercises1," As they cooperate with teammates, they help one another to win a game or complete a task.;
, For example, working in pairs, each child can guide his/her blindfolded teammate to find objects that are scattered throughout the room.


Ask children to talk about what made the game challenging or fun. Guide them to use words that focus more on their feelings than what another child did or didn't do.

"
Define the goals of the team building activity.,
Introduce low-risk team building exercises.,
Ask teens to write down one positive attribute about everyone in the group.",How to Do Team Building Exercises2," The objective may be to improve relationships between group members by highlighting the strengths of each participant.

, Start with icebreaker activities that allow teenagers to get to know one another. For example, ask all participants to write down a personal strength on a piece of paper and toss the paper into the middle of the table. The positive qualities of each person can then be written on the board for everyone to see.

, This allows each participant to focus on the strengths of others and themselves.

"
"
Determine the objective of the team building exercise.,
Choose an exercise that addresses observed challenges.,
Divide large groups into smaller ones.,
Ask the small groups to accomplish a task together.,
Repeat team building exercises with assigned leaders.",How to Do Team Building Exercises3," The desire to feel heard and appreciated exists in all age groups. Team building exercises for adults typically focus on improved collaboration, decision making and communication.

, For example, a project team might have a hard time working together, with each person focused only on his/her own tasks. In this case, the exercise could focus on an activity that involves relying on one another.

, For example, if working with a 20-member team, break them into 4 groups of 5 people each.

, One example is to work together in a small group to build an object. Provide wood, a small saw, glue, a hammer and nails and ask the groups to construct a bridge.


Reconvene as a large group to discuss the experience. Each group can present its bridge and explain the process of creating it. Some people may have stood aside; others may have taken charge.
Ask team members to write down their reactions to the team building exercise. A common reaction in such exercises is for individual members to downplay the amount of conflict that occurred to minimize group embarrassment. Writing out the feelings and thoughts that accompanied the activity generally helps people to identify their personal challenges in a group setting.

, To encourage leadership skills throughout the team, assign the participants who ordinarily sit back to serve as leaders.

,, They go far in little time and escape the attack zone fast to get back in safety.

, Don't do anything they would expect. Jump up when they think you dive. Don't go and do the same thing over and over again. It will get you caught.

Remember that there is no one set of characteristics possessed by effective captains.,
Be mentally strong.,
Be focused.,
Be an excellent communicator.,
Be emotionally disciplined.,
Know the players.,
Be self-confident.",How to Be an Effective Team Captain for a Youth Soccer Team," In reality, very different personalities can be successful captains. However, there are key traits that any person wanting to be a good captain can learn and practice, and the following steps explain these.;
, The mental part of the job is the hardest part. All captains should be mentally strong. Inevitably, the captain will be criticized at some point, both from within and from outside the team.

, Equally, the captain needs to remain focused and aware while under intense pressure during a game, so that he or she can make the correct decisions at the right time. To cope with this requires considerable mental strength. Some captains say the mental part of being a captain is the hardest part, because there is so much more to think about, as well as playing.

, This is a skill required by all captains. The captain will need to encourage teammates. Never yell.


The captain should only speak when necessary, being able to keep his/her communication short and to the point.

, This quality is important for three main reasons:


As a role model the example set by the captain must meet every expectation he has of the players. For example, if the captain becomes angry with the referee and constantly questions his decisions, he cannot expect his players to accept refereeing decisions themselves.
If the captain loses self-control and vents his anger or frustration (whether against an opponent, team-mate or the referee), he will have lost the ability to make rational decisions. His own performance will also suffer; a loss of emotional control will affect timing, co-ordination and the ability to “read” the game as awareness becomes more narrowly focused.
A loss of emotional control will be seen as a sign of weakness by the opposition, boosting their confidence whilst undermining that of the team. This does not mean that your captain becomes an emotionless robot, without passion.

, A captain must remember that while soccer is very much a team game the role involves dealing with individuals who are all different in attitudes, tempers and experience.


The captain that also takes time to get to know his or her team-mates as people and not just players will ultimately achieve far more respect and effort from them.

, A self-confident captain inspires confidence in others. It also helps him/her maintain his or her own performance. This is easy when things are going well, it is harder, but more important, to do so when the going gets tough. The captain needs to make sure he at least gives the impression of confidence. Looking and acting confident will, sooner or later, lead to being confident (fake it till you make it).

Selecting a captain is important.,
Communicate with your players.",How to Start Your Own Sports Team," Inexpensive team sports are the best options if you are on a tight budget. Soccer, ball hockey, basketball and beach volleyball all commonly have leagues in each city.;
, Unless you are extremely experienced, join a recreational league that has multiple divisions or levels, such as beginner, intermediate, and competitive/premier, 1, 2, 3, etc.. It is very important to play at your level. Additionally, it is better to start a little lower because if you do well, you can win the title then move up divisions.

, This will be the sum of the league fees, plus equipment, uniforms, permits, etc. This will determine your team fees.

, Basing your team name around your region, habitat, culture or a professional team is common. For example, let's say you are from Cambridge and your team is participating in soccer; you can name your team the Cambridge Kickers.

, Based on your team name, have a friend who is good with graphic design make a logo for your team. You can also have your logo designed by an online company for less then $50.00 if you search around. Many logo sites have templates which don't cost much. Your logo should incorporate an image related to your sport and/or name. Make sure to add your logo to letterheads, web sites, blogs, posts and ads. When players looking for teams go through classifieds, they tend to think teams with a logo are a better fit than ones without one.

, Hold try outs. Ask everyone you know who is interested in sports if they want to join your team. Additional sources of players could be friends, co-workers, and players you've played with in the past. To find new players, place ads in online classifieds, especially Craigslist and filed under (your city > community > activity partners > your sport). You can also put ads up in local community centers, the town hall, and local businesses.

, Normally amateur teams are non-profit, so if your team fees are $2000.00 and you have 10 players, each player should pay $200.00 per season.


Try to get sponsors for your team. Often sports bars have sponsorship programs where they rebate money back to you team that you spend there. Local businesses might consider sponsoring your team if you help advertise for them during their games.
Look for other ways to raise funds for your team. Have a team fundraisers, BBQ, raffles, etc.

, A commonly-used structure is as follows: manager (you), coach (maybe you also), captain, co-captain, players.

, The person selected as captain should not always be the ""best"" player. It could be an above average player that is dedicated to the team, shows up on time and has a firm understanding of the game.

, Start a blog or a web site and make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of set-up, practicing, schedules, etc. You can also use the blog or web site to advertise your team, give advertising space to your sponsors, and recruit new players.


Keep a mailing list and phone number list. Contact players one day prior to game day to confirm they will show up. Much of winning and losing in amateur sports has a lot to do with who shows up.

Know the implements of the game you are playing.,
Find a comfortable batting stance.,
Crowd the plate.,
Identify the ball as soon as it leaves the pitcher's hand.,
Once the type of pitch is identified, determine whether the ball is worth swinging at.,
Swing lightly.",How to Be a Successful Wiffle Ball Hitter," There are many different types of wiffle balls (circle holes all around, spiral holes on just one side, Junk Balls), as well as many different types of bats (big barrel, medium barrel, standard yellow thin barrel). It may sound obvious, but knowing what you are using is imperative in order to hit well.;
, Stand at the plate in whatever way feels natural, and test how comfortable you feel in your stance by swinging the bat a couple of times. See if your swing is at its full potential in this stance. When you feel ready, settle in for the at bat.

, If you're crowding the plate, a slider or curveball that would normally be right down the tube will probably hit you. Also, you'll draw more walks and the pitcher will be forced to aim for the outside corner, which is a pitch you can handle., Try to distinguish how it will travel based on its spin, the pitcher's arm location, the hole location on the ball, the wind, etc. There are one of four ways the ball can go:


Curve Out. The ball will tail away from your body. The arm motion of the pitcher is over the top, with the holes on the ball facing away from your body.
Curve In. The ball curves into your body. The arm motion of the pitcher is over the top, with the holes on the ball facing your body.
Sinker. The ball will drop towards the plate. The arm motion of the pitcher is sidearm, with the holes on the ball facing the ground.
High ball. The ball will rise upwards. The arm motion of the pitcher is sidearm, with the holes on the ball facing towards the sky.

, If you can hit it well, swing away. If not, watch it go by.

, The ball is going to have a huge jump off the bat no matter how hard you swing. Its best to slow down your bat speed and simply ensure contact with the ball is made.


Don't try to destroy the ball. Don't just try to make contact, either. Swing hard and focus on hitting a solid line drive.

Expect the opposing team to try to unnerve you.",How to Be an Awesome Kickball Player," Don't put pressure on yourself all of the time. It's fine to be competitive but be realistic about what you can achieve. Also, while it is important work to improve on your weaknesses, it is more important to really focus on your strengths and bring those forth, as these will gain you the confidence to be a good player.;
, The fielding team will probably try to tag you out.

, Try to drive the ball into the outfield for the possibility of extra bases.

, Don't let it slip out of your hands.

,, Kick the ball on the top of your shoe, it will go higher and farther. If you kick on the front of your shoe, it won't go high or very far.

, If it does, that is good. When the ball is not touching the ground, kick it.

,, Kick with confidence.

, Or, if you can, throw it to one of the people near the pitcher.

, This can give a boost to the players running the bases.

, You can practice throwing at home or at a local park to improve your technique.

,, That sort of talk can make them nervous and they might fulfill it and mess up.

, If your teammate gets an out, don't make them mad by saying something mean. It can cause a lot of your teammates to get their head out of the game and mess up. Moreover, you'll get an out sometimes too, and you'd want your team having your back.

, That's their role, just as it's yours to do the same back. Don't be afraid of the other team. Ignore their tactics and just keep playing well.

Our staff is dedicated to the emotional and physical development of the players. Crazedball Volleyball Club puts an emphasis on developing each and every player on the team."";
, Most leagues will require your volleyball club to have a governing committee that will include a chairperson, secretary, and treasurer.

If you are associated with a local school, you can name your club something that relates to the school.If your club is more recreational than competitive, you should think of a funny or clever name.
Some examples of club names include Performance Volleyball Academy, Momentum, Lightning, and Strikers.

, The club constitution will act as the club's bylaws and will explain certain procedures, goals, and membership guidelines. It is what staff and leaders will use when making decisions for the club.Check the governing body of your club to see if they have examples of club constitutions that you can use as a reference.
The constitution should also outline the steps to amending the constitution as well as the rights and powers of the committee.
You can download a template for your club constitution by visiting http://www.sportenglandclubmatters.com/club-planning/governance/policies-procedures/constitutions/.

, To be an official club, you must register your club as a business. Decide whether you want the club to be a corporation, partnership, non-profit, or sole proprietorship and apply the club with your local government. Filing your articles of incorporation will differ depending on which state you live in.Refer to an attorney if you're not sure what kind of business you want to create.
There is typically a fee ranging from $50 - $300 to file for a business license.

, Most leagues require a club to have a separate bank account. Do research on banks around you and open up a business account for the club. Certain banks may also provide you with a line of credit that can help you pay for the club's startup expenses."

Set the price for the services you'll provide.,
Set staff salaries.,
Research the cost of renting practice space.,
Determine the cost of equipment.",How to Start a Volleyball Club2," Services can help cover some of the expenses for your club. Common volleyball services include fitness classes, private lessons, membership dues, summer camp, and branded apparel. Think about what you can provide regarding services, and charge a fair price to members for those services., The average salary for an assistant volleyball coach in America is $33,684.The average pay of a head coach is $54,576 per year.Determine the average salaries of the other staff positions that you need to fill and factor it into your yearly expenses. The more members and players you have on your team(s) will require you to get a larger staff.

, Locate a facility that is large enough to accommodate practice and call them to inquire the cost of renting it out for a certain amount of time on a weekly basis. You can also get a mortgage to purchase a practice space if you want a permanent practice location.Some clubs have coaches who are affiliated with a local school.
If your club doesn't have a school affiliation, contact local recreation centers for practice space., Write out a list of all the equipment that you'll need and search online for the cost of the gear. Volleyball equipment includes uniforms, balls, nets, kneepads, duffel bags, and specialized training devices.The average cost of equipment for a volleyball club is around $37,000.Look for deals on equipment but make sure that they are high quality so that you don't need to replace them.

Interview candidates to join your staff.,
Build a strong base of volunteers.,
Register your team with your National Governing Body.,
Hold tryouts for your volleyball team.,
Practice and train with your new team.,
Register and compete in local, national, or international leagues.",How to Start a Volleyball Club3," A strong volleyball club starts with a strong coaching staff. Your volleyball club's staff could include a head coach, trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, managers, directors, IT personnel, and marketing and communication employees. Put out ads to fill the different positions and make sure to get experience and recommendations before making your choices.If you are trying to start a recreational or smaller club, you won't need as much staff.

, Volunteers make the core of many volleyball clubs. Volunteers can help coach the team, referee, assist with administrative tasks or can tutor students.Talk to local schools and see if they have any students that would be interested in volunteering. Use your social media presence to ask for volunteers and post flyers at school campuses to advertise your volunteer positions., If you want your club to be officially recognized you'll have to register it with your National Governing Body or NGB. Being affiliated with a NGB will also give you access to professional referees, insurance, access to leagues, and access to funding sources. Search online to see what the NGB is in your country, and follow the steps for registration.In England the NGB is called Sports England.The NGB in America is USA Volleyball., Each team within your club should have a minimum of 8 players and a maximum of 15 players. Advertise tryouts for one of your teams through posting flyers and word of mouth. Refer to your league manual for the guidelines you must follow for tryouts. Slim down the potential candidates and build your first team in the club., Once your staff, players, and volunteers are in place, you can start holding practices and competing with your new team. Make sure that you have coaches who are experienced and can build a comprehensive training regimen.

, Once you've gotten enough practice to compete, it's time to register for leagues. If you are playing amateur children's volleyball, there is likely a local or state league that you can join. Once your team is proficient, you can start to consider joining national or international leagues.Leagues in the U.S. include the USA Volleyball Junior National Championships, the USA Premier Volleyball League, and the USA Volleyball Adult Nationals.

Read the defense.,

Extend your arms up over your head.,
Position your hands.,
Position your feet.,
Bend your knees.,
Decide where to send the ball.,

Follow through.",How to Set a Volleyball," Before the ball is even served, strategize about where you want the ball to go. Is one of their blockers less effective than another? Is there an obvious area they aren't guarding well? If so, you want to get to the ball to an attacker on your team who is positioned to make the best of that weakness.








Throughout play, try to continually assess the defense, so you always know where you want to send the ball when you have the opportunity.;
, When waiting for the ball to be passed, stand with your weight on your right foot, ready to take a step with your left in the direction of the ball. 








Most setters find it easiest to position themselves in the back-right corner of the court and approach each set from there. You can set from wherever you are most comfortable, but this position starts you off facing in the optimal direction for sending the ball to your team's attackers., The ball will rarely come directly to you. The faster you get to it, the more time you have to execute the set.









Getting quickly to the ball is all about efficiency. This means you should try to move in a straight line to the ball, taking no more steps than necessary.
You will also need to run as efficiently as possible. Many setters make the mistake of running with their arms up, but this will slow you down. Wait to raise your arms until you are in position., When you reach your position, make sure your hips, feet, and shoulders are directly facing the spot the ball is going to come down, not the direction it came from.









A good rule of thumb is to always orient yourself toward the left antennae when setting, that way the other team can't figure out where you're going to set the ball to based on which way you are facing., Your hands should be directly above your forehead and your elbows should be pointed to the sides.







, Your hands should be four to six inches above your forehead, with your fingers spread out in shape of the ball, as if someone were about to rest the ball in your hands.








Your thumbs and forefingers should form a triangular window through which you can see the ball, but your hands should not actually touch one another.
Try to relax your fingers right before you make contact with the ball.If you want to back set the ball, aiming it behind you, extend your arms upward and behind instead of in front or directly above you., Spread your feet about shoulder width apart, with the foot closest to the net slightly in front of the other. This position rotates your hips and shoulders slightly into the court and helps keep the set from accidentally going over the net.








, Before you set, your knees should be slightly bent and your weight distributed evenly from the balls of your feet to the arches.









Even distribution of weight will allow you to quickly change the direction you are facing if necessary.
If you are back setting, the knee bend is less important. Instead, push your hips forward a little and slightly arch your back., You should already have developed some ideas about this, but this is your last chance to choose the right attacker to send the ball to.


You can create advantageous situations for your team by being deceptive about where you are going to send the ball, potentially leaving the other team unprepared for which attacker will actually be spiking.For example, you might slightly arch your back, as if you are going to back set, and then at the last second set the ball forward instead, or vice versa.
You can also square up as if you are going to set the ball toward one player, especially one across the court, and instead execute a short set to an attacker in a different direction, such as off to your side.After setting, turn and look toward the ball's final destination, to signal your own teammates., Contact with the ball should occur just above the center of your forehead, roughly at your hairline.








Try to make contact with all of your fingers touching the ball. The more of the ball's surface area you make contact with, the more control you will have over it.
Do not let the ball touch your palms. Contact with your palms may be considered catching the ball, which is against the rules in volleyball. If your team scores a point after an illegal maneuver, the referee might opt to restart the rally and revoke that point.

, As soon as the ball touches your fingers, straighten your arms and legs as you push the ball upward in the direction of the spiker.









The straightening of your legs sends power through your body and up to your hands. Your whole body should be part of the push.Actual contact time with the ball should be minimal.This action is essentially the same for a back set, but with less force originating from the knees., At the end of your set, your arms should be fully extended, and you should follow through with your hands by straightening your wrists after releasing the ball. This helps ensure that it stays on your intended trajectory.

Have an understanding of what it means to create topspin.,
Practice in slow motion training.,
Practice contacting the ball in the cobra position.,
Practice serving topspin serves.,
Practice serving topspin short serves.,
Start spiking from a platform once fairly comfortable with creating topspin.,
Have a coach toss the ball off the net and approach hitting 10s.,
Take a full approach and spike at the net.",How to Spike With Topspin," Watch video or have a coach demonstrate spiking a volleyball using topspin. The more you see a spiker create topspin, the more you'll understand what it means exactly to spike with topspin.;
, We want to learn to spike with topspin a quickly as possible. The quickest and most efficient method to learning how to create topspin is by first practicing the spike in slow motion. The key to creating topspin is contacting the ball in a claw-like hand position. This hand position is also called the cobra. Practice the volleyball spike arm swing in slow motion while keeping the hand in a claw-like position during the entire movement. This trains the spiker to be in the claw-like position at pre-contact. Do this in slow motion for 5 to 10 minutes. For faster results, use a camcorder to record the spiker and immediately watch the video. Training in slow motion isn't easy, but is the fastest way to learn the technique for creating topspin.

, Don't make the mistake of trying to do the full volleyball approach and create topspin. The best way to learn topspin is to chunk down the volleyball approach. Therefore, the next step is to just focus on contacting the ball. Get a partner and practice the arm swing spiking motion, spiking the ball to one another. Focus just as before on keeping the hand in a claw-like position during the entire movement. Watch the the rotation of the ball as it travels in the air. If the ball isn't spinning, then the contact was poor. Typically, the better the contact, the more the ball will stick to the hand. The entire hand should be contacting the ball, not just the palm. The entire hand should be wrapped around the ball.

, The easiest way to serve topspin is by contacting the ball more back behind your head. The idea is to reach back further than you normally would while keeping the hand in the cobra position as you swing through the ball. The big difference between serving floaters and serving topspin is how energy is sent through the ball. With float serves, energy is sent through the center of the ball resulting in less spin. With topspin serves, energy is sent more through a spot above of the center of the ball resulting in more spin. Since energy is sent through the center of the ball, float serves will require less power than topspin serves. However, topspin serves are usually very effective. When served with topspin, the ball travels faster and the server is usually more accurate.  

, To get a real grasp of how to create topspin, practice serving short by looping the ball high so it drops short over the net. The key here is to contact the ball back behind your head while keeping the hand in the cobra position.

, Stand at the net on a platform or box and practice the volleyball arm swing. Self toss the ball and just focus on creating topspin. The goal is to get a feeling of how to create topspin and spike the ball down into the court. Progress to adding targets on the court.

, The next step is to practice spiking from far off the net. Practice spiking from off the net because it's easier to contact the ball back behind your head when the set is off the net. Focus on getting comfortable getting your hand in the cobra position and creating topspin on your spikes. Progress to adding targets.

, Remember, the tighter the ball is to the net, the more tempting it is to spike the ball flat without topspin. Always focus on creating topspin every time you spike.

Set against the wall.,
Set to yourself.,
Pass to yourself.,
Practice serving.",How to Practice Volleyball Without a Court or Other People," Most of the exercises in the article involve a wall, so before you begin you should find a flat, high one.;
, Stand about ten feet from the wall. Toss the ball up with your left hand, then take a step with your left foot as you hit the ball with your right hand. Be sure to snap your wrist. Ideally, the ball will bounce right where the floor meets the wall. Then, catch the ball and repeat.

, Stand ten to fifteen feet from the wall. Toss the ball up so that it is higher than your head and just a little bit in front of you. Then set it to the wall. Your sets should be nice and high and they should go in a bit of an arc. You can either catch the ball and repeat, or you can just set the ball as it is bouncing back to you.

, This is very easy to do. You can do it while watching TV or just when you are feeling bored. All you need to do is lay down and set the ball straight up to yourself. Keep the sets going for as long as possible.

, All you have to do is get into passing position and pass the ball straight up to yourself. Try to keep the ball from dropping. You can even count the number of passes and try to beat your record.

, Measure 7'3"" on the wall (higher or lower depending on what net height you usually play at) and mark the spot with a bit of masking tape. Stand 30 feet (9.1 m) from the wall. Toss the ball up with your left hand and hit with your right hand as you are stepping with your left foot. You should be aiming to have the ball hit just above the tape. You can also practice your jump serving or underhand serving.

Know the six court positions.,
Know your position on the team.,
Know when to rotate.,
Know when to sub out.,
Know where to move during your rotations.",How to Rotate in Volleyball," Each team's side of the volleyball court will be filled with two rows of three players each, making for a total of six spots. Though players rotate clockwise, the positions are labeled counter-clockwise. Here they are:










Position 1: The right back, where the serving player is.

Position 2: The right front, just in front of the right back.

Position 3: The middle front, to the left of the front right.

Position 4: The left front, which is to the left of the middle front.

Position 5: The left back, behind the left front.

Position 6: The middle back, behind the middle front.;
, Your court position is where you are standing on the court, which changes with every rotation; your position on the team is your set role and does not change. Here are the six positions and what they do:



The setter: The setter's job is to set up the hitters so that they could hit the ball. Ideally, the setter will get possession of the ball second to set it up for the hitters; if he/she can't get to it, then he/she has to yell ""help,"" and have someone else do it. If he/she accidentally gets it first, then he has to yell ""setter out"" so someone else can set it.

The outside-hitter: This player hits the ball from the strong corner (front left for right handed players; front right for left-handed players).

The middle-blocker: This is usually a tall, strong person on the team, who is mostly in the middle front and blocks every hit. This player also moves to form a double block with either of the outside hitters.

DS: This player plays in the back row and do a lot of rolling and digging so that they keep the ball in play. If they want to come in the game, they have to make a substitution with the refs.

The libero: The libero, (a position created in 1998) only plays in the back row, but can join the game as often as needed. They also wear a different jersey than the rest of the team. The libero is a good passer, good digger, and has good ball handling skills. This player often takes the place of the middle blocker when he or she rotates to the back row.

Each position has a court position that is best for it. For example, middle blockers are best when they are playing in middle front. Setters are best at right front, outside hitters are best at left front, and DS and libero can be anywhere in the back row, although libero is often best at middle back.



, You rotate when you side-out. A side-out is when the other team has the serve, but your team wins the point. In volleyball, you rotate clockwise. If your team wins the point when the other team is serving, then the person in the front right moves to the right back, becoming the new server. If your team is serving and you win a point, you do not rotate, but stay in the same position.









After serving from position 1, a player will rotate to position 6 (middle back), then to position 5 (left back), then to position 4 (left front), then to position three (middle front), then to position two (right front), before returning to position 1, the serving position.
Just remember that each player only rotates one time after the team gains possession of the serve; the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.

, Depending on your level of play and position, you may either stay in the game or be subbed out with another player when you reach a certain rotation. If you are a front row player (setter, outside hitter, or middle blocker), you may substitute with a back row player (DS or libero) when you get to right back, or you might be allowed to serve and then sub out. Back row players will sub with front row players when they reach left front.








, You can move after the server makes contact with the ball to optimize your position. For example, if you're a setter who is in the left front, you can move to the right front after the server makes contact so you can be in the best location for your position. This is the same for other positions too. Middle blockers will always try to run to middle front, outside hitters will try to run to left front, and so on. Just remember that you cannot move until the ball is served.









Players can move positions, but backcourt players can't move to the net to block or spike and must make all attacking actions behind the attack line. This rule is in play so skilled spikers can't dominate in all six of their court rotations.
The setter can sometimes look like he's ""hiding"" behind the other players before a point; this is because he has to be in the correct rotation order before he can move to the net.

Use a salt soak.,
Use a chamomile salt soak.,
Make a compress using breathable tape.,
See a professional piercer.",How to Heal Cartilage Piercing Bumps1," A salt soak is the safest, most effective way to deal with cartilage bumps - it will reduce the size of the bump and help it to disappear over time. To use:


Add 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to one cup of boiling water. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved.
When the salt water has cooled slightly (you want it to be as hot as possible without burning your skin), dip a clean cotton pad into the cup.
Hold the soaked cotton pad against the bump for two minutes. You can leave your jewelry in your ear (or nose) as you do this, but avoid pulling or pushing it around.
Repeat the salt soak twice a day until the bump has disappeared.;
, The addition of chamomile tea to the salt soak helps to soothe and calm the skin around the piercing, making it a good option for people with sensitive skin. To prepare:


Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of salt in boiling water, as described above. Add a chamomile tea bag to the water and allow to brew for five minutes.
Once the tea has brewed, dip a cotton pad in the solution and press it against the bump for five minutes. Do this twice a day.
Alternatively, some people brew the chamomile teabag in hot water, then remove the teabag and allow it to cool slightly before pressing it directly to the ear.
Make sure you are using pure chamomile tea with no added flavorings, and avoid this method if you have a ragweed allergy.

, Using breathable tape to press down on the bump is an example of compression therapy. This method should only be used on fully healed piercings, as it could irritate those that are still healing. To use:


Buy some breathable medical tape (such as Micropore) at your local drugstore. Try to find a color that matches your skin tone.
Use a clean scissors to cut a small strip of the tape. It should cover the entire bump and about 1-2 mm of skin on all sides.
Tightly cover the bump with the strip of tape, so the bump feels compressed. Wear the tape continuously, replacing it with fresh tape when it begins to look grubby.
Use this method for two to three months. Hopefully, the bump will have disappeared after this time. If not, switch to a different method.

, If you'd like a second opinion on the bump, see a reputable local piercing artist. They will be able to examine the bump and give you further advice on treatment options.


As bumps are often caused by wearing loose or overly large jewelry; the piercing professional will also be able to pick out a better ring or stud for your piercing.
The bumps may also be caused by jewelry made from the wrong materials. Ideally, jewelry for cartilage piercings should be made from titanium or a biocompatible plastic.If you prefer, you could also see a doctor or dermatologist, but it's important to keep in mind that they do not have as much experience in dealing with piercings as professional piercers do.

Use tea tree oil.,
Use aspirin.,
Use lemon juice.,
Use honey.",How to Heal Cartilage Piercing Bumps2," Some people claim to have had success in healing piercing bumps with tea tree oil, which is a common ingredient in many home remedies due to its antibacterial properties.


Make sure to buy 100% pure tea tree oil, as this is the least likely to cause irritation.
If your skin is not sensitive, just apply a drop or two of the tea tree oil onto a cotton swab and apply directly to the bump. Do this twice a day until the bump disappears.
If you do have sensitive skin, it's a good idea to dilute the tea tree oil (which is very strong) with a drop or two of water before applying it to the ear.

, Aspirin is believed to be effective in the treatment of cartilage piercing bumps as it opens up the blood vessels beneath the skin, thereby speeding up the healing process.


Place an aspirin tablet in a small bowl and crush it with the back of a spoon. Add a couple of drops of water and mix until it forms a paste.
Apply the paste directly onto the piercing bump then leave it to dry for ten minutes. Rinse off the hardened paste with some warm water.
Repeat this process two or three times a day for best results., Lemon juice is another home remedy some people have found effective in the treatment of cartilage bumps.


Squeeze the juice from half a lemon, then mix to half strength with water. Dip a q-tip in the lemon water and apply to the bump.
Repeat two or three times a day until you see an improvement in the size off the bump.

, Honey contains natural healing properties and is often used in home remedies for the treatment of scars and burns.


Therefore, it could potentially help with the treatment of cartilage piercing bumps. Try applying a dab of honey to the bump, two or three times a day."
"
Make sure your jewelry fits properly.,
Never get pierced with a piercing gun.,
Avoid bumping or knocking your piercing.",How to Heal Cartilage Piercing Bumps3," Loose jewelry can move around inside the piercing, disturbing the cartilage and causing a bump to form.


Therefore it's important to get jewelry that fits the piercing perfectly. A professional piercer from a reputable salon can help you with this.
You should also avoid wearing earrings with butterfly backs, as these are more prone to causing bumps.

, Piercing guns should never be used for cartilage piercings. However, some cheaper or less-professional piercing places still use them.


Piercing guns jam the jewelry through the skin, which distorts the ear cartilage underneath and often causes bumps to form.
Therefore, if you plan on getting a new piercing, avoid getting it done at a place that still uses piercing guns.

, Frequently bumping things off your piercing or getting it caught in hair or clothes causes the jewelry to move around and can lead to bumps.


Tie long hair back as much as possible (particularly when sleeping) to prevent it from snagging in the jewelry.
And in general, just try to be more aware of your piercing and do your best to protect it. Don't fiddle with it or touch it constantly.

Use a rally point system for scoring.,
Switch sides of the court.",How to Play Beach Volleyball," Each team consists of only two players. Professional beach volleyball does not allow for substitutions. If one player is unable to play, then the team must forfeit the match., Beach volleyball is played on a rectangular court and is divided evenly into two parts by the center line and net. For professional or Olympic beach volleyball, the court must measure 16 x 8 meters and the net must be at height of 2.43 meters for men and 2.24 meters for women.


Many local public beach areas will have nets set up for impromptu volleyball games. Depending on your area, court time can be reserved through the local Parks and Recreation Department.
Sand courts can also be found at parks and other recreation areas. Using a search engine to search for “sand volleyball courts” in your area should show some courts that are near you.

, The objective in volleyball is to make the ball hit the sand on the opposing team’s side of the court while simultaneously preventing the ball from hitting the sand on your team’s side of the court. This can be difficult to do and many players will go to great lengths to be able to keep the ball from falling., In beach volleyball, each team is only allowed three contacts with the ball before it must go back over net. Players are permitted to block the serve as it comes over the net, as long as they do not come into physical contact with the net. The ideal sequence is a dig (a pass in which the forearms are used as a platform to direct the ball), then a set (passing the ball over the head with your hands), then an attack, where the ball is directed over the net to the opponent’s side., Each player is only allowed to hit the ball one time before the other player must hit it or the ball drops.

, The ball must be in motion at all times until it hits the sand. In other words, the player cannot hold or carry the volleyball for any length of time during the rally. Doing so will earn the opposing team a point, as if the ball had hit the ground., There are two ways of passing the ball in volleyball: the forearm pass and the overhand pass. A pass is a method of receiving the ball from the other team. In order to execute the pass, the player uses their hands or forearms to direct the ball.


For a forearm pass, the player receives the ball with their forearms and then directs it by clasping their hands and joining their forearms together to form a platform.
The overhand pass is executed by directing the ball with your hands over the head. This movement must be quick and precise.

, Setting the ball involves hitting the ball into the air so that it is in a position for you or your teammate to execute an overhand attack or hit. This movement is generally carried out in the same manner as the overhand pass. The player directs the ball with their hands over their head.

, Blocking the ball involves halting the the ball from coming over the net by jumping with your hands overhead and hitting the ball back to your opponent’s side. When blocking the ball, be very wary of the net. Touching the net is a violation in beach volleyball.

, Hitting the ball is the player’s way of getting the ball to hit the sand on the opposing team’s side of the court. This is generally executed with a jump to increase the intensity of the hit, which can increase the difficulty of the other team being able to return the ball., There are three games in every match. A team must win two of those games in order to win the match. The first team to reach 21 points wins the game but they must be leading by at least two points. The third game is only played to 15 points and must also be won by a two point advantage., When the play stops at the end of each rally, a point is earned. A rally is the number of hits between the two teams. Whichever team wins the rally will also win the next serve.When the opposing team serves the ball and then wins the rally, it scores one point and serves again.
When the opposing team receives the serve and wins the rally, it scores a point and wins the right to serve.

, After every seven points in the first and second set (also known as a game), and every five points in the third set, switch sides of the court with the opposing team. This will require each team to play in the same weather conditions, which can be more favorable on one side of the net, depending on where the sun is shining or which way the wind is blowing.

Strategize with your teammates.",How to Spike a Volleyball," The rules of volleyball state that in order to strike the ball over the net, you must be a front row player. It's most effective to strike the ball from the right or left side at a sharp downward angle. Whether you are spiking the ball from the right or left front position, position yourself behind the 10-foot line (attack line), which is the line that is about four steps away from the net.If you have long legs or take bigger steps, and stand further back.
If you are right handed, you may have a more powerful spike when you approach from the left side of the court, and vice versa if you are left handed. If you are tall or can jump higher, try starting near the middle.;
, The person playing the center position will set the ball high in your direction, arcing it so that it falls close to the net in a position that makes it easy to spike it to the other side. You'll start your approach after the ball is set.


As you practice spiking, make sure you're working with a skilled setter. It should rise and fall in a gentle arc close to the net, putting it in the perfect position for you to go in for the kill.
As you practice with your team, you'll want to call to your teammates to let them know you're striking. Many teams come up with codes for each side, so use them if yours does.

, Face the ball and bend your knees so you're ready to move. If you're right handed, your left foot should be set back from your right foot. If you're left handed, your right foot should be set back from your left foot. , Take a strong first step with your left foot in the direction of the ball. If you're left-handed, do the reverse.








, Step with your right foot to build speed (if you're left-handed, it will be your left foot). At the same time, swing your arms back behind you to prepare for the strike. The distance of this second step will vary according to the position of the ball. If the ball is closer to you, you'll take a short step; if it's further from you, take a longer step.







, Step again with your left foot (or your right, if you're left-handed) and end with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees bent. Your arms should be swung back behind you.









Your arm swing is essential when it comes to the height of your jump. A well-timed swing will help your upward momentum. Practice getting the timing down perfectly.
Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart so you don't end up off balance.
Keep your head up to watch the ball as it falls toward you.

, As your last step lands, your body should be turned at 30 degrees from the net with your hitting shoulder further from the net. Jump explosively upward and swing your arms forward at the same time to jump high into the air. The higher you jump, the more powerful your strike will be.








, As you reach the height of your jump, your arms should swing above your head. Pull back your right elbow (or your left, if you're left-handed) and bend it at a ninety degree angle. Your hand should now be at head level., Keep your hand open with your fingers together. Rotate your arm at the shoulder and whip your forearm forward to move your hand quickly toward the ball and make contact. Snap your wrist downward to impart topspin and direct the ball down into your opponent's court.









Try to hit the ball at the height of your jump to maximize the power of your strike.
Bring your arm down ""through"" the ball and next to your body. This ensures that you don't lose momentum throughout your hit.
It's against the rules to touch the net. Bring your arm back toward your body after the strike to avoid a penalty.
Be careful not to ""carry"" or ""hold"" the ball for even a second, as this is against the rules.

, This will help you regain balance and avoid an ankle injury. Make sure you don't fall into the net as you land.








, If the opposing team returns the ball, you'll need to be ready for more action. Drop back from the net and get in your ready position. Keep your eye on the ball the whole time.

, When you're just learning how to spike, it's important to get the footwork down. Practice enough that you know the volleyball approach well enough to do it in your sleep. Remember to start behind the attack line and move toward the imaginary ball. Focus on mastering a fast, powerful approach.

, Take a volleyball and practice hitting it against a wall, over and over. Toss it up in the air or set it to yourself, then practice rearing back and spiking. Remember to snap your forearm forward by bending your elbow and rotating it toward the ball. The more quickly you can do this, the more powerful your spikes will be.









Practicing on your own is good, but it also helps to work with a partner who can set the ball for you so you can work on your entire approach, jump and swing.
Focus on making solid contact with the ball, snapping your wrist and following through.

, The height of your jump is reliant on your entire approach, not just the final step. Make sure you step toward the ball powerfully to begin building momentum. Swing your arms back briskly as you bend your knees. When you jump, your entire body should move in one upward swing, putting you in the best possible position to spike the ball.








Practice jumping as high as you can and spiking the ball at the height of your jump every time.
Try working with a spike trainer. This is a device that holds the ball in a high position, forcing you to jump high enough to hit it at the height of your jump and spike it out of the device.

, Knowing exactly when to hit the ball can really impact the power of your spike. You want to time your approach so that you're able to make contact with the ball right as it reaches your ""sweet spot,"" the place where your hand can strike it downward while you're still at the height of your jump. Timing is one of the most skills to master; only with plenty of practice will you be able to maximize your strike.









To work on your timing, it helps to practice with a good setter. Work with someone who is capable of setting the ball high and in the correct position for you to strike it at the top of your jump.
Keep your eye on the ball as you approach for the strike. If you hit it with the tips of your fingers or too low on your hand, you know your timing was off.

, Follow through is essential for a powerful strike, because without it, you're forced to halt your hand's momentum before it has had the chance to really attack the ball at full speed. The key is to follow through without touching the net. Bend your elbow during your follow through so you can keep your arm close to your body instead of reaching into the net., Serious volleyball players do special exercises in order to build up the calves, abs, rotator cuff muscles and other muscles that allow them to jump powerfully into the air. Work with your coach to start an exercise routine that will help you jump higher. Here are a few exercises to try:



Do push ups. You can either start with your hands placed on the ground or on an exercise ball, which also helps your shoulder stability. Do three sets of fifteen pushups each, increasing reps as you gain strength over time.Do a two-hand overhead ball slam. Use a medicine ball (a heavy volleyball-sized ball). Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, use both hands to swing it up over your head, then slam it down on the ground. This works out your shoulders and arm muscles., A strike is more powerful and effective when you hit the ball at a sharp downward angle. You want it to hit the floor as quickly as possible, so your opponent won't have time to return it. Once you've mastered the correct striking form, practice striking at a sharp angle.









Look for the holes in the court that your opponents will have trouble reaching. Aim for the holes instead of striking the ball directly to the opponents.
By striking from different places along the net, you can take advantage of your opponents' weak spots.
Practice your aim by hitting on a box. Stand on a tall, sturdy box in the position you would be in at the height of your jump during a spike. Have someone set the ball to you and practice spiking it from the box to hit targets on the other side of the net., Blockers are players on the opposing team whose job it is to block your spike from getting over the net. No matter how powerful you strike the ball, if you plow it right into a blocker, you probably won't be earning a point for your team. It's important to keep your eye on the ball, but you also have to learn to see blockers out of the corners of your eyes so you can avoid them at the net.


The best way to practice seeing blockers is to practice with opposing players. During your spiking practice, have teammates try to block your spikes.
You can avoid blockers by correctly aiming your strikes out of their reach.
Remember to snap your wrist during your follow through so that the ball has topspin; this will make it harder for blockers to successfully block the ball.

, A slower, graceful dance toward the ball is going to give your opponents plenty of time to get into position to block your strike. Moving quickly and explosively will take them by surprise, and you'll have a greater chance for successfully making the kill.








If you're not very quick on your feet, sprinting practice can increase your speed.
It's important not to start your approach until the ball has been set; otherwise, you'll give yourself away before you get the chance to strike.

, Many volleyball teams use code words, special positioning and other strategies to fake out their opponents. Making the effort to distract or confuse your opponents before spiking is a great way to free up a hole on the other side so you can make a point. See How to Play Volleyball to learn more about volleyball strategy, and what it takes to beat a sharp opposing team.

Ready your stance.,
Pick up the ball.,
Check your posture.,
Make a fist with your other hand.,
Swing your arm.,
Hit the volleyball.",How to Serve a Volleyball1," Place your feet about shoulder width apart, but staggered in an up-and-back position.


You should be able to rock back and forth in this position without fear of falling over, as it is the most stable.
Make sure your feet are planted on the ground and you are not standing on your toes.
You will begin with your weight shifted to your back foot, while maintaining your stance with your front foot fully on the ground as well.;
, You should hold the ball in your secondary hand (the one you don’t write with), with your other hand laying at your side.


Hold the ball in front of your body, above your hips and just below your waist.
Don’t hold the ball too far out from your torso, otherwise you won’t be able to hit it with your opposite hand.
Don’t grip the ball too firmly, but rather let it rest on your palm using a gentle grip with your fingers to keep it from falling.

, Your upper body and shoulders should be leaning forward slightly, and you should keep your eyes on the ball at all times.

, Close your hand, with your fingers tucked in and your thumb resting at the side.

, Using your hand with a closed fist, swing your arm in a pendulum motion to hit the ball.


Swing your arm with your palm facing up and your thumb facing out.
Don’t wind your arm up very far prior to the swing; bring it back the same distance as you have to swing forward. For example, if you have to swing your arm forward half a foot, then swing with your arm only half a foot behind your starting position.
Shift your weight forward slightly from your rear foot to your front, in time with your swing.

, Aim to hit the ball just below the center, so as to propel it slightly upwards and over the net.


Drop the hand holding the ball just before making contact with your swing.
Follow through with your swing. Don’t stop your arm from moving immediately upon hitting the ball, but allow it to propel forward to give your hit more power.
Keep your eye on the volleyball the whole time to aid in making contact."

Tip if you need to.",How to Master Basic Volleyball Moves," You want to stand with your feet a little further apart than your shoulders. Bend your knees and curve your back so that your chest is upright, forcing your butt to stick out a little. You should be standing on your toes and ready to move in any direction in a split second.If someone were to push you while in your passing position, you should easily be able to move a foot to save you. They should be able to tap you and cause you to fall toward one direction or the other.;
, Now, bend your elbows half way. You should look as though you’re holding a large box with your palms facing up. This makes it possible to pass with either your forearms or your hands in a split second decision.

, Now that you have your ready position down, work on the form for passing with your forearms, or platform. Take one hand and place it flat on the other. Next, take your thumbs and have them meet in the middle. Cup your fingers, and point your thumbs away from you. Try to get your thumbs as far from your body as possible, this will straighten your arms and force your forearms up to create your platform. You always want your platform to be straight.


Try squeezing the sides of your elbows together to give you a straighter platform. If you’re double jointed, you might even be able to perfectly match up both forearms.

, You always want the ball to go back into the court when you’re passing. Therefore, whichever leg is nearest the outside of the court will be the one you lead with. This will face your platform toward the court.


Stepping doesn’t require standing straight up. Stay low as the ball comes to you.

, Watch the ball come over the net and onto your platform. Never look away from the ball.

, As the ball falls onto your platform, be keep the angle between your arms and torso steady. You want to use your legs to lift the ball, don’t swing your arms.


Swinging your arms creates inconsistency in where your pass will go. You need very strong legs to stay low and pass correctly.
Follow through to target. As you straighten your legs to move the ball, be aware of the way you’re facing. If you’re facing the target, you’ve done it correctly., Even after you pass the ball and watch it go to your target, you want to stay low and be ready for the ball to come back at you. When playing in the back row, you should never be standing straight up unless the official has blown the whistle and the play has just ended.

, When preparing to set, your feet should be shoulder width apart with a slight bend in your knees. You should, once again, be on your toes and ready to move., You should have your right shoulder next to the net. Keep yourself square to the net, no matter where the ball goes along it. This ensures that you’re facing where you want the ball to go.

, When setting, your thumbs and forefingers should form a triangle. This is the hand positioning you should be waiting in when the ball is coming into your setting area. Keep your hands in the shape of a ball. If you keep your fingers straight you will not only be called for illegal setting form, but you also put yourself at risk of injury.


Have your hands ready. As soon as the ball begins to come toward you, your hands should be up by your head. When first starting out, tap your thumbs to your forehead before you set each ball.

, As the ball comes to you, you want to use your wrists to “accept the ball.” You aren’t allowed to hold it, but accepting the ball gives you the ability to control where you’re going to put it. Keeping your hands at forehead level will help you to have proper setting form. This will keep you from holding the ball for too long.

, Just as with passing you want to use your legs to move the ball, not your arms. Although your arms will straighten as you push through the ball, the power of your set should be coming from your legs.


Release the ball cleanly. The ball should only be in your fingers for a second. Using your legs, push the ball to the spot you want it to go to. Push through your legs, tighten your abdominals, and use your arms to direct the ball. You should finish in almost a superman position. Make sure the ball has minimal spin, because the officials will call you for a double contact if the ball spins more than one full rotation.

, Before you can think about hitting, you must be able to take a proper approach. Start back on the attack line with your feet next to each other at a 45 degree angle to your setter.These directions will be for righties, if you are a lefty, do the mirroring movement. Take your right foot and take a large first step. From here, take a big and powerful step onto your left foot. You should be about 3 feet away from the net at this point. Then take your right foot and quickly match it to your left foot. As you land on these two feet, your legs should be bent and ready to jump.


Use your arms to help your approach. Start with them in front of you and swing them back as you come to your last two steps of your approach. They should be fully extended behind you before you take off for your jump.

, You don’t want to use your momentum to drive you forwards or you’ll jump into the net. Use your legs and arm swing to propel you up.

, As you jump, pull your right arm back passed your face. Keeping your elbow up, swing toward the ball. Always keep your eye on the ball.

, As you swing through the ball, you want a strong wrist. If your wrist is weak and flimsy, the ball won’t make it over the net. Using your abdominal and shoulder muscles, put your power through the ball and swing through. You should finish by landing on the ground with your arm swinging all the way through.


Hand contact is the most important part to placing the ball. Placing the ball is what will score your points. Practice hand contact by standing 20 feet from a wall, tossing a ball up, and hitting it into the corner of the floor and the wall. Try to get the entire surface of your hand on the ball at once., If your spacing is awkward, or the ball is in the wrong spot for you, you can tip the ball. This is when you tap the ball just enough to get over the block and watch it fall gently on the ground behind them.

Know who can score.,
Don't worry about which team serves.,
Avoid violations.,
Use a score sheet to keep track of points.",How to Score in Volleyball1," During a volleyball match there are rules about which players may strike the ball and when. Front row players are going to be the ones who are focused on this task while back row players are forbidden from striking the ball. However, if the back row player jumps from behind the attack line, they are then allowed to attack and score a point.Back row players cannot attack while standing in front of the attack line.
Front row players will be more likely to score points.
Front row players can reach over the net to block but only after the other team has used their three moves.;
, The original rules in volleyball stated that only the team serving could score a point. However, the rules have been updated and now any team can score a point regardless of which team served the ball. Stay focused and always look for your opportunity to score whether your team served or not.The ball is now allowed to touch the net on a serve.

, The game of volleyball has many rules that must all be carefully followed. If the rules are broken a violation is leveled against a player. Avoid some of the more common violations to keep your team strong and increase your chances of scoring:Do not touch the net when the ball is in play.
Do not hit the ball more than four times.
Do not catch the ball or hold it.
Servers cannot step beyond the back-line when serving.

, There are many free and easy to understand score sheets available on-line. These score sheets can be printed off and will allow you to quickly and accurately track a large amount of information during a game. Look over some of the following common elements of a volleyball score sheet to get familiar with their structure:Information about the match including time, location, date, and the level of the match.
Places to list the players numbers, names, serving orders, and substitutions.
An area to track the running score.
Charts to track any sanctions against players for violations of rules.
Names of the referees and scorekeeper.
A place to write the final scores and for the judges to sign off on them.

Hold your arm out perpendicular from your body.,
Prepare to toss the ball.,
Hit the ball.",How to Serve a Volleyball2," They should be shoulder width apart, with your non dominant foot leading.


Have your feet and body facing directly where you plan on serving the ball. This will line up your body, giving you the most power in your serve.
Your weight should be resting on your back foot.

, You will hold the ball up with your secondary hand - the one you don’t write with. This is also called your shelf hand.

, You will use your shelf hand to lift the ball above your head, tossing it 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) up.


Release the ball near eye-level or when your arm is fully extended.
Be sure to throw the ball straight up, as throwing to the side will force you to have to reach and make your hit out of balance.
Don’t try to throw the ball per se, but rather lift it into the air in a pushing motion. This will help to prevent a throw that is too high.
Prepare to hit the ball. Bring your hitting elbow back so that it is held in the air just above your ear.Imagine pulling a bow-and-arrow string as you reach back to hit the ball. This is about how your elbow should be bent before the hit.
When the ball hits its highest point, swing forward to hit it. Use the torque from your arm and torso to add strength to your hit.

, Keep your hand open and hit with the heel of your palm, or close it in a half-fist.


Use a punching action to hit it, stopping your swing just after you make contact with the ball.
Unlike an underhand serve, you will have little to no follow through after you hit the ball.
Push forward with your hand to hit the ball with little to no spin, as is desired for a floating serve."
"
Get in the proper position.,
Toss the ball.,
Bring your arm back to hit.,
Swing forward with your arm to hit the ball.",How to Serve a Volleyball3," Use the same ready-position as you would with an overhand float serve, with your feet shoulder width apart and slightly staggered.


Your weight should be resting on your back foot and your body leaning slightly forward.
You will hold your shelf arm out perpendicular to your body to throw the ball.
Bring your hitting arm back with your elbow pointing behind you, at about eye level.

, Throw the ball up into the air like you would for a float serve, but throw it at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the starting point.


Be sure to throw it straight up, not to the side, to allow for a balanced hit.
Although you are throwing it a bit higher for the topspin serve than for the float serve, do not throw it too high. You will likely under/overestimate the timing to hit it, leading to an unbalanced hit.

, Use the same pose as you would for a float hit, with your elbow above your ear and behind your head.

, Instead of punching at the ball like a float serve, you will instead hit downwards with an open hand.


As you swing, you will turn so your throwing shoulder is facing away from the ball.
Snap your wrist downwards so that your fingers are angled towards the floor. Do this as you make contact with the ball to push it forward.
Follow through all the way with you arm on this serve, so that your hand will come to a stop much lower than where the ball originally was.
You will end the hit with your weight shifted to your front foot."
"
Make sure you are prepared.,
Position yourself a good distance from the line.,
Get in the ready position.,
Take your steps forward.,
Toss the ball.,
Jump up and forwards, bringing your arm back at the same time.,
Hit the ball.",How to Serve a Volleyball4," A jump serve is the most advanced of all the serves, and should only be done when you are sure of your ability to successfully perform the other three.

, If you are playing on a court, a jump serve must be performed from outside the line, although you can land inside after having jumped.

, Place your feet shoulder width apart with the leg on your non-hitting side placed forward slightly.


You will be taking a few steps forward, so be sure that your stance is comfortable for doing so.
Hold the ball in your shelf hand, and prepare to draw your hitting arm back for the swing.

, Take two steps forward, beginning with your left foot.


Don’t take steps that are too wide, as they will throw you off balance when you go to hit.
To practice you can take these steps slowly, but in a game you will want to take these steps in quick succession.

, At the beginning of your third step forward, throw the ball into the air 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) high with your shelf hand.


Throw the ball straight in front of you, not off to the side, to improve your chances of hitting the center and getting a better serve.
Be sure to toss the ball slightly forward, not directly above you. This is because you will be moving forward with your jump, and don’t want to have to reach back to make the hit.

, You want the jump to be as powerful as possible, to add momentum to your hit.


Bring your arm up and back, with your elbow just above your ear.
Use your momentum to push your body forward in time with your hit; you want the ball to be around eye-level before you make your swing.

, You can choose either a float serve or a topspin serve to hit, using the same techniques for both except for in the air.


For the floating serve, bring your arm back and push forward with an open palm, like a punch. You may have a little follow-through with this because of your jump.
To do a jumping topspin serve, hit the ball downwards flicking your wrist in the process. You will have a lot of follow-through with this because of the jump."
"
Be aware of rotation.,
Drill with your team.,
Practice often.",How to Score in Volleyball2," Most sports will have dedicated positions for players to take and become masters of. However, volleyball will require players to change positions during a game. For this reason you and your teammates will need to become confident playing any role necessary during a game.Whenever your team gains the serve back you will need to rotate.
After a successful serve players can change positions. However, players in the back-court can't move up the court.

, Although you can practice your own technique you will need to practice with your entire team to increase the amount of points scored. Scoring points during a volleyball game will be highly dependent on excellent teamwork. Practice with your full team in order to increase the amount of points scored.Practice both defensive and offensive drills with your team.
Try to simulate actual games with your team to develop techniques for realistic situations.

, Getting regular practice is key when maintaining and developing both individual and team skills. A good coach should be scheduling your teams practice sessions and making sure that everyones skills are at their sharpest. Make sure you and your team are getting regular practice to score more often during your games.Repetition will cause you to become more familiar with the techniques of volleyball.
Make sure both you and your team are fully focused during training and practice.

Learn how to serve.,
Improve your passes.,
Practice your blocks.,
Work on your setting skills.,
Build your hitting ability.",How to Score in Volleyball3," Serving the ball is the opening move for any volleyball match. The serve will send the ball over the net, being sent from the server to the defending team. Serving the ball properly can result in an immediate point being scored or will at least give your team more time to work to score a point later on during the rally.The easiest serve is the underhand serve. Hold the ball in one hand and bring your other hand up to strike the ball, sending it over the net.
Overhand serves are more difficult but can be more powerful. Toss the ball up into the air with one hand and strike it down and over the net with the other.
You cannot cross the end court line when serving.

, Passing the ball to your teammates will be a critical part of scoring more points in a volleyball match. Without proper team work your team won't be able to set up the ideal attacks.

Bring your hands together.
When passing the ball, strike it with your forearms. Do not use your wrists or hands to pass the ball.

, Beyond offensive skills, defending your team can help keep the ball out of play, stop the opposition from scoring and get the ball back under the control of your team. Keep some of the following points in mind when practicing your blocking:The front three players will be in charge of blocking.
Blockers should reach over the net when blocking a shot.
You will need to pay careful attention to where the ball is and where you expect it to enter your side of the court.

, Setting the ball will likely fall to you during a game of volleyball and it's an important skill to develop. By properly setting the ball you will be lining up the best possible shots for your hitters to take. Try to remember some of the following concepts when developing your setting skills:Start with both hands up above your head.
Have your fingers wide before contacting the ball.
As the ball touches your hand, bring your fingers together and push it away from you.
Send the ball over to your teammate who is ready to strike it over the net.

, Striking will generally be the way your team will score goals. The striker is given the ball by the setter and then attempts to send the ball through the oppositions defense. If the opposition cannot stop the strike your team will score. Practice your striking to make your shots count.Approach the ball as it comes to you.
Squat low and get ready to jump up to meet the ball.
You will strike the ball as you would during an overhand serve.
Try to send the ball away from opposing blockers.

Taking or training on stairs can improve your jump strength.
Running hills is a good way to improve leg strength and cardiovascular function.

, Strengthening you core can help with your stability and power during any movement and will help boost overall performance when playing volleyball. Use some of the following exercises to help build a strong and powerful core:Static planks are a good exercise that focus on building core strength.
Side planks will target your obliques and build a strong core all around.
Squats are a dynamic movement than can improve both leg and core strength.

, Many volleyball players sustain injuries to their shoulders. This is largely due to the amount of overhead arm movements that the game requires from players. To prevent injury to your shoulders you will need to keep them strong and flexible. Try some of the following exercises to protect your shoulders and keep your volleyball game at it's peak.Push ups are the simplest exercise you can do to build stronger shoulders.

Find a high wall on which you can practice your setting.",How to Set," In order to learn setting, you will need full range of motion in your arms and legs.


Wear cross training sneakers that allow you to move in any direction without twisting your ankle. They should also grip the floor so you don’t fall.
Wear kneepads as you learn advanced setting. Setters are required to occasionally kneel to reach a ball.;
, A set will usually be the second touch out of 3-touch return. The setter must pivot and adjust to where the first pass took place.

, Face the ball and square your hips toward it.


Position yourself so that the ball will hit you in the head, if you do not set it with your hands.
You want the ball to be redirected with upward, rather than sideways momentum, allowing a player to spike it in the direction of their choice.

, Your dominant leg should be leading and your knees should be slightly bent.

, Elbows should be bent slightly. Your hands should be approximately 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) above your head.

, The window should frame the ball as it comes toward you. There should be approximately 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5cm) between your thumbs and your index fingers.
All of your fingers should touch the ball when you set, although the most control comes from your “window.”

, Straighten your knees at the same time.


The power that lifts the ball straight up should come from your legs and your triceps, with the wrists controlling the direction.
Your arms will outstretch, but can remain slightly bent if you are not setting the ball high.
Never allow the ball to rest into your hands. Prolonged holding of the ball is an illegal lift.

, A teammate can temporarily fill in for the current plan. , The following are set types:


The One Ball is low and quick, going toward the front middle attacker.
The Two Ball will rise 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2m) upward. It should be versatile for the front or back attackers to make the final hit.
The Three Ball is a medium-high set approximately 3 feet (0.9m) upward and directed low and fast at side attacker.
The Four Ball is low and fast to the left outside attacker.

See a professional if you experience serious pain or bleeding.",How to Change a Nose Piercing," For most new piercings, you'll want to wait until the opening has plenty of time to heal before removing your jewelry. Changing your jewelry too early can be painful and potentially lead to irritation and infection. On top of this, it's likely to extend the healing time of your piercing even longer.While every piercing is different, most new nose piercings will need at least a month to heal to the point that you can safely remove the jewelry.However, longer waiting periods (up to two months or longer) are usually preferable. As a general rule, if your piercing is painful to remove, it may need more time to heal.
Note that, if your piercing becomes infected, your doctor may direct you to remove your piercing early. See our article on infected piercings for more information.;
, Clean hands are crucial when removing your piercings. Human hands can potentially carry millions of bacteria, especially if they've just come into contact with a bacteria-rich object like a doorknob or a piece of uncooked food.To protect your piercing, which is vulnerable to infection even if it's well-healed, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap or sanitizer and water.


Another good option is to put on a fresh pair of sterile latex gloves (unless you have a latex allergy, in which case, you should steer clear.) Gloves can have the added benefit of making it easier to grasp the slippery ends of jewelry pieces that rest inside your nose.

, You're now ready to begin! To start, you'll want to remove or undo the mechanism holding your piercing in. Depending on the type of piercing you have, the exact mechanism can differ. Most should be fairly self-explanatory, but here are some general guidelines for a few common types of nose jewelry:



Seamless hoops: This is a metal hoop or ring with a break in the middle. To prep the hoop for removal, just bend the two ends of the ring in opposite directions to widen the opening.

Captive bead hoops: Similar to seamless hoops (see above), but with a bead in the middle to cover the break in the ring. Prep for removal by pulling the ends of the hoop in opposite directions — the bead should eventually fall off the ring.These can be notoriously difficult for first-timers to remove, so if you're struggling, consider getting a professional's help.

L-shaped studs: Basic ""stud"" design with a 90-degree bend in the skinny portion so that the jewelry resembles an ""L"" shape. To prep for removal, grab onto the decorative portion on the outside of the nose and gently push down until you see the curve of the L come through the outside of your piercing. Note that you may feel a slight pinch as the bend in the stud comes through the piercing hole.

Nose Screws: Similar to ordinary studs but with a corkscrew shaped stick portion. These require a little twisting to insert and remove. To prep for removal, gently push outward on the end of the piercing inside your nose. It should begin to slide out. Gently twist it as you push it through your nose, following its curve. Depending on your jewelry, it make take two or three full twists to come through. It may also help to use KY jelly or another gentle lubricant when you do this to keep the stud from getting stuck.

Bones or Fishtails: Miniature ""sticks"" or ""poles"" with beads or other stoppers at both ends. The central pole may be straight or curved. While some bone may have removable stoppers, the majority do not, which means that these can be some of the most difficult pieces of jewelry to remove. To prep for removal, press a finger or thumb against the end of the jewelry on the inside of your nose and push so that the jewelry sticks out slightly on the outside.

, Once you've gotten your piercing ready for removal, taking it out is usually a cinch. Gently pull the jewelry out of the piercing hole at a slow, steady pace. If your jewelry has curves in it, go slowly and be ready to change the angle you pull at to accommodate its curves.


For some piercings, you may find that it's helpful to have one finger inside the nose to guide the internal portion of the jewelry out. Don't be shy about this — it may look like you're picking your nose, but if you do it in a private place, it can save you from unnecessary discomfort.
For nose bones without removable stoppers, pulling the jewelry through will require more force than with the other types of nose jewelry. Try to remove it in one firm but gentle motion. Be prepared for an uncomfortable pinch as the nub on the inside end of the bone comes through the piercing. Don't be alarmed if you bleed a little bit after it comes out, especially if this is your first time, but be sure to clean it thoroughly if this happens (more details on cleaning below.)

, Once you have your jewelry out, put it in a safe place so that you don't lose any of its smaller pieces. Next, use a cotton swab or Q-tip to gently clean both sides of your piercing with a gentle antibacterial solution. This kills bacteria around the piercing site and reduces the risk of infection. In terms of cleaning solutions you may want to use, you have several options. Below is just a short list of examples — see the section below for more information.


Saline (salt and water) solution
Rubbing alcohol
Bactine
Antibacterial ointment (i.e., neosporin, etc.)

, After you've removed your jewelry, you have two cleaning tasks: to clean the jewelry you just removed, and to clean the new piece of jewelry before you insert it. For convenience's sake, you can use the same cleaning method for both! Your first choice in terms of cleaning options is to use a simple saline solution. The benefit of this option is that it's very cheap and easy to prepare at home — however, it does take some time to prepare.


To make a saline solution, heat two cups of water in a small pot. When it starts to boil, add 1/2 teaspoon (not tablespoon) and stir until it dissolves. Continue to boil for five minutes to kill any microorganisms in the water.To sterilize your jewelry, pour your saline solution into two separate clean containers, then drop your old jewelry into one container and your new jewelry into the other. Let both pieces soak for five to ten minutes., Another good option for cleaning your jewelry is to use rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol, which is usually available for cheap at local hardware stores. To clean your jewelry with rubbing alcohol, simply pour a little into a small, clean container and use a cotton swab or Q-tip to thoroughly paint both your old jewelry and the new jewelry you intend to insert.Give your new jewelry a chance to dry on a clean paper towel before inserting it into your piercing. Rubbing alcohol can sting if it's introduced directly into a piercing (though it shouldn't cause serious harm.)

, Liquid antiseptic solutions (like Bactine or other brands with benzalkonium chloride as an active ingredient) are great for cleaning nose jewelry. Not only do they kill harmful bacteria on contact, but they're also easy to apply — just dampen a clean rag or Q-tip with the solution and rub it onto the jewelry, then set it out to dry before inserting it again.


Another great thing about Bactine and similar products is that they can help relieve the pain that can accompany changing your jewelry for the first time, so don't be afraid to gently apply a little to the piercing itself.

, If you have any antibiotic ointment in your bathroom cupboard, you may want to use it in addition to of one of the cleaning solutions above. To do so, simply rub a small amount onto both pieces of jewelry, taking special care to coat the portion that will sit inside the piercing. Suitable ointments include those that contain polymyxin B sulfate or bacitracin as their active ingredient.Note that the use of ointments for piercings is somewhat controversial — while they're good for killing bacteria, there is some evidence that using ointments this way can actually slow the healthy healing process of the piercing.Note also that some people are allergic to common antibiotic ointments. If you experience pain and swelling upon inserting your new jewelry after cleaning it with ointment, remove it and stop using the ointment. Contact a doctor if problems persist.

, When your new piece of jewelry has been sterilized, inserting it into the piercing is usually quite easy. Simply remove any fasteners or beads and gently slide the jewelry's thin portion into the piercing.


If your piercing is in your septum (the ""middle"" section of the nose), you'll need to insert the jewelry into the hole through one nostril. If, however, the piercing is in the side of one of your nostrils, you should insert it from the outside of the nose.
As a reminder, be sure to wash your hands or put on gloves before handling your (sterile) new jewelry or touching your piercing.

, To help aid the jewelry through your piercing, try inserting one finger onto the other side of the opening as you push the jewelry in. This can help you get the angle of insertion just right — when you feel the jewelry poke your finger, you'll know you've ""cleared"" the hole.

, Continue feeding the jewelry through your piercing, using both hands to guide and adjust it as needed. If your piercing has any curves in it, gently twist or turn the piece of jewelry as you push it in to accommodate the curves and avoid any unnecessary pain.

, When your jewelry has been inserted completely, the only task that remains is to seal or fasten it in so that it won't fall out. Depending on the type of jewelry you're using, the exact way to do this will differ — just like with the removal process above. Below are rough instructions for several common types of nose jewelry:



Seamless hoops: Simply bend the two ends of the ring so that they line up inside your nose and the ring sits securely in your piercing.

Captive bead hoops: Bend both ends of the ring so that they meet inside the fastener bead. As noted above, these pieces can be quite difficult for beginners, so consider enlisting the help of a professional if you're having trouble.

L-shaped Studs: Stick the narrow end of the jewelry through your piercing. The decorative end of the stud should be above the piercing if you want the end of the ""L"" to point up into your nostril and vice versa if you want the end to hang below. Push it through until you reach the bend, then carefully work the angle of the stud through your piercing (pull it down if you started with it above the piercing and push it up if you started with it below the piercing.)

Nose Screws: Put the tip of the stud through your piercing. Put your thumb or finger against the hole on the inside of your nose for guidance. Gently push the screw through, twisting clockwise until you feel the tip poke through the inside of your nose. If necessary, keep twisting until the piercing is flat against the outside of your nose

Bones or Fishtails: As noted above, while these types of jewelry are comfortable to wear long term, they can be some of the least comfortable to put in and take out. To insert a bone or fishtail, start by placing the nub of the jewelry against the outside of your piercing. Using your thumb or finger inside your nose for support, firmly push the bar through until you feel it come through the other side. Don't be alarmed if you feel an uncomfortable pinch as you are doing this.

, Once your new jewelry is seated comfortably in your nose, congratulations — you've just successfully changed your piercing! At this point, finish up by giving your nose one more thorough cleaning with an antiseptic to discourage infection. Apply a mixture of warm water and soap, an antibacterial sanitizer, or any of the cleaning solutions described in the section above to the area around both sides of your new piercing.

, Inserting your new piece of jewelry may be somewhat awkward or uncomfortable, but it should not be outright painful or cause significant bleeding. If you experience either of these symptoms or your piercing becomes red, inflamed, and/or irritated, this may be a sign that your piercing has not had adequate time to heal or that your piercing is infected. In either case, visit a reputable piercing professional to determine the problem. See a doctor if your symptoms don't seem to get better over time.

Check with your parent and/or employer.,
Research a quality piercer.,
Gather the proper paperwork.",How to Care for Your Nose Piercing1," If you’re under 18, you may need your parent’s permission to get the piercing. They will have to go with you to sign a consent form.If you are over 18 and hold a job, check with your employer about dress codes. Also, if you go to a private school, you’ll want to find out if face piercings are acceptable.;
, Don’t go looking for a bargain. You don’t want to risk anything going wrong. Instead, ask around. Word of mouth is a great way to find a reputable piercer. If no one knows of anyone, start looking some up online. Go into the shop and get to know your piercer before you decide. Ask them about previous piercings that they've done, if there were every any issues, and how long they've been doing them. Sometimes, they’ll even have a photo album for you to look through.


Ask to see certificates that their Autoclave has passed spore tests. If they do not have an autoclave, leave immediately.
The shop should be clean and sanitary.
Some piercers are registered with the APP. Whilst this ensures they should be sanitary in their work, it does not mean that they do good piercings. Always check feedback of their customers and do not assume that an APP certificate means that they are a good piercer.

, You’ll need to bring your license for sure. Some states require a birth certificate as well. The laws change from state to state, so check about the law in your area."
"
Watch your piercer.,
Sit still.,
Use implant grade material.,
Use new needles.,
Throw away the needles.",How to Care for Your Nose Piercing2," If they take you into a room without sufficient lighting, question it. They should be able to see what they are piercing. Also, watch them wash their hands and put on sterile gloves. If they already have gloves on, you are completely justified in asking them to re-wash their hands and replace the gloves with new ones.

, While you’re getting your nose pierced, try to stay as still as possible for your piercer. It is a small pinch just like any other piercing, and you’ll only feel it for a second.

, Titanium and surgical steel are good substitutes, but most piercers include the price of a surgical steel piece of jewellery in the price of the piercing. If you ask for gold, titanium, and niobium (niobium is the material least likely to irritate your skin) the piercer may add an additional cost.

, The needles that they use should be brand new and in sterilized sealed pouches. You should see them open the sealed packages. If you get into the room and the needles are already open, you are once again justified in asking for new ones.

, Your piercer should throw away the needles in a biohazard container after using them. They should also provide after-care instructions at this point.Most piercing salons will carry the cleaner that they are going to recommend to you.

"
"
Wash your hands.,
Use saline solution.,
Don’t play with the piercing.",How to Care for Your Nose Piercing3," You should be cleaning your piercing twice a day for the first three months. Before touching it, it is essential that you use antibacterial soap to wash your hands thoroughly. Skipping this step is often the cause of infection.

, A saline solution is a mixture of warm water and non-iodized sea salt. Your piercer can either sell you some from the studio, or he can tell you where to buy it. When you use it, it should be the temperature of a drinkable hot beverage. Place it in a microwaveable cup and heat it in 10 second increments. Once it is the correct temperature, take a sterile tissue and dip it into your solution with clean hands. Generously wipe down your piercing with the solution. The optimum time for your saline solution is right after you shower.
Do not reuse the same cup of solution.

, Throughout the day, resist the opportunity to play with your nose ring. Your hands are constantly covered in bacteria and this is a great way to get an infection. If you notice any build-up around the ring and you don’t have your cleaning solution with you, wash your hands and soak the piercing for a few seconds in warm distilled water until the build up easily comes away. Do not move the jewellery in and out, as this may cause hypertrophic scarring.

Know what’s normal.,
Watch for green and yellow.,
Look for a red raised bump.",How to Care for Your Nose Piercing4," Redness and swelling is natural. Also, it may notice some pain the following days. This is normal. Don’t worry about these, but make sure you continue cleaning your piercing properly.

, If the painful inflammation continues, watch for discharge from the piercing. If it the discharge is green or yellow and smelly in nature, seek medical attention. This combination could mean infection., This bump can occur within a few days or months after the piercing. Not all bumps are infected but if they’re red and resemble a pimple with pus inside, they likely are. Pus is not always a sign of infection, but get it checked with a doctor just in case. DO NOT remove the piercing if it is suspected to be infected, as this traps the infection and will likely have to be drained. Always ask your doctor before removing jewellery of an infected piercing. "
"
Use clean jewelry.,
Continue to clean regularly.,
Be careful with face make-up.",How to Care for Your Nose Piercing5," Three months after your piercing, it should be healed and you will be able to put a different nose-ring in. It is best to get jewellery that has been autoclaved (sterilised with a combination of gas and pressure) and sealed in a pouch. If it has been touched by other people before being inserted, put it in boiling water and wait for the water to cool before removing the jewellery and inserting it into your nose.

, Now that your piercing has healed, you don’t need to clean it twice a day. You can gradually work your way down to cleaning it a couple times a week. Instead of your saline solution, make sure you’re washing it in the shower. Do so with a face cloth (cleaned regularly) and antibacterial soap.

, When putting on face make-up try to avoid your piercing. The chemicals can build up in your piercing hole."

, Fill out the application to become an umpire. These applications can often be found on the Little League website, but you may also have to retrieve and fill out the physical copy in person. Your information will be reviewed and you will be contacted if selected.


Be prepared to fill out information related to your occupation, any umpire training you have received, whether you have children and they are playing on the team, and whether you have been refused by other youth programs in the past.Be forward with your personal information. Most Little Leagues perform background checks for volunteers.Have a few references you can supply on the application that can put in a good word for you.

, Pick up the gear you’ll need to do your job on the field. This includes a chest guard, face mask, shin guards, plate shoes, and comfortable underclothing.


Sporting goods stores carry much of the equipment you’ll need, sometimes bundling the items into one package.
Check with the league to see if they have any old equipment that you can use, or ask to see if you can borrow gear from any prior umpires that are not participating this year.

, There are a series of differences between Little League baseball and major league that can impact rulings and how the game is played. You need to understand the rules completely in order to be considered as an umpire.One example of a Little League specific rule to consider is: “When a ball goes under the fence, what happens?”
Another example: “If the ball hits a tree and the fielder catches it, is it a fair catch?” Parents and players will both want to know that these questions are handled correctly.

, Little League classes are available in many areas, and umpire specific classes are included. These classes go over the major differences between the major leagues and Little League, as well as advice for becoming a better umpire.


Local recreation departments often have classes, or can suggest where to find one.
Little League also hosts a national umpire school that aspiring umpires can sign up for online., The Little League umpire registry allows umpires to connect and communicate with one another. Signing up for the registry includes a copy of the official Little League Baseball rulebook, as well as access to the Umpire Registry site.


The registry can put you in contact with other umpires in the area who can help show you the ropes.
Updates to regulations or rules will be provided on the registry site, providing members with immediate access to the latest information., Plate umpires call the balls and strikes, as well as plays at the plate. The plate umpire must also return the ball to play after foul balls or a time out.


Keep a consistent strike zone. There are a few guidelines for what constitutes a strike, but whatever you choose, consistency is what is important to being a good umpire.
Keep an indicator to help keep track of balls, strikes and outs., Base umpire responsibilities are different than the plate umpire, and require you to watch the pitcher and runners on base. Once the ball has been hit, the umpire must move appropriately to avoid getting in the way of players, while still maintaining the ability to call a runner safe, or out.


Let plays complete before making your call. Calling a play too early can result in an incorrect call and anger players.
Make your gestures for runners crisp and visible to everyone in attendance.

, Loud and aggressive calls help alert the crowd and players to close calls, as well as indicate your knowledge of the rules. However, there is no need to be loud for obvious plays, such as wide, foul balls.Develop your own style! Many umpires add their own style to their strike calls. Some growl it, some make it sound more like ""Hike"" than ""Strike"". Be careful not to confuse players with your calls though.

, Own up to “blown” or incorrect calls with respect to everyone involved. If the coach says ""I'd like to appeal that call,"" grant his request if you know the call was questionable.


Speak with your partner umpire before conversing with the coach. You want to get a consensus on the call and whether it was truly incorrect., Ejecting coaches should be avoided and only used as a last resort. However, if the coach is making the game less enjoyable for players and the crowd, then it may be necessary to remove the coach. If the coach does not leave then his team may have to pay a price, such as forfeiture.


Explain the reasoning to your call calmly. Do not escalate the situation if you can help it.
Walk away from coaches who do not want to accept your call. Try to move on with the game!
Don’t say any more than you must. You are the umpire, and others must learn to respect that."

Keep playing until the correct number of innings is reached.",How to Play Baseball," You will need at least nine people to be able to field a team for defense. It is possible to play with fewer people, but you'll need to expand each player's coverage on the field. This may make it difficult for players to reach the ball after it's hit though, so get as close to nine as possible., The pitcher is the player who stands in the middle of the field and throws the ball to the batter. The catcher will be squatting just behind the batter at home plate to catch the ball if the batter doesn't hit it.Make sure the catcher wears protective gear, like a face mask, since the pitcher will be throwing balls hard and fast enough to injure them.

, The players in the infield (or the diamond) protect the bases. There should be a player stationed at first, second, and third base, and they will be referred to as ""basemen."" Make a fourth player the shortstop, which is a roving position that backs up the the basemen and helps catch balls in the infield., The three players in the outfield are the right fielder, center fielder, and left fielder. They're responsible for catching fly balls in the outfield and chasing down ground balls that make it past the infield., There are four bases (first, second, third, and home plate), which are “safe spots” for runners during the game. They’re canvas or rubber-covered bags set up in a square, though it’s more commonly referred to as a diamond.Bases are numbered counterclockwise from home plate: first, second, and third. Second base is on a direct line from home plate through the pitcher's mound.
Each base is approximately 90 feet (27.5 meters) away from the previous one.
The lines that connect the bases are made of dirt, so that runners may slide into bases, while the rest of the field is made of grass.

, The pitcher stands on a mound of dirt in the center on the diamond, approximately 60 feet (18 meters) from home plate. On the mound, place a small rubber plate, where the pitcher will throw from., A baseball that's hit and lands to the left of third base or the right of first base (as seen from home plate) is considered a “foul ball,” which invalidates the play. The foul lines extend from home plate out to the first and third bases, and then beyond into the outfield., The batter stands either on the left side of home plate or the right side, depending on which is their dominant hand. Paint a 4-foot by 6-foot (1.2 meters by 1.8 meters) box on both sides of home plate., Just behind home plate, paint a small box where the catcher and umpire (an impartial judge) will squat or stand and watch the ball after the pitcher throws it.

, A batter will approach home plate and stand to the side of it in one of the batter’s boxes, waiting for the pitcher to throw the ball. Batters may take practice swings until the pitcher is ready to begin.During offensive play, all players act as batters, taking turns trying to hit the ball.

, The batter must try to predict whether the ball will be hittable. They can decide whether to swing and attempt to hit the ball, or to not swing, and allow the catcher behind them to catch it. If a legal hit is not made, the umpire will make one of three calls – a strike, a ball, or a foul ball.A “strike” is an indication that the batter either could have swung at the ball and didn't, or swung at the ball and missed.
A “ball” happens when the pitcher pitches a ball that's too far outside the hitting area to be considered hittable by the batter. After four balls, the batter “walks,” which is a free advancement to first base. Batters will occasionally try to crowd the plate and earn a walk rather than hit the ball.
A “foul ball” is a ball that the batter hits which lands outside the foul lines. Usually a foul ball just counts as a strike; however, in most cases, players can't get more than two strikes as the result of hitting a foul ball. Additional foul balls aren't counted.

, While standing with your feet parallel and knees slightly bent, hold the bat upright at the base with two hands. Swiftly bring it forward in a fluid motion, and at the same time, shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot. Don’t forget to keep your eye on the ball to increase your chances of making contact., While the hit ball is moving across the field, either through the air or along the ground, the batter (who is now called the “runner”) drops the bat and runs as fast as possible towards first base. As long as the runner doesn't get an “out,” they can stop at first base, or keep going until it's no longer safe.A runner can be tagged out if a defensive player has possession of the ball and touches the runner.
A runner can also be out if the hit ball is caught by a defensive player before it touches the ground. This is called a flyout.
A runner can get a ground out if the hit ball touches the ground, but then a defensive player gets possession of it and touches first base before the runner can get there.

, In most instances, the runner won't be able to complete an entire circuit of the bases on a single play, so they must stop at a base and wait for the next batter to step up to the plate. However, at any time, the runner may attempt to “steal” the next base by running to it before the pitcher realizes what's happening.Since the pitcher is usually the best thrower on the team, stealing a base is very dangerous: the pitcher can turn and throw the ball to a baseman instead of the batter, allowing an easy tag out.

, Only one runner is allowed on each base at any time. When all three bases have a runner, the offensive team is said to have the “bases loaded,” meaning the next fair hit or walk will necessarily result in either a run or an out.

, Sometimes, the batter hits the ball so hard or so well that they are able to run around the entire diamond before getting an out, scoring a run on the first hit. This is called a “home run.” Most home runs are the result of the ball being hit past the fence at the back of the outfield, at which point it's completely out of play and all the fielding team can do is watch.A home run hit while the bases are loaded is called a “grand slam,” which is worth four points (one for each runner). While rare, grand slams can turn the tide of a difficult game or virtually guarantee victory.

, Home runs are fun, but not common enough to be relied upon as a means of winning the game. Instead, focus on learning how far to run after a normal hit. By knowing when to stop and wait, you can stay in play longer and raise your chances of scoring a point.

, While you’re the defense team, you will not be able to score any points.


The game has nine periods, called innings. They’re each comprised of two parts: a “top” and a “bottom.” When the offense of one team has received three outs, the game moves either to the bottom of the current inning or the top of the next one., The pitchers will stand on the pitcher’s mound and throw the ball toward the hitter, attempting to get an out. Pitchers often use fastballs, curveballs, changeups, and sliders to confound batters.The fastball is what it sounds like – very fast – as is the curveball.
A changeup involves the pitcher pretending to throw a fastball but actually throwing a much slower pitch, confusing the batter's sense of timing.

, Once the batter hits the ball, it will either fly through the air or it will roll along the ground. The defensive team, which is spread out across the infield and the outfield (the grass beyond the diamond), will attempt to catch the ball before it hits the ground. This automatically gives the batter an out and they can’t proceed to run the bases.If the ball hits the ground before anyone catches it, the defensive players must get to it quickly and pass it to any teammate close enough to tag a runner out.

, As long as they have the ball in hand, a defensive player can tag a runner as they are circling the bases, and the runner will then be out. Or a baseman (the person in charge of guarding a base) can catch a passed ball and step one foot on the plate in order to get an out for a runner who was approaching that base., When the field is set up just right, the fielders may be able to pull off a double play or even a triple play, in which they get two or three outs on a single play.Triple plays are rare, but possible if enough force outs are available.
Double plays are more common, and often involve forcing out a runner on first, and then grounding out the batter before they reach first.

, As opposed to basketball and many other team sports, baseball doesn't have a clock or timer, with the exception of little league games. Instead, the game is played until all the innings are completed. At the end of the last inning, whichever team scored the most runs wins.Because this can make games drag on for a long time, teams are allowed to have alternates, particularly extra pitchers (called relief pitchers) to keep play fresh from beginning to end.
If the teams are tied at the end of the last inning, an extra inning is played. It is very unusual for a baseball game to end in a tie; typically, extra innings are added until one team manages to scrape out an advantage.

Make sure your bat needs to be broken in.,
Use real leather softballs.,
Begin the process by hitting balls from a batting tee.,
Rotate the bat 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) between swings.,
Take 100 swings from a tee.,
Hit 50 short lobs.,
Hit 50 fast pitches.",How to Break in a Softball Bat," Fast pitch softball bats that are 100 percent alloy, or that have an alloy barrel, are good to go right away, with no break-in period needed. Composite bats, however, have carbon fibers that need to be loosened before the bat reaches optimum performance. The fibers can be loosened during just one break-in session that will take about an hour.


Many fast pitch players hesitate to use a new composite bat in the middle of season, thinking that the break-in process is too time consuming. However, breaking in a new bat shouldn't take more time than a routine practice session.
Don't be tempted to skip the process of breaking in your composite bat, since a fresh bat won't perform as well as one that's been broken in correctly.;
, It's important to use high quality, regulation-size softballs with leather skin and good stitching to break in your bat. If you're breaking it in at a batting cage, go to a cage that uses real balls instead of the rubber balls (which usually have developed pock marks). The pock-marked balls can damage your bat, hindering its ability to perform well.


Don't break in your bat during very cold weather. The softballs should be at least 60℉ (15℃). A cold ball can damage the bat before it is broken in properly.

, Breaking in a bat requires hitting a certain number of balls at half the maximum impact force before you move on to full-impact fast pitch hitting. The easiest way to bat at half-capacity is to bat off of a tee, rather than having someone pitch to you. If you don't already have a tee, buy one at a sporting goods store and keep it as part of your practice equipment.


The alternative to using a tee would be hitting half-speed pitches or slow pitches. This would break in the bat effectively, but it might not be great for your batting form. Hitting half-speed pitches, especially when they have an arc, can mess with your form and timing.

, Rotating the bat between swings will ensure that the entire barrel gets broken in. Many composite bats are marked around the diameter so you know exactly how much to turn the bat. It's important to rotate the bat during the entire breaking-in process so the bat won't get damaged or neglected in any one area., Using the correct form, hit about 100 balls from a tee. You'll be hitting the ball at about half of your normal power. These first 100 swings at half power will begin the work of gradually breaking in your bat.


To make the process go faster, have someone help you by setting up new balls on the tee before every swing.
You can take more than 100 swings if you desire. However, don't do less than 100, since the bat needs to be broken in gradually. Moving to a full-speed swing too quickly could damage the bat.

, Have someone lob pitches from a short distance, and aim to take about 50 swings this way. Hitting a short lob will require a slightly faster speed and harder contact, continuing the gradual process of breaking in the bat.


Short lobs are often used to help batters work on their form. Work with your coach or a friend to swing 50 times this way.
If no one is available to pitch short lobs, you can use a pitching machine. Adjust it to pitch slowly and without an arch so you don't have to change your form to make contact.

, To finish breaking in your bat, hit 50 regular fast pitches at full speed. You'll notice at first that your hits don't travel as far or as fast, but as you gradually break the bat in you'll be able hit at full capacity. Keep hitting fast pitches until you're comfortable with how your bat is performing.After 50 pitches, your bat should be broken in. However, if you're not quite willing to use it in a game, use it during batting practice a few times to make sure you're used to the way it hits.

Grip the ball between your thumb and middle finger.,
Keep your grip hidden.,
Wind up and throw the pitch.,
Snap the release.,
Practice.",How to Throw a Curveball1," Place your middle finger along the bottom seam of the baseball and your thumb along the back seam. Leave your index finger off the ball. Instead of using it to grip the ball, you'll be using it to point at where you want the ball to go.








Hold the baseball such that the curves of the seams are close to your palm, with one on top and one on the bottom of your palm.
For right-handed people, place your middle finger on the right seam on top, and your thumb on the left seam on bottom. Lefties should do the opposite.;
, If the hitter knows you're about to throw a curveball, they'll be prepared for the change in speed and drop. It's important to hide your pitch until you wind up to throw it. Make sure your glove is covering your hand gripping the ball, so no one on the other team will be able to see that you're gripping for a curveball.








The basic curveball grip is easy for experienced hitters to spot even during the windup. Practice hiding your grip so your curveballs are harder to read.

, Place your dominant foot on the rubber. Lift your opposite knee and rotate your hips forward as you throw the ball. Your elbow should be level with or above your arm, and bent at a 90-degree angle. Complete the first part of your curveball pitch as you would a fastball.








A basic, four seam fastball will have your middle and pointer fingers on top of the ball on the seam that runs left and right across the ball when the ball is facing you. Your thumb should be directly on the smooth leather of the bottom of the ball, in between the seams., Keep your palm facing inward towards your body, and release the ball as your arm extends and you step forward with the opposite foot. As your arm comes down from the throw, it should be headed toward the opposite hip.








Snap quickly from top to bottom, rather than moving your hand in an arc across your body.
When you release the ball, rotate your thumb up and your middle finger down, as though you were going to snap your thumb and middle finger together. The ball will move in the direction your middle finger is pointing.
You'll want to release the ball as close to your body as you can. This is called ""short arming,"" and will create more resistance between your middle finger and seam, increasing spin and curve., Master a basic curveball before you move on to more complicated forms. Remember, the spinning action of the throw is achieved by gripping the ball without pressure from the index finger and snapping as the ball is released. Keep this movement in mind as you throw.







"
"
Grip the ball between your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.,
Keep your hand position hidden.,
Wind up and throw.,
Release the ball with a snap.,
Try modifying your grip.",How to Throw a Curveball2," This is the classic curveball grip. Grip the ball with the bottom seam between your index and middle fingers, and place your thumb along the back seam. Hold the baseball such that the curves of the seams are close to your palm, with one on top front and one on bottom rear of the ball.








The ""front"" of the ball refers to the part that will be traveling away from you when thrown, while ""rear"" refers to the part of the ball facing you after the ball is thrown.
For right-handed people, place your middle finger on the right seam on top, and your thumb on the left seam on bottom. Lefties should do the opposite.
Use your index finger to point at the target. As with the basic curve, you should be using your index finger to point at where you wish to throw the ball. This time, though, it'll also be steadying your middle finger.

, Same as with most pitches, you'll want to make sure your grip isn't visible to the other team by hiding it behind your glove until you wind up to throw the pitch. Otherwise, the hitter will be warned that you're about to throw a curveball, and you aren't likely to get the results you want.








If you have difficulty hiding your pitch before the wind up, you may want to position your ball as deeply in your mitt as possible before taking your grip on the ball.

, Put dominant foot on the rubber, in a parallel position. Lift your opposite knee and rotate your hips forward as you throw the ball. Your elbow should be level with or above your arm, and bent at a 90-degree angle. This windup is exactly the same as that you'd use when throwing a fastball.







, Keep your palm facing inward toward your body, and release the ball as you step forward with the opposite foot. As your arm comes down from the throw, snap it toward the opposite hip.









As you release the ball, rotate your thumb upward and your middle finger downward, as though you were snapping your thumb and middle finger together., If you slightly change the positioning of your fingers, you can change the way the ball breaks, confusing the hitter even more. Regular curve balls are known as 11-5 throws because the ball breaks in the angle formed by the 11 and 5 numbers on a clock. Try these variations to make your throw break differently:









A 12-6 curve ball will break downward more sharply. Place your index and middle fingers between the seams, and your thumb on the bottom of the ball. Do an abbreviated snap as you throw, or release the ball as your hand passes your head instead of following the arm motion all the way through. To account for the sharp break, throw a 12-6 a bit higher than you would a normal curve ball.
A 10-4 curve ball will start up and close to the hitter, then break low and away. Start your grip as you would for a traditional curve ball then slide your index and middle fingers downward a bit, toward your thumb. Place the majority of the pressure on your middle finger, and turn your wrist outward from your body as you throw.

"
"
Grip the ball.,
Use your index knuckle to point at your target.,
Keep your grip hidden in your baseball glove.,
Wind up and throw.,
Snap the release.",How to Throw a Curveball3," The knuckle curveball is similar to other grips, but the variable this time will be your index finger. Grip the ball with your middle finger along the bottom seam, and your thumb along the back seam. Hold the baseball such that the curves of the seams are close to your palm, with one on top and one on the bottom of your palm. Bend your index finger inward before laying it on the ball so that your nail and top knuckle are resting on the ball and your middle knuckle is pointing at the target.









For right-handed people, place your middle finger on the right seam on top, and your thumb on the left seam on bottom. Lefties should do the opposite.
Getting comfortable with a knuckle curve ball grip can take practice. Acclimate yourself to how it feels by practicing the grip, without throwing, when you have downtime.
This kind of curveball is considered more advanced than other kinds. Don't be discouraged if it takes some time to master., As with the straight curve, your index finger will be both pointing to the target and steadying your middle finger, but has the added benefit of adding more torque through the bending of your knuckle.







, This is extra important with a knuckle curve ball, since your finger placement will make it obvious at a glance. Make sure the ball is deep in your glove before taking hold of it with the knuckle curveball grip.







, Your dominant foot should be on the rubber, in a parallel position. Lift your opposite knee and rotate your hips forward as you throw the ball. Your elbow should be level with or above your arm, and bent at a 90-degree angle, same as a normal fastball pitch.







, Keep your palm facing inward to your body, and release the ball as you step forward with the opposite foot. The ball should be out of your hand shortly after it passes your head. As your arm comes down from the throw, snap it toward the opposite hip. Twist your thumb upward and your middle finger downward to put a spin on the ball.

Build a strong foundation in statistical analysis.,
Develop a comprehensive understanding of baseball statistics.,
Apply statistical findings into data that clients will find useful.,
Explore avenues that can help you find a job as a baseball statistician.",How to Become a Baseball Statistician," By pursuing a practical, university-based education, aspiring baseball statisticians can develop a thorough understanding of complex statistical concepts and applications. Most degrees include intensive study of:


Probability and statistics.
Applied statistical methods.
Quantitative analysis.
Variance theory.
Time-series analysis.
Statistical computer analysis.;
, Most baseball statisticians cultivated their expertise beginning at an early age. Most understand how the game's statistics are compiled and how data is interrelated. Some of the fundamental concepts in baseball statistics include:


Official scoring: This is the cornerstone of all statistical analysis of the game. Judgments made by the official scorer in each game are binding. Certain decisions, like whether a batted ball is determined to be a base hit of a fielder's error, have an impact on the career numbers of the batter, fielder and pitcher involved in the play.
Simple statistics: Conventional statistics form the basis of all statistical analysis in the game today. Simple data, like at-bats, hits and strikeouts, are unambiguous. But some of the fundamental statistics are interrelated and together form important starting points for further analysis. For example, dividing the number of base hits into the number of official at-bats renders the player's batting average, one of the game's seminal figures.
Complex concepts: Pioneers in the statistical analysis of baseball have compared and combined certain conventional data to form groundbreaking methods of analyzing players. Sabermetrics concepts have slowly gained mainstream acceptance because of their powerful results. A leading Sabermetrics principle is OPS, which combines a player's on-base and slugging percentages into a single figure. This number purports to show the player's value to his team and has gained widespread acceptance as a potent statistic.

, Experts who produce baseball statistics can tailor their findings to their audience. Statisticians who work for media organizations and teams tend to present raw, in-depth findings. But analysts who work for agents often generate nuanced figures that help their clients land big contracts for players. In some cases, statisticians manipulate numbers or conjure statistics to highlight a player's value. Some examples include:


Analyzing players of similar ages: Statistician Marc Rubin helped the agent of Atlanta Braves star Chipper Jones land a big contract his client as he neared the end of his career. Rubin analyzed Jones' productivity and compared it to hall-of-famer Dave Winfield, who signed a lucrative deal at the end of his career. The analysis helped Jones ink a massive, 4-year extension.
Extrapolate performance outside tabulated data: Rubin helped Dan Wheeler, a pitcher, earn a $2.15 million contract despite carrying a record of 1 win and 9 losses and an earned run average over 5.00. By sifting through game data, Rubin discovered that Wheeler often entered games when his team was trailing. Most of the time, he would maintain the deficit, giving his team a chance to win. By expanding his conceptual thinking, Rubin uncovered a statistically significant abstraction that helped Wheeler during his salary-arbitration hearing.

, There is no such thing as a standard curriculum to becoming a successful baseball statistician, but 2 pioneers of modern baseball statistics cut similar paths toward achieving notoriety in the field.


Devise a new method of baseball statistical analysis. When Steve Mann developed the ""run productivity average"" in the 1970s, the formula's effectiveness in gauging player value was irrefutable. Houston Astros general manager Tal Smith was so impressed by the power of the technique that he hired Mann as the team statistician in 1979.
Promote yourself. Sabermetrics guru Bill James developed several potent statistical applications before he achieved mainstream success. James tirelessly wrote about his techniques, eventually self-publishing the bulk of his work. Mann got his start in Houston by self-marketing: He wrote a letter to Smith. You don't have to take such an expensive or brazen approach to promote your work. Start a personal blog on baseball statistics. Write about your statistical analysis and methods you've developed to effectively evaluate talent.
Approach minor-league teams. Armed with an intriguing, singular analytical approach, contact a local minor-league affiliate and sell your technique. The pay probably will be minimal, but you'll be gaining a profile inside a Major League organization that could lead to a role with the big league club.

Position your fingers along the seams.,
Tuck your thumb under the ball.,
Squeeze the ball.,
Release the ball.,
Practice to gain control.,
Know what the batter sees.",How to Grip a Sinker Pitch," Turn the ball so that your forefinger and middle finger are position along the seams where they're closest together. Your fingers should lay directly on top of the seams, parallel to each other. Tuck your ring finger and pinky finger back.


Try an alternate grip. Instead of positioning your fingers over the seams where they are closest together, move your fingers up and position them over the horseshoe. This positioning is slightly more comfortable for some pitchers.;
, Your thumb grips the ball from the opposite side, on the smooth part of the ball where there isn't a seam. You should grip the ball with the side of your thumb so it won't slip out of your hand., The tips of your fingers should be slightly inside the seams against the smooth part of the ball just next to them, to give you a firmer grip. Your thumb should be tight against the bottom of the ball, pushing it against your fingers., Your middle finger should be aimed right at the batter when you release. As you follow through, your thumb will push slightly inward. This is the same release as a four-seam fastball, and the opposite of the release you'd use for a curveball., The sinker pitch is a little more difficult to control than the four-seam fastball. Releasing from a two-seam grip gives the ball more movement than it would otherwise have. The grip is also a little looser than a standard fast pitch grip.


For this reason, it's important to practice the sinker pitch until you understand the nuances of the pitch before you use it during a game.

, The sinker pitch is easier to keep your eye on because it looks like a perfect double seam coming toward the plate. Unlike a curveball, it's not tricky to keep your eye on the ball, and batters often make contact with a sinker pitch. However, since it drops slightly in, the batter often grounds out instead of making solid contact."

, Players don't like to sit in a dusty or bug infested dugout. Sweep after every half inning, arrange bats where they can easily be reached, and keep equipment clean. You can even re-paint the dugout if you want to!

, Since most bat boys are not old enough to buy chewing tobacco, sunflower seeds or gum is the best alternative.

, Don't be mopey and sad all the time, be glad that you get to travel with the team and see all the games! Players don't like their bat boys to be mad or sad at them all of the time.

Do drills with a buddy.",How to Do a Toe Touch Jump," Well, technically, you start with your hands clasped in front of your chest. But that's not very active, so let's go straight to the high V or your hands above your head. You have to start up top so you can swing down and build up momentum.


High schools will start in a high V, whereas All-Stars tend to start with their hands clasped above them, arms up straight slightly in front of their heads.;
, If first position was your arms up in a high V or vertical clasp, second position is your knees slightly bent, weight coming onto the balls of your feet, and your hands in fists down in front of your knees ready to swing up. We will refer to this as ""athletic"" position from here on out.


If you're moving from a high V to this position, make sure to swing your arms in and down, not out and down. If you're moving from a vertical clasp, just swing your arms straight down.

, Let's cover the arms of the actual jump first. As you come out of athletic position, your arms should move to a firm ""T,"" a ""T"" with sharpness. They should form a 90 degree angle with your neck and head. Not lower and not higher.


Some tend to lower their T so their legs look like they're going higher. But your legs won't end up looking higher – your form will just look sloppy.
When you hit your T, snap to it. A good cheerleader or toe touch-er has energy behind even the smallest of movements, from head to toe.

, To give yourself that natural explosion upward, make sure you're jumping off the balls of your feet. This will also help you keep your toes pointed, which leads to a more elongated-looking jump. Get your legs out from underneath you as quickly as possible, bursting them out to your sides.









To get them high in the air, roll your hips back, exposing your inner thighs. Imagine someone grabbing the top of your legs moving them counterclockwise an hour or so – that's rolling them back. As for dropping them down, that'll get your feet slightly higher than your hips, which is ideal.

, From the top of your toe touch, snap everything back to the ground, resuming athletic position. That means you'll land aiming to bring your feet close together, legs slightly bent, hands down in front of you and arms straight. Stay in athletic position for a second and then stand up straight. That's it.









To get down the latter half of the jump, you may want to work with a resistance band around your ankles. This will force your legs down quicker and get the rapid movement into your muscle memory.

, Find a high object in front of you, just above your normal eye level. That is your goal to jump to. Think to yourself that you're going to jump in line with this object.


Before you get into the jump (starting with the next step) and when you're ready, count off 5-6-7-8. The prep starts on 1.

, Your arms should be bent at the elbows, held to your chest. Hold this same position on 2.


Your arms should look almost as if they're in prayer position, but your head should remain level and your hands should be clasped together halfway between a clap and a fist.

, Or you can put your arms above you, while still in a clasp (again, this is All-Star protocol). Hold this position on 4 as well. Every step works in twos.









Again, make this sharp. You should shoot up into a high V or high clasp. Count 4 shouldn't involve movement unless you're working on super speedy drills.

, Do not swing out – swing in and down. You want your arms to lightly cross if you're coming from a high V.









Remember: athletic position is with your arms in front of your knees, legs slightly bent, the balls of your feet ready to jump, and your head looking out straight in front of you.
Make sure your legs stay together with the balls of your feet firm on the ground. If you pre-jump before your toe-touch, your landing will be sloppy because you did not have enough balance during your prep.)
On 6, start your jump, finishing the swing. You want the swing of your arms to be one constant motion to keep up your speed. Your arms will finish in a T and your legs will be lifting into the air.

, Remember: a toe touch is not you literally touching your toes. Your arms should be in a T motion and both of your legs should be in a straddle, or splits, in the air. Use your diaphragm to lift your legs up and sit into the stretch.








Snap your legs back down on 8, hitting athletic position briefly before coming back up into a natural stance.
Try to do several in a row. The more you work up your endurance, the better your toe touches will become.

, You must always warm up and stretch your legs before jumping to prevent injury. Do a light jog, some jumping jacks, and push ups to get your blood flowing. This will prep your muscles to stretch to their maximum potential.









There are several stretches you can do to prepare for a toe touch. We'll discuss those in the next steps. Just remember to never overextend yourself – you'll find yourself unable to stretch the next day.

, To do this stretch, start in a straddle position on the ground. Get your legs out to your sides on the same plane as your core as much as possible. Hold this position and put your arms in a T. This is what you should look like in the air. Hold this for 10-20 seconds. Relax and then repeat. Soon this position will become effortless.









A ""T"" is where your arms are directly out to your sides, so that your body sort of looks like a ""T"" shape. Generally, your hands will be in fists whenever you're in this position.

, These can be very difficult, but once you perfect this stretch you can easily perfect most any jump. To do this one, stand with knees shoulder-width apart and hit a T. Bend your knees until you are in a squat (you should be able to feel the stretch already). Kick your right leg up as high as you can without moving from your T or your squat. The rest of your body should be completely still while you kick. Do the same for the left leg.









Try your best to keep your back straight. During the jump, you'll have to have your back straight or your jump will be hunched over. Practice makes habit, after all.

, If your hip flexors aren't developed, it'll be hard to raise your legs high into the air. Grab a seat on the ground in an open area. Here's how to do this stretch:









Get into toe touch position, like in the first stretch listed above.
With your back straight, spread your legs out in front of you as wide as possible. The more they are off to your sides, the better.
Place your hands by your knees. The weight should be in your hands; if it's further back, that's cheating!Point your toes and lift your legs 4 or 5 inches (10-13 cm) off the ground.
Work in quick cycles, lifting and lowering, lifting and lowering. Do this 10 times, take a break, and repeat 10 more.

, A way to get higher toe touches is to use the wall as resistance. To get started, find a wall (wide enough for your legs to spread out on) and then lay down on your back (facing the wall). Next place your legs against the wall, pushing your butt up against the wall as far as it'll go. At this point, your body is in an ""L"" shape. After that, slowly open your legs until you start to feel a stretch. Stretch them as far as you can.


As the days go by, gradually your legs should go lower and lower and it'll start to look like you're doing the splits on the wall. Do this each day for about 5 minutes.

, Sometimes part of the obstacle of the toe touch is mental. After all, if our legs are spread way out up in the air and we have a split second to get them back down – eesh. But having a buddy give you a boost gives you that extra second, which means peace of mind. Here's how it works:









Have a friend stand behind you with their hands on your waist. Go through the motions of the right technique (discussed above) – but as you jump, your partner should help lift you off the ground, keeping their hands on your waist the entire time. This will give you an extra split-second in the air, which could mean extra inches to your jump.
Or you could work with two partners. Sit on the ground in a toe touch position. Have one partner behind you keeping your back straight and your hands up in the air and one partner lifting your legs up and pressing them back. Have them hold this position until you can't hold it any longer.

Before you attempt to do a standing full, you should have complete mastery of a standing back handspring and a standing tuck.Some other moves that are helpful to be proficient in before attempting a standing full are a high standing back tuck, a layout full twist (in a tumbling line), and a standing Arabian.These prerequisite moves will get you accustomed to the height, speed, and timing needed to successfully execute a clean standing full.;
, Stand with your arms raised above your head. You can stand on your tiptoes, but most importantly, your weight should be on the balls of your feet.Some people find it helpful to start with a high set and then take a step back, brining their arms down with their step., Coming from the high set, swing your arms vertically from over your head, down to your sides, and back past your body.As your swing your arms down, bend your knees so you are almost in a sitting position. Your knees should be bent at approximately 130°.


Swinging your arms back behind you from over your head provides momentum for height in your jump. Your bent knees are also preparing for your jump.

, With your arms pulled back behind you and your knees bent, swing your arms back up above your head, while straightening your knees to jump.


When lifting off of your jump, it’s important to remember to get in the air before you start trying to pull your arms and tuck your legs to get the twist.If you pull your arms and tuck your legs too soon, you will turn too early, and won’t get enough height in your jump to land the standing full.
As your lift your arms and jump off the ground, try to arch your back a bit. This will help lead into the backflip aspect of the standing full., Once in the air, tuck your arm (on whatever side your are twisting to) down so your elbow is near your hip. Bring your other arm across your body in front of your chest, to wrap around to your turning side.For example, if you are turning to the right for your standing full, tuck your right arm down so your elbow is near your hip, and pull your left arm across your body, in front of your chest. While off the ground in your jump, look over your shoulder to whatever side you are twisting to.That doesn’t mean throw your head back. Instead, simply look to the side following the momentum of the twist to spot the ground where you will land.To complete the twist, it helps if you pull your opposite knee (to whichever side you are turning) over your body to give more turning momentum to your twist.If you’re turning to the right, you would pull your left knee over your body to the right. If you’re turning to the left, you would pull your right knee over to your left side.
All of these tucks, twists, and pulls can be executed on both sides of the body. It just depends on what side you want to twist to when you perform the standing full.

, While in the air spinning, be sure that you keep your head tucked down, flex your abdominal muscles for a tight core, and consider bringing your legs in, as if in the fetal position.A tight core with your head tucked and legs brought in will provide a solid center of gravity and help keep your standing full controlled., As you are coming down from the twisted jump, land with both feet on the ground at the same time.Do not land on your heels. Rather, try to land on the balls of your feet. It may help to extend your arms out in front of you as land, for more balance.


As you practice this, aim to land facing the same direction as you started. If you can land facing your same starting direction, you have corrected executed a standing full."

Stretch when you're finished.",How to Do a Scorpion in Cheerleading," Before you attempt a scorpion or any other cheerleading skill, you should stretch your body to prevent injuries or torn muscles. You should focus on stretching your legs, back, and arms, since those are the parts of your body that will be most useful during this skill. Here are some stretches to try:









Stretch your legs. Stretch both your legs by doing a side split and a regular split. Focus on stretching your standing leg during the split by reaching forward to touch the toes of the lead leg when you're doing the split with that leg in front.
Do a table scorpion. Find a table that is the same height as your hips. Face away from the table and place the leg you will pull up into a scorpion straight on the table behind you, in the split position. Bend the knee of this leg, and pull your foot way up as if you were doing a real scorpion.
Stretch your back. Do a bridge or a backbend to stretch the muscles in your back. Then stand up and lean forward to touch your toes to stretch different parts of your back.
Stretch your arms. Stretch your wrists by pushing one hand away from your body while flexing back the fingers of that hand with your other hand.
Stretch your shoulders and neck. Stretch your shoulders by rolling them forward and backward, and stretch your neck by rolling your head clockwise and then counter-clockwise.;
, Put your arms at your sides and look straight ahead. Bend the knee of the leg that you will use as your back leg. Typically, your standing leg will be your dominant leg, so this leg will not be your dominant leg. Make sure that you're standing on a comfortable surface that isn't too hard.









If you're doing a scorpion for the first time, you should try this move with a spotter, which should ideally be either one of your teammates or your coach.
You can also start by placing the hand that is on the same half of your body as your standing leg on a dresser or a higher surface for stability. If your standing leg is your right leg, then you should hold on to a surface with your right hand.

, If your back leg is your left leg, grab it with your left hand. You can do this by twisting your hand and arm outwards and then behind you so that the back of your hand is facing your thigh.









Your palm should be facing the inside of your foot.
Your back should be slightly flexed backward, with your chest open.
Your standing leg should be firmly locked so you don't buckle.
Your free hand should be at your side or on your hip for balance.

, Push hard with your back foot. Do not use your hands to pull your leg up. Your hands should guide the direction of your leg and should keep it in position. Your leg muscles should push your leg much higher.









Keep your thumb under the sole of the upturned foot. Start pushing your leg up and pull up with your hand.
Your hand should start moving up at least a foot.

, Once your foot is about as high as your ear, turn your elbow outwards, so that it is pointing forward, in front of your head.








, Remember to keep your standing leg locked as you do this, or you will buckle. Push your leg as high as it can go while firmly gripping it with your arm.









Remember to push your leg up, not back. Pushing your leg up will make it easier for you to grab it with your other hand. If you push your leg back too much, it will be hard to reach it with your other hand.
Start lifting your other hand to get ready to grab your back leg.

, Reach as far back behind you as you can with your other hand and grab the raised leg behind you.









If you're having trouble reaching the leg, you can start by grabbing the wrist of the hand that's holding your foot.
Alternately, you can reach your other hand in front of your face to grab your back leg, and then pull it over your head so it goes in the same position as the other hand.

, If you feel comfortable in the scorpion, you can push hard with your back leg into a high scorpion.









Don't bend your head forward or backward. Keep your gaze straight ahead.
Once you're more comfortable with the scorpion, you can tilt your head, neck, and back slightly back, so your face is tilted toward the ceiling, or even so that your face is under your hands and leg and is looking up at the heel or pads of your foot.

, As you master the position, pay close attention all the aspects of your pose, such as where your free hand is, and whether your toes are pointed.









You can learn more about your own pose by practicing a scorpion by looking in the mirror, or having a coach or friend film you doing a scorpion.
You can also improve your pose by asking your coach or teammates for pointers.

, After you finish your scorpion or scorpion practice for the day, you should stretch your back in the opposite direction.









Lie on the ground with your chest facing up. Tuck yourself into a little ball and rock back and forth on your back.
Stand up and bend down to touch your toes.

Bails are the grooves that connect the stumps, and wickets are rectangular wooden structures made up of these stumps.there are 6 stumps on a pitch 3 on one side and three on other side. there are 11 players in both the teams. 3 umpires are selected in match where 2 umpires are at the ground and 1 is at out of the ground


Look at pictures of the equipment online.
Watch professionals play cricket online or on sports channels on TV—you will see the equipment they are using.
Recognize where the equipment is used on the field: the bats and balls are in the players’ hands, but the wickets and stumps are out on the field.

, This is the easiest way to get really familiar with the components of cricket. Go to a local sports store and ask if they have cricket equipment. Look at the balls, bats, stumps, and wickets. Try handling them.

, The field is rectangular, and on both sides of the field are the pitches.The pitch is outlined with white lines. The pitch is a rectangle where the batsmen stands.


The wickets are in the pitch. The batsmen stand in front of these.
The two pitches are facing each other; the batsmen runs in between these when he bats.
Boundaries are the edges of the field.

, Just reading about the layout of a field can be confusing. Looking at a labelled diagram of a field can help you understand it. You can even try copying the diagram by hand to help you familiarize yourself with it. Knowing the parts of the field is essential to understanding the game and the rules.the fielders can stand on silly point, gully, mid off, mid on, third man, fine leg, slip, mid wicket, long off, long, cover, short cover, forward short leg, backward short leg or leg slip etc.

, You can attend a cricket game if you live near a field; if not, there are many online videos of games and it is a popular sport in many countries so is broadcast on television. Watch a few, and look at the marks on and layout of the field. See if you can name the different parts, such as the pitch and wicket.

, The team that is batting sends two players to bat at a time, and these are called batsman.They wear protective gear and carry cricket bats. Each batsman wants to score as many runs as possible by hitting boundaries, which are like home runs.


One type of boundary is awarded four runs. This is when the batsman hits the ball past the boundary line.
The other type of boundary is awarded six runs. This is when the batsman hits the ball past the boundary line without the ball bouncing.

, On the field are the eleven fielding players. One is a bowler who stands behind a wicket, away from the pitch; one is a wicket-keeper who is behind another wicket. These two players have special ball-catching equipment on.


The other 9 players have no special equipment.
The other 9 players are stand in various locations around the field.
Their collective goal is to stop the batsman from scoring runs.

, The innings in cricket organize where players are and what they are doing. When a team is batting, it is their inning.The players switch roles when an inning is over.

, Cricket involves two teams of eleven players each.Teams bat in successive innings and try to score runs; the opposing team is in the field and trying to end to the batting team's innings. After the two teams has batted one or two innings the team with the most runs wins. The basic concept of cricket is as simple as that!

, A coin toss decides which team bats or fields first. The two batsmen in the middle of the pitch need to make runs by hitting the ball, and the bowler will try to strike them out. The batsmen take turns hitting the ball and running to the opposite wicket, trying to ensure they get their run before the fielder throws the ball back.


If the fielder, bowler, or wicket keeper throws the ball directly at the batsman’s stumps and the bail falls off before the batsman is home, he is out.
If a fielder, bowler, or wicket keeper catches the batsman’s hit, he is out.
If a batsman is out another batsman replaces him.
Once a team has lost ten wickets the innings is finished.

, If a player is batting, they should run between the wickets until the fielders have their ball; in cricket, a batsmen can score multiple runs per shot. If a player is in the field, they should pay attention to the bowler and batsmen so they will be ready to catch the ball when and if it comes at them. When a fielder catches a ball, they must throw it back to the bowler.

, For example, a player can’t pitch the ball from an undesignated area, bounce the ball when pitching, or pitch the ball at a batsmen.These are all actions that go against the rules of cricket. There are many other things a player cannot do, such as:


Touching the ball when batting.
Hitting the ball twice when batting.
Batsmen need to be paying attention while batting, or they are out.

Watch the ball.,
Begin the downswing of the bat.,
Point your toes and lean into the ball as you hit it.,
Uncoil your wrists.,
Extend your arms.,
Hit the ball.",How to Time a Cricket Stroke," Maintaining a relaxed body, positive energy, and a focused mind between balls can significantly improve your timing when you step up to hit. Take deep breaths and release the tension in your shoulders while you await the next ball.Let go of the fear of getting out and visualize yourself making a successful hit. Rest your bat between bowls and stay focused on the present.Find a routine that works best for you. Perhaps chatting with the umpire relaxes you and takes your mind off the expectations placed upon you.
Turn your concentration off between balls and when not on strike. No-one can concentrate for two hours non stop.;
, Routines can help get you into the correct mindset. When you step up to the crease, utter a phrase to yourself. “Keep your eye on the ball” is a common mantra. Other players complete a routine before assuming their stance in the crease, the place from which you will bat.This routine may include kicking the bat with your feet or adjusting your clothes. Mantras and routines don’t need to make sense to anyone but you. This may seem silly, but a consistent routine can help put you in the right mindset to hit the ball.Often routines and mantras are picked up during your youth.

, A high level of mental focus is required when trying to time your hit perfectly. As you prepare for the bowl, keep your mind free from distractions. Forget past failures and try not to conjure up potential future failures. Focus on the present. Remain calm, relaxed and aware of your body., Placing your weight on the balls of your feet prepares you to move quickly. Flexing your knees will transfer your weight from your heels to the balls of your feet. Avoid locking your knees or straightening your legs., Your outside eye--left eye if you are a lefty and right eye if you are a righty--should remain level with your inside eye. This will allow you to clearly see the ball leave the bowler’s hands with both eyes. It also will ensure that the rest of your body remains open and squared to the ball--your shoulders will stay level and your hips will remain opened.

, Before you can raise your bat high like the professionals, you need to master your stance. Only raise your bat to a level that allows you to keep your knees bent, your eyes level, and your body open. Having great posture at the crease will improve your timing more than looking like a professional., This encourages you to play straight. You should aim to “rock the baby' with your elbows as you drive the ball, rather than slogging across the line.

, While the bowler runs at you, keep both eyes focused on the ball. Zoning in on the ball will allow you to better judge the ball’s speed.Focus your eye on a seam of the ball.

, Your should complete the downswing slowly. A slow, steady downswing allows you to watch the ball longer. It will prevent you from playing the ball too early, thus enabling you to accelerate the bat through the ball as you hit it.


Sloggers swing hard and early, meaning they hit the ball too early and too slowly, spooning catches in the air.

, With your knees bent and the weight on the balls of your feet, point your toes in the direction that you would like to hit the ball. You may choose to point your toe at the bowler as the batsmen of the “Golden Age” did. When your bat connects to the ball, transfer your body weight into the ball.

, As the ball hits the bat, and not before, uncoil your wrists. This will add additional punch to the ball. This does not mean hitting everything to leg, you can throw your wrists to the off side as if you're playing a hockey shot.

, When cutting or hooking the ball, make sure your arms are fully extended. A cramped shot leads to a catch.

, You will hit the majority of balls along the ground. Of course, if you are trying to drive straight for a six, or score a run, you will hit the ball in the air and hope it goes over the boundary."

, Your fingers should form a narrow V, with your forefinger slightly to the top left of the seam and your middle finger on the other side of the seam. Your thumb should complete your grip, being directly in line with the path of the seam.The majority of your tension on the ball should be from your thumb and forefinger, with your middle finger used to balance the ball.

, Do not bowl yet; this is practice! Using only your wrist, toss your ball with the intention of keeping the seam as steady as possible. Repeat this practice until your seam is consistently straight and the motion is natural.

, Lying on the ground, hold your ball in the V-grip position. In a controlled fashion, imitating how you would bowl on the pitch, toss your ball into the air. Try to keep the seam of the ball straight


Try to control the position of your wrist; a straight wrist that is kept behind the ball will help maintain the form you need for consistent seam bowling., Many coaches encourage side on bowling, as this facilitates many bowling actions. A bowler is considered to have a side on position when his or her back foot, chest, and hips are lined up toward to the batsman at back foot contact.While practicing in this position, start bowling at a slow to moderate pace, with your main goal being keeping the seam of your ball as straight as possible.

, Chest on bowling requires the bowler to align his hips and chest towards the batsman upon back foot contact.Even if this isn't your (or your coach's) preferred approach to a swing, practicing your seam ball in a variety of ways will likely give you a better kinesthetic understanding of the seam ball motion.

, For a faster swing, you will want a more narrow grip between your forefinger and middle finger, with little space between these fingers and the seam of the ball. More space between your fore and middle finger will translate to a slower ball., Seam bowling is a subcategory of fast bowling and capitalizes on the imperfections of a cricket ball to generate bounce, making the pitch more difficult to hit. Professional bowlers attain speeds up to 90 miles per hour.If you are just starting out learning seam bowling, aim for a moderate-paced pitch and focus on technique. Once you are confident in your seam technique, you can add more power to increase speed.

, Shift your grip on the seam in such a way that your middle finger takes primary position on the seam while your forefinger moves farther off to the side.When you bowl in this way it causes spin, which will make the ball ""swing in"" toward the batsman.

, Hold the seam with your forefinger laid mainly in line with and on top of the seam. Your middle finger should be off to the side of the ball, away from the seam.When you bowl in this way, the left side of the ball will spin away from the batsman.

, Though clean form and consistency will help you achieve results, there will be differences in body type and style that might necessitate you hold the ball in a fashion unique to yourself. Don't be afraid to modify your style when trying to find your ideal stance.

Take a 20-30 over-old ball that is still shiny.,
Hold the ball along the seam, with the shiny side towards leg side and the rough side towards the slips.








,
Flex your wrist along with the cricket ball such that the shining side is about 30 degrees downwards.








,
Bowl with your hands angled.,
Make sure that in the follow-through, your bowling hand goes between your body and the stumps (on either side of your body.)",How to Reverse Swing a Cricket Ball," Such a ball is usually better through the air on the side of shine because of natural sedatives put on it to shine, whereas the other side has gone through wear and tear without any repairs. This weight difference is what bowlers take advantage of.









Shine the ball a lot and make the other side (the rough side) as rough as possible. To test if the ball is ready for a reverse swing, just throw the ball with straight seam to a fielder and if the ball swings towards the shining surface, then it's ready to dance the batsman out.;
,,, The angle between your head and bowling hand at shoulder should be about 50-60 degrees. Bowl with your hand, holding it as much away from your head as possible.

Do a high reach for that bar, and pull your core into a hollowed position.,
Pull your legs to you arms.,
Land.,
Add the twist.",How to Do a Roundoff Layout," A standing tuck will not help you in learning a layout because you can't do a standing layout without piking.
, Your roundoff tuck should be extremely long. Not because your tuck is long but because your roundoff is reaching. If you are 4 feet in height, your roundoff should be at least 5' in length. This will maximize power that will go into the layout., Make sure your legs come down in a hollow position and land slightly behind you., Position your arms so they reach for the bar above your head. Try spotting the wall you came from when you set., Just like the tuck, you want to make sure your roundoff is powerful because that's where your power comes from. And the bigger the block from your shoulder the more power you'll have.,

Make sure you are still spotting the wall.

,

Do not put your arms by your sides. Grab the bar that's way up there and hold on as you pull your stomach to you hands using your core.

, Then hold this form (which is why you get maximum height with the roundoff). As you are holding this form, you should be looking at your toes. Make sure you don't pike your legs down., When you see the ground where your feet will land and not a moment before or after, your arms will got out to sides to form a T like position with your body. Make sure you bend legs on landing., Now you have learned a layout, the only thing you need to do to twist is instead of arms on each side; put both arms to one side and look at them."

Decide whether to take an attacking shot or defend the stumps.,
Move forward or back.,
Keep your eyes on the ball.,
Avoid being called out.,
Hit the ball with the bat with precise placement, timing, and strength to avoid the fielders on the field.",How to Play Various Shots in Cricket1," The factors that could play into your decision might be anything from how fast or well the ball is bowled, to the length and rules of the match being played. Shorter matches usually make for more attacking shots as batsman have less opportunity to score runs. Longer test matches that can go for up to five days tend result in more defensive plays.;
, Front foot shots are most often used to play a ball that is delivered between ankle and thigh height. Back foot shots are better for balls that are between the thigh and head. Once you identify the height which the ball will likely arrive, you can shift your weight to the front or back leg to play the corresponding shots.

, Watching the progress of the ball is important, as it will help you to determine when and where to hit it.

, There are several ways to be called out in cricket. When batting keep these rules in mind in determining how aggressive to be with your shots.


Prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.
Avoid being hit in the legs by the ball in front of the wicket. This may result in the batsman being out by leg before wicket.
Avoid giving catches to any fielders on the field.
Avoid edging the ball to the wicket-keeper.

, It takes a great deal of skill and practice to be a great batsman. Be patient and wait for the right shot to play.








"
"
Play a forward defensive shot.,
Play a straight drive.,
Play a sweep shot.,
Play a front foot leg glance.",How to Play Various Shots in Cricket2," Not every shot in cricket can be a scoring shot. When a ball is well bowled, use a forward defensive shot to avoid being called out. Having a solid defense is a crucial part of being a good batsman.









Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Take a step with the front foot while keeping the back leg straight.Swing the bat downward and contact the ball as it passes below the eyes. Keep the bat angled so the face is toward the ground.
The bat should end up slightly ahead of your front leg and close the side of the pad. Do not follow through. Keep the heel of your back foot off the ground and hold the position to have the best chance to block the ball.

, This shot is usually played when a full delivery on middle or off stump. It is one of the most common shots and usually the first one learned by cricket players. Depending on the direction the ball travels, this shot can be referred to as a cover drive, off drive, straight drive, on drive, or square drive.








Lean forward and step with your front foot. Bend your front knee. This will give you a solid base for the shot.
Your head should ahead or level with the front knee and your back foot should be up on the toe during the swing.
Swing the bat straight and contact the ball when it is below the eyes. Keep your wrists relaxed and the bat angled to keep the drive low.
Follow through should continue on a straight path so that the bat face is toward the sky.

, This shot is great to use against spinners. When you see a low-bouncing ball on the legside, go to the sweep shot.









Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Stride with your front foot so the pad is in the path of the ball. Drop your back knee to the ground.
Lift the bat to a high backswing then bring the bat down and across the body. Strike the ball in front of the pad. Roll your wrists slightly when you make contact to angle the ball downward.
Follow through. Bring your hands around after striking the ball so they end up near your front shoulder with the bat held high in the air.

, This shot relies of the speed of the bowled ball as opposed to the power of the hitter. A front foot leg glance is best used to play balls delivered off to the leg side.









Lean forward with your head and front shoulder. Shift your weight to your front leg.
Bring the bat straight through. Angle the bat face slightly toward your front leg during the stroke. Make contact in front of the front leg pad.
Flick your top wrist to glance the shot downward. This shot relies on control and precision to deflect the ball as opposed to a powerful swing.

The follow through can be performed one of two ways.",How to Play Various Shots in Cricket3," When facing a fast bowler a back foot defense shot is an important element to avoid being called out. If a shot is on the stump but short of good length, this shot is a solid way to play it safe.









Step back towards the wickets with your back foot. Keep your back leg inside the line of the ball. Keep your head forward and your back foot flat on the ground.
Move your front foot toward the back leg with your front foot pointed at the bowler.
Keeping the arms in a high position, swing the bat straight down. Angle the bat toward the ground and strike the ball when it is below the eyes.

, The trick to mastering this shot is all in the wrists. Use it to play balls that are delivered short or full on the leg side.









Quickly move both legs back toward the stumps. Keep your back leg in line with the ball. Angle your body to face toward the bowler.
Swing the bad straight through. Turn the face slightly toward your leg side and strike the ball in front of the body.
Roll your top wrist over to control the ball and angle it toward the ground. The top hand grip can remain loose or tight depending on how fine or square the batter wants the ball to be., This powerful shot can help score lots of runs. Select this shot on short deliveries that are outside of the stump.









Step backwards and across the stump with the back foot. Begin your backswing by turning your front shoulder while bringing the bat back.
Swing the bat down and across the body. Get your arms fully extended to generate maximum power. Roll your hands slightly to angle the ball downwards.
Continue the

, This shot is similar to a back foot defensive. Play this shot in to a short delivery to score runs.









Bring your front foot back as you begin your backswing.Keep your weight slightly on your front leg. And keep the bat in line with the delivery of the ball.
Keep the bat straight as you begin your swing. Use your top hand to control the swing and provide the power by pushing through with your bottom hand.
Follow through bringing your hands high above your front shoulder.

, The steps for these shots are identical, but a pull shot address balls delivered to the short side around the waist level, while a hook shot addresses balls delivered to the short side between chest and head height. These shots are somewhat risky as they pose the chance of being caught out. It requires great footwork and excellent hand-eye coordination.









Step back and across with your back foot. This will open up your chest slightly toward the bowler.
Move your front leg back and out toward the leg side. Bring your body around while keeping your eyes on the ball.
Swing the bat across the body at a slight downward angle. Keep your arms full extended and roll the wrists on contact to help keep the ball down.

, You can lift the front leg and shift your weight to pivot on the back leg. Or you can turn both your legs to follow through the path of the ball.

Hitting a reverse sweep.,
Try a switch hit shot.",How to Play Various Shots in Cricket4," This is usually played against overpitched deliveries.









Stand on a balanced back foot. Place the front foot up to the toes (padded portion) vertical or upright.
Hold the bat horizontally close to the pitch by the phase of the bat in an opposite manner.
Move the bat to the offside so that the ball is struck the instant it touches the ground.

, This shot was made famous by Kevin Pietersen in 2008.In this shot, a batsman changes his handedness and posture to adopt a stance the mirror image of his traditional handedness while the bowler is running in to bowl. As a fielding team cannot change the placing of fielders while the bowler is in his run-up, the fielding side is effectively wrong-footed with the fielders out of position. This shot's legality was confirmed by the ICC in 2008.The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other handedness and is more likely to make a mistake in the execution of his shot.

, You must know how to judge the bowler. A spinner can change the variations of his ball even at the last moment before delivery. You should be able to judge the spin and variations the ball will take after bouncing.

, Playing a Sweep Shot needs a lot of practice. It is hard to hit if you are a beginner.


Make sure to practice daily for as much as an hour. Remember, the more you practice; the better the shot is.

, Make sure not to be much on front foot as it may result in a stump out.

, Make sure not to overbend, so that you can return to the original position if you are unable to transmit

, This is the right time to judge the bounce and spin of the ball. Once you get an idea of the ball, you will be able to transmit the shot better.


It is possible that bowler had observed your footwork and would not allow you to play your shot. In such a situation, he would try to bowl short ball at a higher speed on which you would be beaten.
If you see such response from the bowler, immediately come on back foot by re-bending your knees to the original position and defense the ball.

When it’s your turn to field, ensure that all the players are in the correct fielding positions.,
Restrict the rival team’s total.,
Win the match.",How to Play Indoor Cricket1," Any multipurpose sports hall with sufficient space can be used for this. An indoor cricket court must ideally measure 30 metres × 12 metres. Tight netting, about 4.5 metres high, should completely enclose the playing arena, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The pitch is the central strip between the wickets and should be 22 yards (20.12 m) long, just as in conventional cricket. Note that the non-strikers crease (or running crease) is only 11 metres from the striker’s crease. This basically means that the batsman only needs to run halfway down the pitch for a run. All other creases are in the regular position.;
,


In conventional cricket, the stumps are stuck in the ground. As this won’t be possible indoors, you need to place a set of plastic spring-back stumps at each end of the pitch. These stumps will immediately spring back to the standing position when knocked over.
For bowling, a modified cricket ball, with a softer centre is used. Unlike the red or white ball used in the traditional format, a yellow ball must be used in indoor cricket so that it is clearly visible indoors against varied backgrounds. For an amateur match, you could just use a tennis ball.
For batting, traditional outdoor cricket bats and specialised indoor cricket bats that are lighter are both acceptable. The gloves may also be lightweight cotton with no protective padding on the outside. Team uniforms and additional protective gear (like elbow guards) can also be worn.

, The 2 teams in indoor cricket generally consist of 8 players each. Everyone gets to bowl 2 overs and bat in a partnership for 4 overs. Thus, there will be 16 overs in one innings. If you want a faster game, or have lesser players, each side can be reduced to 6 players and each innings will last for 12 overs instead of 16. If there are 8 players in each team, the ball will be bowled 8 times in an over. In six-a-side matches, the usual rule of 6 balls per over is followed.

, Just like in outdoor cricket, one team will bat first and the other team will field. In the second innings, the roles will be reversed. If your side is batting first, the goal is to score as many runs as possible. In indoor cricket, there are two ways to score- physical runs and bonus runs. For physical runs, both batsmen must complete a run from one crease to the other, that is, from the striker’s crease to the non-striker’s crease (or vice versa). As mentioned before, the batsman only needs to run halfway down the pitch and not the whole length. Bonus runs can be scored when the ball hits a net and vary, depending on which part of the net you hit.


Hitting the ball in Zone A (the front net, i.e., the net behind the wicket keeper) won’t get you any bonus runs.
If the ball hits the net in Zone B (side nets between the striker's end and halfway down the pitch), you get 1 bonus run.
If the ball hits the net in Zone C (side nets between the bowler’s end and halfway), you score 2 bonus runs.
Hitting the ball in Zone D (the back net, i.e., the net behind the bowler) allows you to score 4 or 6 bonus runs depending on how the ball hits the back net. If the ball hits the net after bouncing, you get 4 bonus runs. If the ball hits the net without bouncing on the ground, you score 6 bonus runs.
If the ball hits Zone B or C onto Zone D, you score 3 bonus runs.
Remember that at least one physical run must be taken for any bonus runs to be scored. Whatever bonus runs you get will be added to the physical runs. For example, if you strike the ball into the front net for 1 bonus run and take 2 physical runs, you score a total of 3 runs off the ball.

, The indoor cricket court is divided into the front court and the backcourt and it is compulsory that 4 players of the fielding team are present in each half of the court when the ball is bowled. Keep in mind that the wicket keeper is included in the front court fielders and the bowler is included in the backcourt fielders.

, One effective way of doing this is to dismiss the opposing batsmen as quickly as possible. Dismissals take place in the same way as they do in conventional cricket, with a few differences.


Unlike conventional cricket, the batsman continues to bat after getting dismissed in indoor cricket. Each pair of batsmen will bat for 4 overs, no matter how many times you dismiss them. However, 5 run will be deducted from the batting team’s total for each dismissal. If the player is dismissed, the physical or bonus runs that might have been awarded on that ball won’t be counted.
The batsman is declared out if he/she strikes the ball and a fielder catches it before it touches the ground, just like in outdoor cricket. In addition to this, a player can also be dismissed if the ball is caught after rebounding off a net, as long as it has not previously touched the ground (except when a “six” is hit).
The batsman can also be dismissed through the method of Mankad, which is much less common in outdoor cricket. This happens when the bowler completes the bowling action without actually releasing the ball and breaks the stumps at the bowling ending without letting go. If the non-striker is out of the crease, he/she is declared out.
Leg before wicket (lbw) is a valid form of dismissal in indoor cricket but is does not occur as often as it does in outdoor cricket.

, Both innings last for a full 16 overs (or 12 in six-a-side matches) and the team which has the higher score after both innings have been played is the winner of the match. If the totals are tied, the skin system can be followed. In this system, the batting partnerships from each innings are compared against one another and the higher of the two is declared the winner of the ‘skin’. If the third batting pair (5th player and 6th player) of your team scores, say 20, and the third batting pair of the other team scores 15, then your team wins the skin. The team that wins the most skins out of the four skins available will be declared the winner if the totals are tied.

Know the mechanics of a good throw.,
Grip the ball with four fingers on the laces.,
Place the inside of your back foot towards the target.,
Step straight towards your target with your front foot.,
Point your glove towards your target.,
Bring the ball back behind your head with your elbow at shoulder height.,
Point your palm behind you.,
Bring the ball rapidly up and over the shoulder.,
Release the ball by snapping your fingers and wrist downward.,
Pull your glove back towards your body.,
Continue your throwing motion across your chest.,
Carry your momentum forward.,
Practice each part separately to learn good mechanics.,
Bring it all together.",How to Throw a Softball1," Fast and accurate throwing is essential for every softball player, but the exact motions of a good throw may seem foreign to someone just starting to learn the game. Good throwers throw with a lot of backspin, which helps the ball fly farther, use their whole body instead of just their arm to get power, and align their legs and shoulders with the target for accuracy.


Make sure you throw with your dominant hand. This is whatever hand feels the most comfortable.
Always practice with a glove in your opposite hand -- this is how you will have to throw in a game.;
, Turn the ball so that the laces form a ""C,"" then place your four fingers along the top lace. Your thumb should comfortably rest on another lace along the side of the softball.


The laces provide a surface to grip onto, and you will ""pull"" on the laces as you throw to give the ball backspin (the top of the ball spins back towards the bottom), which helps the throw's speed and stability.

, Your back foot is the foot on the same side as your throwing arm. You want the instep, or inside, of your foot to face your target so that your toes point diagonally to the right (right-handed throwers) or left (left-handed throwers) of your target.


To be precise, point your toes roughly 45 degrees away from the spot you throw towards.

, You should be able to draw a straight line from your back instep through your front foot and to your target. In other words, you will be perpendicular to your target.


You should point your front toes however you feel comfortable. Usually this is sideways.

, This insures accuracy, but it also opens up your shoulders to allow a more natural throwing motion.


As you get more experienced, you may begin pointing your glove elbow, not the glove, towards your target. This makes your throwing motion more compact and efficient., Your arm should form an ""L"" shape with the ball held high. Dropping the elbow is the most common mistake many young softball players make when throwing, so pay close attention to your arm position.

, With your arm high in the air behind you, point your palm and the ball up and behind you. This will allow you to snap your wrist with more power later in the throw.

, This is your throwing motion, and you will feel your arm extending as you ""whip"" past your head. Remember to keep your elbow near shoulder-height as you begin your throw. The ball will be at the highest point of your arm.


Try to keep your elbow loose and relaxed -- don't try to keep the ""L"" shape as you throw.

, As the ball passes you head, throw the ball by simultaneously letting go of the ball and ""pulling"" the laces of the ball down to create backspin.


You can test your backspin by placing black electrical tape perpendicular to the laces of the ball. If you release the ball properly, you should see a solid black ""line"" of the tape as the ball spins., Though not necessary when you are first learning, practice pulling your glove back towards your chest as you begin your throw -- it gives you more room for a powerful follow-through. Bend your arm towards your chest at the elbow, then pull your elbow back towards your ribs.

, Once the ball is released, let your arm keep swinging down and across your body, ending with your hand near your opposite thigh. Your fingers and wrist should be down from spinning the ball.

, As you throw, you will feel your body weight shifting to your front foot. Don't resist it, and feel free to pick you your back foot to keep your balance as you lean forward after the throw.

, If you decide to try everything at once, every time, you are bound to pick up bad habits. Instead, break the throw down into smaller parts and practice these before bringing it all together:



Grip: Toss the ball up and catch it in your glove. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball and turn it in your hands to quickly place all four fingers on the laces. Repeat.

Feet: Pick 3-4 different targets in the distance. Toss the ball up to yourself. As soon as you catch it, grab the ball, turn, and set you feet up towards one of the targets, cocking your arm back like you are about to throw. Stop here and note your foot position -- are you in a straight line towards your chosen target?

Wrist Flick: Hold your arm in front of your body with the ball high and your elbow at shoulder height. Practice throwing the ball with just your upper arm, snapping down from the elbow and pulling back the laces with your fingers and wrist. Your goal is to practice good, consistent backspin.

, You should work on throwing with a good, fluid arc. Your final throwing motion should be consistent, smooth, and comfortable.


Grip the ball along the laces.
As you bring the ball out of your glove, align your feet with the target.
Cock you arm backwards at a 90 degree angle while pointing your glove at the target.
Rapidly swing the ball past your head and release.
Snap your fingers and wrist down and towards your target.
Follow through by bringing your weight and arm forward and down.

Obtain the requisite equipment.,
Understand the basics.,
Bowl well as the fielding team.,
Score for your team.",How to Play Indoor Cricket2," The cricket bats, team uniforms and protective equipment are similar to the ones used in outdoor cricket. Just as in conventional cricket, a hard ball and a full length pitch (22 yards) is used. If necessary, a mat may be rolled out on the floor of the arena to replicate the playing conditions of an outdoor pitch. Since the game is indoors, collapsible spring-loaded stumps are used instead of regular stumps. Any sports hall of suitable size or similar shaped indoor room can serve as the playing arena.

, The side which is batting must score runs by hitting the ball while the fielding side attempts to restrict the total score and dismiss the player. Both sides get a chance to bat. The team that has the higher score at the end of the match wins. These basic rules are the same in both indoor and outdoor cricket.

, All six players in the team don’t have to bowl. There can be a maximum of ten overs of six balls in an innings. Every over takes place from the same end of the pitch which is the central strip between the wickets. One bowler can bowl a maximum of three overs. In addition to conventional methods of dismissal, a batsman can be declared out if the ball, bouncing directly off the side wall (but not touching the floor or roof), is caught.

, The rules of indoor cricket are almost identical to outdoor cricket. However, there are a few exceptions to this, most notably the means of scoring.


If you strike the ball and it straightaway hits the back wall (“boundary wall”) behind the bowler without touching the floor or any part of the wall or roof, you will score six runs. If it touches the floor but not any other wall or the roof, you get four runs.
If the ball is struck to hit one or more of the side walls, one run will be awarded, even if the ball subsequently hits the boundary wall.
If you strike the ball in such a way that it directly hits the roof, it would be immediately declared a dead ball. This means that there will be no dismissal and no runs scored on that delivery. The ball won’t be re-bowled. However, if the ball hits the roof after it hits a wall, it’s still in play.
When the batsmen complete a run physically, that is, run from one crease to the other, two runs will be scored. These two runs can be scored on top of a run for hitting a side wall but are not counted when a boundary (six or four) is hit.
After reaching a personal total of twenty-five runs, the batsman must retire. However, if the rest of the team is dismissed before ten overs are completed, the batsman is allowed to return. If five wickets are lost within ten overs, the last player will continue batting and the fifth player who was out will remain as a runner.

Start with your feet shoulder length apart and facing the catcher.,
Grip the ball with four fingers along the laces.,
Step with your opposite foot towards the catcher.,
Extend both arms in front of your body.,
Bring your throwing arm high above your head.,
Swing your throwing arm down behind your body and around to your waist.,
Simultaneously, drop your glove hand down.,
Release the ball just past your waist.,
As you release, flick your fingers back towards your palm.,
Follow through by bringing your arm to chest height.,
Troubleshoot your pitches.,
Practice the full motion after you have the parts down.,
Practice finding a smooth delivery.",How to Throw a Softball2," Hold the ball in your glove near your chest.

, Turn the ball so that the laces form a ""C,"" then place your four fingers along the top lace. Your thumb should comfortably rest along the side of the softball.


In order to properly grip the laces, use the tips of your fingers to hold the ball so that there is a little bit of space between the ball and your fingers.

, This is the foot opposite your throwing arm, and you want it placed directly towards your catcher. Most often, where you place your feet will indicate where you throw the ball, so work on making a ""power line"" that extends from your back foot, through your front foot, and straight to the catcher.


Your feet should be pointing anywhere between 90 and 45 degrees to the side, away from the batter.

, The ball and the glove arms will be separate, but both should be extended and pointing at the catcher.

, Keeping your arm straight, bring your throwing arm up so that the ball is towards the sky.

, Your arm should be relaxed and slightly bent at the elbow the entire time. Think of your arm as the hand of a clock and your shoulder is the center of it.


This is called the ""arm whip,"" because your arm should be loose and relaxed, letting momentum carry your arm quickly through it's arc and towards your waist., As you arm swings backwards, start dripping your glove back to your side. When you time both arms correctly you open up your shoulders so they face towards your target, allowing better accuracy.

, Practice to find the exact location that works for you -- release too early and the ball will hit the dirt, too late and it will go too high.

, Your palm is facing upward and your fingers will rapidly snap back into your hand as you let go of the ball. Think of the motion you make when trying to hide something in your palm. Your fingers come back as if someone was trying to take a quarter out of your hand., After you release the ball, you want to end with your arm up and pointing directly at your target.

, There are a lot of things that can ""go wrong"" while pitching, but the most common ones involve balance and improper posture. Some things to look out for include:


Keeping the ball over your toes. You want your arm's entire arc to stay perpendicular to your body, so avoid letting your hand stray out and away from your torso. If the ball is over your toes the entire time you will keep the ball straight and throw more strikes.
Forgetting your fingers. The snap at the end of the throw is crucial to keeping the ball stable at high speeds, so if your pitches are wild or wobble in the air, focus on following through properly.
Landing your front foot. As you start throwing, don't forget that proper foot placement is key to accuracy. Make sure that every time you step forward you are landing towards the target.

, Do not try to start throwing pitches right out of the gate. Practice every part slowly and separately to get good habits. For example, make your step forward and bring your arm up, then stop and check your position -- are you in line with the catcher? Next, bring your arm around and snap your fingers -- did you get good backspin? You are not looking for good pitches yet, just good consistent motions.


You can test your backspin by placing black electrical tape perpendicular to the laces of the ball. You should see a solid black ""line"" of the tape as the ball spins., The best pitchers put all of these parts together quickly and smoothly, without pauses or jerky, awkward motions.


Push off of your back foot.
Plant your front foot towards the catcher.
Begin rotating your extended arm clockwise over your head.
Drop your glove arm as you arm passes your head
Release the ball by your waist.
Snap your fingers back into your palm as the ball exits your hand.
Follow through to your chest.

Throw a change-up by following through without snapping your fingers.,
Throw a drop pitch by gripping the ball along the laces.,
Throw a curveball by rotating your wrist as you release.,
Throw a ""rise ball"" with a special grip and release.",How to Throw a Softball3," The change-up is a slower pitch that throws batters off-guard when expecting another fast-ball. Hold the ball completely in your palm, letting your each finger rest on the laces, and skip the finger snap when following through, instead leaving your hand open.


This is often the first special pitch you should learn after the fastball.

, The aim of the pitch is to make the ball sink on the batter. Grip the ball with your fingers aligned with the laces, instead of across them like you would on a fastball. Keeping your elbow a little more rigid than normal, flick your wrist and follow through like as if you were throwing a basic pitch.

, You need the same grip as a drop pitch -- fingers aligned with the laces, not across. Curveballs move down and sideways, making them tricky for a batter to track and hit. Your throwing motion is nearly the exact same as a fastball, but you twist your wrist (counter-clockwise for righties, clockwise for lefties) as you release the ball. This causes the ball to spin sideways as it travels., The hardest pitch to throw, this ball will come up towards the batter, making it incredibly hard to hit. The goal is a pitch that has top-spin so that the bottom of the ball rotates towards the top. To throw it:


Put your middle and ring finger in between the laces, at the point where they start to come towards each other.
Dig the tip of your index finger into the side of the ball.
Begin your normal fastball motion, but keep your palm facing down as you come around behind your back.
As you release, quickly turn your hand so that your palm faces up, as if you were turning a doorknob.
Release the ball early so that it has time to rise.
Remember that this is the hardest pitch to throw, and may take upwards of a year to perfect."

Be aware of your surroundings at all times.,
Talk to the base coach.,
Take a lead.,
Notice the backstop.,
Watch the person at the base ahead of you.,
!,
Try to take a ""rocking lead"".",How to Steal a Base (Softball),";
, The coach on first or third will help you. They will tell you to steal, or to stay. Sometimes they might instruct you with more complicated orders, but the make sure you know the steal sign that your team created. If you don't have a steal sign, listen to the base coach or just trust your instincts.

, When the pitcher releases the softball, take two or three large steps. Be prepared to quickly run back just in case the catcher feels she can catch you off base with a quick throw. Make sure not to run before the pitcher releases the ball, though, or the umpire will call you out.

, The backstop is the fence behind the catcher. The bigger the backstop, the easier it will be for you to steal.

, If there are people on base ahead of you, make sure that they steal before you follow. Otherwise, you would have to go all the way back to the base you started at

, If there is nobody ahead of you that is base running, you may steal at your own will.

, Put your either foot on the outside corner of the base and your other foot behind the base. As the pitcher rocks back, you rock back. When she rocks forward into her windup, you rock forward. This will help you get a push off of the base and a head start to the next base. Putting your hands in front of you and 'fake' the windup to know when to go.

"
"
As you step into the box, make sure that your feet are shoulder width apart or possibly more if that feels more comfortable and with a slight bend in the knees.,
Next, make sure your shoulders are squared towards the plate and turn your head so that your eyes are on the pitcher.

,
Your grip on the bat should be not too tight, but not too loose with your back hand on top of your front hand.,
The lower body is the next part to work on and that contains three main parts.,
The next part of the lower body is the heel plant which is how you land after the toe tap or step.,
The last part of the lower body is where all the power in the swing comes from, which is the pivot.,
As you put the arms and legs together that creates the swing.,
Follow through.",How to Swing Correctly in Softball," This is called your stance. Also be sure that you can reach the outside pitches from where you are standing in the box. To check that, you can extend the bat out in front of you across the plate to make sure that the barrel reaches the other side of the plate.;
,, Your door knocking knuckles should also be lined up with each other. In your stance, the hands should be above your back shoulder a couple inches to where it feels comfortable and the bat can be parallel to the ground.

, The first is the step or the toe tap. That is the first movement made with the front foot. As a pitcher is getting ready to release the ball the step should happen so that you are not moving as you are swinging. The toe tap or step allows you to change the weight from the front foot to the back foot so that you have more power.

, It is to make sure that you are balanced before you make your swing.

, The movement of the pivot is when the heel has planted and the hips rotate forward giving you power as the back foot pivots, which is also called “squishing the bug.” The front leg should then be locked creating resistance from the twist of the hips transferring the weight to the bent back leg.

, One thing to make sure of as you throw your hands through the zone is to lead with your front elbow and aim for the middle of the ball. Throwing your hands through the zone is a term that means extending them fully to get all of your power behind the ball. If you drop your hands hitting the bottom side, it will pop the ball up. If you get too on top of the ball, you will hit a little grounder that may not be very hard. You have to extend your arms through the zone and use your legs for power to hit solid line drives. To check your arms in mid swing, they should be parallel with your belly button and fully extended.

, It is very important to finish your swings to give off the full amount of power that you have. So after you have made contact, your wrists should roll over and create the follow through.

Have a signal for bunting.,
Have a code for stealing.,
Have a signal for a change up.,
Make sure there's a repeat sign.,
Have a cancel sign.",How to Use Codes in Softball," This should be something like running your hand across the belt area, and tell the team the code. For instance, the 'b' in 'belt' could be used to remember the 'b' in 'bunt'. You could also use other signals for a bunt.;
, It could be something like tapping your sleeve, 's' for 'steal'. Since there are two types of stealing, (after the pitcher throws, or once the catcher catches it), you should have two signals to differentiate between the two. For example, tapping the sleeve once could be for the steal off the pitcher, and twice for off the catcher.

, If you just scream to your pitcher, ""do a change up!"", the batter will be well prepared. Instead, use something like tapping your cheek, 'c' for 'change'. This will make it easy to understand.

, Just in case the player doesn't see your signal, have a repeat sign for them. Make sure the entire team knows this sign just in case.

, This is for the coach. This would be used if a sudden change in the game makes you change your mind about stealing. For instance, if the runner on third was planning on stealing home, and then two outs were made, you may want to cancel the play.

Find the ""C"" grip.,
Have your fingers grip slightly above the ""C"" and try to hold the ball in the palm of your hand.

,
For your release, everything in your pitching motion remains the same, just the release is different from a fastball.,
Make sure your wind-up is the same speed during your change up as it is during your fastball.",How to Throw a Change Up in Fast Pitch Softball," The ""C"" grip is the part of the softball in which the seams create a C shape.;
,, After coming around in your circle motion, you want to release the ball with your arm straight and with your ""C"" turned on it's side. Let go of the ball no higher than your belly button.

, This way, coaches and players won't know what pitch you're trying to throw.

Stand with 1 foot (0.3 m) on the pitcher's plate in the center of the infield.,
Hold the softball in your dominate hand by gripping it with 4 fingers across the stitching and your thumb holding onto the bottom.,
Swing your arm in a backward motion and rotate your hand for an underhanded throw with your hand toward the ground.,
Practice with a catcher to work on your aim.,
Learn the various pitching techniques for slow pitch.",How to Slow Pitch," The pitcher's plate is a rectangular piece of white plastic embedded in the ground. It is 50 feet (15.24 m) from home plate, where the batter will hit from. Your foot must stay in contact with the pitcher's plate at all times through a pitch, but you are allowed to move your other leg forward and back as needed to gain momentum for the pitch.;
, You must have the ball and glove touch before each pitch, per basic softball regulations. Usually this happens when you touch the ball into the glove at your waist right before you step into the pitching form.

, Bring your arm back no higher than shoulder height, then swing your arm forward, aiming your hand at home plate. Release the ball when your hand gets even with your thigh. The ball must arc into the air between 6 feet (1.83 m) to 12 feet (3.68 m) otherwise it will be deemed an illegal pitch.

, The goal is to have the softball pass through a space near the batter known as the strike zone. This invisible area coordinates with home plate and extends upward to the space between the batter's knees and shoulders. The ball must pass through the strike zone to be considered a strike in the case that the batter misses hitting the ball.

, The key is not the amount of pitches you know but the accuracy in which you throw them. These pitches include the curve ball and knuckle ball.


Throwing a curve ball is the same technique as throwing a standard slow pitch, but when your hand is moving forward turn your wrist toward you so that when the ball is released it will have a spin to it.
For a knuckle ball, dig 4 fingers into the stitching so your knuckles are sticking up. Throw like a traditional pitch, but do not extend your arm all the way back. Keep your wrist stiff so there is no spin and push off with your fingers when you release it. This is a difficult pitch to master, but if done correctly, it will look faster to the batter and they will swing before the ball actually passes the plate, resulting in a strike.

Lacrosse face offs could be considered a game of paper, rock, scissors.,
Clamp beats the rake.,
Rake beats the top.,
Top beats the clamp.,
The last important thing to do in lacrosse face offs is using your body.",How to Win Lacrosse Face Offs," It's kind of a game of chance, unless your hands are fast enough. If you have fast hands, it doesn't matter what move the other player uses, you will win.;
, The clamp is the most basic move in lacrosse face offs. You simply push the head of your stick forward on top of the ball. The clamp will beat the rake if both face off midfielders are about evenly matched in their reaction time.

, Raking the ball in a face off means using the part of the head that is touching the ground to ""rake"" the ball out in front of you. If the other player tries to top you, you can rake the ball right under their stick.

, Topping the ball means bringing the head of your stick over the top of the ball and scooping the ball backwards behind you. The top will beat the clamp because your stick moving over the top of the ball will push the other player's stick out of the way.

, After you push the ball wherever you want it, you want to use your body to make sure the other face off player can't get it, and if they do get it, they will have to foul you in order to. For example, if you rake the ball behind you, spin your legs around so that the other player is behind you and the ball is in front of you. Or if you push the ball in front of you, swing your leg around the other player to ""box"" them out of the range of the ball.

, Lift your stick backwards to about a point where the tip of your stick is about the same height of your shoulder. Don't raise your stick too high or all your strength will be invested in the lifting instead of the shot.


Imagine a nail going through the ball and your stick is the hammer, wherever you hit the ball is where the nail sticks into it. And where your imaginary nail sticks out (the other end) is the direction the ball will travel in.

, Once you create contact with the ice, begin follow through and point to your target in one swinging motion.


While swinging, be sure to hit the ice before the puck and not the puck itself. (It doesn't matter how hard a shooter you are. If you hit the puck itself, you will ultimately fail).

Train your body for strength.",How to Shoot a Lacrosse Ball," The bottom hand acts as a fulcrum, or pivot point, for the leverage of the stick. Your hand should be wrapped around the stick with your thumb near your body and your knuckles outward.


It’s possible to become very versatile at lacrosse and give yourself the option of shooting with either hand. If you learn to shoot with your non-dominant hand, you can make shots from either side of the goal more easily.;
, The power for your shot comes from this hand. Your palm should be on the stick such that it faces toward the opposite hand as you push. This hand should be 10–12 inches (25.4–30.5 cm) from your bottom hand.Having your hand too low on the stick will reduce the amount of control you have. Leaving it too high on the stick will reduce the amount of power you have.
This hand positioning is only used for shooting, so don’t move your hand into this position until you know that you are going to shoot.

, Your legs lead your shot, so this step is important. As you approach the goal, take a powerful, lengthened step with the leg opposite your dominant hand. Both of your legs should be slightly bent, but the front leg will be bent a little more.You may do this directly after you dodge around a player. If you have just been running, you may want to slow down as you move into your shooting stance.
Your step should carry you forward and you should plant your foot hard into the ground.

, You won’t always have this option, especially if you are shooting on the run, but the basic technique requires your body to be square. This starts with squaring your hips to the goal.

, Lift both of your elbows so that the pocket, or net, of the stick goes slightly over your dominant shoulder. This is the start of the shooting motion. The farther back you wind up, the more power you can achieve.


You don’t want to overextend yourself on this part, so crank back just to the point where you feel tension in your shoulders.

, Thrust your upper hand forward and pull the bottom of the stick back. Bring the head of the stick downward. The goal is to snap your wrist quickly. The power comes a little more from your wrists than from your shoulders.


Get comfortable with performing a nice full crank back and swinging straight through the arc into a complete follow through.

, Your shot’s power is a combination of your leg placement, your wrists snapping quickly forward, and your torso twisting through the motion. Your dominant shoulder comes forward while your non-dominant shoulder goes backward. You’ll feel this twist through your abdominal area. Keep your hips forward.

, Just like golf, tennis, and baseball, the follow through after a shot is important in lacrosse. Once the ball leaves the pocket of the stick, let the stick continue with the momentum it has. When you finish, the pocket of the stick should be pointing down at the ground near your forward foot.


After the shot, move your top hand back up toward the middle or top of the stick to get ready for the next play.
The complete arc of your shot should move the pocket in a diagonal line from the top of your dominant side to the bottom of your non-dominant side.

, There are a lot of great ways to practice your shot which isolate different parts of the technique. Sitting down takes your leg placement out of the equation and focuses all of your attention on using your upper body to swing through the shot.This drill is best done in fairly close range to the goal as you will be able to achieve less power from this position.
Focus on twisting your torso and bringing your arms through the full range of motion.

, This is a great drill for beginners and it allows you to get the motion down without worrying about ball placement and aiming perfectly. Practice a few dozen reps without a ball to gain muscle memory for the shot.The great thing about this drill is that is can be done anywhere since you don’t need a ball and goal. You can practice in your bedroom, the garage, or out in your yard.
The main disadvantage to this drill is that you can’t practice aiming or gauge your power as well as you can with a ball.
This drill is called shadow shooting.

, While it is good to shoot from directly in front of the goal to get your technique down, most of your shots during games will not be so easy. It’s important to practice shooting from the left and right of the goal, as well as down low and high over your head.


During practice, do specific drills that force you to shoot in these ways. Do a set of shots that are only sidearm.
Do a round of drills where you aim specifically for the top corners or bottom corners.

, Lacrosse is a highly physical game, so being in great shape and keeping up your strength is always important. You should run daily, both endurance and sprinting. Doing push ups, pull-ups, and plenty of core training to build your muscles is highly recommended.If you are on a lacrosse team, or are thinking about joining one, talk to the coach to find out what exercises they suggest you do outside of practice.

,, Your dominant hand should be on top.

, This will help the ball slide easily into the stick's pocket.

, Slide it in at about a  170 degree angle, so the stick doesn't slam into the grass and stop moving.

, The ball should roll down and into the bottom of the pocket.

, Keep practicing so your skills improve and stay sharp.

Be a role player and stick to it.,
Know your limitations.

Keep your cool.,
Don't hit balls where...


You stroke the ball without authority
You have difficulty positioning the ball consistently
You must telegraph where you are hitting (unless of course this is where you hit best).

,
Never sacrifice the pure fundamentals of hitting (hitting line drives, being selective, and hitting where you hit best) just to become a place hitter.,
Keep your philosophy basically conservative.,
Observe the other team.,
Remember that as long as the ball is in the outfield nothing can be done to prevent runners from advancing.,
Keep the umpire on your side.,
Observe the umpires and how they seem to make decisions.,
Have good attendance.,
Be dedicated.,
Have players who have been with the team the longest always start.,
Have a good coach.",How to Play Slow Pitch Softball As a Team,";
,, Find out what kind of pitches you like to hit, where you hit best, and learn to do it well. Being aggressive is important, but not so important that you end up swinging at pitches that you're not good at hitting. Don't be afraid to take a pitch. If being selective ultimately means a higher batting average, then striking out 1 or 2 times is surely acceptable. An out is an out (see section on ""good out and bad outs""). It is very possible that your batting average may be poor due to swinging at too many pitches. Your hitting concept should be designed in a way that will maximize benefits to the team. Your hitting concept should be long run-oriented and should not be changing from game to game. A .650 hitter with 0 home runs may be just as good, or better, than a .500 hitter with 20 home runs.

, How many guys do you know that get mad when they are walked? They mumble things like ""pitcher's chicken"" and ""afraid to pitch me, huh?"". A walk is, most of the time, as good as a hit. That a walk lacks merit is almost never said. If the pitcher walks you intentionally, often you earned it somehow during or prior to the game (it's called ""respect""). If he walks you unintentionally then you still earned it. The team philosophy concerning hitting states to ""hit pitches you are good at hitting"" which are basically strikes. By neglecting to accept a walk by swinging at pitches outside the strike zone is contrary to the team philosophy.

,, Conquer the former, then proceed with the latter.

, This is mostly dependent on the ability of the defensive team. Let's take extra bases when we can, yet there is no reason we should not have faith that our own players will bat us in (if they are doing their job). Softball is a hitter's game. If the team is hitting well, we should not have any problems running conservative bases. Aggressiveness on the base paths should be inversely related to how good the team is hitting. EX: you won't see any of the best teams playing the game today stretching many doubles into triples. When we make base running mistakes we take the bat out of our hitter's hands. Let's let the other team make the mistakes.

, Who has a strong arm? Who has an accurate arm? How well does the other team's cutoff system seem to be working? How long is it taking them to get the ball in from the outfield? These are just some of the questions a good base coach will be attempting to answer as the game progresses (as well as the rest of the team, you never know when you will be base coaching).

, The quicker a ball returns to the infield, the sooner we can prevent such advancement.


The best pitchers are those who can throw a strike when they need to. An effective pitcher is often one who throws many balls, but has few walks (it's called ""challenging the hitters""). On the other hand, a pitcher who has no walks may be suspect of throwing too many strikes. This may suggest he is not challenging the hitters. Allowable limits for walks: 0 to 2 walks per game and walks with no one on base. Inappropriate limits for walks: walking the 9th, 10th, or 11th batters, walks with 1st base occupied. or walking in the winning run ( these are called ""untimely walks"").

, Don't ever argue with an umpire. It doesn't do a bit of good. It only hurts you and the team. An umpire may consciously or even subconsciously get back at you and the team. And the umpire's subconscious is a key factor for influencing. For example, when you are batting and the pitch is a marginal strike or ball, an umpire may unknowingly look for clues as to whether the pitch was a strike or not. The split second you decide you are not going to swing at the pitch, stop looking at it. If you watch the pitch all the way past the plate as if you possibly wanted to swing, you just told the umpire you thought the pitch was worth swinging at (at least it was worth looking at!). If there was any doubt in the umpire's mind about the pitch, there isn't now because you just made up his mind. If you are one ball away from a walk with no strikes and the pitcher likes to throw deep, move up in the box. Some umpires call the pitch where it lands, others call where it crosses your body, and others, well that's another story.

, Take advantage of their faults. And don't ever let them know when they make a bad call in our team's favor. When they make a bad call against us, let them know. But be so subtle that no tension is created. Simply shake your head in awe and disbelief about how Mr. Umpire could possibly be so stupid. The more you argue, the angrier you get, the angrier the umpire gets, and the more embarrassed you teammates become. And this is totally contradictory to the team philosophy of maximizing our chances to win!

, Softball is not our lives. If it were, we would be getting paid to play. Too often practice and games are scheduled around the coach's ability to attend. And then the coach doesn't understand when a player can't make it. If you can't make it, fine. Just make sure the coach knows as soon as possible. And you don't have to make up some story about how your great-grandmother died and you have to go to Russia for the funeral. When you feel you have other priorities, simply notify the coach that you won't be there as soon as possible! On the other hand, you are expected to be excited about playing. Habitually missing practices and games shows a lack of interest. This only hurts the team. There will be no other choice but to find a replacement player.

, Only you can make yourself a better softball player. Besides, you owe it to the team. ""Softball is a thinking man's/woman's game"", states Ron Gordon, expert on softball philosophy. You must be able to think and play by instinct simultaneously. Our instincts can only be improved with repetition.

, Unless that players decides to sit out the game, he can plan on starting the game. However if this player is having a bad game he will be subbed out.

, It's a game and everyone should be having fun.

If you know someone that has an old stick they wouldn't mind letting you borrow his or hers, even better. Understand that the men's and women's games differ significantly, meaning that the male stick is much different than the female stick.


There are two main components of a stick:

The head. This is the (usually plastic) piece at the top of the stick that the ball is controlled with.
The shaft. Traditionally made out of wood, shafts nowadays are made of strong metal alloys and have varying weights and strength.

;
, If your dominant hand is your right, put your left hand about 1 or 2 inches from the bottom of the shaft and your right hand closer to the top, about 4 inches from the bottom of the head. Switch the hands around if your dominant hand is your left.

, Cradling is the lacrosse equivalent of dribbling in basketball. You usually cradle when you run with the ball so that an opponent can't knock the ball out of your stick. Cradling is basically using a curling motion with your wrist to swing the ball back and forth while you run.


Cradling is best learned in front of a mirror. Place the ball in the pocket of your head, so that the ball sits in the mesh, holding your dominant hand a few inches below the head. Hold the stick across your body comfortably.
Begin with the head facing the mirror so you can see the ball. Now bring the head across your face while curling your dominant wrist in towards your body.
When your dominant wrist is curled as far as it can go inward, start bringing your wrist back out and your arm back down to its starting position.
If you managed to keep the ball in the pocket while you completed that movement, you successfully cradled. Keep practicing until you get the hang of it. If you need help (don't worry, it's hard) try watching some videos of people playing lacrosse.

, Passing is critical in Lacrosse. It's used to move the ball up field, catch your opponent out of position while hitting a teammate for an assist, or just getting yourself out of pressure. In order to pass the ball:


Lower your dominant hand down to just above the center of the shaft. Keep your non-dominant hand close to the bottom of the shaft.
Bring the shaft of your stick back by twisting your shoulders toward your dominant side. Don't let it hook around your neck.
Keeping the head next to your ear, and using a straight motion, flick the wrist of your top hand while pulling your bottom hand towards you.
Make sure to follow through with the motion. A proper motion will see the top of the shaft move directly over the bottom of the shaft in a straight line.



Note: eventually, you learn how your stick throws and can adjust the way you throw to be more accurate.

Note: the best thing you can do to help improve your skills is get to a brick wall and play ""wall ball."" This is where you stand a few feet from the wall and throw the ball against it. The ball will bounce back and you practice catching it.

, This is all about hand-eye coordination. With your dominant hand up near the bottom of your head,(For righties this means have your right hand on top and left hand on the bottom and for lefties this means have your left hand at the top and right hand at the bottom) watch the ball travel through the air and into your pocket. Make sure you don't cradle as the ball enters your stick. Instead of cradling, simply loosen your grip on your top hand; as the ball enters the stick, let the momentum of the ball push the whole stick back a little bit. Again, wall ball will really help here.

, Know that games are won and lost on ground balls. While approaching the ball, step to it using the proper foot: if your stick is in your right hand, position your right foot close to the ball, and vice versa. Sink your hips and put the head of your stick parallel to the ground. The butt of your stick should get down low as well. Scoop through and bring the head to your face. Immediately look for the outlet to a teammate.

, Shooting the bass is necessary in order to score goals. Move your dominant hand down a little lower than you would to pass. Perform the same basic movement as passing, except this time, put more force behind it. There are plenty of different kinds of shots in lacrosse — 3/4, sidearm, underhand — but for now, focus on overhand shots.




Try to direct the shots on the corners of the goal. The goalie has a harder time against shots that aren't directed right at him, so aim for top right, top left, bottom right, and bottom left. Also try shooting at the goalies weak side hip. So if the goalie is right handed, shoot at their left hip. Shooting at the goalies weak side hip make it hard for them to stop the ball mainly because it takes a lot speed and quick reflexes for the goalie to extend their arms with the stick across to the opposite side of their body, whether they move their stick upwards or downwards.
Try bounce shots. Bounce shots are where you bounce the ball on the ground before it gets to the goal. Bounce shots are hard for a goalie to defend, so use them.



, Nothing impresses a coach more than being ambidextrous! Learning to use both hands requires patience, because it will not happen overnight. Using your off hand in games will seriously improve your play.


A good way to learn your off-hand skills is to look at what your dominate hand is doing. Mirror the way you are passing. Go through the same motions.
After you do this, spend a week of practice using nothing but your non-dominant hand. During line drills, 6v6, fast break, anything. Only use your off-hand. This will be very frustrating, but keep at it.

, There's no one way to defend, but your object on defense is to recover the ball without the other team scoring. You can do this by checking, keeping your stick up and intercepting passes


Boys Checking

Poke-checking: hitting the other person's stick legally with your own, causing the ball to come out.
Body-checking: hitting the other person legally with your own body, causing the ball to come out.


Girls Checking

Modified- a quick ""tap"" (hit and release) on the head of another girl's head of her stick. You can only do this when her head is below her shoulder

Full (Varsity)- a ""tap"" (hit and release) on the head of another girl's head of her stick. You can check anytime when the girl's stick is not in her ""bubble"" (around her head).




Intercepting a pass. Anticipate where a pass is going and catch it mid-air or bat it down.

, As you play in more lacrosse games, it's important to watch more experienced team members move without the ball. Even players who don't have the ball play a very important role in a possession. You must know when to cut, and make space for passing, and shooting, and to draw defenders away from the person with the ball. You also should learn how and when to set picks for your teammates.

, Although the basic concepts are the same, women's lacrosse differs quite a bit from men's lacrosse. This article will focus mainly on the rules of the men's game.

, The object of lacrosse is to score more points than your opponents at the end of four quarters, which last for 15 minutes each. You score a point by throwing the ball across the goal line of the opponent's goal.

, 10 lacrosse players take the field for a game: 3 attack-men, 3 midfielders, 3 defenders, and 1 goalie. They each have different functions:


Attack-men: usually stay in the opponent's half and are responsible for creating fast breaks, moving the ball around in the opponent's half, and scoring goals.
Midfielders: move the length of the field, help with attacking and defending, and are responsible for the faceoff.
Defenders: usually stay in their half and keep the opponent's players from attacking. Defenders usually, but not always, have longer sticks than other players.
Goalie: defends his team's goal, trying to keep the other team from scoring. Has a bigger-than-normal head on his stick for defending his goal.

, A faceoff in lacrosse is similar to a faceoff in hockey, except that the two lacrosse players get down on their hands and knees and position their sticks parallel to each other. They then vie for the ball when the referee blows his whistle.

, After the faceoff is won, the team with the ball passes the ball until they are close enough to the opponent's goal to shoot. Meanwhile, the defenders try to keep the attacking team from scoring. A shot that travels past the goalie and into the goal counts as one point. Once a goal is scored, the ball is brought back to midfield, where a faceoff takes place again.

, The crease is a large circle that is clearly marked. If an offensive player steps into the crease illegally, possession is forfeited to the opposite team.


There is not a minimum amount of time that a team has to possess the ball for before they score. Scoring can and does happen quickly.
There is not a minimum amount of passes that need to take place before a player can shoot. Theoretically, a player could march down the field him or herself without ever passing the ball and still score.

, There are three rules associated with timing, and they both involve promoting the ball past forward.


After the goalie gains possession of the ball, he must pass or move it out of the crease within 4 seconds. Failure to do so results in a turnover to the other team.
Once the defense gains control of the ball in their defending half, they have 20 seconds to pass or run the ball over midfield.
Once they've moved the ball past midfield, they have 10 seconds to get the ball into the attack area, which is clearly marked as a big box.

, Both involve possession of the ball:


If a player takes a shot and the ball travels out of bounds, the team with a player closest to the end line gains possession of the ball. A player's stick counts as an extension of his body in this case.
Inside the final two minutes of the game, the team with the lead must play inside their attack area exclusively. Failure to do so is considered delay of game, in which case forfeiture of possession occurs.

, When the faceoff is being fought for, a team's attackmen must be being the offensive restraining line and a team's defender must be behind the defensive restraining line. When possession is gained by either team, both attackmen and defence men may move toward midfield, but both teams must have three players above midfield and four defenders behind midfield.



Offsides. Defensive offsides occurs when there are fewer than four players for one team behind their midfield line. Offensive offsides occurs when there are fewer than three players for one team above their midfield line.

Defenders can move passed midfield and attackmen can move behind it so long as another player stays behind or in front of midfield in their stead. This allows for the possibility of a defender carrying the ball up passed midfield, say, if a midfielder stays back to act as a ""defender.""



, Penalties usually send players into a designated area called the ""penalty box,"" where they cannot play and must sit for a period of time. There are two kinds of fouls in lacrosse:


Personal fouls. These include slashing, tripping, illegal cross checking, and checking from behind. A player is usually given 1 minute penalties, although penalties can be increased to 2 or 3 minutes or even ejection for egregious fouls.
Technical fouls. These don't usually result in penalties, but rather a loss of possession. They include offsides, crease violations, pushing from the rear, thumbing, and warding off.

Keep your stick on your man.,
Communicate - talking to your fellow teammates makes defense much easier.,
Dodge from up top: If an opposing midfielder is carrying the ball at the point (area opposite the goal outside the restraining box) and looks like he is doing to dodge, try to channel him down one alley on the field.,
Dodge from the wing: If an opposing midfielder or attackman is looking to dodge from the wing (area adjacent to goal along Goal Line Extended) your primary objective is to not let him get Top-side (imagine a long line extending from both goal posts at a 45 degree angle heading toward the sideline.,
Dodge from X: If an opposing player tries to dodge from X (area behind net) channel him to whichever hand you desire, because most players at X will be very good in both hands.,
Use good foot placement: If the attack man is walking side to side don't cross your feet try shuffling it will lower the chances of you falling and it will make it easier to catch up to your opponent if he beats your.And if beat push off with the inside of your feet not from the outside this will also lower the chance of injury and falling.

",How to Play Solid Men's Lacrosse Defense," If you're playing close defense (long-pole) covering an attack man and the ball is in the offensive end of the field, keep your stick on the attack man to prevent the goalie or defender from the opposing team from ""cheapening it"", or launching the ball down field to your defensive in hopes that one of the three attack men will gain possession. Also, if an opponent is dodging against you, keeping your stick on him will prevent him from bringing the stick in front of his body, forcing him to roll dodge.;
, SOUND TOUGH! Talking about slides and the current situation makes it easier for the defense to react to what the offense is doing. Remember that if your guys are facing their man, they need to know what's going on behind them. Yelling out to your teammates not only makes defense easier, but a loud defense can intimidate an offense. If you watch ANY lacrosse game, the team that communicates louder on both sides of the ball wins the game. In practice, we call bad communication, ""keeping it a secret"". If you're ""keeping a secret"" by not talking on the field, your team-mates will not know how to react or how to help you.

, In the early goings of a game, it is pretty easy to see what hand is dominant for each opposing player. Naturally, take the opponent who is dodging against you to his weak hand. If he appears to be a right-hander, deliberately stand on the right side of his body, which will force him to take the ball in his left hand, unless he wants to run right at you and get the ball taken away. As the man takes the ball down in his left hand, push him on his hip and force him to keep going down the alley in his left. If he rolls back, you can drop a solid slap-check on his bottom hand which will hopefully jar the ball loose.

, the area in front of the goal between these two imaginary lines is an ideal spot to shoot from) If an attack man or middle tries to dodge from the wing and go top side, push him back down underneath toward the goal, because help will be on its way from crease and it will be an easier slide for your fellow defenders to help you if you get beat.

, Try to picture the goal line drawn inside the net extended all the way to the sidelines. Your objective as a defender at X is to keep the opposing player behind this line and force him to throw a pass, take a weak shot, or dodge right into an incoming defender on his way to help you. Best case scenario, the opposing player will dodge and you will take the ball away, give it to your goalie, and start the Clear.

, For example, if the tournament fees for the youth street conference are $195 per team, and the hotel room with be $145 for the night gas will be about $70 for 200 kilometers (120 mi) of travel that comes to $410. If you divide the cost evenly throughout the team that's $82 per player. Do lemonade stands, 50/50 draws, bake sales, and team sponsors.

, Every player needs a stick, good running shoes, tape for the stick, and full eye protection. This would be a pair of glasses that came right against your face or a helmet with a full cage/ mask. You may want shin pads gloves and mouth guards.

, You're going to want shorts and t-shirts and jerseys. Bring a bathing suit if your hotel has a pool.

, The goalie will need a mask, chest protector, gloves, (Blocker and catcher), Pants, Jill/Jock, Goalie Pads, Hard toed shoes, mouthguard, Goalie stick. Buy quality gear as it hurts very badly to get hit with a strong shot.

, Have everyone come over after dinner, pack everything into the car, and do something calming. Do not have a hard practice the night before as you do not want to tire your muscles. Watch a movie of talk, but get to bed early.

, The referee team should review basic mechanics and pertinent deviations from the Laws of the Game authorized by the rules of competition that apply to the game being played (e.g. age group modifications or league-specific rules). The center referee should also advise assistant referees as to any preferences he or she has for the amount of assistance ARs should offer or for the methods of communication between the referee team.

, After the coin toss, the members of the referee team should walk together to the center circle, with the assistant referees to the sides of the referee holding their flags furled in the outside hand. If there is a fourth official, he or she should be to the left of the referee. The team should do a quick handshake and wish each other luck at the center mark.

, After making sure the team is on the same page, both assistant referees should sprint to the goals in their respective halves and do a quick last-minute ceremonial check of the nets. Once satisfied, they should then run to their respective touchline and position themselves facing the field, even with the second-to-last defender. After counting the players in their halves, they should make eye contact with the referee and unfurl their flags.

, During active play, assistant referees should strive to maintain a position even with either the second-to-last defender or the ball—whichever is closer to the goal line.


The assistant referee should stay about one or two feet outside of the touchline in order to maintain a wide-angle view of play close to the touchline and to avoid causing the ball to remain in play if it were to strike the assistant referee.

, In practice—and especially when there is the potential for an imminent offside or goal/no goal decision—assistant referees should move in a side-to-side shuffle facing the field. In the event that the second-to-last defender or the ball is moving too fast to maintain position while shuffling, assistant referees should instead turn and run normally. Being in the right position at the right time is of paramount importance.

, While the ball is in play, assistant referees should always keep their flags in the hand closest to the referee. Ninety five percent of the time that will be the left hand, unless the assistant is following play upfield. When moving—and especially when running—assistant referees should keep the arm that the flag is in still and not pump it while running. This may sound trivial, but when at full sprint, pumping the flag arm can look sloppy, and the motion of the flag can distract the referee and cause him or her to stop play, thinking you signalled for something.

, When a penalty kick is awarded, the assistant referee should position himself or herself at the intersection of the goal line and the penalty area line to allow him or her to more accurately watch for the ball crossing the goal line or for violations by the goalkeeper.

, These are as follows:


Always make eye contact with the referee before signaling.
Come to a complete stop and face the field before signaling.
In all signals, the flag is an extension of your arm. You should be able to trace a line from your shoulder down your arm to the tip of the flag.
Signal with your arm held completely straight.
If the signal is composed of multiple parts, start the first signal in the arm that will be used to make the next signal. If you must change hands, do it below your waist.
Do not signal in an overly hasty manner, but do signal crisply, quickly, and authoritatively. It is sometimes helpful to signal in a manner in which the fabric makes a loud snap as you signal.
Hold your signal until the referee acknowledges it, either by stopping play or by waving it off. Then drop your flag and move to the proper position.

, When the ball completely crosses the touch line for a throw in, signal by raising your flag at a 45° angle in the direction in which the team entitled to the throw-in is attacking.

, When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a goal kick, signal by pointing your flag straight across the field toward the goal area. Use your right hand to avoid impeding your view of the players and the referee.

, When the ball completely crosses the goal line for a corner kick, signal by pointing the flag at a 45° angle downwards toward the corner flag on your side of the field—even if the corner will be taken across the field. If you are standing directly on the goal line, take a few steps upfield so that your flag is not crossing the plane of the corner flag and pointing to a spot off the field.

, When you detect an offside violation by the attacking team, raise your flag straight in the air. If the referee acknowledges the signal by stopping play, drop the flag to a position indicating where the offense occurred: 45° upward for an offense occurring on the far side of the field, straight across the field for an offense in the middle of the field, and 45° downward for an offense on the near side of the field.

, If you detect a foul and are certain that the referee did not see it and would not have applied advantage had he or she seen it, raise your flag straight up in the air. Make eye contact with the referee, and give the flag a slight wave. If the referee stops play, signal with the flag 45° upwards in the direction in which the free kick should be awarded.

, In the event that the foul you detect in the above scenario is committed by a player in his or her own penalty area, raise your flag and give it a slight wave, but instead of signaling a direction, hold your flag horizontally across your waist to indicate that the offense warrants a penalty kick. If the referee awards the PK, move to penalty kick positioning.

, When the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts, you will do one of three things:


If there is no occurrence that would bring the validity of the goal into question, make eye contact with the referee and sprint a short distance up the touchline towards the center line. Then record the goal.
If there was an offside violation by the team that scored the goal, signal the offside violation.
If there was a foul by the team that scored the goal that you believe the referee did not see or any other problem that might invalidate the goal, stand at attention and do not move until the referee consults you about the situation.

, If, during a valid substitution opportunity, one of the teams wishes to make a substitution and the substitute(s) is/are ready and standing at the center line, raise your flag horizontally over your head (your hands should resemble the American football ""touchdown"" signal with the flag held between them). Then conduct the substitution as directed by the rules of competition.

, (This is another USA-specific procedure.) In the event that, based on your view of a situation, you believe a caution or send-off is warranted by the laws of the game, you may discreetly advise the referee by placing your hand over your badge to suggest a caution and yellow card, or patting your back pocket to suggest a send-off and red card. (Note: your referee may ask you to follow an alternate procedure in his or her pre-game conference; since the ""back pocket"" is nowadays quite synonymous with a send-off and somewhat well known by players and coaches, such an overt gesture may tie the referee's hands, so to speak, and fuel any disagreement in the event that he or she does not issue the send-off.)

, After the final whistle for the half or for the match has been blown, assistant referees should furl their flags and rush to meet the referee at the center circle. The referee team should then leave the field together.

, The attacking team places the ball inside the round mark on the corner of the field. Choose the corner closest to the spot where the ball left the field.


You may place the ball on the line of this corner mark. Choose a spot where you can approach it easily, without the flag getting in the way.

, When taking a corner shot, you may aim directly at the box (where both teams will be concentrated), or pass to a player elsewhere who has a better shot. Make sure your teammates know your plan.

, As with any direct free kick, the opposing team must stay at least 10 yards (9.15 meters) away from the person taking the corner.If you're playing on a smaller field, you can use your best judgement.

, As the kicker, you are not allowed to touch the ball a second time after the kick. Once any other player has touched the ball, you are allowed to make contact again., Ask a teammate to position himself close to you, roughly 10–15 yards or meters away on a regulation field. Simply make a ground pass to your teammate and continue playing as usual. Typically, the receiver will attempt to pass to a player in front of the goal, or dribble to a position for a good shot.


Alternatively, the corner kicker runs toward the goal after passing and receives a quick, one-touch pass back from the initial receiver. Make sure to avoid offside offences, although this is usually easy while the defenders are crowded near the goal.
Take this type of corner when your team has an aerial disadvantage, making a kick to the penalty box risky. This can also work if the defense is out of position, so you can rapidly get the ball back into play.

, From your perspective, this is a straightforward cross to the box. Most of the maneuvering here is done by your teammates, who attempt to crowd around the keeper and get in his way. If your teammates can work together and give each other space once contact is made, you have a good chance of either getting a shot on goal or getting a penalty from the crowd of defenders.

, Make the signal that tells your team what you're about to do, and indicates which player should make the goal attempt. Cross the ball just in front of the nearest goal post, or as close as you can get. Your teammate should immediately start running toward that position and attempt to head or volley the ball into the goal as it arrives.


This type of corner gives a short, agile teammate a better chance to make a header. You must be a good crosser to pull this one off, and practice it with your team in advance

, As you would expect, this is identical to the near post run, but your plan is to cross the ball high up and in front of the far post instead. You must select a tall teammate to run toward this position.

, Signal the play to your team so an excellent distance shooter can position himself outside the penalty box. Kick the ball to the edge of the penalty box while your teammate runs forward and makes a shot on goal at long range.


You must be a skilled and powerful crosser to get a goal from this corner. Discuss it in advance, and make sure the shooter knows to act defensively when appropriate. Losing possession from this position could be disastrous.

, If you've got great spin, you can attempt a shot directly on goal. Place the ball on the arc away from the endline. Cross the ball aiming for one of the upper corners of the goal, depending on the keeper's position and your kicking distance. Signal to your teammates what you're doing so they can take possession or make their own attempt if things get messy.

But if you really want to be the best striker in the league, or school, or whatever your case may be, don't have a strong foot. One foot is naturally better than the other, but work on the weaker foot to make it just as good.

, This means you shoot the ball inside the goal. There are a few steps how to aim before you hit the ball.


Think about where you want to place it. With your weak foot (that is next to the ball) you can place the shot in any direction. If you aim your big toe to the left, you'll shoot towards the left. The same happens when you move it to the right.Never stare at where you are going to shoot or the goalie will be ready. If you want to trick them look at one side of the net for about 3 seconds then shoot to the other side of the net or drop back.







,


Lean back or lean over the ball. When you lean back the ball goes up, when you lean over the ball, you'll shoot low.






Hit the ball with your instep.







,


Take a run towards the ball. This will make your shot harder, but may become accurate. However, there may be case where accuracy is most important. In those cases, just worry about getting to the right place.

The kicker can practice alone all he likes, but he's unlikely to score if his teammates don't know the plan or haven't learned to work with him. The following guide will aim to develop the skills of the entire team, not just the kick taker or goal scorer. Know what your teammates are practicing and expecting, even if the advice doesn't apply to your specific role.
, Scoring a goal directly from the corner is extremely rare. Most of the time, the kick taker tries to cross a dangerous ball hard into the box, where a teammate has a good chance at hitting it into the goal. The kick taker must have excellent ball-curving ability and a powerful, accurate kick.

Typically, right footed players take left corners best and left footed players take right corners best, since these are the most natural positions for curving the ball toward the goal.
Two common mistakes are failing to get past the first defender, and delivering the ball too close to the keeper.

, Headers and volleys are the most common ways to score a goal after a corner. The players most successful with these techniques should practice receiving the corner kick and directing it down into the goal. The most common positions to score from are in front of one of the two goalposts., Divide the team into defense and offense so you can practice under more realistic conditions. There are two typical situations that both sides can practice:

Defense typically aims to man-mark every player in the box, and especially the tallest and most skilled scorers. The offense attempts to swarm around and create confusion, wearing down the defense until one of the offensive players slips clear.
Alternatively, defense can practice zonal defense, creating a human barrier while a few other players harry the most dangerous attackers. Offense can counter this by flooding the area with their own players, breaking up the defensive line.

, Always have a midfielder positioned centrally just outside the penalty area to collect the ball if headed clear by the defense, and maybe hit a first time volley. You never want to watch your whole team racing back to the opposite goal because you lost possession., Once you have the basic skills down, start practicing more advanced, coordinated strategies. These are described in the section below.

As you decide on the most effective strategies, come up with a signal for each one. The kick taker should signal the strategy and receiving player before taking the kick.

, Designate a fast, agile player to make this goal attempt. Have the kick taker aim as close to the near post as possible, while bypassing the defenders. Her teammate starts further back from the goal, runs forward as the kick occurs, and heads or kicks the ball in as it arrives in front of the goal.

Besides the one or two players there to attempt a goal, the rest of the offense should try to drive the defenders toward the far post to clear some space.

, If the keeper is close to the near post, the kick taker may prefer to make a similar approach with the far post instead. Because the kick must be higher to evade the defenders, this works best with tall teammates who can head the ball effectively., If your team has a disadvantage in the air, consider a short pass to another player instead. That player typically receives the ball while running toward the penalty box, and either crosses it to another player or finds an opening to charge through., This is a less common strategy, since scoring from outside the box is much more difficult. However, if you have a midfielder with strength and precision, he can take advantage of the lack of a marker to find a shot at the goal."

If you are new to the position go to your local rink's pro shop or to a sporting goods store that carries what you will need and ask questions. There are also many goalie forums online where you can get some great feedback on equipment. You will need a goalie mask, throat protection, chest and arm protector, glove (catcher), blocker, goalie pants (girdle), Leg pads, skates and a goalie stick.;
, Even if you have been playing and/or skating for years, it's different moving in goal equipment; it may seem very bulky at first. Get used to skating and moving with your pads on, it will make learning the position much easier.

, This refers to your stance while waiting for a shot. There are many styles of play and every goaltender has their own preference. Basically you want to make sure the blade of your stick is flat on the ground. Bend your knees slightly, as though you are sitting in a chair with your upper body fairly tall. How far apart your skates are depends on how you play and what is comfortable for you. Keep your glove up and with the palm facing the play ready to catch.

, No matter what happens during a game, whether you are in good position or not, moving, standing still, up or down always always always be square to the puck. This means your chest and your leg pads should be facing the puck no matter what. This alone will at least give you a chance to make a save even if you are out of position.

, Whether you are moving to your right or left always lead with your stick. The stick should go where you are going first. By doing this you ensure that even if you can't get your pads in front of a shot in time your stick will be there.

, Most goaltenders today play a butterfly style at least to some extent. Many new goaltenders know to drop to their knees but, they do not know how to butterfly. You want to go straight down onto the inside of your knees with your stakes out to your sides as far as you can. Do not jump off your skates to drop and do not put your pads underneath you. There are two reasons why, one is for safety. If you drop that way you are exposing your knees and thighs. Even if you wear extra knee and thigh protection under your pads you are still exposing yourself to potential serious injury. The second reason is you do not cover as much net. In a proper butterfly your pads should turn so they are flat with the face of the pad facing the play and your skates away from your body to cover your sides. This covers much more area and gives you a better chance to make a save.

, Many new goaltenders either play with their sticks in the air, or when they butterfly they make one of two mistakes. The first mistake is they hold their stick to their side. The second is they slouch and the stick sits on it's heal. The puck cannot slide under your stick if it is on the ground. When you butterfly your elbow needs to stay up so that your stick blade stays flat on the floor. You also need to make sure you keep your stick in front of you to cover the five hole which if you are not already familiar with is the gap between your legs.

, There are two thing to focus on when talking about playing angles. The first is making sure you are on your angle or lined up with the net and the puck properly. If the puck is on the floor, the puck, you and the center post of the net should all be in a straight line at all times no matter where on the floor the puck is. The second thing to focus on with angles is taking the shooters angle away or challenging the shooter. To do this you simply come farther out of your net. The farther out you are the less the shooter can see the net. For example hold your hand up right against you computer monitor. How much of the monitor can you see? Now slowly move your hand back toward yourself. How much of the monitor do you see now? When you play, the net is the monitor, you are your hand and the shooter is you. A guide line I give goaltenders is if the puck is above the face off circles you should at least be at the top of your crease. How far you actually come out depends on how you play and what you are comfortable with.

, Never takes you eyes off the puck at any time during a game. All you have to do is look away for a second and you might lose where the puck is. Then you may find yourself not knowing where the shot is coming from and not being square and on your angle as a result. Taking it a step further, watch the puck all the way into you. If a shot hits you in the chest, watch the puck all the way to your chest. If it hits your leg pad, watch it into your leg pad. If it's going to your glove, watch it all the way into your glove.

Run towards the ball.,
Kick the ball.",How to Set up a Goal Kick," If you are not confident with kicking the ball long distances, look for a patch of grass that's slightly higher and smoother to place the ball. If you choose the damaged part of the ground which is lower, it will make it harder to kick the bottom of the ball and get the lift you need, you also risk kicking the ground and injuring yourself.;
, Some people prefer longer run ups for longer distances but do what feels comfortable and right, really you only need to take a couple of steps.

Take odd number (3, 5 or 7) of steps back and move right/left (1 or 2 steps) according to your shooting foot.
Just relax and don't rush. If you panic, your ball will be low or wide.







, Move at a steady pace so you can add power to your kick whilst still being in control.

First look where is your team player standing.
Then keep your eye on lower part of ball until the last moment.
Plant your non-kicking foot to the side of the ball, still giving yourself enough room to swing your other foot.







, Kick using the inside of your foot. Actually you use the part of your thumb bone. Lean backwards to get the ball to go higher. Use your foot as a wedge. To kick more precisely, kick slightly below the middle of the ball (to get that flying like result). Remember to kick the ball straight forward like a golfer's wedge swing.


If you want to curve the ball, kick the ball at the same part like above, but your foot should be approaching with a round like motion.

By learning to shoot the ball with either foot, you increase your chances of scoring a goal. You will not have to set up the shot to hit the ball with your dominant foot - you can hit the ball as it is.


Train your non-dominant foot by drilling with it instead of your dominant foot. The only way to learn how to shoot with both feet is to train both feet. At first, it will be uncomfortable and your technique will be terrible. This is to be expected. Continue pushing yourself and using your non-dominant foot to take shots, to dribble, and to do everything else.Juggle with your weak foot by letting the ball bounce and then kicking it up with the laces on your weak foot. Alternate touching the ball with the out-step of your foot, then the instep, over and over until you build rhythm and speed. Practice trapping the ball with your weak foot, increasing the intensity as you improve. Pass with your weaker foot, starting off with passing against a wall and then finding a partner and passing the ball back and forth. After you've done these things and gotten some control with your weak foot, try shooting with your non-dominant foot.This skill takes practice and patience. You will not train your non-dominant foot overnight. It will take weeks of practice. Do not give up - your hours of practice will pay off at the end.
During the time it takes for you to set up a shot with your dominant foot, the other team can swoop in and steal the ball. Being able to kick with your non-dominant foot doesn't give the opposite team time to steal.;
, As a goal scorer, you want to be able to put the ball into the net with either foot and with any part of the foot. Just like being able to shoot with either foot gives you flexibility, learning to shoot with all parts of your foot does the same. Learning how to use any part of either foot means you can shoot with just about any set up.


To develop good technique with all of your foot, practice dribbling, passing, and shooting with all six parts of your foot - insides, outsides, heels, toes, instep (laces) and soles.Devote time to practicing only with certain parts of your feet during every practice session.

, Since soccer is a fluid game that is constantly changing, you can't hope for the same situation you found yourself in when you practiced. You need to be ready for anything the game throws you. Do this by practicing shooting control, ball technique, accuracy, and direction. Complete target practice and drills and technique execution drills., Make sure your practice sessions are intense and aggressive enough to prepare you for situations you will face in a game. You want to practice in all sorts of situations to improve your technique, your ability to anticipate, and your adaptability.

, Shooting goals into an unguarded net is easy. You need to get used to shooting and aiming with someone trying to block your shot. In addition to practicing with goalies, practice with defenders. Your practice sessions should teach you how to perfect your technique, accuracy, and control while other players are trying to steal the ball and block you.


Try shooting partners. Go through shooting exercises with someone else to improve your technique. Critique each other and try to fix any weaknesses. Remember to practice all of the shooting techniques - you want every skill possible so you can be the best player., Start by perfecting technique. This may mean you practice alone against a wall, or with a partner. You should practice shooting into a goal without a goalie to get the hang of it. Add more difficult obstacles as you improve.

, Just before you get to the ball, look at the goalie to see where he or she is. Keep your non-kicking foot alongside the ball. Square your hips towards where you want the ball to go. Your eyes should remain down and focused on the ball when you're striking. Keep your knee and head over the ball. Make sure to make contact with the middle or top half of the ball., When you get the chance to score, go for it; don't stand there and overanalyze. While you hesitate and try to figure out what the best play is, the opposing team can come in and steal the ball. During a game, don't try to set up the ball for a better shot. If you have a shot, take it by only touching the ball one or two times. You always want to finish fast.This takes practice and confidence. When you practice or play recreationally, always go for fast, one touch finishes. If you practice in a situation where you can take your time, set up perfect shots, and not have to worry about aggressive opponents, you will not be ready when you play a good team or a fast-paced game. Practice for difficult games.
This is where foot flexibility and all your hours of technique training help you. Being flexible and having a strong skill set makes you ready to finish fast.

, If you have an open shot, take it. If you think you can take your defender, try it. If you have the opportunity to take a daring pass, go for it. A lot of missed goals come from hesitating as you overanalyze your next move. Be confident and go for it.


You may miss a lot of goals at the beginning as you learn how to effectively finish fast. Remember, fast finishes require accuracy and ball technique. If you always miss the net, go back and work on your accuracy and ball technique and try again.
Your team should encourage shooting - and missing - goals if the player is in position. But the team should also encourage passing to open teammates and working together to get a goal. Being the person who scores is important, but playing defense, helping set up the shots, and doing all the other things involved in a match is equally important.

, If you shoot high, there is a greater chance that the goalie will intercept the ball. Shooting wide aims the ball for the corners instead of right at the goalie, and keeping it low on the ground makes it more difficult for them to crouch down and grab the ball.


The technique to shoot wide and low is similar to passing. You can practice both skills at the same time. Most importantly, when you are practicing your shooting technique, go for wide, low shots instead of high shots right down the middle. This will decrease the chances of the goalie blocking it.
According to a recent study, over 60% of successful scoring shots are made in the bottom part of the net, while less than 20% are at the top of the net. Over 65% of goals were made in the corners from wide shots instead of straight down the middle., Delivering the ball into the net isn't always achieved by kicking the ball with all the power you can muster. This usually ends in a miss, either because it wasn't aimed at the right place or it sails over the goal. Accuracy is the key to a goal, not power.When you're near the 18 yard box, don't kick with all your power. Instead, aim outside of the goalie's reach and kick with greater accuracy and a little bit of power. Use your powerful kicks for when you are more than five yards outside the penalty box.A sidefoot technique is better for accuracy, while instep/laces is better for power.

, Never stand still as you wait for the ball to come to you. Move back, forward, to the left and to the right.


Mark your opponents. Stand right behind them, not in front of them, as they get ready to punt or kick the ball. Watch what they do with the ball and move easily in front of the opponent to steal the ball or steal the ball when the opponent turns.When the ball comes near you, start moving into position, planning where you need to be for your best play.

, Know your plan of action before you get the ball. This saves valuable time where you are not hesitating that can be used to your advantage. The ball is not always going to be where you expect or want it to be, but being mentally prepared when you finally get the ball increases your chances of scoring.


Knowing if you should shoot, where you should shoot, if you should pass, or who you should pass to can be difficult. This comes with experience and practice as your instincts get sharper. If you have the chance to score, go for it. But remember, spotting an open teammate and passing the ball is just as important. Always plan ahead.Always be one step ahead of your opponents. Try to figure out where the ball is about to be kicked and get there. This is a very good way to get possession and is especially useful when nearby the opponent's goal. Many a time, the opposing team doesn't expect you to get it and is unprepared, allowing you to score before they know what hit them.

, Keep your eyes on the goalie, watching for any openings that you can use to your advantage. There is no way you can score if you don't notice where the goalie is. Start watching him or her as you approach the goal.


Try aiming for the corners because most goalies are not covering that section of the goal.

Attempt to dribble past the defenders.,
Get it to your stronger foot, if possible so that you are more likely to have better accuracy and power when you shoot.,
Get a short pull back with your foot.

,
Shoot it across the goal (if you miss, someone else can finish).,
Hit the ball squarely and hit it about 2 feet (0.6 m) off the ground and make it dip right before it reaches the goal.

",How to Score in Tight Spaces in Soccer," If there are few defenders, sprint past them. But if there are a large amount of defenders, try doing some tricks to get by them..


You could try to fake a shot and then quickly run by them.
You could kick the ball through the defenders' legs, and run behind them to take the ball.
You could juggle the ball past the defenders.

You could take the shot from where you currently are by kicking the ball lightly over the defenders' heads and hopefully gravity will lower the ball from the air and allow you to score.
You could dribble past them by running until you are two feet away from a defender, and kick the ball through his legs if you can, or you can quickly pull the ball to his side and run past him. Remember that this must be done smoothly and swiftly, otherwise you will be unsuccessful.
Perform the ""Stop and Go"". For this move, the key is simply a change of pace. Jog slowly with the ball almost to the point of stopping. Usually it is best to do this as a defender is alongside of you and suddenly as you are jogging, burst past the defender. You can magnify the effect if you also put the sole of your foot on top of the ball for a second when you stop the ball, and then push it forward with your instep when you break off to perform the dribble again.
Perform the ""Fake Shot"".Look up and towards what would be your target. Bring your leg back as though you are going to shoot to freeze the defense. Draw your leg back as though you are going to make a pass or take a shot, and then stop this motion just in front of the ball. You can then move the ball to the left or right to set up for your next play, since the defender thought you were going to shoot.
""Scoop"" it! Tempt the defender into diving for the ball, and lift the ball over the defender's foot just as he or she dives in. This is usually done while feinting one way and then scooping the ball the other way, just over the defender's planted foot. Make sure to take off with a burst of speed after you lift the ball over the defender's foot. Often, you'll want to scoop or lift the ball over the defender's foot onto your other foot, so that your body will be between you and the defender after you make the move. Have the ball on your right foot and scoop it over the defender's foot to your left foot. Your body is then between the ball and the defender. This move is usually done when you're in an almost-standing position, and the defender is rushing at you, or you're suckering the defender in and then lifting the ball over his or her foot as he or she comes towards you too fast.
Try the ""Okocha"". Begin by taking a touch a few feet in front of you and smoothly put your right foot on the ball. Spin 180 degrees to your left and pull the ball with your left foot as you complete the rotation. You should have your back to the defender. With the sole of your right foot, pull the ball back onto your left foot, close to the inside of your big toe. If you simultaneously lift your left knee, you will pop the ball up around one or two feet off the ground. At this point, begin to rotate 180 degrees to your left. Halfway through the rotation the ball should be at its peak. Hit the ball with the outside of your right boot up and over both you and your defender and finish the move by completing the rotation and exploding off your left leg past the defender.
Do a Rainbow. Kick the ball in front of you about 2 yards (1.8 m), run onto it, step over it with one foot and use your other foot to hold it in place against your other foot. Then move your foot on the back of the ball up and kick up with your first foot. If you do it right it will sail over your head and over the defender. sprint around him and explode down the field to score. WARNING-When you try to do a rainbow, you will most likely fail, don't let it get to you! Try again again until by some miracle you manage it!;
, If you practice playing soccer with both of your legs, you wouldn't have to follow this step because both of your legs would have the same strength.

If not, shoot to the low corner because that is where the goalkeeper will have the most trouble defending.

Work out your legs.",How to Score from Long Range in Soccer," Most reasonable long range scoring attempts come from the top of the 18 yard box. With practice you may be able to make reasonable (though still unlikely) attempts from about 25 yards away.;
, A long range goal doesn't happen often. Your best chance will come when the goalkeeper is significantly off his line. Also look for opportunities to surprise the keeper with a moving pass followed by an immediate shot at goal (a fast ""one-timer"").


A skilled power shooter can score from around the D-line even when the goalkeeper is in position. This is extremely difficult and often not the best play to attempt.

, Place your non-striking foot alongside the ball. Now strike ""through"" the ball, connecting with your laces and following through.


As always, you'll need to adapt this if a direct shot won't do. For example, if you need to swing the ball outside, connect just to the right of your laces instead.

, The most spectacular and successful long shots pass over the keeper's head, then dip down just under the bar. Pulling this off requires a great deal of practice to get the perfect amount of power and aim it exactly right. You can see now why it's best to make this shot when the goalkeeper is a few yards in front of his line.


The exact spot you aim at depends on the position of the defenders, but go for the top corner if you can.

, Perfecting this technique is impressive in its own right, but practice is nothing like a game. Before you start ignoring your teammates and bashing at the goal every time, use all of the following information to pick the best play:


Can you progress forward instead to shoot from a better position?
Can you pass to a teammate in a better position?
Is the ball bouncing or under control? Have you perfected this shot on a bouncing ball?
Is the ball on your stronger foot?

, We've described the most common situation where you would attempt a long shot. In rare cases, you may see an opportunity to bend the ball around the defenders. A skilled shooter can use this to dangerous effect from the corners of the 18 yard box, with the goalkeeper at the near post. Aim to bend the ball up and into the far top corner of the goal.

, Start with a ball bouncing about 12–20 inches (30–50 cm) off the floor. Stand about 5 yards outside the 6-yard box and work on looping the ball up and over where the keeper would stand, just under the bar. Once you perfect this, keep moving further back and out to the sides to increase difficulty. This lets you get a feel for the trajectory without having to focus on power at the same time.


Keep in mind, if there were a keeper there, you would need a fair amount of power to get it past him before he can respond.

, Besides improving your muscle memory, pay attention to what you need to practice further, and keep reading to find more focused drills.


For a tougher but more realistic challenge, have a teammate send you rolling or bouncing balls while you're in this position or running toward it.

, Many players make the mistake of thinking that power is the most important part of a long shot. Assuming you have the strength and technique to reach the goal, it's vital to control the height and trajectory instead of striking as hard as you can. Try aiming for the crossbar from 20-25 yards out until you can hit it pretty consistently, then work on getting just beneath it.

, One of the best ways to improve your technique is to study how better players make the shot. Look up online videos of long shot experts such as Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, and Andrea Pirlo. Watch their form when striking, and how it varies with different types of shots. How do they adjust to defenders in different positions? How do their teammates set them up? When do they attempt a long shot in the first place? This type of examination will reveal what you need to work on, and expand your understanding of the game.

, Depending on your physique, you may need to work on leg strength to make these long shots. Make dedicated leg exercises a part of your workout in addition to speed and agility training.

Make the defender overplay.,
Set the pace.,
Work with your team.,
Shoot the ball and score the goal.",How to Score A Goal In Soccer1," Having a defender trying to block you or steal the ball can be a difficult obstacle to overcome. However, the defender has some weaknesses that you can exploit to move beyond them. Try some of the following techniques to get around a defender.Wait for them to overplay which will send them off balance and allow you to move around them.
You can try a fake or juke to make the defender move one way while you go the other.
The main focus is to keep the defender off balance, taking away their ability to recover their momentum and block you.;
, Although the defender will be trying their best to slow you down it is important that you set the pace. If you slow down or give into their defense they will have a better chance of stopping you or stealing the ball. Always be aggressive when facing any defenders and set the pace of the attack.Defenders will try to push you into a position where they can steal the ball.
Try to push into the defender, causing them to continually back up.
Try to move towards the defenders backside at all times to prevent them from stealing the ball.

, Soccer is a team sport and working with your team can greatly increase your chances of scoring more goals during a match. Passing the ball and properly attacking the defenders will make more shots possible, allowing you to increase your own chances of scoring more goals.Pass the ball when needed.
Keep an eye on your teammates and pass the ball when they are open.
Don't hog the ball. Working together will increase your chances of scoring more often.

, Once you have a clear shot at the goal you will need to shoot the ball quickly and accurately in order to score the goal. Make sure you kick the ball with proper technique and shoot it away from where the goal keeper might be located in order to increase your chances of successfully scoring a goal.Using the inside of your foot allows for greater accuracy at the cost of power.
Kicking with your toes allows for greater power but less accuracy.
Kick the middle or top half of the ball.
Shooting low makes it tough for the goalkeeper to reach the ball and block the shot.
Avoid shooting high as this can make it easy for the goalkeeper to grab the ball.
Aim your shot for the far side of the goalkeeper as these are harder for them to block.

Notice the simple things.,
Did he glance in that one direction for a bit too long?,
Never dive before the shot is taken.,
Try to cover as much ground as you can.,
Attempt to dive out of goal in the direction you have chosen, as this cuts the angle of the kick, making you bigger.

,
Note: You can also look at the plant foot of the player.",How to Save a Penalty," Don't get angry at your team-mates, the referee, the crowd, or the other team. This will distract you. If you do get cross channel that anger into the upcoming penalty or count to 50.;
, Having your arms out covers more goal area and makes you look bigger and more intimidating to the penalty taker. Bent knees will give you more of a jump when you dive to save the goal.

, If possible during this period try to push the shot away from the penalty area and the lurking members of the opposing team, ideally you will be able to push the ball away towards either your left or right side, resulting in a corner. Better yet, catch the ball if at all possible.

, See how the penalty taker places the ball, is it leaning towards a certain angle?And also try looking at his eyes. Where are they fixed to? Make sure to look at the shooter's hips and which way they are leaning. The player's hips give away the side he/she is going to shoot. If you are not sure, either guess a side, react if they shoot it to a side or right down the middle, Little hints like this give away which way the penalty will be taken.

, Many players will jerk before hitting the ball, trying to trick you. When you have decided where to dive, simply be ready to go that direction, or take a step to the direction (make this step very subtle, or try to disguise it any way you can). Right as the foot strikes the ball, dive to your desired side.

, If you're diving to the right you must fully commit yourself in that direction to prevent the shot sneaking in.

,, Players always go in the direction of their plant foot. This will probably only work for younger players around U15 and younger.

Switch your feet.",How to Score a Direct Free Kick," The opposing keeper will give you a good idea about where to aim your kick. When a direct free kick is called, some of the opposing players will form a wall ten yards away from you in front of the keeper. While the purpose of the wall is to help the keeper defend against the kick, it can also obscure his view of the striker. Usually, the keeper will try to stay in the middle of the goal. If he does this, aim your kick toward either the left or right goal post.


If the keeper remains closer to one side of the goal, aim your shot to the opposite side or try to kick it over the wall. Try to put the ball in a difficult spot for the keeper to react to.
You might even be able to trick the keeper by looking in the opposite direction and kicking where he started off.
If the infraction occurs in the opposing penalty box, you’ll kick a penalty kick. This is a type of direct free kick in which only the striker and the goalie participate.;
, You should always know how hard and which direction the wind is blowing before you take your kick. Severe wind can drastically alter the trajectory of the ball. Take a peek at the corner flags on either side of the pitch before you set up your shot. Take the wind into consideration and adjust your aim so that the ball still goes where you want it to.


Remember that a strong gust of wind can also cause your ball to sail over the goal post so you might have to aim the ball lower than you normally would.
A weak kick will be affected by the wind more than a powerful kick.

, Complete the motion of your kick by bringing your leg all the way through. Following through with your shot will guide it in the right direction. Think of your leg like a pendulum swinging straight through the ball. If you don’t follow through with your shot, it may end up in a different spot than you intend it to.









Keep your follow through controlled. If you try to follow through too much, you could hyper-extend your leg or slip and fall on your back. Your kick should always be controlled so you don't get hurt.
Hold your follow through for a few seconds after kicking the ball.

, The length of your run-up will depend on how much power you need to generate for your shot. If the direct kick is placed far away from the opposing goal, you’ll need more power. Measure out four or five steps. Your run-up for a long shot should cover about ten yards. If the direct kick is placed closer to the opposing goal, accuracy will be more important than power. For a short shot, you may only need to take a one step run-up.








Practice your run-up before game time to get it perfect. If you stutter-step to the ball, you’ll lose power and accuracy.
When deciding how long of a run-up to take, take into account the strength of your leg. If you’re a particularly powerful striker, you might not need to take as long of a run-up.

, When you kick the ball, make sure that your non-kicking foot lands as close as possible to the ball. The nearer to the ball your standing foot is when you make contact, the better control you’ll have over where the ball goes. If your standing leg is far away from the ball, you might unintentionally slice or hook your shot.Make sure that your standing leg does not touch the ball. If it does, you’ll be called for a double touch when you kick it.
When your foot lands, make sure it is pointed toward where you want the shot to go.

, If you want your kick to travel in a straight line, aim just below the center of the ball. The top of your foot should make contact with the ball in the center of your laces. If you do this properly, the ball will move directly where you kick it. Contacting the ball in the middle of your laces will also give your kick more power.


You may want to use this style for longer direct free kicks or if you see an opening in your opponent’s defense that you want to quickly exploit.
This type of kick is not good for kicking over the wall. Your ball will continue moving in a straight line after it crosses the wall and will likely sail over the net.

, If you can’t find a straight path to the goal, you can try curling or bending your shot around the defenders. To curl the ball, you’ll need to get it spinning. Contact the ball with the inside of your foot. Try to kick the ball slightly to the right of its center to make it start spinning. After you make contact with the ball, follow through towards your opposite leg instead of straight in front of you.








Curling the ball can help you get it around the wall.
If you are kicking from far away, you can still curl the ball with the top of your foot. However, the ball won’t curve as much as if you use the inside of your foot.

, A knuckle ball is a kick that has very little to no spin. Because the ball isn’t spinning in a particular direction, it can move in a very unpredictable way. To kick a knuckle ball, kick it with the densest part of your foot. Make contact with the ball at the top inside corner of your laces near your sock. After you make contact with the ball bring your kicking leg toward your non-kicking leg. Don’t follow through when kicking a knuckle ball or you'll cause it to spin.Rather than swinging through, think of kicking the ball in a punching motion.
A knuckle ball can move straight down, in a loop or side-to-side depending on how little it spins.

, When you kick a direct free kick, your opponents have to be at least ten yards away from you. When the referee gives you the okay to kick, the players in the opposing wall will start to inch towards you to get in position to block your shot. Have two of your teammates stand on either side of the wall to keep it from advancing.The opposing team will think twice about over-committing to your shot if there’s two people on either side of them that could get the ball.

, The opposing keeper might expect you to take your time to plan out your direct kick. If you immediately take the shot right when the referee blows the whistle, the goalie might not be prepared to react to it. This tactic works best for shorter direct free kicks and penalty kicks. If you have to kick from far away, the keeper will have more time to react.


A straight kick works best for this move as you want the ball to reach the net as quickly as possible.You can also watch footage of the opposing keeper in previous games. See what kind of shots they have difficulty defending.

, If you have to shoot the ball over the wall during a direct free kick, you should try to find the easiest route to the goal. Identify the shortest player on the opposing wall and try to kick the ball over their head. Remember that the ball has to go over the wall, but come down far enough to travel under the top of the goal post.









Taller players will force you to kick too high and the ball may not come down in time to reach the net.

, If you have the ability to kick the ball confidently with both legs, you should change your kicking foot depending on what side of the goal you're on. If you’re kicking from the right side of the goal, you’ll have an easier time scoring using your left foot. If you’re kicking from the left side of the goal, you’ll be able to take a more effective shot using your right foot.Sometimes coaches will use separate strikers to kick direct free kicks from different parts of the pitch.
If one of your legs is dominant, always use it to shoot free kicks. The angle from which you attack the goal isn’t as important as the accuracy of your kick.

Get close before shooting.,
Chip the ball.,
Dribble past the goalkeeper.",How to Score A Goal In Soccer2," Although it can be tempting to kick the ball from far away and as hard as you can, taking shots closer to the net can result in a better chance of scoring a goal. By shooting close to the net you will allow for greater accuracy and control over your shot, making it more difficult for the goalkeeper to block. Make sure you aren't shooting from too far away to increase your score count. Also, ensure you maintain your distance from the goalie as goalkeepers are trained to make themselves look big and then dive and latch onto the ball. Make sure you have sufficient distance to shoot from without the goalkeeper being able to grab onto the ball. Shoot from around 10 to 15 meters away.

Train for a rigorous practice schedule.,
Improve your speed and endurance.,
Strength train (recommended).,
Avoid injury.,
Remember to rest.,
Understand the position you're aiming for.,
Play at the highest level you can.,
Contact the college coach.,
Watch as much soccer as you can.,
Keep your grades up.",How to Prepare in High School for College Soccer," A typical college varsity soccer team trains five or six days a week, and competes in one or two games. As a student athlete, you must develop excellent physical fitness, endurance, and recovery habits.


If you aren't getting enough training with your current school team, look for leagues in your area.;
, These traits are incredibly important to your success. Try to achieve excellent speed and above average stamina in high school. If you're still falling short on your goals in college, you'll be under a lot more pressure to catch up.

, Schedule dedicated muscle-building workouts if you don't already. North American recruiters tend to favor bigger, stronger players, although this depends on the coach's mindset. Other regions may have different philosophies, but being stronger certainly won't hurt you.

, Follow good warm up practices and safety precautions. If you do get injured, even in a minor way, get it checked up and follow your doctor's advice. Besides avoiding the disaster of injuring yourself out of recruitment, you'll learn habits to protect yourself in more demanding situations.

, Your life should not be all about playing soccer. Even professional athletes take rest days to renew their body and mind. Get enough sleep every night, and make some time for friends, fun, and family.

, College coaches often recruit based on position, since they know how returning players will fill out the roster. Focus on the position you're best at, and understand its role in the team.


If your current coach can't help you with this, look up training videos online. Learn the most important skills for each position, and find drills to improve your weak areas.
In countries with highly competitive college soccer, you may need to demonstrate versatility. Learn to play comfortably in every position, including goalkeeper.

, College coaches place a high value on players who have proven their talent in playoff games and regional or national competitions. The more experience of this kind on your resume, the better.

, Don’t be afraid to call the coach yourself to ask questions, even early in the season. Project confidence, mention your soccer achievements, and keep a positive attitude. Besides piquing the coach's interest, you'll learn valuable information to guide your training and decision-making. Ask him to tell you about the team, and which positions he's recruiting for.

, Many high school students underestimate how important this is. Watching local and televised games will vastly improve your understanding of the game. Analyze individual and team decisions, and apply the lessons you learn to your own play.

, Many schools do not allow students to play sports if they have poor academic grades. It is important to balance athletics and academics, as this will only get harder in college.

, If you are making a half court, purchase only 1 hoop.

, Place stakes in each of the 4 corners.

, Remove everything but dirt from the staked-out area. This includes all rocks, sticks and grass. Leveling requires transferring dirt from high areas to low areas before being packed down.

, Make sure the weather is dry before performing this step. Once the concrete has been poured, you will need to wait at least 36 hours before utilizing the court.


Pole hoops will need to be installed during the concrete pouring step. Each pole must be placed 1 to 2 feet (30.48 to 60.96 cm) into the ground and stabilized with concrete. Regulation height for basketball hoops is 10 feet (3 m) from the ground to the top of the rim.

If you play often, keep your ball well inflated and store indoors at room temperature. If you don’t play too often, keep your ball slightly deflated. This will increase the longevity of the ball.


Never leave a ball outside and avoid direct sunlight for too long of a period.

, A good way to ruin your basketball is by kicking it around like a soccer ball. It is a common misconception that any inflatable ball will work for anything.

Turn: The shooting form starts when a player receives a ball and squares up for the shot.,
Release: At the point of release, the player should have his strong hand underneath the ball, with the fingers pointing towards him.,
Follow Through: After a shot is release, the player should maintain the shooting form of the strong hand with the arm still extended and the wrist bent towards the ring.,
Practice: With all these fundamentals, the best thing a player can do to improve his form is to constantly practice it.",How to Improve Free Throw Shooting2," This is a very important part of the form and it dictates the flow for the rest of the shot. The proper turn would be to have your shooting hip and shoulder squared up or pointed at the direction of the ring. The feet should be turned 10-45 degrees towards your off hand.

, The off-hand should be supporting the ball and not pushing or holding it in any way. The strong hand’s elbow should be tucked in and the ball should be released at the highest point in the jump, with the wrists snapping forward upon release of the ball.

, This is called the follow through. The follow through can help with shot accuracy and shot strength. The follow through should be done on every shot, including hook shots, free throws and jump shots.

, The best shooters in the game developed the right shooting form by practicing it daily; taking hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of shots every day. Once you have the correct form, you have to constantly practice using it in your shot for muscle memory. Using the proper form should be second nature for good shooters.

, Watching your body move when you make good baskets and when you miss can help you tweak things that are off and improve your game. If you’re in middle or high school, have a friend or parent attend a game to help you record some video footage. If you’re in college, many teams have media assistants who record games for the university. Ask your coach if you can review some game footage.


It can be helpful to compile your best footage from these games into a highlight reel for potential NBA recruiters, if you are in college. Edit the video to keep lagging moments to a minimum and keep your video under 5 minutes., You become a stronger and more strategic basketball player when you are challenged by someone whose skills are superior to yours. Elevate your game by regularly scrimmaging other players who push you to be better. If you are in high school and are already the best basketball player you know, try to join a local AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) team to find people whose playing ability really pushes you to a new level.Top AAU teams are tracked by prominent college recruiters and are one of the top ways to get athletic scholarships.

, If you have a playing skill that is particularly strong, make it your own. There are lots of great basketball players, but you’ll need to distinguish yourself from the pack as a specialist in one area if you want to be in the NBA.


If you are particularly fast, for example, try to bring speed to every skill you perform on the court. People will notice that this is a unique strength of yours as a player.

, Attitude matters. A basketball team can’t function with a roster full of prima donnas because it is a team sport. Make yourself appealing to prospective recruiters by being a leader and exemplary person both on the off the court. Everyone wants a player who will get along with others and inspire the team to be better.Learning from your mistakes and setting a high standard are two great ways you can step up your leadership game.
Don’t be afraid to approach your coach at school, whether high school or college, and ask if there’s a way to assume more responsibility on the team.

, Getting in front of talent scouts from major universities (if you are in high school) and NBA teams (if you are in college) are key to advancing in your basketball career. Attend as many tournaments as possible, as these are places important coaches and influencers go to see and select the next generation of players. The more influential people who see you play the better.If you’re in high school, many AAU leagues participate in regional tournaments your school may not. You don’t need to sign up for anything extra, but the schedule can be grueling on top of your other commitments. If playing in the NBA is really your dream, try to attend as many as you can.
If you’re in college, your school basketball team already participates in all the right tournaments. Make the most of recruiting opportunities at regional conference tournaments and March Madness by playing the best you possibly can.

, You must be 19 to play in the NBA, and most players are drafted out of college. Excel to the best of your ability in high school and AAU basketball, so you can play at a competitive basketball school such as Duke, Kentucky, or North Carolina. Top NBA recruiters usually only consider players from Division 1 basketball programs.A private basketball coach can help step up your game if you’re not where you need to be.
If you’re in high school, good grades will help round you out as a full “package” and make you more attractive as a student-athlete. Think like a recruiter: You want to be an easy sell to whomever they need to make your case to. If you need an academic tutor to bring your grades up, contact your dean’s office. They can connect you with a tutor who will meet your needs.
Most high school and college coaches will have a good sense of which recruiters will be at specific games or showcases. Ask your coach if they have any information about this, if you’re hoping to connect with someone.

, The majority of NBA players who are not selected out of college programs play internationally prior to joining the league. If you attended a D2, D3 university or junior college, this can be a good route into the NBA. International play exposes you to a greater variety of strong players and different basketball styles. If you are an outstanding player but don’t feel like college is for you, it might be helpful to seek out an international basketball league that has fewer age and eligibility requirements than the NBA.Hoopsagents.com has a big international directory to connect you with an agent in your desired country to get started.

, If you are at a high level of play but haven’t been approached by a recruiter yet, it may be that you are past college age or just haven’t gotten the right people to see you play. Contact an agent in the U.S. to help facilitate important meetings to get your professional career on track.Hoopshype.com has a list of the top basketball agents and links to their sports agencies so you can contact them. You can see how many players each agent has placed and where, if you have your heart set on a specific team.

, Set your timer for 30 minutes, go right under the hoop and start form shooting.

, Start off right under the basket. If you can't shoot 5 out of 10 shots the distance away from the basket you are, then move in.

,, Once the timer stops, take a 3 minute rest, then set the timer for 10 minutes again (20 if on a half court), and do the same thing over again only with your left hand dribbling the ball.

Keep doing this for about 5 times. Take a three minute break and do 5 more.

, If you have a friend with you, you can practice that way, but if you don't, you can bounce the ball against a wall and try to catch it as it comes back. Pass or bounce the ball from different angles (if you're using a wall it is more unpredictable, and trains you better). Do this for 30 minutes and then take a 10 minute rest.

, Try to make it bounce off, and rebound it in. The objective is not to make a shot it is to miss the shot, and rebound it in, that way you practice your rebounds. After the timer stops, take a 5 minute rest.

Keep your defender guessing.,
Keep the ball low and dribble with your fingers.,
Keep your head up.You want to know if someone is open for good a pass and the position of your defender, so dribble by feel and keep your head up.








,
Execute the crossover dribble.This dribble is quite effective, because it allows you to use all your momentum after an easy weight shift.,
Spin.,
Use the step jump shot.,

Execute the behind-the-back dribble.,
Stop-and-go.,
Dribble with both hands.,
Be confident about your abilities.,
Use all of the above moves on the basketball court.",How to Execute One on One Basketball Moves," To succeed, you'll need to confuse the defense, keep the defender guessing as to what you're likely to do next. This is the key for any dribbling movement to work. If the defender knows what you're going to do, then he or she will stop you, but if you keep the defender guessing, then you're in control.






;
, You don't want to give the defender the ball, so keep it low and secure (protect it with your body). For a better dribble, use your fingertips to keep more control, trying to never hit the ball.








,,









With your ball in your right hand, give a step towards the right with a head fake to the same direction.
Lower your left shoulder to look sincere.
If your defender goes all over the right, then turn your weight and bounce the ball to your left hand in front of your defender, and go all the way to the basket!
If your defender doesn't go over the right, then quickly run to that direction.

Try an in and out plus a crossover. Do an in and out move (carry the ball left then right in one fluid motion). Go for an exaggerated crossover to your other hand, then drive past your opponent.



, This is a very smart solution when you are going fast towards the basket.









With the ball in your right hand, go where the defender is and dribble hard towards him or her.
Stop with your left foot forward and planted.
Change the ball of hand and bounce it once, making a 360-degree rotation with your left foot.
Then bounce it back with your left hand, and finally go to score!

, This is a very effective drill when you want space for a good shoot.









Dribble hard towards the defender.
In the same place where you are, make some quick stutter steps as if you're about to dribble.
When your defender falls with your fake, use the space to quickly rise up and shoot a jump shot!

, When you see a double-team coming, calm down, plant your front foot and straighten up slightly. Your defenders will do the same instinctively. Now that you have got them, run quickly all the way to the basket and score.








, This is a very easy but effective move.









While going towards your defender running (supposing that he or she is on the right), bounce with your right hand.
Then pass the ball behind your back, and quickly with your left hand, run all the way to the basket.

, The stop-and-go movement involves a change in speed and its effectiveness can be used in many situations.









With the ball aside you, protecting it from your defender, seem to be calmed down.
Give a step or two back.
Forwardly explode your speed and all of a sudden, overtake the defender!

, If you only dribble on one side, then your defender will know where are you going, but if you change the direction, then it will be harder for him or her to stop you. Therefore, try to use both hands.








, Play as if already you were the best player out there. Don't be ashamed of doing your best effort. Play as a team, for your team and with your team, not for yourself. Just believe in yourself.








, If you have an opportunity to execute one-on-one moves and score, do it! Enter to the paint with confidence, score and make your team win!

Get low.,
Be on your toes, Being on your toes will guarantee success when playing defense.,
Help side defense.,
Big Steps to Small Steps.,
Keep your hands up at all time.,
Watch your player and the ball.,
Be disciplined.,
Be aggressive.,
Don't be afraid.",How to Get Better at Defense in Basketball," Getting low is very important when playing defense. You want to bend your legs at about a 45 degree angle. Being low helps you shuffle from side to side faster, and when you are bending your knees, your eyes are around your opponents waist, which is very important because then you will know where your player is going.;
, Being on your toes makes it easier to maneuver your body. You can move side to side, front to back and it is easier to start running when you are on your toes.

, Help side defense is crucial when it comes to basketball. When the ball is on the opposite side of the court from where you are, then you need to leave your player and shuffle to the middle of the court. This is very important because if your teammate gets beat, you are there to back them up.

, Using big steps to small steps is very important while playing defense. When you are on help side defense and your player is about to get the ball, you need to move from the center of the court and start going back to your player. When you are going back to your player you need to take big fast steps to small choppy steps. This is because if you run out too fast, then your player will just dribble right by you, and if you go out too slow, then your player will shoot over you.

, Keeping your hands up is very important because it stops the player from shooting over you. Also, it distracts the player from knowing where to pass, and it makes it harder for them to see what is going on. It does not have to be both hands but definitely one. This is especially important when playing a zone defense because it makes the passes for the other team harder and it allows you and your teammates to intercept passes.

, Watching your player and the ball can be difficult at times, but it is very important. If you are just watching your player and you can't see the ball, you could be getting beat from behind. But, if you just watch the ball then your player could be making cuts behind you and you could lose track of them and they could score.

, Being disciplined is very important because it teaches you to keep fighting. When your player beats you down the court or scores on you, do not give up. You need to stick with it and try harder next time. You can not give up.

, Being aggressive could be maybe the most important tip when becoming a good defender. You can not just sit back and watch the game happen. You need to get active. Dive for balls on the ground, steal the ball from your player, and don't be afraid to intercept passes.

, Don't be afraid to go for the block and steal passes

Determine your size of hockey skate.,
Try on several brands of hockey skates to assess the comfort.,
Base your budget on how long you think you're going to play.,
If you're buying inline hockey skates, look at the following steps:


Except for really small sizes, inline skates come with 4 wheels.",How to Buy Hockey Skates," They can vary by brand, but typically will be 1 size to a size and a half smaller than your shoe size, depending on the brand. Your toes should barely touch the toe cap.;
, This will also help you determine whether you need a standard width or wide skate. Standard width skates are usually denoted with a ""D,"" and wide skates are marked as ""EE."" Some brands and models run wider and deeper than others.

, If you're trying out hockey for the first time, buy a pair of skates that are around $100. These won't last as long. But if you know you're going to be playing for a while you can pay between $200 and $800 for a pair of skates that will last you a good number of years. Look for brands like Reebok, Bauer, CCM, and Easton.


More expensive skates are lighter weight, have a more durable construction, and greater ankle support and padding.
Competitive players look for high-end hockey skates with thermo-formable foam padding that can be heated to create a customized fit.
Look at the construction of the plastic holder and metal runner (blade) on ice hockey skates. A 1-piece design is less expensive and suitable for a child or introductory player. A 2-piece design costs more but allows just the plastic holder to be replaced if it breaks, which can happen from impact by a high-velocity puck.

, The wheels may all be the same size or have slightly larger wheels in the back.
You'll want harder wheels (a higher durometer rating) if you are using the inline hockey skates outdoors. Outdoor wheels are more durable but have less grip. A durometer rating of 72A, 74A or 76A are for indoor use only. A durometer rating of 78A or 80A can be used indoors or outdoors. A durometer rating of 82A or 84A are for outdoor use.
Look at the bearing rating. A higher rating, such as ABEC 7, is more expensive but makes it easier to skate, because the wheels rotate with less effort.

"
Never intervene in a fight while two or more players are throwing punches unless one player has a distinct advantage over the other while both players are on the ground or if one of the players signals for you to intervene (this will usually happen only when the players have tired themselves out).,
The best time to intervene is when both players are on the ground or players are ""hugging"" and no longer throwing punches.

,
Always remove your whistle from your finger because this may be harmful to yourself, your partner or other players.

,
Remove player equipment that may have fallen from the immediate vicinity, because once again, it's a safety issue.

,
If the players tell you not to intervene even though it seems an appropriate time, do not intervene.,
Intervene at the same time your partner does, grab players arms when they are standing up and pull away, or if on ground, do your best and work with your partner and get your bodies in between the two fighting.",How to Break up a Hockey Fight,";
,,,, They still wish to fight and may end up throwing punches again right as you skate in to break it up. However, if a player has a large advantage over the other player, break it up.

, Pull them apart and put your and your partner's bodies between the fighters as they are escorted to the penalty box.

Choose a helmet.,
Choose some skates.,
Choose some gloves.,
Choose a stick.",How to Buy the Proper Hockey Gear," Helmets are probably the most important part of your hockey gear. Without it, a hard fall could seriously injure you. Since helmets can and have saved lives, you'll want a good quality one. Reebok 8K, Cascade M11 Messier, Bauer 5100, CCM Vector V08 and Easton Stealth S19 Z-Shock are all good choices, although they can be quite pricey. When buying your helmet, make sure it fits right too.;
, Without skates, you won't be able to move. Also, if you have bad quality skates you won't be able to skate very smoothly or they could break mid-game. Like the helmet, your skates need to fit well, but not too tight. Bauer APX are great skates, although they cost quite a bit. Research some other nice skates and shop around to find them cheapest.

, Gloves keep your hands warm and help you get a good grip on your stick. They can also protect your hands and knuckles from a flying puck, a hard knock from a stick or just a fall. You don't always need top of the line gloves so just look around for some nice strong ones.

, The stick that you use has to be good otherwise it could break, making you mess up a good chance. While all sticks might break eventually, one95's vapor 40's, 10k or ak27 are all quite good. If you don't like the way the stick's bent, heat it with a heat gun and bend it to your liking. Keep in mind that this could weaken the stick.

Consider where the system will be installed.,
If you want an indoor basketball goal, your first preference must be a portable basketball hoop.,
Get an outdoor basketball system, in case you have enough open space in your backyard.,
Buy a basketball system which can be easily adjusted as your kids are in a growing stage, they would frequently need to lower the hoop.,
Safety should be the first consideration while buying basketball hoops for kids.,
It is essential to use the right basketball for your kids.,
As far as the basketball material is concerned, it is better to have a basketball made of composite leather which is durable, affordable, and easy to grip.

,
Also invest in quality backboard material as it affects the quality of play.,
Look for durability to ensure years of family fun by buying basketball equipment from a well known basketball equipment maker.",How to Get A Basketball System For Your Kids," Will your system be installed on a driveway in the front of the house or inside one of your rooms? Choose a system that compliments and not overwhelms your home and landscape.;
, There are many systems designed especially for kids which can be adjusted from four feet to a maximum height of six feet. This makes the hoop easier for kids to play on and easier to get in and out of the room.

, As kids have a tendency to be a bit rough on their possessions, it is advisable to invest in an in ground basketball hoop. The installation process for this type of basketball goal requires a bit more work but it would give a more stable base to your kids for playing basketball.

, There are systems which come with easy adjustment mechanism, such as the crank adjust or handle adjust. A wrong basketball goal would be a big disappointment to youngsters learning to get the ball to the goal.

, Generous setbacks and pole padding are essential. Always get a pole pad to wrap around your pole. With padding on the pole, if your kid accidentally runs into the pole while playing, they will not get hurt.

, While the ""official"" sized basketball is 29.5 inches (74.9 cm), for all kids under 12, you must get a basketball that is 28.5 inches (72.4 cm).

,, Be it the backboard, pole, basketball goal or any other thing, if it is not made of high quality material it will not last long.

, Compare features of different manufacturers to get a clear picture of what you can expect your system to look like in the years ahead.

Go to different stores and try on different brands and types of equipment.,
Ask the employee's opinion.,
Wear your equipment around for a while.,
When you buy new skates, try on various pairs to see which designs are the most comfortable.,
When you buy a stick, choose one that has a length that goes from the floor to between your chin and nose with your skates on.,
When you buy new pants, make sure that the back of the pants touch your shoulder pads and the bottoms of your pants touch your shin pads.

,
Some hockey leagues require neck guards; they're required everywhere in Canada.",How to Buy Hockey Equipment,";
, See what they think on how your shoulder pads fit. They may not be accurate, but it doesn't hurt to ask. You'll get the best results if you go to a hockey-centered store, instead of a big chain store, such as Modell's, or Sports Authority.

, The equipment may feel rather comfortable at first, but end up not fitting you.

, Buying used skates is fine, as long as the store has a skate oven. The cost of a set of new skates is sometimes worth it, but if you find a good quality pair of used skates that you can get molded, buy them. Both function just fine.

, If you buy a stick and you don't have your skates with you, choose one that goes between your forehead and nose. That way, when you use it with your skates, it should be the right length.

,, Check with your local league to see if they're required. If you're not sure, buy one just in case, since they're not expensive and it doesn't hurt to have one. Just because it's not required doesn't mean you shouldn't use one.

Research hockey.,
Practice skating.,
Practice balance.,
Practice passing the puck.,
Practice shooting.",How to Become a Better Ice Hockey Player," You need to know the basic structure of the game, such as the penalties and how to score a goal in hockey.;
, This is the key component to ice hockey unless you are a goalie. Search online and ask your coach for drills that will improve your skating. Check at your local ice rink for open skate sessions, or better yet, open hockey sessions where you can put on full pads and skate like you would in a game.

, It doesn't look or feel very good to fall down. Practice skating with a puck, and slowly start to carry the puck without looking down. This helps your balance.

, Get someone to practice with you. Practice passing the puck without it coming off of the ice. If you're a beginner, you don't need to worry about your passes being hard, you just need to worry about making accurate, tape-to-tape passes.

, There are three types of shots in hockey. Beginners only need to worry about taking a wrist shot:


Start with the puck on the heel of your stick, and your stick slightly behind you and extended from your body. Position your hands at the top and a bit higher than halfway on your stick.
Bend your knees slightly, and bring the stick forward. The puck should roll off your stick, giving it spin.
Follow through with your knees still slightly bent and point at where you would like the puck to go with your stick.

Understand how a slap-shot works.,
Learn when to take a slap-shot.,
Point your feet towards the puck, which should be about 3 feet (0.9 m) from your skates.,
Glance at the net.,
Get the proper grip.,
Wind up.,
Take another look at the goal and aim as you wind up.,
Make contact with the ice inches before you hit the puck.,
During contact with the puck, roll your wrists so that the thumb on your dominant hand (right hand if right-handed, left hand if left-handed) turns down towards the ice.,
Follow through with your shot to where you're aiming.",How to Take a Slapshot in Ice Hockey," The hockey stick is aggressively slapped (almost as hard as you can) and bent on the ice, building tension that is then released against the puck in the direction of the intended target. Even though this technique can generate a puck speed of over 100 mph (160 km/h), it's not as accurate or as convenient as the wrist or snap shots.;
, It's tempting to wind up on the one-timer heading for you when you're right at the top of those hash marks, but try to restrain yourself. The vast majority of the time, something much more simple will work better. Slap-shots should be used primarily by a defenseman when in his position near the blue line or to dump the puck in the offensive zone. This allows for a tip by a forward standing in front of the net.

, Do not point your skates at your target (which is the net, hopefully); this is a huge mistake made by beginners. Although once you build more skill in taking Slap-shots, this will be possible. Later on, if you're short on time during a play, or cannot position yourself correctly for the shot, you can take a shot with your feet a little crooked.

, You probably won't have much time to get your puck off if you spend too much time aiming at this point. A simple glance will do for now to get the general direction of where you want to shoot.

, If you're right-handed, you should be holding your stick with your left hand at the top. Your right hand should be lower than where you would normally carry it when stick-handling or skating. Make sure your hands are shoulder length apart on the stick, as the stick reaches its highest point your hands will separate a little more and move down the shaft, and as you finish the shot, your hand should end up somewhere near shoulder length apart. (NOTE: A majority of left handed hockey players shoot on the left making these instructions completely backwards. Your right hand would be on the top of the stick because you would use your dominant hand for best control)

, Don't do this to an extreme; pulling back way above your head doesn't add power and sacrifices time and accuracy drastically. Pulling the stick back to your waist should be sufficient. You should be looking down at the puck at this point so you don't miss it. Especially as a beginner, while trying to learn the overall movement, during the windup don't bring the blade of your stick any higher than your waist. Once you have a reasonable shot, you can increase your windup. With good mechanics it is possible to unleash a very powerful slap-shot with little windup.

, If you're going for a goal, you should aim for a particular spot on the net, not just the net itself. If you're taking a shot hoping a teammate will tip it (this is recommended over an actual shot for a goal), keep your eyes on the ice and on your teammate's stick side.

, Many mistakenly hit only the puck, thinking the ice will slow their shot. If performed correctly, however, hitting the ice with your stick moments before contact with the puck will cause your stick to ""flex"" and shoot the puck off like an arrow from a bowstring.

, This adds accuracy to your shot.

, After initial contact, follow through completely in the direction you want the puck to go. This makes for a more accurate shot, and it also helps keep your puck stable in the air. Your shoulders should finish facing the net, your hips should twist towards the direction of the shot, and your front foot should turn towards the direction of the shot. After following through, your stick and body should be pointing (gliding) towards the direction of your shot.

Practice.",How to Play Defense in Table Tennis," Return a ball to your opponent by placing a little backspin on the ball. To do a backhand push, stand close to the table and hold your forearm with the paddle parallel to the table. Keep the other arm pointed towards the ball so you stay balanced. Use a short stroke to hit the ball on back bottom part of the paddle. This will give it a little spin.


This is a good defensive stroke to return a ball that your opponent hits short over the net (one that would bounce twice on the table). It also keeps your opponent from using an attacking stroke.;
, Send the ball to your opponent's baseline or sideline and prevent her from playing an aggressive shot. To use forehand drive, stay close to the table, but turn so your side faces the play. Raise your paddle up a bit and keep your free arm pointed toward the ball. When the ball comes toward you, twist 45 degrees and hit the ball at the top of it's bounce.If you want to give it some topspin, keep your paddle in a somewhat closed position. To keep it in a closed position, hold the paddle with the hitting side facing down towards the table.

, Your opponent might strike a high ball across the table to you. If she does this, you'll need to return the ball so that she can't forcefully smash it back to you. You'll need to lob the ball or return it with unpredictable spin. To lob the ball, return the ball high in the air so your opponent has a hard time timing her return shot. Try to send the ball to the deepest part of the table so your opponent will to return the ball from farther away, slowing it down.Until you're comfortable lobbing the shot, remember to quickly get back into position after you've returned the ball. This way you'll be prepared if your opponent smashes the ball.

, If your opponent sends a high ball your way, consider smashing (also known as slamming) the ball. This will forcefully return the ball to your opponent so that she won't be able to hit it. Take a few steps back while you rotate your body to the side. Raise your paddle up high so that you bring it down with force when your opponent lobs the ball at you.Smashing the ball takes a lot of practice, especially to keep the ball from bouncing off the opposite wall or into the net.

, Stand about 7 to 10 feet away from the table with your right leg slightly in front of the other. Swing the paddle back early so you're prepared to undercut the bottom of the ball as it starts descending towards you. To undercut the ball, sweep the paddle down and up as though you're scooping up the ball.Chopping the ball can spin the ball and throw it on a new trajectory, preventing your opponent from scoring.If you want to do a backhand chop, twist your body to the left before doing the stroke. Or, if you want to do a forehand chop, rotate your body to the right before the stroke.

, Give yourself a little room at the back of the table and stand with your feet a little more than shoulder-width apart. It's important to keep your knees bent so you're ready to spring into action and return shots. Hold the paddle at mid-distance from your body so you can return a variety of your opponent's shots.


While you can hold the paddle in a neutral position to defend against different types of shots, you may actually want to hold it in a backhand position. This will be more effective in defending against slams and is better for defensive purposes.

, While this may sound like more of an offensive strategy, being the first to attack will put your opponent under pressure to return your shot. This might be enough to throw off your opponent or at least keep her from settling into a comfortable offensive rhythm.


Wear your opponent out. If you can, start by hitting an aggressive shot, like a loop.To hit a loop, return the ball so there's a lot of topspin. Hit the ball on the bottom while bringing your paddle up and forward to create topspin., Try to keep your shots going straight down the middle of the table, so your opponent has fewer options for returning the shots.She'll have to stay close to the table to return your shots. Playing the middle of the table also works well if your opponent is tall and has less room to maneuver backhand and forehand shots.Try to determine what power zone your opponent prefers. She might like shooting from her forehand side or from the area close to her body on the backhand side. Avoid sending the ball to her power zones.

, Try to keep your opponent on her toes. She'll be looking for you to fall into a set rhythm with shots. But, if you change the speed of your shots, you'll force her to change her style of play which can lead to mistakes on her part.


For example, if your opponent likes hitting a long stroke with a lot of topspin, try to return the shot low and close to the net. This way, she can't do her preferred stroke., Try to play against an opponent who's just slightly higher in skill level than you. If you play against someone who's much more skilled, you'll have a harder time learning how to improve on what you're doing.Ask your opponent to vary her shots so you can practice returning them using forehand and backhand returns. For example, you might lob the ball at your opponent so she can slam it back to you. This way, you can practice returning a slam hit.


Don't be discouraged. Much of table tennis is a mental competition, you just need to practice gauging what your opponent will do.

, This can be determined in many ways––you can flip a coin or you can volley. To volley is just to toss the ball and play it until someone scores if you score then it is your serve, but when you volley the ball has to be hit three times in the match before some scores.;
, Hit the ball on your side once and have the ball go over the net to hit their side. In doubles, serve from the right side of your table and have the ball go across to the left side of table.


When serving, either every 2 points scored or every 5 points scored, switch serves between teams. When playing doubles, you will usually play up to 21 but you can play up to 15 as well.

, When you serve five times or two times whatever is decided, then the other team will serve and when they serve two or five times, then it will be your teammates turn to serve.


When serving, if you are person A and you are serving the ball to towards person C on the other side, then when it is person C's turn to serve, she or he has to serve to your teammate person B. When it is person B's turn to serve, she or he has to serve it to the other team person D. So, after your turn to serve is over, then switch spots with your teammate so that he or she returns the serve to the person that was just returning your serve.

,, When hitting the ball, you and your teammate have to alternate hits so if you return the serve when the other team returns the hit then your teammate has to return that hit. Therefore, you can't hit the ball twice in a row.

, Every time you score it is worth 1 point


If you return the ball but it does not hit the other team's side. it is the other team's point
If the ball hits your side twice, it is their point.
If a serve does not go over the net, it is the other team's point.
If a serve hits the net and goes over, it is a reserve.
If anyone hits the ball twice in a row it is automatically the other teams point

,, The two main gripping styles are the pen hold grip (holding like a pen) and the shake hand grip (holding like a gun without your finger on the trigger). The second style is more common and makes backhand skills easier to develop. When using the shake hand grip, press the index finger against the racket back and the thumb against the racket front. Lower your wrist so that the racket points in the same direction as your forearm. This helps produce better ball topspin. Hold your index finger and thumb nearer to the tip of the racket during forehand strokes for a more comfortable holding position. Lower your index finger during backhand strokes so that the ball doesn’t hit it, and put your thumb down for more comfortable holding. Keep your eye on the ball and use peripherals for gauging what kind of spin is put on it by your opponent.

Figure out how to tell if a ball is in or out.",How to Keep Score in Ping Pong or Table Tennis1," In ping pong/table tennis, you should first decide who's going to serve the ball. The person who serves the ball is the person who first hits the ball to start up a game. You can flip a coin or play a game like rock, paper, scissors to decide who serves. Whoever serves gets to choose which side of the table they want to play on., If you're chosen to serve, you will have to do so. There are some specific rules for how to serve a ball that you will need to follow in table tennis.For starters, hold the ball in the palm of your hand with your hand opened flat. Keep this hand level with the table.
You should toss the ball upward and hit it when it's hovering above the table. You need to hit the ball so it bounces once in your court and then once again in your opponent's court.
You can replay a serve under certain conditions only. You can replay a serve if the ball hits the net before your opponent's court, if your opponent hits the ball before it touches the court on his end, or if your opponent was not ready when you served the ball.

, In ping pong, you always play an odd number of rounds. The winner is the person who wins the majority of rounds. For example, if you're playing 7 rounds, the winner would need to win at least 5 of those rounds to win the game., In each round, you'll play until one player reaches a certain number of points. Most games are played to 11 points, but you can also play to 21. If you want a longer game, 21 may be a better option.Whoever gains 11 or 21 points first, with at least a 2 point lead, wins the round. For example, a score of 9 to 11 would win an 11-point round, but a score of 10 to 11 would not.
In the event a round becomes tied at 10 to 10 or 20 to 20, you will have to play into overtime. In overtime, continue playing until one player gains a lead of 2 points. Whoever gains the 2 point lead first would win., An important thing to understand if you want to score table tennis is whether a ball is in or out. Often, a point is awarded based on whether a player hits a ball in or out of the field. If a ball touches the surface of a table, it's in. If a ball touches the side of the table, or falls off the table, it's out."

Record when you win a point.,
Record when you lose a point.,
Switch up who serves.",How to Keep Score in Ping Pong or Table Tennis2," As you begin playing ping pong, record when each player scores a point. Essentially, you score a point by keeping the ball in play longer than your opponent.


If your opponent fails to hit a ping pong ball that you served or hit last, you get one point for the game.Remember, in ping pong you have to hit your ball so it bounces off your end of the table, and then off your opponent's end of the table. If your opponent misses the ball, but the ball does not bounce on his or her side of the table, you do not get a point., You can also lose points in ping pong. Make sure to record when you lose a point. Under the following conditions, you would subtract one point from your total score.If you miss the ball, you'll lose a point.
If you hit the ball into the net and it falls back onto your side of the table, you'll lose a point.
If you hit the ball too hard, and it falls off the table, you lose a point.
You cannot hit the ball before it bounces off of your side of the table. If you do so, you'll lose a point.
If your ball bounces twice on your side of the table, you'll lose a point.
If you accidentally move the table during play, you'll lose a point.

, Each time you or your opponent misses the ball, you will have to serve the ball again. In ping pong, service changes every two points.For example, you serve the ball to begin a game. You score one point, after your opponent fails to hit the ball. It would be your responsibility to serve again. Then, your opponent scores a point on you. Once again, you serve the ball. You have reached two total points in the game, one for you and one for your opponent.
The next time a point is scored, it's your opponent's turn to serve. He or she will keep serving until another two points are scored. Then, it's your turn again.

Play an odd number of rounds.",How to Keep Score in Ping Pong or Table Tennis3," Continue to play the game, keeping track of scores. The round will continue until one player has at least 11 or 21 points, depending on the rules you set. You need at least a 2 point lead in order to win a round, so a score of 10 to 11 or 20 to 21 will not result in you winning.

, Remember, in the event of 10 to 10 or 20 to 20 tie, the round goes into overtime. Continue to play until one player gains at least a two point lead. For example, a score of 10 to 12 could settle a tie in an overtime round.

, You play for an odd number of rounds in ping pong. The player who wins the most rounds wins the game. For example, say you're playing for 5 rounds. The winning player must win at least 3 out of 5 of the rounds.

Warm up before playing.,
Start by warming up in-game by just hitting the ball with the bat slow then moderate then fairly fast.,
Practice.,
Know that the loop drive is the primary attacking stroke of serious players today.,
Understand that depending on the characteristic of the incoming ball, the loop must be modified to hit the ball correctly.,
Forehand Loop: From the ready position, bring the right foot slightly back (while transferring your weight to it).,
Backhand Loop: This time, the backswing goes in front of your legs, and to do so you should drop your right shoulder somewhat.,
Notes on the loop: Since a lot of paddle speed is required in this stroke, the extra backswing, bending of the knees, and the usual waist rotation and weight transfer are all needed, not to mention the wrist snap at contact.,
Forehand Drive: Keep the upper arm close, but not flush, to the torso.,
Backhand Drive: From the ready position, the waist turns left with the racket pointing towards the 9 o'clock position.,
These are the advanced and basic terms of ping pong.

",How to Play Offensive in Ping Pong,";
, By this way you are adapting your body to react to different speeds of the ball. Never use spin in a warm up.

, Get a friend to hit the ball for you with no spin. As soon as the ball bounces on your side of the table and reaches the peak of its bounce, start the forehand topspin drive to hit the ball. You're looking mainly to hit the ball in the 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock angle. Hitting the ball this way will actually cause the ball to get good top spin with speed. Make sure to hit the ball with your racket closed and partially tilted to the right as this will cause the ball to get side spin as well.

, A loop is basically a spinney counterpart of a drive, emphasizing top spin over forward motion. Likewise, a stronger upward motion is required in the swing, grazing the ball instead of hitting it. Despite the nature of the loop, they can go just as fast as the drive, approaching 100 mph (160 km/h) for an over-the-table loop by a talented player. If there were any doubts about the endurance requirements of table tennis, try hitting decent loops against extreme backspin time and time again. Players not used to this stroke may find it the most tiring for the first time.

, If a ball is coming in fast and high with heavy topspin, the paddle should be more closed and the swing should go forward more. However, if a chop came floating your way, then the correct thing to do would be to open the paddle somewhat, and perform a strong upwards swing. Think of it as 'pulling the ball back up with the paddle'. This is especially what makes the loop such a tough stroke. As the ball touches the paddle for only a short time, as well as meeting on a more perpendicular path(as opposed to the highly parallel paths during a drive), good timing is critical to avoid completely missing the ball altogether. This means keeping a sharp eye on the ball throughout the stroke is important, as it is for all other strokes.

, At the same time, rotate your body backward, and the paddle should be brought back and slightly down, depending on which spin you are hitting against. Bend your knees slightly. Start the stroke by rotating the waist and hips forward, and start straightening out the knees to add more force. The forearms should gradually accelerate from the backswing to contact, snapping for maximum speed when you meet the ball. Hit topspin balls at the top of the bounce or while it is dropping. Hit backspin balls while it is dropping. Follow-through forward more for top spins and upward more for back spins. The weight should be completely transferred back to the left foot at this point.

, Remember to keep the eye on the ball no matter what the other parts of your body are doing. Rotate your waist to the left and transfer the weight to the left foot. Against topspin, unwind your waist and hit the ball at the top of the bounce(or during the drop) with a forward motion, but remember to just graze the ball as opposed to driving it. Snap your wrist at contact. Against backspin, remember to apply more of an upward motion, but also add a bit of forward force or you could hit your nose in the follow-through!(nothing like defaulting due to a self-inflicted nosebleed eh?:)

, A forward graze will produce higher speeds, but they can only be used on relatively high balls at the top of their bounce. Use something between the all-out topspin loop and extreme backspin pull-up for most rallies. Killer top spins are prone to the net or going off the end line, and excessive usage of the high arcing loop can lead to a deadly smash by your alert opponent. A relaxed posture is doubly important for loops, both your speed and consistency will improve if you can go through the swing 'naturally'. Keep your rubber in good condition; how much spin and control you put on your loop depends upon the tackiness of the rubber. Bad rubber=weak loops(if at all).

, The forearm (form a rough 90 degree bend with the upper arm) should be drawn back to the 3 o'clock position, and let the waist turn naturally along with the arm(this is where relaxing is important). Shift your weight toward the right foot at the same time. While shifting your weight back to your left foot, swing forward with a slight upward motion, with the waist providing additional force in the swing. Use the elbow as a pivot point; it should not move so much up and down, but also should be allowed to move slightly forward in the follow-through. Contact with the ball should be made slightly to the side of the body after the top of the bounce. Make sure the paddle is somewhat closed(or facing downwards at an angle), and remains that way throughout the stroke. Follow-through should finish when racket is parallel with the left shoulder. Immediately return to the ready position. The left foot should be slightly in front of the right for support.

, When following through, contact with the ball is made in front of the body, slightly after the top of the bounce. Let the elbow again act as the pivot point, and snap the forearm forward in a slightly upward direction. Make sure the paddle is closed. Follow-through should finish naturally(about 12~1 o'clock) after contact with ball. The left foot should be slightly ahead of the right.

Join a league or club.",How to Be Good at Ping Pong," You need one with a good head that still has all or most of the grip on it. If you're a beginner, choose a beginner paddle – they're designed for less spin and speed on hard-to-return balls. If you're ready for something a bit more advanced, get a medium-fast blade for optimal control and emphasis on technique.


If you use the European ""shake-hand"" grip, purchase the correct bat as opposed to the Asian ""pen-hold"" grip which has a shorter grip.
When selecting your first bat, do not purchase a bat which is advertised as being extremely spinny and/or powerful, temping though it may be. Know your level. If you don't, it will be detrimental to you as you begin playing.;
, Your body needs to be balanced, relaxed, and ready to move in any direction. In fact, after every stroke, you should aim to return to ready position. Make sure your playing arm is ready to hit the ball, too.


If you have a better forehand, stand a little more to the left and vice versa if you have a stronger backhand.
If you are right-handed, stand generally to you're left with your right foot slightly forward. If you are left handed, stand generally to your right with your left foot slightly forward.

, The ball can go just about anywhere depending on how it is placed and how it is curved. If you stick to your ready stance, you'll have more physical speed at the get-go. Use it! A speedy opponent is often hard to beat.


Stay reasonably fit. Go jogging and do some dynamic stretching before playing to warm your body and reflexes up.

, If you manage to get the ball to land in a corner, it is almost impossible to hit even for experienced players. Edges of the table work, too. However, if you're not skilled enough to aim the ball precisely, don't risk it. You could lose a point if the ball goes off the table.


This can be a highly strategic move when combined with speed. One minute you're sending a fastball to the far edge of the table and the next you're sending a snail just in front of their net on the right ledge. Corners are especially tricky when your opponent doesn't know what to expect.

, Remember this rule: less space means less angle. The lower you send your ball over the net, the harder it is for your opponent to put some fancy angle on the ball. It will also be difficult for them to hit the ball with significant power.


There is, however, an exception to this rule: lobs. In this case, send the ball incredibly high over the net and place it on the very edge of the table, encouraging your opponent to miss.

, There are many fouls and things that are considered points for the other team. For example, if you bounce the ball twice before it goes over it is a loss of point. Also in serving, it is compulsory to throw the ball up 6 inches (15.2 cm) above your hand or it is a foul.


Don't know your fouls? Then you could lose the game anyway – sort of like not knowing that you can't scratch on the 8-ball in pool. Make sure you're familiar with the basic rules of ping-pong before you go into any seriously competitive games.

, Curves can be hard, but once mastered; they can save your game. Here's a few things to keep in mind:Watch the angle of your opponent's racket. If it's moving from low to high, you can expect topspin (spins upward). From high to low, backspin (spins downward). From left to right, ride sidespin, and from right to left, left sidespin.
You can compensate for spin with your racket angle. If you're facing a ball with topspin, angle your racket down and hit to ball above its center. If you're facing a ball with backspin, angle the racket up and hit the ball below its center. If right sidespin, angle the racket to the right and hit the ball on the left. If left, angle the racket to the left and hit the ball on the right.
Master the art of the sidespin, too. This can severely limit your opponent's options when it comes to returning the ball. Experiment with hitting the ball on the right or left and drawing it to center, creating a sidespin. Often the ball won't go where your opponent expects it to go.

, Your whole body is what gives you power – not just your arm or wrist. You need to swift and agile, using your hips and shoulders, too.


To stroke your forehand, rotate your hips and shoulders backwards during the backswing. Then come forward as you complete the swing. This transfer of body weight gives your swing more power and oomph. If also leads to a consistent attack.

, Even if you don't have your technique down 100%, if you play like a madman with no consistency, you'll be able to psych your opponent out. Go deep, go short, use spin, hit it straight, go pure speed, ride the ledge, etc. Keep the competition on its toes.


To make this easier on you, use that ready stance. Be ready to transfer your weight at any point, but especially after serves and in between strokes. Be ready for an attack at any given moment.

, Remember that the ball weighs almost nothing. It's always spinning, too. If you come at it with a tight grip and with hard, stiff force, you're going to kill it in mid-air. Before you get into a game, loosen up your body and your grip. It just needs a light touch, whether the ball comes to you or whether you have to go chasing after it.Relax your mind, too. If you lose control of your temper, you might as well hand over the game. If you've missed several shots in a row, don't get mad – get even. Never give up until the game is over. In ping pong, the tide can turn in a heartbeat., Every racket is different. They all have their own feel and their own unique characteristics. If you want to sit back and relax, playing your top game, use your own racket. You know how to work it and what to expect from it unlike any other. If you use someone else's game, your performance will not be consistent.


Because this racket is like your right arm, take good care of it. Keep it in a case when you're not using it. Wash it with warm soap and water if it has a smooth surface (inverted sponge rubber). Alternatively, use a racket cleaner to keep it in tip-top condition.

, If you need to get to a point where your strokes are consistent, try practicing alone against a wall. Practice each type of shot, working on your spin, length, and speed. This will also help you get a feel for your racket and know exactly what nuance each stroke needs.


You can also use the floor for spins. Practice hitting it downward and getting it to come right back to you. Then move onto different angles, too., Practice doesn't make perfect, but it makes habit. If you're practicing all the time, you'll learn what to expect even from yourself. Your shots will be consistent and you'll be able to aim the ball within an inch of its life. So whether you're practicing alone, with a friend, or competitively, do it.


However, in the beginning, stick to practice and not competing. It's easy to get frustrated with something that seems so simple, even though it's not. There's a reason it's a competitive sport in certain areas of the world.

, When you just start off in a sport or in developing a skill, all your mental energy and focus is going to think it out. In order to relax and truly develop your technique, you'll need to get past that stage. Keep playing until the strokes become automatic and you don't have to think about what you're doing with the ball or where it's going to go.


Think of it like driving. At first, you were so nervous, taking in all the stimuli around you. Now you can drive and not even remember getting there. Ping pong is the same. Just relax and let it happen.

, If the only people you know who play are your uncle and the 8-year-old down the block, your game is never going to improve. Join a league or club in your area to find like-minded individuals that can put your skills to the test. And it doesn't matter your level, either; most clubs welcome all players, from beginner to practically professional.

This way, you can have fun learning how to play. You can play one-on-one, or you can play with two teams of two, which is known as doubles. And you want someone who has regulation ping pong balls, paddles, and a table if you don't have access to any!


If your hand-eye coordination is more on par with a three-legged, blind dog, you might want to start practicing against a wall and getting familiar with how the ball and paddle work together. It's best on a table against the wall, for the record.
You want to play or practice with balls that are orange or white and 40 mm in size. The table should be 2.74 meters (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 meters (5.0 ft) wide, and 0.76 meters (2.5 ft) high.Ping pong paddles don't have a regulation size, actually. Small paddles are hard to use successfully and bigger paddles weigh too much and are cumbersome. But they must be made of wood and rubber and competition paddles must have two colors.;
, There are two commonly-used styles of gripping the paddle: the pen grip (penhold) and the shakehand grip. Regardless of how you grip the paddle, it's important to hold it loosely to allow your wrist to move freely. If your fist is clenched around the handle, most of your force for returns will come from your arm, not your wrist, and you won't be as accurate. Neither grip is rocket science:









With the pen grip, you essentially hold your paddle just as you would hold a pen. With the shakehand grip, you place your hand on the paddle's handle as though you are shaking hands with it, and then wrap your fingers loosely around it. The main thing here is to do what feels most natural for you.

, According to the official International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) rules, the right to choose whether to serve first is determined ""by lot"" (i.e. flipping a coin or drawing straws, etc.), with the winner choosing either whether to serve first or which side he or she wants. If the winner chooses whether to serve or to receive, the opposing player or team gets to choose which side of the table they will play on, and vice versa.


In most recreational ping-pong games, however, the serve is determined by a quick rally, typically with each player spelling out one letter of the word P-I-N-G for each hit they make. After the word P-I-N-G is spelled out, the person to win the rally serves first or chooses which side of the table they wish to play on.

, The ball should be tossed out of your free hand vertically a minimum of 16 cm (6 in), and then hit with the paddle so that it first hits your side of the table once and then goes over the net and hits your opponent's side.









If you're playing singles, the server can serve to any point on the opponent's side of the table, and the opponent should then return it. If playing doubles, the serve is rotated between you and your partner, starting with the person on the right, and the ball must bounce first in the right half of your side of the table and then must be delivered cross-court to your opponent's side.
The serve switches sides every two points. After two points have been awarded, your opponent -- or in doubles, the person on the opposing team who is cross-court from the server -- then gets to serve. After two more points are awarded, the original server (or in doubles, his partner) then serves.
If the ball hits the net on an otherwise a legal serve, the serve is a ""let,"" and the serve is repeated with no points scored. After 2 consecutive lets the player opposite of the server receives the point.
On game point the person that is losing shall be the server.

, After a serve or return, the ball may be returned over or around the net to any point on the opponent's side of the table. The ball must be returned after it bounces once on your side, but before it bounces twice or hits the floor or any object off the table.









If the ball hits the net on a return, but proceeds to go over the net and hit your opponent's side, the ball is still in play, and your opponent must return it.

, A point is awarded for each rally that is not a let, and either opponent can score a point regardless of who served. Here's the gist of it:









If your serve goes into the net, goes off the table without hitting the opponent's side, or (in doubles) hits the wrong half of the opponent's side, the receiving opponent or team scores a point.
If you do not make a legal return (as described above -- the ball goes into the net or doesn't hit your opponent's side of the table) a point is awarded to your opponent.
If you receive a legal serve or return and hit the ball more than once with your paddle or touch the ball with your body, a point is awarded to your opponent. Note that if your opponent's serve or return doesn't hit your side of the table, you still get the point even if the ball hits you or you catch it after it passes the end of the table.
If you touch the table with your free hand or move the table, your opponent scores a point.

, Many people like to play to 21 or 15 (alternating server every 5 points), which is fine for recreational play. The official rules, however, state play is to 11 points (alternating server every 2 points). In order to win, one must be ahead by two points. If the players or teams are tied at 10-10 or 20-20, for example, the normal order of service proceeds, but the serve alternates sides after every points instead of after every two points.

, In sanctioned competition, matches are won by the player or team who wins two out of three games. The players switch sides after each game, and they also switch sides in the third game (if a third game is necessary) when one player or team scores five points.


The team or player serving first also changes each game. Generally, things stay as even as possible. No player should have an advantage over the other.

, You can become a pretty good ping-pong player quickly with consistent practice. The most important things to practice initially are keeping your eye on the ball, getting a feel for the correct timing, and keeping the ball low.









From the very first time you pick up a paddle, you should consciously make an effort to follow the ball with your eyes, from the moment it is served to when it hits your paddle, and so on.
Your timing will become better with practice -- you just need to get used to it -- but it helps if you listen to the ball as well as watch it closely.
Keeping the ball low -- without hitting it into the net -- is probably the hardest skill for beginners to master. It's also one of the most essential, because a high ball can easily be smashed down by your opponent. Try to keep your paddle as horizontal as possible and use your wrist to impart energy to the ball and to aim it. Generally, the faster the ball is moving, the easier it is to keep it low.

, You must be able to hit the ball from either side of your body if you want to become good at table tennis, and it's generally not practical to switch hands, so get comfortable with both your forehand and backhand shots.








, This is done by flicking the wrist side-to-side or up-and-down right as the ball is hit. To counter-spin, put spin of your own on the ball. If you have some downtime, practice this against a wall, experimenting with what works for you.









Think of chopping the ball -- undercutting the bottom side as it comes to you on its descent. This will spin the ball, slow it down, and throw it on a new trajectory. Experiment doing this with your forehand and backhand strike.

, Smashing (also called slamming or spiking) the ball entails hitting it with force so that it goes fast enough to, hopefully, be unreturnable. A slam is a powerful weapon, but it can be difficult at first to use it accurately, and you may find that your slams initially go into the net or well off the other side of the table. Don't be afraid to keep trying them, though. You'll eventually get it.









This is similar to volleyball. Once you slam, smash, or spike the ball, it's virtually impossible for your opponent to keep the ball in play. This will be one of your most used skills when you cultivate it -- and the most frustrating for your opponent.

, A fast serve or a serve with plenty of spin on it can become the key to your game as you face better players. If you give your opponent an easy serve, you'll be lucky to get a paddle on his return. An easy serve gives him time to wind up and blast you with a slam that you won't even see coming.









Speed is definitely important as you move up the ranks, but you have to maintain aim and precision. As you get better and better, you'll be able to predict where the ball will go and how it will behave with each strike.

, As you face better competition, you can't just expect your opponent to make mistakes, even if you're hitting the ball hard. You've got to force errors by taking control of the game and making your opponent move around the table a lot. If you can hit one shot off the right side and then quickly hit another shot to the left side you might be able to prevent your opponent from getting the ball. Tricks, such as giving the appearance of a slam and then dunking the ball, or getting into a right-left pattern and then hitting two or three consecutive shots to the right, can also put your opponent off-balance and in position for a slam.








, Professional players generally stand a little farther back from the table, and as you begin to get into faster rallies, you may find this is a good technique as well. The ball is coming so fast and so hard, standing farther back is the only way to continue the rally. And if your opponent favors a side, you should favor the same side as well.


In addition to stance, they have different equipment sometimes, too. There are a wide variety of ping-pong paddles available, and while the cheap ones at your local sporting discount store are just fine for beginners, as you get more advanced you may want to get your own custom paddle.

, Once you've been playing for a bit, you'll automatically notice what your strengths and weaknesses are. Then, you'll pick a strategy that plays up your strengths and plays down your weaknesses. Here's the four common styles of players:



Control players. Just like their name says, they like to have control at all times and thus rarely take risks. They don't smash all too often and keep it traditional.

Defensive players. This type of player tries to make their opponent make mistakes as opposed to focusing on their own game.

Offensive players. This player is generally pretty aggressive, focusing on topspin and consistency. They can place the ball very well and clearly understand spin.

Power players. No fooling here, power players rely mainly on speed to trip their opponents up.

, As you play your opponent, you'll be able to get a read on what kind of player they are. They'll generally prefer a certain type of stroke and always come back to a default way of play. Here are some things to look for:


The counter driver stroke is when solid contact is made with the ball (little to no spin) at the top of the bounce. A player who favors this is best defeated by a mid-table shot -- where they have to quick decide between their forehand and their backhand.
The chop stroke is when the underside of the ball is cut during its descent. The amount of spin can vary. To combat this, work the middle and above all, be patient. Alternating your shots will keep them from becoming comfortable.
Blockers are defensive players. They don't like attacking, so force them to. Vary between short and long shots, and switch up your style. Don't use all your power so they have to.
The ""loop"" is a shot that starts in your legs with your shoulders dropped, ending up in a strike that forces the ball slightly upward and giving it underspin. If you run into this player, be aggressive. Get them playing defense, which is generally not their forte.
Players who grip the paddle in the penholding position generally have very strong forehand strokes and weaker backhand strokes. However, knowing this, they usually have very good footwork. You'll have to force their backhand out quite wide and keep it varied so they don't know to stay on the edge of the table.

, Regardless of who you're playing, it's a good idea to have a few ideas brewing in that cranium of yours. The element of surprise is incredibly important in this game. Latch onto it and a win will be yours.


Be sure to vary your spin and strokes. Good players will be able to read you like a book and know exactly what you're going to do next. They see how you like to hit the ball, where you like to hit the ball, and how you handle different set-ups. To avoid this, vary up your style. Vary your spin, the height you give the ball, and the speed you use in your strokes. Keep 'em on their toes.
Be able to place the ball outside of your opponent's ""power zone."" If you're facing an opponent with a ""shakehand"" grip, their power zone is within arm's reach of their forehand and near their body on their backhand. Playing in the middle and out wide (purposefully) can zero in on your opponent's weaknesses. But don't take this guide's word for it -- look for weak spots yourself!

, Ping pong is taken very seriously in some circles. If you're looking for a bit of inspiration, look to online videos -- tutorials, tournaments, or otherwise. Maybe your next stop will be the Olympics!


Ping pong is a game that requires hours of practice. Look for clubs or leagues in your area, or find a group of interested friends that are looking to get competitive. Since it requires very little initial skill, it's usually not hard to find people willing to play.
If you do take this seriously, you'll play your best when you're energized and alert. Because of this, always get plenty of sleep and eat well! You need all your senses to be at 100%.

Set a hair dryer to a hot setting.,
Hold the ping pong ball in the stream of hot air.,
Wait until the ball expands.,
Suspend the ball in a tissue (optional).",How to Fix a Dented Ping Pong Ball2," Just like the boiling water method, this uses heat to expand the air inside the ping pong ball.


The fast-moving air also has a lower pressure.This makes it easier for the air inside the ping pong ball to push outward.

, Hold the ping pong ball in your bare hand. Ping pong balls are flammable, but the risk of burning is low as long as it's not too hot to hold. Blow dryer temperatures vary, but this will probably work fine at a distance of 6–8 inches (15–20cm).


Alternatively, just point the hairdryer straight up and levitate the ball in the stream of air.
The ball is very unlikely to burn if it is held in air. It might burn if you leave it on a surface, and hold the dryer too close.

, It may help to hold the ball so the dent is opposite the hair dryer. It may be wise to turn the dryer off and let the ball cool periodically, to help prevent deformities.


The repaired ball will be a little ""off"" in size and shape compared to a new ball.

, To avoid sagging as the ball cools, wrap it in a tissue and hang it from a nail for a few minutes. Since the hot air was not as hot as boiling water, this may not be necessary.

Spot your opponent some points.,
Play with your left hand (if you are right-handed).

,
Change your grip from shake-hands to pen-holder or vice versa.

,
Practice your defensive game and use just back spins, pushes and blocks.,
Avoid using the smash and instead use pushes, drop shots, lobs, loops, slices, chops, blocks, flicks etc.

,
Switch bats to one with the pips out or a beginner's bat.,
Stay close to the table and develop that part of the game.",How to Make Table Tennis Competitive Against A Weaker Player,";
,,, This will make the game even and will improve your overall game. Most champions are mostly aggressive and use topspin, but this player probably has a very good chop which he uses sometimes in his play mix.

,, This is a good equalizer and the next best choice after ""playing with your left hand"".

, It is a disadvantage to stay close to the table all the time for most players. Here it is concentration, anticipation and speed.

Figure out what grip you want to use.,
Start with a basic plastic or wood paddle.,
Buy a ready-made commercial paddle.,
Try out a competition paddle.,
Play with a rubberized paddle to increase control.,
Look at different rubber textures.,
Consider how thick you want the rubber sponge to be.,
Replace your paddle or rubber when it becomes worn out.,
Select your own custom materials.,
Choose a paddle that’s designed for your preferred grip.,
Decide whether you want rubber on one or both sides of the paddle.,
Experiment with different sizes and weights.",How to Choose a Ping Pong Paddle," Think about the way you play and how different types of paddles might influence your performance. Decide which of the traditional grips is more comfortable for you. The most common grip in the West is the “shakehand” grip, which takes its name from the similarities in the way of holding your play hand to shaking hands with someone you just met. Other players might feel more in control when utilizing a “penhold” grip, in which the handle is gripped between the thumb and forefinger like a pen with the paddle held downwards.Try serving and returning the ball a few times with each grip before deciding which is better suited for your game.
A shake hands grip will allow you to make returns with more force, as well as put spin on the ball, while playing with a penhold grip puts the arm in a more natural position to use quick, brushing strokes.;
, Pick up the cheapest paddle you can find when you’re first learning how to play. These basic paddles are usually made from one piece of molded plastic or a few thin layers of wood and offer no frills in terms of function or aesthetics. They can be very helpful when you’re just starting out, though, and you won’t have to break the bank buying a more expensive paddle that you aren’t enough good enough to take advantage of.A cheap, plain paddle can actually teach you to be more precise, as you’ll be forced to make sure you’re hitting the ball directly each and every time you serve and return.

, Take a stroll through the tabletop games section of any sporting goods store to find a garden variety packaged ping pong paddle. These paddles are typically made taking a cookie cutter approach, with the same dimensions, materials and unsophisticated rubberized surface layer. For most recreational players, a basic store-bought paddle will be all they’ll ever need.Ping pong is more about technique than it is about equipment. A good player can dominate with a store-bought paddle.
Commercial paddles can be purchased cheap and are sometimes sold in pairs or packaged with ping pong balls included.

, If you find yourself going through commercial paddles too quickly or you’re just looking for something a little more heavy duty, pick up a competition grade paddle. The official table tennis rulebook specifies that competition paddles be mad up of at least 85% natural wood, so they’ll have a bit of heft to them. Competition paddles are also put together using higher quality rubbers and adhesives, meaning they’ll last longer and hold up better to intense play.Professional paddles can usually be bought in the same places that sell basic commercial paddles, or you can order them online.

, Make sure the paddle you’re playing with has rubber attached to at least one side. Most ping pong paddles have a thin sheet of rubber glued to the flat surface of the paddle. This adds traction to the face of the paddle and gives you more control over the ball. If your play style involves using a lot of spin to switch up the speed and direction of the ball, it’s important that you find a paddle with some good, grippy rubber.Having control over the ball means making it go where you want at the speed you want, without having to worry about the ball sliding or deflecting off the paddle.
Almost all ping pong paddles are rubberized these days. However, the quality, durability and play characteristics of rubbers can vary greatly.

, Play with a textured paddle to change the way you handle the ball. In addition to the rubber layer, some paddles also have textures known as “pimples,” “dimples” or “waffling” that grip the ball and help it stick briefly after it makes contact. For defensive players and people who like to decide the pace of a game, a textured paddle can make a big difference.With a textured paddle, you’ll have additional traction but give up a little bit of speed and reactivity on returns.
Deep textures are not recommended for players who use a lot of spin techniques.

, Decide whether you’d play better with a thicker or thinner rubber sponge. The sponge lies beneath the outer surface of the rubber to absorb impact and offer grip and control. It also changes the speed with which the ball can be returned. Thicker sponges make the paddle heavier and more dense, which lets you hit the ball with more speed. Thin layers of rubber, on the other hand, provide sensitivity and let you slow things down a bit.In addition to the type, softness and texture of the rubber, you have a choice of how thick you want the sponge.

, The more you play with a paddle, the fast the rubber surface will begin to show signs of wear. When this happens, either replace the rubber and sponge or drop some money on a new paddle. Rubber that has been worn thin loses a lot of its grippiness and spring, which will compromise your technique.Look for places where the texturing is thinned out or feels less pronounced to the touch.
If you tend to use commercial paddles, buy a new one once the old one is past its prime. If you play with a custom paddle, strip off the worn out rubber and attach a new one.

, More experienced players often pick and choose the materials that go into building their paddles to fine-tune their performance. Customize your paddle by deciding what type of wood you’d like to use for the construction, narrowing down a rubber that gives you the right balance of speed and control and incorporating other materials that alter the paddle’s specs. Built your ideal paddle by selecting and assembling each part individually.Other materials used in ping pong paddles include carbon fibers, which increase the strength of the paddle and gives it extra snap, and compressed paper, which reduces the paddle’s weight.
After you’ve been playing long enough, you’ll start to form an idea of exactly what kind of paddle you need to be at your best.

, All ping pong paddles have the same basic shape, but certain types vary the width of the blade or the length and design of the handle to be better for specific play styles. For a classic shake hands grip, find a paddle with a thick, sturdy handle to give your stroke some authority. If you play with the penhold hand position, choose a lighter weight paddle with a longer, more narrow handle that permits quick brushing motions of the wrist.Some paddles are designed specially for players who favor a penhold grip. These paddles are longer and more ergonomic, and sometimes even include an extra fin of wood around the handle for added security., You’ve found a wooden blade you like, but do you rubberize just one side of the paddle or both? This is mostly a matter of preference. An additional rubber and sponge will add to the overall weight of the paddle, but you’ll have more control when alternating between forehand and backhand strokes. You might also choose to rubberize both sides of the paddle, but use a different texture and thickness for each side. That way, you’ll be able to switch between both sides of the paddle when you need to make different shots.Competitive players often use two different rubbers on their paddles, each with slightly different properties for more versatile strategies., Ping pong paddles are available in lots of sizes, shapes and styles. It can be worth trying out a few different types before settling on one you really like. Heavier paddles are better for offensive players who use quickness to win games, while lighter, more flexible paddles allow defensive players to regulate the speed and direction of the ball. Play with paddles of various weights and dimensions whenever you get the chance until you find out what works best for you.The weight of a paddle is determined by its thickness. Thicker paddles let you drive the ball with greater speed but sacrifice control. Thinner paddles offer the most control over the ball but tend to return a little slower.Each type of paddle has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Again, it's about learning your strengths and weakness as a player and finding a paddle that is suitable for you.

Develop your fundamentals.,
Learn the responsibilities of your position.,
Practice hard.,
Stay healthy.,
Stay hydrated during workouts.,
Listen to your coach.,
Communicate on the field.,
Push through the pain.",How to Be a Good Player1," If you want to be a good team player, you've got to work first on being a good all-around athlete, spending time building the fundamental skills necessary to your sport. If you want to be a great basketball player, that means spending time dribbling, developing your defensive skills, and learning to make crisp passes. If you want to be a great soccer player, you've got to learn to control the ball, shoot accurately, and move to space.


It's fun to just get out there and play the sport you play, but doing drills is an essential part of practicing. Instead of just shooting hoops, practice some of the dribbling drills you do in practice, or working on other defensive training drills that you learned from the coaches. Working on building the less-fun skills will help you to stand out and become a stronger player.;
, Playing a team means filling a specific role. Unlike being a tennis player or a golfer, playing as a part of a team means filling a role. It's not every football player's job to score touchdowns, and it's not every soccer player's job to shoot goals. Being a good player means learning the specific responsibilities and role of your position, and studying how best to fill that role.


Learn where you need to be on the field and what your specific job should be. If you're playing defense, figure how you select an opponent to mark up against. If you're controlling the ball, how can you best distribute it around the field?
When you're first learning how to play a sport, most of us want to go for the glamorous positions: quarterback, striker, point guard. A great team, though, is a team made up of role-players who play the positions for which they're most suited. If you're a great defender, don't waste energy being envious of the offensive positions. Embrace your role and commit to improving your skills.

, Showing up to practice and giving every single workout your best effort is a critical part of being a good team player. Practice hard and you'll improve your skills and your knowledge of the game, setting you and your team up for success.


Show up on time to practice and be prepared to work. Have your gear ready and plenty of water. Start stretching out and getting ready to work.
Have a good attitude about practice. Some athletes have lots of talent, but look like they'd rather be at home playing video games than building skills with teammates. Be a better player than that.
Leave all your grit and effort on the practice field. If you pull up and take it easy when you're supposed to be lifting weights, running laps, or doing drills, you're going to be slower, weaker, and less talented than your opponents. Bring it to practice.

, Even if you're a great athlete, you can't be a good player if you're spending all your time healing from injuries and recovering on the bench. It's very important to take care of your body and stay healthy and in-shape to compete in games and give your team the best chance of winning, game in and game out.


Warm up before you practice and cool down afterward, every time. Never run onto the field without stretching and warming up your body for hard work. Good players should also take several minutes to stretch out after practice, to avoid cramping and soreness.
Get enough rest between workouts. If you've got to practice tomorrow, you shouldn't be staying up until the wee hours of the morning playing Xbox and chatting online. Get enough sleep, at least 8 hours, and allow your body ample time to recover and rest before putting it to the test again tomorrow.

, A study of NFL players found that almost 98% were dehydrated before workouts, which can lower performance levels by as much as 25%.Sports drinks and plain water are an important part of maintaining electrolytes and hydration, giving you the energy to perform at your highest level and stay healthy. Before working out, drink 15 or 20 ounces of water, and try to drink about 8 ounce of water every 15 minutes during practice. Drink slowly to avoid upsetting your stomach during intense workouts.

, Good players need to be coachable, which means you've got to learn to take criticism and apply new lessons to getting better and improving your skills on the field. Coaches aren't there to tell everyone that they're doing a great job and that everyone's going to end up going pro. Coaches are there to make you a better athlete and train you to win. Sometimes, that might mean you'll hear some suggestions and criticisms.Bad players fold up and get frustrated when they receive criticism and good players will listen and take lessons from it. If your coach calls you out for your sloppy squats during a workout, you could get moody, or you could say, ""Yes, coach!"" and sweat a little harder.
Never argue with your coach, especially in front of the other players. If you've got a problem with strategy, or something the coach told you in practice, set up a private talk about chat about it alone. Good players should never question the authority of the coach in front of the team.

, Teams need to be organized and coordinated to win. Silent teams lose and talkative teams improve their chances of winning. Cheering for other players, calling for the ball, and communicating clearly about players and strategy is a critical part of team success. Make it your goal to be louder than the other team at all times.


It's important to talk to your teammates, but try to avoid trash-talking the other team. Unless it's absolutely necessary to talk some smack as a way of motivating your teammates. Then, go for it, but be gentle.

, Training isn't always fun, and games can be crazy-exhausting. But good players–great players–learn to push the pain of training into the back of their mind and fight through it. When you're exhausted at the end of the game and the ball springs free between you and the goal, you could jog toward it tiredly, or you could dig deep and sprint. Good players sprint.


Find ways to stay motivated and fire up for games so that you'll be energetic and enthusiastic to fight for the whole game. Play some loud music that gets you pumped, or fire yourself up with a sports movie, or other team-building exercise that you enjoy.

Lose with dignity and win with class.,
Follow the rules and play clean.,
Play with passion.,
Don't show off.,
Don't argue with the officials.",How to Be a Good Player2," All games will come down to the final minute and you'll find out if all your hard work was enough to win, or if you've still got more work to put into it. Good players are tested at the moment the last whistle blows. Are you going to handle it with quiet dignity? Or are you going to be sore? Sportsmanship starts with knowing how to win gracefully and how to lose just as gracefully.


When you win, it's perfectly fine to celebrate, but never ok to taunt the opposing side. Be happy that you won, but never rub it in. Congratulate and compliment the other players for a job well-done and stay positive about the experience.
When you lose, it's ok to be disappointed. No one likes to lose. But don't sulk, make excuses, or lash out at the opposing team or your teammates. Treat each loss as a learning experience. What can you take from the game to use to improve for the next? What could you have done better?

, Good players don't take shortcuts, or even look for them. Good players recognize that games aren't all about winning or losing, but about how you win or how you lose. You need to be able to look back at your performance with pride, regardless of the outcome. Hold yourself accountable.


In many team sports, the rules are a regularly changing thing. Learn the rules and study them, staying up to date on the newest and most recent rules.

, Good players run on passion and emotion when they're on the field, using their desire to succeed drive them. For some players, coming up with a good storyline or a good dramatic angle to the game is an important way of getting passionate. Saying ""It's just a game"" is a good way of going half-speed through the rest of the game. Michael Jordan used to invent slights and insults from his opponents, making it personal. He made each game a chance to show up his opponents and prove them wrong (even if they hadn't said anything to begin with).


Don't let your emotions take over and push you to poor sportsmanship. Play passionately, not angrily. Practice turning it on and turning it off when you're on the field only. As soon as the game is over, let it be over.

, Putting your skills on display to impress other players, observers, or opponents is bad sportsmanship. While it's common to get wrapped up in the competitiveness of the moment and want to do well, good players don't need to show off to prove their ability or to feel better about their skills. Know that you're talented and that you're a good player without the need of running up scores, embarrassing other players, and hamming it up for the fans.


One good team technique to get in the habit of practicing is to learn to pull back if you're winning by many points. On the soccer field, if your team is up by more than six goals, start making a rule that no one can shoot until every single player on the field has touched the ball. Use the opportunity to work on your ball handling. Make the game more challenging for yourself.

, When the referees make a call, specifically a call against you or one of your teammates, don't argue. Follow their instructions to the letter and speak to the officials respectfully. Talking back or arguing can make the punishments worse, displaying bad sportsmanship.When you address the officials, use the word ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"" and try to calm yourself, if you're frustrated. Take a second to take a deep breath and check your emotions before you open your mouth.

"
"
Lead by example.,
Learn to motivate your teammates.,
Never make excuses or blame teammates for failures.,
Be loud on the sideline.,
Leave it all on the field.",How to Be a Good Player3," Being a leader doesn't necessarily mean being the most talkative, giving corny motivational speeches at halftime. Silent and stoic or loud and inspirational, leaders come in all forms, but have one thing in common. Leaders lead by example. You need to practice what you preach, putting lots of effort into your game and improving your play. When other teammates see you leaving everything on the field, doing that extra rep, running when your tank is expired, they'll be motivated to do the same. Go 100% all the time.


As a team leader, remember that you're not a coach. It's not your job to tell other players what to do, it's your job to be a good player. If others are motivated by your performance, all the better. If not, just focus on your own skills and in doing the best job you can do.

, Teams are only as fast as the slowest player, a chain as strong as the weakest link. Try to identify your teammates that need a little extra and help them out by pairing up during partner drills, or cheering them on during practice. If you're a strong player, you might automatically gravitate toward other strong players, but try to spend time with younger teammates who might need to learn more. It'll mean a lot to them and make you stand out as a leader.


Cheer on your teammates, clapping and encouraging the players when something goes right, and when you see other players getting frustrated with the way something is going. Take control of the morale of your team and encourage them toward success.
Different teams have different dynamics, meaning that there's no one way to motivate other players. Some good players may need motivated with some reverse psychology: ""You can just sit this one out if you're feeling tired. Maybe it'd be better to let one of the freshman play instead?"" Likewise, some unconfident players might need encouragement to improve their play: ""You're looking like an upperclassman out there. Keep it up, kid.""

, Morale can sink quickly with a loss, but if you get into the blame-game, it can sink a whole lot lower. Never throw other players under the bus for losses, or make excuses for your own play. It wasn't the officials, or the weather, or the subs fault that your team lost. It was the team's.


If it was obvious that one player had a particularly bad game, it's not necessary to talk about it. If that player looks particularly down, take them aside and give them a slap on the back. Get their head straight by reassuring them it's not their fault.
If one of your teammates gets punished for breaking a rule, take it upon yourself to serve out the punishment with the rest of the team. If one player gets a yellow card and has to run laps at the next practice, run laps with them. Get the other players to do the same. Come tougher as a team and act as one.

, Leaders should be hollering and cheering, invested in every game as if it were the Super Bowl. Cheer on your teammates and encourage them even when you're not on the field giving it your all. Get your other teammates invested in the outcome of the game, even if they're not playing. Support everyone and be loud.

, Each time you go out to play, inspire your teammates by leaving everything you've got out there on the field. 110% every time you play. Push through the pain, rely on your training, and make sure that you never finish a game wondering if you could have played harder. Sweat and grit it out to give your team the best chance of winning.

Learn the rules.,
Start practicing about two months or so before tryouts.,
Do arm strengthening exercises like push-ups.,
Consider attending a volleyball summer camp the summer before trying out.,
Get to know the coach's expectations.,
Arrive 20 minutes before the tryouts.,
Try out and think positive.,
Get noticed during tryouts.,
Don't be disappointed if you don't make it.,
If there's a problem, be open with your coach.,
Maintain a good attitude.,
Be team-spirited.",How to Make Your School's Volleyball Team," Obviously, the coach isn't going to pick someone who always double touches and runs into the net. Search for the ""rules of volleyball"" online to see if any good websites that have the rules listed come up. Focus on sites that have rules relevant to your part of the world; variations may exist elsewhere.;
, Practice about 60 minutes daily.Practice all the basic volleyball moves before the try-outs. Practice setting, spiking, bumping, blocking, and serving.


Practice by yourself as well as with others. Set/bump against the wall, practice your serves, and jump rope. Jog daily, but not for too long, because long distance running damages your vertical jump., These will help your serves and hits. If you are strong, the coach will probably accept you on the team.

, This will give you a lot skills without the pressured level of expectation. Plus, you'll have a ton of fun.

, If the coach is expecting everyone to get their serves over, you had better work on serving. Almost all coaches will want to see how good you are at the fundamental skills. Try to show the coach these fundamentals in try-outs.

, This will give you time to check out the atmosphere, watch players and feel relaxed.

, If you think you can hit it, you are more likely to follow through on your internal confidence.


Always go for the ball in try-outs, otherwise, how will the coach know how good you are at passing? Also, remember to call the ball.
Overhand serves are more preferred, but if you have the right fundamentals the coach might work with you.
Don't talk about how bad you are at hitting, etc. Such negativity is a total downer and a coach will likely avoid someone who shows such a lack of confidence from the outset.

, Volunteer when the coach asks for volunteers, wear brightly colored clothes. Act overall peppy and the coach will definitely notice you.


Be sure to ask questions. This will show your coach you want to get better and care if you are doing something wrong.
When the coach calls for you to shag up the balls, be the first to be out on the court running and shag the balls.
When the ball is coming toward you yell ""Mine!"" or ""Got it!"" to let other members know that you have the ball and they won't go after it. Your coach might even be impressed.

, Just remember, there's always next year, and practice makes perfect!

, Coaches like to know what's going on and they'll appreciate your honesty. If you have a minor injury but are still going to play, then tell them before tryouts start so that she'll understand if you need to take a break instead of thinking that you're not trying your hardest.

, Coaches look for upbeat and can-do attitudes in sport. And listen to what the coach says. They appreciate it when you listen. If the coach says to change something the next time you do it, your main focus should be on changing what the coach told you. It shows the coaches that you are willing to listen and learn.

, Encourage others around you to do their best. Be prepared to talk to your teammates. It's very important in volleyball to communicate with your team and the sooner you are known as someone willing to do this, the sooner people will rely on you. A team player who is reliable and relied upon is valuable and will be kept as part of the team. You may even make team captain if you keep the good attitude!

Check for a hoop with a red mark on top.",How to Set up Croquet1," While croquet can be played on any lawn, the balls will travel faster and more smoothly over short grass. If possible, find a flat lawn without many slopes, patches of uneven ground, or other obstructions. This croquet setup is popular all around the world, and is used for tournaments in the U.K. and Commonwealth.;
, If you are playing with adults on a large, flat lawn, measure 14 meters (46 feet) using a tape measure.If your lawn is smaller, has high or uneven grass, or if you are playing with children, try 10m (33 ft), 7m (23 ft), or any measurement that fits.

, If you have extra stakes or flags, place one on each side of this line to demonstrate the boundary of the court. You may also use a stick, rock, or any other noticeable object. For a more precise boundary, tie a length of string between them.

, The croquet playing field is rectangular, with the long side 1.25 times as long as the short side. Starting from one boundary marker, walk at a right angle to the first line while measuring with the tape measure. Once you reach a distance 1.25 times as long as the short side, stop.


If you are using a full size garden croquet field, your field's measurements will be 14m x 17.5m. Other possible sizes include 10m x 12.5m (33ft x 41.25ft) or 7m x 8.75m (23ft x 28.75ft).

, As before, use a flag, stick or other object to mark the corner of this boundary. If you have a string, stretch it between this marker and the last one you put down.

, From the end of the long line, turn at a right angle and create another short side parallel to the first one. Place the fourth boundary marker to create the last corner. Stretch a string between this boundary marker and the two nearest markers. If the rectangle doesn't look even, you may move one of the boundary markers to make the sides parallel.

, Stretch a long length of string across opposite diagonal corners of the rectangle. Do the same between the other two corners. The point where the strings cross is the center of the field. Put down a stake or stick to mark this point. Do not use a hoop in this position.


Alternatively, use a tape measure to find and mark the center of one long side, and the center of one short side. Have two people walk in a straight line from these two points, into the field. The point where their paths cross is the center of the field.

, From any corner, walk along the short side of the field until you have walked across roughly 1/4 of the field's shorter length, counting your paces. Turn at a right angle and walk into the field the same number of paces.


You may use a tape measure instead if you would like to be more precise.

, It is important to remember how many paces you walked. If you used a tape measure, write down the distance measured instead, which should be 1/4 the length of the shorter side.

, Some croquet sets have one hoop (wicket) with a blue top to mark it as the first one; if your hoops are unmarked, use any one of them.Place the two prongs of the hoop firmly into the lawn so the hoop stays upright. The prongs should be placed parallel to the shorter sides, so you can look through the hoop if you stand on the shorter side.


Use a croquet mallet to tap the hoop into the ground if it won't stay up on its own.

, Place three more hoops using the same method, but starting at the remaining three corners. Walk the same number of paces (or measure the same distance of 1/4 the short side) as you did when you placed the first hoop. Every hoop should be placed with its opening facing the short sides.

, Ideally, the hoops should form four corners of a rectangle, with the center stake at its center. Move one or two hoops if necessary to achieve a better approximation of this situation. On many lawns with uneven ground, slopes, or vegetation, the setup will not be possible to achieve. Fortunately, the field doesn't need to be perfectly set up for a casual game.

, Stand at the center stake, then walk in a straight line toward one of the short sides (parallel to the long sides). Once you've walked the same number of paces or distance you noted down earlier (approximately 1/4 the length of a short side), place a hoop in the ground. Keep the opening facing the short sides of the field, as you did with the other hoops.

, Return to the center stake and measure an equal distance or number of paces in the other direction. Place a hoop here. The opening should be in a line with the last hoop you put down, and this line should be parallel to the longer sides of the field.

, Some croquet sets have a single hoop with a red mark on top. This is the last hoop in the sequence. Out of the last two hoops you placed, on either side of the center stake, it should be the one farthest from the starting hoop (the blue one, or the first one you put down). If you used the red hoop somewhere else, you may want to switch it with the hoop in this final position.

Create a field for 9 hoop croquet on any lawn.,
Measure the short side of your playing field with a tape measure.,
Make a boundary at either end of this line.,
Measure a second side twice as long as the first.,
Create another corner with a boundary marker.,
Complete your field with one more boundary marker.,
Drive a hoop (wicket) into the ground at the exact center of the field.,
Decide which ends are ""north"" and ""south"".,
Walk from the center hoop toward the north end of the field.,
Place a hoop at this location.,
Find the next hoop's location by walking an equal distance between the center and the south end.,
Place another hoop slightly farther in the same direction.,
Continue on the same short distance and place the south stake.,
Mirror this setup on the north side.,
Return to the center hoop and walk diagonally ""southeast"" to locate the next hoop.,
Place the last three hoops by walking in the other diagonal directions.",How to Set up Croquet2," A flat lawn with short grass is best for croquet, but if none is available, you may play croquet on any lawn. Vegetation or high grass may stop the croquet balls and make the game harder to play. While there are many variations of croquet played all around the world, this version is more commonly played in the United States.

, If you have a large, flat lawn with short, evenly mowed grass, you could measure a full size American (9 hoop) court with the short side equal to 50 feet (15.2m).However, for inexperienced players or less than perfect lawns, a smaller size is recommended. Try 30 ft. (9.1m), 25 ft. (7.6m), or any other measurement that fits.


Not that the long side will be twice as long as this measurement. You may want to pick a smaller size in order to fit the playing field on your lawn.

, Place a rock, stake, or flag on either end of this line. If you have string, tie it between the two markers or lay it on the ground to create a boundary.

, The croquet playing field is rectangular, and in the nine hoop version the long side is twice as long as the short side. Starting from one boundary marker, walk at a right angle to the first line while measuring with the tape measure. Once you reach a distance twice as long as the short side, stop.


For a full size 9-hoop garden croquet lawn, your final measurements will be 50 ft x 100 ft (15.2m x 30.4m).
Other possible measurements include 30 ft x 60 ft (9.1m x 18.2m), or 25 ft x 50 ft (7.6m x 15.2m).

, As before, use a flag, stick or other object to mark the corner of this boundary at the end of the line you just measured. If you have a string, stretch it between this marker and the last one you put down.

, From the end of the long line, turn at a right angle and create another short side parallel to the first one. Place the fourth boundary marker to create the last corner. Stretch a string between this boundary marker and the two nearest markers. If the rectangle doesn't look even, you may move one of the boundary markers to make the sides parallel.

, One way to locate the center of the field is to stretch two strings across the field diagonally, each one between opposite diagonal corners. At the location where the strings cross, drive the two prongs of the hoop firmly into the ground to create an arch. The opening should face toward the short ends of the field.


Alternatively, measure the center points of one short side and one long side, then have two people walk at right angles from each point. The point where their paths cross is the center of the field.

, One of the shorter sides of the field will be called the ""north"" end, and the opposite short side will be called the ""south"" end. It does not matter where actual compass north is; this is just terminology to make the court easy to describe.


The longer sides are the ""west"" and ""east"" sides, as if you were looking at a map with the ""north"" end of the field at the top.
The players will be starting on the ""south"" side of the court. However, the players move back and forth across the entire court, so even if the ground is sloped it won't make much difference which end is which.

, If you are using a full size field (50ft x 100ft, or 15.2m x 30.4m) and want to use precise measurements, measure out 32 ft (9.75m) with a tape measure.Otherwise, scale down this measurement to the same proportion as your field's side, or simply walk approximately 3/5 of the distance to the north end while counting your paces. Walk in a straight line, parallel with the long sides of the field.


The 9 hoop game has several variant setups with the hoops at different distances from the center hoop. The general shape of the setup is more important than the exact numbers involved.

, Once you've measured the correct distance, or walked approximately 3/5 of the way between the center and the north side, put a hoop down. As with all the hoops you'll be putting down, the opening should be facing the ""north"" and ""south"" ends of the field.

, The next hoop will be exactly opposite the last one. Return to the center hoop and walk an equal distance south, approximately 3/5 of the way to the south side of the field.


If you are counting your paces instead of using a tape measure, use the same number of paces you did to locate the previous hoop.

, Continue walking south 6 feet (1.8m) for a full size field, 3 ft (0.9m) for a half size field, or simply estimate a reasonable distance by walking four paces. Place the hoop here, with the opening of the arch facing the shorter ends of the field as always.

, Walk an additional four paces, 6 ft. (1.8m), or whichever measurement you used in the last step. Place a stake here, not a hoop. If your croquet set did not come with stakes, use a large, noticeable stick or flag planted upright in the ground.

, Return to the stake closest to the north end of the field. Place a second hoop and then a stake a few paces further north of it, in a line with the center hoop and with the southern line of hoops and stakes. Use the same distance between hoops and stakes that you did on the southern end of the field.


Walking from the north end of the field southward, you should cross a stake, two hoops, a long distance, the center hoop, a long distance, two hoops, and a stake.

, At the center stake, face the line of two hoops and a stake you just put down, then turn 45º to the left and walk toward the long ""east"" side of the field. Stop when the center stake and the nearest southern hoop are at equal distances from you, and you are a few paces from the eastern edge of the field. Place a new hoop at this location.


On a full size field, this hoop will be 6 feet (1.8m) from the eastern edge of the field.

, Return to the center hoop and find the location of the final three hoops by walking southwest, northwest, and northeast at a 45º angle. Try to walk at the same angle and for the same distance each time. You should end up with four hoops in a square pattern, each corner near a western or eastern side of the field.

Divide into teams or play individually.,
Place the first ball halfway a few paces from the starting hoop.,
Take turns hitting the balls with a mallet.,
Try to hit the ball through the hoops in order.,
Earn an extra shot by making it through a hoop (optional).,
Earn two extra shots by hitting your opponents' balls (optional).,
Look up additional rules and variations if you decide to play more.",How to Set up Croquet3," Croquet balls are usually color coded so you can tell whose is whose. Divide into two teams, so that each team has two or three balls, or have each player use their own ball.


Usually, one team plays with the blue and black balls (and green if available), while the other team plays with red and yellow balls (and orange)., In 9 hoop croquet, place it halfway between the southern stake and the nearest hoop.In 6 hoop croquet, place the ball a few paces between the southwestern hoop and the southern side.This is where each ball will be placed in turn, one at a time. Do not place the next ball until the previous one has been hit.


It doesn't matter if you've forgotten which end is south. Pick one stake and decide to call it the south stake.

, Use the flat side of the wooden mallet to hit the ball firmly, sending it rolling across the grass. The balls are hit in this order: blue, red, black, yellow, green, orange. You normally only get one hit on your turn (but see below), and you do not get to hit a ball with the mallet if it doesn't belong to your team, so the players should rotate as well, alternating between the two teams.


Note that you may choose who goes first with a coin flip or an aiming contest hitting the balls toward a target. If, for example, the green player goes first, play continues in the order listed above: green, orange, blue, red, black, yellow, then back to green.

, The goal of the game is to get your team's balls through the hoops in a particular order, and in the right direction through that hoop. You might want to use colored clothespins or clips that match the balls' colors to keep track of which hoop you are aiming for next.


In 6 hoop croquet, the order is: northward through the two western hoops, southward through the two eastern hoops, northward through the two center hoops.
In 9 hoop croquet, the order is: northward through the two southern hoops, then in a northern zigzag through the eastern and center hoops, northward through the two northern hoops, hit the northern stake, then work your way in the same pattern southward. Use the western hoops instead of the eastern when going back southward. End by hitting the southern stake.

, This rule is optional, and may not be fun if some players are much better than the others. Every time you hit a ball through a wicket in the correct direction, you may take an extra shot. There is no limit to how many additional shots you may take in a turn.

, The players should decide whether they want a game that involves more interference and direct competition, in which case they should use this rule. If you manage to hit an opponent's ball with your own, you get to take two additional shots. Note that you cannot hit your opponents' balls with your mallet, only by aiming your own balls toward them.

, For a casual game, this is all the information you need to play. If someone makes a mistake, try to put the balls back the way they were and continue to play. There are many more rules and variations in croquet, from official tournament penalties for different errors, to special balls with the ability to remove opponents' balls from the game. Look these up or find an official guide for your regional tournament if you get excited about the game and want to learn more!

Assemble the players at the shuffleboard.,
Give each player or team four weighted metal disks.,
Decide who starts.,
Start playing.,
Score the disks.,
Retrieve the disks and start again.",How to Play Shuffleboard1," Shuffleboard tables, commonly found in bars, have a polished wood surface and range from 12 to 22 feet (3.6 to 6.6 m) in length. The table's height is usually 30 inches (75 cm) and its width is 20 inches (50 cm). Lines are drawn 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30 cm) from the far end. A foul line is drawn 6 feet (1.8 m) from the far end; disks must cross this line without falling off the table to be eligible to score points., The discs should be marked to distinguish one side's pieces from the other side's pieces; however, the disks are usually marked with red or blue. There are only two sides; players play solo or in teams of two.

, Have a team or player call heads or tails, then toss a coin. If the side the team or player called is what turns up, then they go first. If not, then the other team or player goes first.

, Have players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the table until all disks are cast. The goal of shuffleboard is to get your disk to the furthest point on the board while also trying to knock the other players’ disks off of the board. When playing table shuffleboard in teams, you may also try to knock your partner's disks into a higher scoring area.

, If you are playing in teams, then only the player or team whose disks are furthest down the table scores points, and only those disks further down than the opponent's furthest disk score.If a disk hangs over the far end of the table, it scores 4 points. If a disk crosses the far line without hanging over the far end, it scores 3 points. If a disk crosses the nearer scoring line, it scores 2 points. If a disk crosses the foul line, but no other lines, it scores 1 point.
If the disk touches or crosses any of the lines, it scores the value of the lower scoring area. Thus, if a disk has crossed the 3-point line but is still touching it, it scores only 2 points.
In some versions of table shuffleboard, a less skilled player scores 1 more point for a hanger or crossing the lines than a more skilled opponent does. You may observe this rule if you choose, just make sure to specify that this rule will be in effect before you start playing.

, Some table shuffleboard games play from only one end, while others play from either end. Whichever player or team won the last turn starts the next turn. In a 2-player game, the first player to either 11 or 15 points wins the game. In a team game, the first team to 21 points wins the game.

Gather the players at the shuffleboard court.,
Give each player or team 4 wooden disks and a cue.,
Take turns.,
Score the disks.,
Keep playing.",How to Play Shuffleboard2," Outdoor shuffleboard features a 52-foot-long (15.6 m-long) rectangular court with a triangular scoring area at either end.Have all of the players come and stand around the board.

, You will be using a cue to push the disks down the shuffleboard court. Disks are in 2 colors, usually yellow and black, with a diameter of 6 inches (15 cm) and a thickness from 9/16 to 1 inch (1.4 to 2.5 cm). The cue is a pole no longer than 6 1/2 feet (2 m), with a U-shaped prong on the pushing end.

, Have the players or teams alternate sliding their disks across the court until all of the disks are cast. Starting with the player with the yellow disks, players place their disks in the ""10-off"" section of the scoring area on their end of the court on their turn and shoot toward the opposite scoring triangle.


The yellow player's disks are launched on the left side of the court, and the black player's disks are launched from the right side. A player's cue cannot push past the scoring area when shooting a disk. Disks must cross the ""dead line"" 3 feet (0.9 m) in front of the opposite scoring area but must not hang off the edge of the court; disks that fail to cross or that hang are removed from the court.
As in table shuffleboard, players try to knock their disks into the higher scoring areas and their opponents into lower scoring areas or out of play entirely.

, The triangular scoring area in outdoor shuffleboard is divided into 6 sections; a disk must be entirely inside one of these sections to score points. A disk in the apex of the triangle scores 10 points, a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the apex scores 8 points, and a disk in either of the 2 areas behind the 8-point areas scores 7 points. A disk that lands in the ""10-off"" section deducts 10 points from the score of the player or team who owns the disk.


Unlike table shuffleboard, outdoor shuffleboard assesses penalties for rule infractions. A disk that touches the 10-off area line before being played costs a player 5 points; if it touches one of the triangle's sides, the penalty is 10 points. Ten-point penalties are also assessed if a player's body crosses the baseline while playing or shooting an opponent's disk.
Remove any illegally played disks from the court. Give any of the opponent's disks that were displaced by an illegally played disks back to the opponent to replay.

, Alternate sliding disks from either end of the court until one side wins. Whichever side reaches a score of 75 or more after all of the disks are played in a turn wins.

Have all of the players gather around the deck shuffleboard court.,
Give each side four wooden disks and a cue.,
Decide who starts.,
Have the players alternate sliding their disks across the court.,
Score the disks.,
Alternate sliding disks from either end of the court until one side wins.",How to Play Shuffleboard3," Deck shuffleboard has 2 oval scoring areas, each 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, spaced 30 feet (9 m) apart. There are lines in front of and behind each scoring area; the inside lines are called ""Lady's lines"" and the outside lines are called ""Gentleman's lines.”, The disks are the same size as in outdoor shuffleboard and they are marked with two separate colors. The cues are similar to those in outdoor shuffleboard, although the shooting section, or ""shoe,"" consists of a semicircle cut into a rectangular piece of wood.Players may play in teams of 2, with one player playing one end of the court and the other the other end.

, This is usually done with a coin toss, as in table shuffleboard., Keep going until all of the disks have been cast. Players stand behind the “gentleman's line” when shooting. During play, players can try to knock their opponent's disks out of the scoring area or off the court.Take any disks that fail to cross the Lady's line off the court.

, Tally up the points after all players have cast their disks. Disks score points according to where in the scoring area they land, as long as they are completely inside that scoring area.


The center of the scoring area consists of 9 squares labeled with the numbers 1 through 9, arranged in the format of a magic square; any line of 3 numbers adds to 15. The semicircle furthest from the players scores 10 points for any disk landing in it, while the semicircle nearest the players deducts 10 points for any disk landing in it.

, Whichever side reaches a score of either 50 or 100 first, wins."
"
Prepare the playing surface.,
Give each player four weighted metal disks.,
Decide who starts.,
Begin playing the game.,
Score the disks.,
Alternate sliding disks from either end of the table until one player wins.",How to Play Shuffleboard4," Shuffleboard is played on a table 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) long and 3 feet (0.9 m) wide. At either end, scoring lines are drawn at 4 inches (10 cm) and 4 feet (1.2 m) from the end., Each player's disks should be marked in some way to distinguish them from the other players' disks.

, For two players, toss a coin. If there are more than two players, choose another method with an equal outcome.

, Have the players alternate sliding their disks across the table until all of the disks have been cast. A disk must cross one of the lines without falling off the table.


Once a player has slid a disk across the table, it becomes a target for the other players, who can knock that disk off the table and replace it with their own disk.

, A disk that hangs over the far end of the table scores 3 points, a disk on or across the far line scores 2 points, and a disk on or across the near line scores 1 point. If none of the disks have crossed a line, the disk closest to the near line scores 1 point. Add the scores to the players' previous scores., Whoever scored the most points on the last turn starts the next turn. The first player to score 11 wins.


If there are more than two players, the winning score can be higher than 11.

Obtain all the right equipment- all the pads, the helmet, and everything else.,
Stretch out thoroughly.,
Try skating around the goal.,
Get in the net and start to get into your ready position.,
Stand in your ready stance, and ask the coach or another player to warm you up with shots getting progressively better and faster, while the rest of the team is doing something else.

,
Get ready for drills/games once you're warmed up.,
Positioning and timing are crucial; you should position yourself so that most of the goal is covered, and that which isn't covered should be easy to cover quickly.,
Don't get discouraged when you let a shot in and everyone starts to celebrate, goalies are one of the toughest positions to play and don't usually get comments like, ""nice save"" unless you do something spectacular or have very nice teammates.,
Arm positioning: Keep your arms up covering as close to the top corners as you feel comfortable with, have your catcher-mitt with the palm facing the puck/ball so that all you have to do is move it in front of the puck/ball to catch it.,
Think about how you can improve after training, what you might change next training, or even do some research on alternate stances or useful goalie stretches or off-ice conditioning.

",How to Be a Roller Hockey Goalie," Don't try to play without it!;
, You should have some type of routine or comfort zone to get into the right mindset. You'll probably find you need to stretch out much more than any of the other players. Join in the player stretch-out then move onto doing some personal stretches. Make sure you stretch your legs very well because you'll use them the most. Don't forget the arms, they're important too!

, Shuffle backwards and forwards using small steps to get in the right frame of mind.

, There are a few different positions but the most important thing is to be comfortable in how you're standing. You should probably do some research to find out what all the styles involve before practice.

,, Drills will usually involve you being shot at by players moving in, they are really to better the players rather than you but practice anticipating the play and keeping your eye on the ball. Games will be a bit more relaxed as you tend to have a team on your side as well. Always be aware of what's going on and keep yourself warm, skate on the spot, move side to side or something, as long as it keeps your muscles warm.

, Timing is another key asset of a goalie, you should never make the first move, unless of course, that's your style. Allow the player to move in on you and wait for them to make the first move and react to it.

, Remember just to enjoy yourself and keep focused.

, Your blocker-mitt should just rest naturally when you place your stick on the floor slightly in front of you covering your 5-hole (in-between the legs).

, Volleyball shoes are designed for court use, and can lose traction if you wear them on dirt or grass. Keep them in your bag, and wear sandals or other shoes on your way to practice. Even if you wear ordinary sneakers while playing, it can be nice to change to a less sweaty pair of shoes afterward.


Consider packing running shoes on conditioning days.
If your shoes are old and losing traction, buy a ""court grip"" product.

, When you're just starting out, you'll want knee pads that cover your entire knee, for full protection. Later, if you become more competitive, you may switch to smaller knee pads that only cover the part of the knee you slide on. This discourages you from sliding in the wrong position.

, Pack at least one bottle of water or sports drinks, and add more to your bag if you run out during practice. If you tend to get hungry during practice, pack a snack that won't go bad if you forget about it.

, Your coach may or may not require ankle braces. Even if she doesn't, there is good evidence that they help prevent injury. There is no good evidence that braces interfere with jumping or movement., Decide whether you need any of the following:


Pack deodorant or perfume to cover body odor.
If you have long hair, keep it out of your face with hair ties and headbands.
Bring a towel if you sweat a lot, or if you shower at the gym.
If you wear jewelry, put it in a small container so it doesn't get damaged or lost in your bag.

, If you plan to stay longer after practice, or to show up early, get your own ball. You can practice many volleyball skills with just two or three people, even without a net. Here's an example of a warm up called ""peppering"":


Have two people (""Player A"" and ""Player B"") Face about 5-7 yards (4.5—6.5 meters) apart from the other person.
Player A sets the ball to Player B.
Play B spikes toward Player A.
Player A digs the ball back to Player B, where he can easily set it.
Repeat this sequence as long as you can, trying to stay in the same position.

, Naturally, you'll need your team jersey when you show up to a game. If you save it only for official games, it will stay in better condition.


If you will be playing in multiple games today, get a foam roller to clean up your uniform in between them.

, If you might be helping out as a down ref, you'll need a whistle to halt play when necessary.

, Taping your thumb or finger helps protect it from injury. You may not need this if someone else on the team is willing to share.


If you've injured your fingers before, it's a good idea to wear tape to practice as well.

, If you track team statistics, bring along a notepad and writing utensil.

, If you're heading to an away game, make sure to have some cash with you. This may come in handy in an emergency, or just to buy a meal at the end of a long day.

Be a good role model.",How to Motivate a Team," If you want your team to be motivated, then you have to explain the positive outcomes of achieving the objective. By incorporating this team motivating step, you are putting the control over their future compensation or other rewards into their own hands. Your team should see how their success would benefit not only the company, but also each individual team member. If you really want to motivate them, then you have to make your goals as concrete as possible so they can feel a tangible reward.


For example, saying ""We have to work harder so the company looks better"" won't motivate employees as much as saying, ""If we improve our sales by 10%, then we'll make enough revenue to give out Christmas bonuses this year."";
, Build a sense of curiosity within your team members' mindsets so that that they are interested enough to want to achieve the goals you expect. By doing this, your team members will want to learn more. This can be achieved if you understand what excites or interests your team members. Get to know what matters most to the members as a team and as individuals. If you keep things interesting and exciting by mentioning concrete goals, changes, and improvements, they will want to keep working.


Don't just tell your team members what to do. Keep them interested and up-to-date on as much of the company process as you can so that they care about what's happening and have questions about the process.

, Know what your team is capable of and set a goal that they can actually reach. It's good to be ambitious when setting goals, but if you make them so challenging that your team is destined to fail, then everyone will only feel discouraged. Establish a realistic goal and provide a tool that shows their progress as they get closer to attaining that goal. Setting micro-goals along the way is also a great way to ensure success, so your team doesn't feel like it's all or nothing.


For example, if you have a project that needs completing, create a chart that breaks that project into smaller goals so that, as they achieve each step, they can check it off and visualize themselves getting closer to completing the project.

, Create a competitive environment that will inspire your team members to achieve their goals. Have small competitions with tangible rewards, even if it's just a free lunch, to get people excited about working their hardest. This can help your team exceed its own expectations, as long as you make the guidelines clear and make sure that people are getting along.


For example, break your team up into smaller teams and have them each be responsible for an aspect of the complete goal. Introduce an incentive that will inspire them, but make it a friendly competition and not one that brings about hostility and back stabbing.
Make sure you know your team members well enough individually first to see that this won't make people turn on each other.
A great way to get team members to know each other is to create mini-teams of people who don't know each other so well.

, You can have an objective that needs to be met, but passing that sense of control over each of your team members will give them the feeling that achieving the goal is something they want done. If they just feel like you're barking orders at them and that they're checking them off one by one, then they'll feel like they have no initiative or control over the situation.


One way to make team members feel like they're more in control is to let them to contribute to the company's objectives when it's necessary. Though they may not always be qualified to give feedback, any time you ask for suggestions or for their insight, they will be grateful for it and will feel more eager to contribute.

, By doing this, team members know that their individual efforts will be noticed and not lost as a team effort. This will inspire all members to do their share. If members know that they will only be rewarded and recognized as a team, they may be more inclined to hide behind the efforts of others. This, in turn, may cause resentment amongst those who did all the work.


Take the time to check in individually with all of the members of the team so that they know that you recognize their strengths and are there to help them through their weaknesses. They'll also feel like you care enough to take the time to address each person individually.

, Establish a plan of action that requires cooperation between team members so that they are forced to work together to achieve that goal. If every team member is just working individually, then there may not be as much team unity or cohesiveness. No individual can make the team succeed, and optimal success comes from having all of the members of the team work together as well as they possibly can.


Find what strengths and weaknesses the members of the team have, and find a way to have people with different talents working together and helping each other.
Try to mix it up. Don't always have the same people working together just because they like each other the most or are the most comfortable with each other. If two people don't know each other that well, try pairing them together to improve overall teamwork.
If two people really don't get along, try to resolve the issue by meeting together. Don't think you can resolve the issue just by keeping them apart forever.

, Getting to know each member of the team and having an idea of what makes each person tick can go a long way in helping you motivate the team. If you have a sense of each person individually, you can see that some people are more visual learners, some are better at accepting criticism than others, some are born leaders, and that others work best under the guidance of more experienced team members. Taking the time to see each person as an individual will really make a difference in the team efforts you'll see.


It may be impossible for you to get to know each and every person, if the size of your team is pretty large or if you are simply just too busy. Still, you must do the best you can, even if it means you get to know members of the team in small groups.

, If it's somebody's birthday, or someone just got married or had a baby, make them feel special. Send an email. Bring in a cake. Give him or her a silly card -- do whatever is appropriate for the occasion, as long as you are respecting that person's privacy. It's important to make each member of the team feel important and like they are wanted and needed.


Recognizing members of your team for successes within the job can work, too, as long as it doesn't encourage too much competition.

, It's important to be on friendly terms with your team members, to make small talk, and to make them feel wanted and cared for, but you don't want to cross too far over that line. If you end up being BFF with your team members, then chances are that they won't listen to you or take you as seriously as they would if you maintained a respectable distance from them.


This is a delicate balance to achieve. You want your team members to feel comfortable talking to you and create open lines of communication, but not make them feel so comfortable that they start feeling like it's okay if they slack off or show up late to work because you're such a cool boss.

, Motivate your team by not having everything be all about work, work, work. Have monthly happy hours to have the members of your team relax a bit. Have a Sunday softball league with interested team members. Have everyone in the team go out for lunch together every two weeks instead of everyone going their separate ways so people are more motivated to work hard because they'll know each other better.

You shouldn't guilt or force busy members of the team to attend the social events, of course. If you make them sound as appealing as possible, though, then people will naturally want to come along.

, If things in the office are tense, impersonal, cold, and unfriendly, then yeah, your employees won't be as motivated as they would if they walk into the office feeling happy, safe, and warm. Okay, so some people will never love walking in to work, but you can do your best to make them like the experience as much as possible. Have treats at the office, windows that offer lots of sunlight, and a friendly, casual atmosphere where people feel comfortable.


Encourage communication in person, instead of over chat or email. Get people walking around and talking to each other. Sure, this may be 10% less efficient, but the morale boost it gives will be worth it.

, If your team is doing really well, don't just say, ""Great job! You've worked hard!"" Let them know that you really care by citing specific examples of how the team worked hard. Say something like, ""You've done fantastic work with the latest fundraising campaign. Donations went up 30% from last year,"" or ""Your group report was direct, helpful, and even entertaining, at times. I especially loved the chart on page 3 -- it really drove the point home."" This kind of talk makes your team feel like you acknowledge their hard work.


Along the same vein, it's important to be specific when you give criticism, too. Instead of saying, ""You need to work harder,"" say something like, ""This team needs to work on producing more monthly reports. If you wrote just one more report a week, productivity would really soar.""

, Though your job and your team's job may be pretty straightforward, try to mix things up as much as you can. Even if your team's job is really to write reports all day, see if you can find a way to be a bit more creative so they are not doing the same old thing every day, and so that they stay motivated and excited to be there. No matter what the task is, if your team members are doing the same thing 8 hours a day, every day, they are bound to get bored and to lose motivation.


It can be important to mix things up for at least a few hours a week. Even if it lowers productivity a bit, it can make people happier, which can lead to more productivity.

, Maintain a positive outlook and a positive attitude as much as you can. Even if things aren't going well, keep your head up as much as you can, because positive -- and negative -- attitudes can be very contagious. If you keep up a positive attitude, the members of your team are sure to follow, and they will be more motivated for it. If everyone is down in the dumps, then they are guaranteed to get less work done.


If your team members feel that everything is hopeless, why would they work?

, If you really want to motivate your team, then you have to be a good role model and someone that each individual team member can look up to. You don't have to be perfect, but you should be hard working, reasonable, willing to communicate, and generally a smart, reliable employee. If you're not demonstrating the very traits you want your team to embody, then why would they follow suit?


Treat your employees with kindness and respect. Set a baseline of good behavior.
If you've made mistakes, don't try to cover them up. Instead, own up to them and move forward. Your team will respect you for it.

Don't quit!",How to Handle Being Dropped from Your Sports Team," Clearly there was a reason you were dropped from the side and you'll need to work on remedying the reason before you can earn back your place on the team. Whether it's poor passing or being too unfit, focus on doing what you can to improve your performance.


If it's lack of fitness or a particular physical weakness, put together a training program that targets the areas you're not strong in.






If it's about lacking mental determination or stamina, you'll need to spend some time working on improving your confidence and belief in your abilities. You might find improving your visualization skills to be helpful.





;
, Even if you aren't the best at a lot of things that are involved in the game, doing even one thing better than anyone else can prove to others that you need to be on the team. If you're not the fastest bowler or the strongest batsman, make yourself the best fielder, the person with the most motivation or the best team-player.

, People who attend team meetings and practices, who become friends with other players or team members, or who perform fundraising and other non-game related tasks, show that they committed to the team, and that is the most important attribute no matter your skill.

, Since you've been dropped from the side, you'll need to work harder than anyone else on the team, so get in extra practices and read up about your sport frequently to keep ahead of the other players. Learn from the professionals in your sport by reading their biographies and about their wins – what moves, tactics, and thinking strategies are they using to make their game or sporting prowess much greater?

, Although being too obvious is probably a bad idea, make sure you show off your new skills at practices and make sure other team members can see you've improved.


Whenever there is a new round of try-outs or selections for your team, be sure to put down your name and go for it with the attitude that this is a fresh start.







, Nothing is more important than maintaining a good attitude, even when you may feel sour for being dropped. Remember to keep in there and never give up! If others are feeling tired or left out on your team, pep them up and show that great attitude off - you never know who might be watching.


If you make a fuss and behave petulantly after being dropped from the team, this can simply confirm to the coach and others that they made the right decision. On the other hand, if they see you taking it with good faith and tolerating the change in circumstances, all while trying to improve yourself, they'll be impressed by your tenacity and perseverance, as well as your ability to take hard knocks without losing it.







, If you are placed back into the side for a match, make sure you're on your best behaviour. Play every second like your coach or selector is watching and never give up. Without putting other players down, make sure that you shine the most out of them all and that it is clear you are perfect for the team by the end of the game.

, If you still aren't getting selected despite doing everything you can, consider trying out for another team, trying again next year, or if you are only playing for the exercise, consider joining a social league for your sport where everyone gets a game no matter your skill. It may not be that you aren't good enough, it may just have to do with the abundance of other players or other factors beyond your control. Think laterally rather than giving up.

, No matter what you do, keep at it. If you want it, you can work to it. You may feel that no one has seen your improvements, but more often than not you'll be surprised by that phone call asking if you're available for the game next weekend.

Know how teams are set up.,

Send eight granite stones down the ice.,
Play 10 ends.,
Throw the stone.,
Sweep the stone.,
Practice the three main strategy shot types.,
Get stones into the house during an end.,
Land more stones toward the center of the button than the other team.,
Tally up your points at the completion of the game.",How to Score in Curling," Each game of curling is played with two teams, and each team has four members.


Each member of the team will throw two stones per end, and each of those stones is played one at a time, not back-to-back. The other players will help direct the stone toward the house. Players will determine their order of rotation before the game and follow that rotation throughout all the ends.;
, The actual playing surface is called a sheet, an each sheet has a house and a button.The ""house"" is the target or dartboard at the end of the sheet. The ""button"" is the bull's eye of this target.
Both teams will aim for the same house and button.
Players will start from a position that is 57 feet (17.4 m) away from the house.
To stay in play, the stone must stop in between the hog line, which is 21 feet (6.4 m) from the center of the house, and the back line, which lies behind the house.

, During each end, each team will send eight separate granite stones (sometimes called “rocks”) down the ice toward the goal. Each stone weighs 42 lbs (19 kg).


The teams will take alternate turns. In other words, Team A will curl one stone, then Team B will curl one stone. Team A will then curl their second stone, and Team B will curl their second after that. This continues until each team has used eight stones.

, To play a full game, you will need to play through a total of 10 ends. That means each team will be curling a total of 80 stones.


Each end will begin with the team who won the end before it. If Team B wins the first end, Team B starts the second end. The second team actually has a greater advantage than the first, so this is done to help even out the odds.

, During each turn, one player will ""throw"" the stone by gliding it across the ice and aiming it toward the house.


The speed, force, and direction are all important. While success is not entirely dependent upon the throw alone, it is difficult to get near the button without a good starting throw.

, During each throw, the other players on a team will use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the stone as it glides across the sheet.The ice of the curling sheet is fairly rough on its own, so if a moving stone is left on its own, it will hit these rough patches and spin or ""curl"" across the ice. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how the throw was made and on any obstacles in the stone's path.
The friction of the sweeping melts the ice, allowing the stone to move across it more smoothly.
If you want to keep the use moving fast and straight, you would sweet the ice directly in front of it.
If you want the stone to curl around other obstacles, you would sweep less. Doing so causes the stone to grab onto the rough ice and turn.

, Plain, straight shots are used in curling, but strategy shots are more common and usually more significant to the outcome of an end. There are three main types of strategy shots: guards, draws, and takeouts. Each has its place within a game of curling.


Guards block the house from the opposing team. These shots land just in front of the house but within the scoring area. If the opposing team were to hit the stone, that stone would likely be knocked into the house, so the opposing team will usually try to avoid that area.
Draws are shots that are designed to get around the guards by curling around them. These are some of the most strategic shots you can use and some of the hardest to implement because they have to bend around the guards in precise ways to get into the house.
Takeouts are hard, fast shots that move with such great force that they completely knock one of the opposing team's stones out of play. Some takeouts end up within the house, while others don't, but they must at least remain within the active play zone to be considered valid.

, Only stones that are within the house or button can earn points.


It is possible to land a stone within the active play area but not within the house. Stones lying in these areas at the conclusion of an end will not count toward any points.
It is also possible for no one to score points during an end if neither team gets any stones in the house.
If in doubt, you can determine whether or not a stone is in the house by standing directly above it and locating its leading edge. That edge must touch the outermost margin of the house or fall within it, but it cannot go past it.

, The team with the closest stone at the conclusion of an end will be awarded the point for that end.


Only one team can earn points during an end. Even if Team A gets one stone out of eight in the house while Team B gets all eight in the house, Team A will still get the point for that end if its stone is closer to the center than any of Team B's stones.
You can earn more than one point during an end. If Team B has three stones closer to the center than any of Team A's stones, Team B will earn three points. With eight stones per team, per end, eight is the maximum number of points a team can score during an end.
When you cannot determine which stone is closest simply by looking at it, a referee will need to use a measuring stick to figure it out.

, After playing through all 10 ends, each team will tally up their points. The team with the most points will win the game.


If you have a scorekeeper, the scoreboard will be updated at the end of each end with each team's current number of points.

Land your jump.,
Prepare eight balls for the drill.Place a pair of balls at four intervals along the court.,
Hit one ball from each pair over the net.,
Hit the second ball from each pair over the net.",How to Jump Serve a Volleyball," Stand two-three feet behind the back line. You will want to throw the ball high and step to the line in order to gain momentum for your jump.


Start with your left foot forward if you are right handed, and your right foot forward if you are left handed. You will take a three step approach.;
, Look to the positions of the players on the opposing team and try to aim your serve in the empty spaces. You want to hit the ball into “dead zones”. This means that when you hit the ball, you want it to land between players, so that they have to communicate about who will hit the ball back.


Position your body so that you are facing one of the dead zones. Turn your hips and shoulders toward the area. You should not have to turn your head to look at it.

, Use both hands for more control. If you are very confident with your dominant hand, you can throw with that hand. Toss the ball high and in front of you. You should be able to do a approach before you hit the ball, so make sure that you throw it in front of you and high enough, so that it floats just behind the serving line.


A good rule is to throw the ball the way that you like the ball to be set to you. If you like your sets low, then throw the ball lower. If you like your sets higher, throw the ball higher.

, Take three steps, starting with your non-dominant foot. Jump with your non-dominant foot when you hit the serving line, and hit the ball hard with your dominant hand.This step progression does not work for everybody. If it makes you uncomfortable, try starting and ending on your dominant foot. There are many ways of performing a serve, so find a progression that best suits you.
Aim your jump so that you remain in the serving area. If you hit the ball when you are outside the service area, the serve will be void. , Swing your arm up and hit the center of the volleyball with the heel of your hand. Hit it as hard as possible. This is where the force and momentum of the jump serve comes from.


Extend your body and arm fully and jump high. If you do, the ball should clear the net and land deep.

, When hitting the ball, your eyes should be on the ball. After you’ve hit it, bring your hitting arm down. Point your hand toward the place that you want the ball to land.


Follow through with your eyes as well. This will ensure that you focus on the ball from the moment of contact until your follow through.

, As long as you were behind the service line when you hit the ball, your serve should be legal. However, to be safe, you should try to land behind the service line as well. If you overshoot your landing, you may accidentally hit the ball too close to the court.


Land with both feet. Keep your knees bent to avoid any injuries.

, The first pair should be at the net. The next pair should be three steps back, and the next pair three steps back from that. The final pair should be at the serving line.


Placing balls close to the net gives you a good idea of the height you need to extended your jump and your arm in order to get the ball over the net.

, Do not jump to hit the ball. Instead, toss the ball high in the air and swing your arm up to hit it. You should hit the ball when your arm is fully extended. Start with the ball closest to the net and move backwards until you are hitting the ball from the serving line.


It is important that you do not jump, so that you get a sense of how long your body and arm should be extended. You want to use the same position when you jump serve, with your arm fully extended.

, This time, jump when you hit the ball. The first hit, close to the net, should give you an idea of how high you should jump. Each time you hit a ball further away, you should be hitting it a little bit harder.


As you get back to the serving line, use everything that you have learned thus far. You should be jumping and fully extending your arm just as you did before you were jumping. You should also be jumping as high as you had to when you were serving close to the net.

"
Set your body in the correct posture.,
Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm.,
Hit the ball with the upper part of your palm.",How to Hit a Volleyball1," To hit an overhand serve, you need to stand with your feet about shoulder width apart with the foot opposite your hitting hand slightly forward. You should have your hips squared off to the net.


Most of your weight should be on your back foot.;
, An overhand serve requires you to toss the ball with your less dominant arm so you can hit it with your dominant arm. This step takes lots of practice to be able to toss the ball in the best position to be hit. Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm and about two to four feet above your head.








Being consistent with your toss is what will make you a good server, so be sure to practice this frequently.

, Spread your fingers really wide and make contact with the ball with the palm of your hand. Contact the ball in the center and try to hit it when the ball is high enough to go straight over the net.









In an upperhand serve, the trajectory of the ball should be straight.
Make sure to follow through after hitting the ball so that your arm is extended out straight towards the net.

"
"
Stand with your feet staggered.,
Position the ball in front of your hitting arm.,
Make contact with the ball.",How to Hit a Volleyball2," Having the correct posture when serving is an important step to take. When serving underhand, your feet should be staggered with the opposite foot of your hitting arm forward. This will give you a good solid base as you serve.Most of your body weight should be on your back foot.
Your hips should be squared off with the net.

, Your hitting arm is the arm that will actually force the ball to go over the net, and it’s usually your dominant arm. Use your other arm to hold the ball in front of your body to the side directly in front of your hitting arm.

, To hit the ball, you can make a fist with your hand and try to make contact with the flat part of your fist where your thumb and pointer finger meet. Swing your arm like a pendulum, backwards first and then forwards to hit the ball. You should make contact with the ball slightly below the center to make the ball travel out and up over the net.


Keep your eye on the ball where you want to make contact.
Transfer your weight from your back foot to your front foot as you hit the ball.
Try to drop your holding hand right before hitting the ball.
Let your hitting hand follow the ball as it is hit, making sure you follow through straight forward.
You can also hit the ball with the bottom of the palm of your hand.

"
"
Position your body for a bump pass.,
Hit the ball.,
Follow through with your arms.",How to Hit a Volleyball3," Make a fist with your nondominant hand, and wrap your dominant hand around it. You should end up with both thumbs next to each other side by side. Stretch your arms out and away from your body creating a sort of platform with your forearms. You should stand with your legs spread apart and your knees bent., The bump is typically the first type of hit after the ball comes over the net to your team’s side. To execute a bump, you should let the ball make contact with your forearms and hands rather than swinging them back to hit the ball. This will give you more control when hitting.









If the ball comes down above the waist you can bump the ball to a teammate with your forearms and fists.
If the ball comes down below the waist, you’ll need to do a dig. You can dig by bending your legs and sometimes waist to bump the ball and save it from hitting the court.

, You should continue moving your arms towards the person you are passing to after you make contact with the ball. This will make sure the ball has the desired trajectory after hitting it.








"
"
Stand facing the ball with your hands slightly above your forehead waiting for the ball.,
Contact the ball.,
Pass the ball to a teammate.",How to Hit a Volleyball4," A set is usually the second hit made after the ball is on your side of the court. This type of hit sets up a teammate to spike the ball onto your opponent's side.Your fingers should be spread out and make a triangle shape with your pointer fingers and thumbs very close together but not touching.

, When the ball comes to you, move your hands above your head, and rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing up towards the ceiling.









Keep your fingers spread and in the triangle shape, but separate them to put more space in between them as the ball comes to your hands.

, Once the ball has contacted your hands, immediately extend your arms and use your wrists to push the ball upwards and towards a teammate.








Straighten your arms completely when you release the ball for the follow through.

"
"
Take steps to set your body up for the spike.,
Jump into the air.,
Spike the ball over the net.",How to Hit a Volleyball5," The spike hit in volleyball is the hit that sends the ball over the net to the other team. You need to take steps to get your body in the correct position and to get the energy to achieve a good spike. You can take 3 steps or 4 steps to make the spike, but the conventional approach is to take 4 steps.








Take a small step with your right foot.
Take a bigger, quicker step with your left foot towards where you think the ball is getting set.
Take a big step with your right foot to place you at the best take off position to jump.
Take a quick small step with your left foot to transfer your momentum to a powerful jump.

, The point where you jump off the ground is important to ensure you can hit the ball high in the air and in front of your body. You want to jump vertically in the air, and be able to contact the ball at the peak of your jump.








, Swing your arms back as you’re approaching the ball to make contact with the ball at the peak of your jump and your arms stretched out. Swing your arms back as you take your big step with your right foot, and then stretch them out as you jump.








With both arms stretched up, bring your hitting hand back by bending your arm at the elbow. Your hand should be open and relaxed. This should create a bow shape with your arms.
Your hitting arm swings over the top of the ball and makes contact with the ball high up on it.
When you make contact with the ball, snap your wrist down to get the ball to move in a downward motion over the net.

Find a team to try out for (generally called a club because they include many teams of many different ages).,
Go there and give it your all.,
Wait.,
If you've made the team, be ready to work.,
Get ready for tourneys.,
Don't be discouraged if your teammates aren't playing up to par.,
Have fun!",How to Join a Junior Olympic Volleyball Team," Try out for at least 2 clubs, more if you are very serious about playing. Hundreds of girls try out per year (per club even) so the stakes are high. Find out their tryout information and sign up in advance if you can. There is always a tryout fee (usually from $5 to $20; rarely but sometimes as high as $50) and you will usually get a better deal if you sign up before. Beware: Many clubs in the same region (see tips) hold tryouts on the same day at conflicting times, forcing players to choose the club they want more. Make sure you know this.;
, Tryouts are long and tiring, but you must show stamina. The tournaments you will be playing in will be all day, usually with a minimum of 4 matches. If you can't last in a 4-hour tryout, they won't consider you. Every club is different; the only thing you can be sure of is that you will be given a random number. Remember your number with your life because this is how the coaches, whom you need to impress, will address you on this day.

, It's different for each club, but most will give you a time limit to when they will contact you. If they contact you within that time limit, it means that they wanted you as their first choice. They can still call you about up to 3 weeks after the cut off date, because some people will refuse and they will go to the waiting list. If you make it, you will either be on a National or Regional team. Ask your club director for more info pertaining to your region and club.

, Practice will usually begin in December or January. It is critical that you show up to each practice. Coaches will not give benching you a second thought if you don't show up on time or don't try your hardest.

, Easily the most fun part of the season, tournaments are what you will play instead of one game per Saturday per week. It is very hard to explain how they group you into pools and brackets but it is similar to NCAA basketball. You will play the 3 other teams in your pool in the morning (which often lasts until 2 pm, ironically), have a ""lunch"" time, and then play in Gold, Silver, or Bronze bracket.

, Sometimes, you will be stuck on a team where some to all of the success rides on you and a few other players. Your other teammates may be inexperienced, not as athletic, or just not trying hard. Either way, try your hardest and don't blame yourself if you lose. Volleyball is a team sport and therefore, the whole team is at fault for a loss, if any fault is to be placed.

, Make friends with your teammates, laugh, have a good time. Volleyball, more than many other sports, is a sport in which your body, mind, and soul are required for success (and you thought we were just crazy!). Make up some cheers, celebrate every point you earn, create a relationship with the coach.

Consider buying knee pads.",How to Dress Appropriately for Volleyball Practice," Baggy shirts will hinder your ability to move quickly around the court, so choose something form-fitting. It should be long enough to cover your stomach, but not so long that it hangs down over your thighs.


Many women wear tank tops or t-shirts, but you can also wear a long-sleeved workout shirt to protect your forearms from the impact of the ball during passing.Cotton is a popular material for t-shirts, but it absorbs a lot of moisture and doesn’t dry quickly. Try choosing a shirt containing nylon or spandex, both of which help to wick moisture away from your skin.;
, Regular bras with underwire will not offer adequate support for the amount of movement you’ll be doing while playing. Sports bras come in a variety of styles, like racerback and front-fastening, and offer varying levels of compression.Visit a department store to get fitted for a sports bra to be sure you’re wearing the right size.

, Spandex will fit snugly to your body and give you the most freedom of movement. Regular gym shorts may be alright, but check with your coach to be sure.


Move around in your shorts ahead of time: jog, squat, and lunge. Make sure the shorts do not easily ride up or slide down.

, These should lace up, provide good arch support, and not be able to leave any black marks on the gym floor. If you’re serious about playing volleyball long-term, invest in a specialty pair of volleyball shoes. These will weigh less and provide even more support and traction than regular workout shoes.Volleyball shoes can be purchased online or at sporting goods stores, where a sales associate can help you figure out the proper size.

, What type of socks you wear is a personal preference, so choose what feels best to you. Knee socks may offer added protection of the skin on your legs if that’s a concern. Avoid ankle socks, since those can easily slip down into your shoe and distract you as well as cause blisters.Consider socks that offer special features, like moisture control, built-in arch support, cushioning for the ball of your foot, or blister control., While some players decide they don’t need them, you should invest in a pair of knee pads if you’re at all concerned about hurting your knees as you dive for a ball.But you may want to wait to do this until you’re sure you’re committed to playing volleyball.


Visit a sporting goods store to get your knees measured and fitted for the right pair of knee pads.

, Put your hair into a ponytail or braid if it’s long. Try to keep short hair off your face using a headband or hair clips. This applies to bangs as well – pin them back or use hairspray to keep them away from your forehead.

, Wearing earrings, necklaces, bracelets, or rings can injure you or someone else on the court. Be sure to take all of those items off beforehand and store them somewhere safe during practice.

, Find a short-sleeved or sleeveless shirt that fits snugly and is comfortable to move in. Choose something made of breathable, synthetic fibers that will wick sweat away from your body.

, Men don’t typically wear spandex shorts as tight or as short as the women do. But your shorts should still be more snug than a normal pair of baggy workout shorts.Choose a pair that will allow you to move around without sagging down.

, These can be crew, calf-height, or knee-height, depending on your preference. Avoid socks that are mostly cotton since these will absorb moisture and be slow to dry. Look instead for socks that have acrylic or synthetic fibers and keep your feet dryer to help prevent blisters., Unless you’re serious about playing volleyball, you can just start with a good pair of running or gym shoes. Be sure that they fit well, offer good arch support, and won’t leave black marks on the gym floor.


If you decide to play volleyball long-term, visit a sporting goods store to get fitted for volleyball shoes, which provide more traction and support than ordinary gym shoes.

, Many men opt not to wear knee pads, but some do, so decide if knee pads are right for you. They protect your knees from injury and pain when you have to dive for a ball, but some players think they’re uncomfortable and bulky."

Perform lunges.Start from a standing position.,
Execute wall sits.Place your feet about two feet away from the wall (a little over half a meter).,
Do jumping jacks.Stand up straight, placing your feet side by side so your insteps are touching.",How to Get in Shape for Volleyball1," First, straighten your back and roll your shoulders back and down to keep your core engaged. Raise your chin and fix your eyes at a spot directly in front of you, at eye-level. Then:Take a step forward with one leg so that ankle is directly below your knee, with your calf and upper thigh forming a right angle.
At the same time, let your hips sink to the floor, so that your other leg also forms a right angle as its knee nears the floor.
Support your weight with your forward heel as you use that leg to push yourself back into a standing position.
Repeat with your other leg for one rep.
Start small if you need to, adding sets and reps as you build strength, until you are able to do three sets of 20 reps.
For an extra challenge, hold weights at your side for added resistance.;
, Let your upper back rest against the wall. This is your starting position. From there:Let your hips sink until each leg's calf and thigh form a right angle.
Make sure that the back of your head, shoulders, and your whole upper back stay flush against the wall.
Divide your weight evenly between both feet and keep them flat on the floor, from toe to heel.
Hold that position for 30 seconds before pushing with your legs back into a standing position.
Do three sets of one rep each, working your way up to 45 seconds in your second rep and a whole minute in your third.

, Let your arms hang down along your sides, with your palms flat against the outside of your thighs. From this starting position:Jump into the air, spreading your feet apart and raising your legs to either side.
At the same time, raise your arms to either side and over your head.
As you come back down, lower your feet and arms back into starting position for one rep.
Aim to complete three sets of 50 jumping jacks each workout, starting with fewer or smaller sets if needed until you work up to that.

Strengthen your core with sit-ups.Lie down on the floor with your whole upper back on the ground.,
Use planks to build your core, arms, and back.,
Work out with lateral dumbbell raises.",How to Get in Shape for Volleyball2," Keeping both feet flat on the floor, draw them in toward your butt so that your knees bend, with your legs resembling a raised tent. Touch the backs of your ears with your fingertips while drawing your shoulder blades together, so that your elbows point outward from your sides instead of ahead. From here:Engage your abs to pull your upper body off the floor and toward your knees.
Be careful not to yank yourself forward with your head or shoulders.
Once your upper body meets or nears your thighs, use your abs to lower your upper body back down to the ground for one rep.
Increase the number of reps and/or sets with the goal of reaching three sets of 50 per workout.

, First, get into a position for a push-up, with your toes lifting your lower body into the air. But instead of placing your hands on the floor, use your elbows instead. Set them directly below your shoulders with your forearms flat on the floor, pointed ahead of you, so both arms form right angles. Once you are in position:Draw your belly button inward, toward your spine, to straighten your back and get those core muscles active.
Let your forearms support your upper body and raise your palms off the floor if necessary to make sure of this.
Aim to hold this position for half a minute as your first set.
Repeat with two more sets, adding time to each until your second set is 45 seconds and your third set is 60.

, First, choose a weight that is light enough for you to control each lift from beginning to end in order to avoid injury. In the beginning, start with something light, such as five to ten pounds each, to avoid straining yourself. Then stand with your feet about hip-width apart. With a dumbbell in each hand, hold them at your sides, keeping your arms straight and your palms facing in toward the outside of your thighs. From this starting position:Bend your elbows a bit and begin your lift, raising the dumbbells outward to either side of you.
As you do, angle each dumbbell so that the forward weight dips down, as though you were emptying a glass.
Continue your lift until your arms are spread out to either side of you, parallel to the floor.
At this point, hold your position for a second after your last exhale.
Now inhale and bring your arms slowly back down to your sides to finish your rep.
Condition yourself toward the goal of completing three sets of 25 lifts each for each workout.

Do ladder drills.,
Start with hop-scotch drills.,
Move on to in-out drills.,
Up the stakes with the lateral feet drill.",How to Get in Shape for Volleyball3," Grab a piece of chalk and draw a ladder with four rungs (or multiples of four: 8, 12, 16, 20, etc). Make sure there is enough space between each rung to fit both feet. Even though real ladders usually don’t have them, draw two more rungs along the very top and very bottom. From the bottom up, mark the space between each rung from 1 to 4 (and onward, depending on how long your ladder is).Use this ladder to practice drills that will increase your agility, speed, and coordination.When doing ladders:


Use the balls of your feet to push yourself up and off the ground when you jump.
Bend your elbows to form right angles with your arms and pump those arms with each jump or step, as if you were running.
Relax your upper body while keeping your head immobile as best you can.
Start slow to master each pattern, then increase your speed once you can do each one smoothly.
Start each set with your left foot as your lead foot, then alternate feet with your next set so that both grow comfortable with leading.

, Try this easy pattern to ease into the practice. Place both feet hip-width apart with your toes just an inch or two away from the bottom rung. Now push off the ground with the balls of both feet and land on your left foot only inside Space #1. From there:Jump from your left foot as soon as you land.
Land with both feet in Space #2 and then use both to jump again right away.
Land with your right foot only in Space #3 and use that foot only to jump again.
Land with both feet in Space #4.
Repeat until you complete the whole ladder.

, Improve your range of motion by landing to either side of the ladder, as well as inside. With this drill, however, simply step from mark to mark, rather than jump. To begin, assume the starting position at the base of the ladder. Then:


Step into Space #1 with your left foot, then your right foot.
Leading with your left foot, step to the outside of Space #2, followed by your right foot on the opposite side, so you straddle the ladder.
Step inside Space #3 with your left foot and then your right.
Leading with your left foot, step to the outside of Space #4, with your right foot doing the same to straddle the ladder again.
Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the ladder.

, Improve your side-to-side motion. As you step in and out of each space, use a one-two count (“One, two … one, two …”) for your feet’s movements to avoid tripping yourself up. With this drill, start with both feet below and to the left of the bottom rung. Now:Step into Space #1 with your left foot (“One”), then your right (“Two”).
From there, cross your left leg in front of your right and place your left foot outside and to the right of Space #1 (“One”).
Now bring your right foot outside of Space #1 and plant it to the right of your left foot (“Two”).
From there, step into Space #2 with your left foot first (“One”), then your right (“Two”).
With your left foot, move directly to your left and step outside of Space #2 with your left foot, then your right (“Two”).
Keep this pattern up until you complete the ladder.
With your next set, switch sides at the beginning. Start from the right of the ladder and lead with your right foot.

Do frog jumps.Place your feet slightly more than hip-width apart.,
Use a “jump box.” Use an actual jump box that is specifically designed for jumping exercises (which many gyms provide), or use any raised surface that will support your weight, like a sturdy, steady bench or bleachers.,
Do jump shrugs.",How to Get in Shape for Volleyball4," Wrap your fingers behind your head with your elbows sticking out to either side. Sink into a squat until your legs form a roughly 90- degree angle. Keep your upper body as vertical as possible and your chin up so that you are looking forward, not down. From here:Use the balls of your feet to push yourself up and forward into a jump.Don’t worry about jumping high. Simply aim to land a few feet in front of your starting position.
As you land on the balls of your feet, absorb the shock with your legs by sinking back into another squat.
Jump again and repeat for a total of five to ten reps per set.

, Stand within jumping distance with both feet planted hip-width apart, facing the box. From this starting position:Jump off the ground with both feet, using the balls of your feet to push yourself off the ground.Land on the box with both feet, distributing your weight evenly across them to stay balanced.
Starting small so you have as much control over your last jump as your first, work your way up until you can complete three sets of 20 jumps per workout.
As you master the height of one box or surface, challenge yourself by working with another that is even higher.

, Use two dumbbells weighing between 10 and 25 lbs (4.5 to 11.3 kg). Hold one in each hand, down along your sides. Set your feet directly below your shoulders and straighten your back. From here:Jump directly upward, not forward.
Shrug your shoulders upward as you ascend.
Relax your shoulders as you descend.
Land in your starting position with both feet at the same time.
Increase your sets and/or reps until you can do three sets of 25.

Choose loose fitting shorts.,
Put on a sports bra.,
Wear a t-shirt or tank top.,
Find comfortable athletic shoes.,
Put up your hair up.",How to Dress to Play Volleyball1," These shorts should have an elastic band. The length can range from your mid-thigh down to your knees. These are often branded as athletic shorts. Basketball shorts, running shorts, and soccer shorts are good options.;
, For women playing sports, it is essential that you wear a sports bra underneath your shirt instead of a normal bra. These tight, polyester bras will allow you to run around without interference or injury.

, Short-sleeved shirts or sleeveless tank tops are good for volleyball because they allow a full range of motion while keeping you cool. Compression shirts, sweat-proof athletic tops, and mesh jerseys are all good options as well. Choose a cotton or polyester blend. Make sure that you can fully move your arms.

, Find shoes with good traction. Check the soles for deep rubber grooves. You should be able to wiggle your toes comfortably in these shoes.


While you can buy specialized volleyball shoes, you don’t have to unless you are a competitive player. Other types of court shoes, such as tennis or basketball shoes, are good substitutes., If you have long hair, you will want to keep it out of your face. You can put it in a ponytail or a French braid. A tight bun also works. Make sure that it is tight enough so it won't untangle or get in the way.


If you have shorter hair, you may opt for a headband to keep hair out of your eyes. Choose one that has elastic bands to keep it on your head even during rough play.

Pancake only as a last resort.,
Start out low on your toes.,
Take a big step forward.,
Dive forward as low as possible.,
Land with one arm stretched forward.,
Slide when necessary.,
Let the ball bounce off your hand.",How to Do a Pancake in Volleyball," A pancake is a last ditch effort, as it is extremely unreliable. You'll have much better control if you dive to meet the ball in midair. Only try a pancake when there is no other way to reach the ball.;
, Be in the ready position, and hunker down further if you anticipate a tip.


When practicing the pancake, have another player stand at the net and tip toward you. You should stand about five steps behind the ten foot line, or as far as you can reasonably dive.

, Step forward with your left foot if you're right-handed. Lean forward as you do this, into a falling position.

, Continue the fall until your body is almost parallel to the ground. Push forward with your front foot as hard as you can. Imagine a baseball player sliding forward and reaching his hand out to touch the base before he gets tagged. This is the motion you want to achieve the maximum distance in the shortest time.


This is different from an ordinary dive, which may involve leaping up into the air.

, As you dive, stretch one arm out as far as you can. Keep your hand flat with your palm down, as though you were high fiving the floor. Aim to land with this hand pressed flat against the floor, exactly where the ball is about to land.

, Land with enough forward motion to slide on the floor if you need an extra couple inches. Try to slide on your kneepads first, then on your shirts and shorts as you fall forward. Ideally, your hand should land only at the end of the slide, to avoid taking off skin.

, You are literally making no effort to send the ball upward or provide a better platform. This ""Hail Mary"" technique will get the ball back into play, but only just. If your hand isn't completely flat against the ground, the ball is likely to bounce awkwardly or fall off to the side.

Wear shorts.,
Put on a jersey.,
Invest in a pair of volleyball shoes.,
Put on knee pads.",How to Dress to Play Volleyball2," Men and women tend to wear different types of shorts when playing volleyball. Women’s shorts are tighter and shorter while men’s shorts are longer and looser.


Women typically wear spandex shorts. These have a four-inch inseam and resemble biking shorts.Men wear baggy shorts that reach just above the knee. These resemble basketball shorts.

, Jerseys are standard in competitive volleyball. Your team will likely provide you a jersey. Jerseys must be a solid color, and the libero must be wearing a contrasting color to the rest of the team.Women’s jerseys are tight-fitting with short sleeves. Make sure that your shirt is snug but that you can still move your arms. Try stretching and rotating your arms when you try yours on to see how well you can move.
Men wear looser jerseys with no sleeves. Make sure yours is not so loose that it can get caught in the net.

, Volleyball shoes have special rubber soles that give them extra traction on the court. Two popular brands of volleyball shoes are Asics and Mizuno.Prices for good shoes range from $70 to $150.

, Pick knee pads that fit you well and that cover your entire knee. The sleeve of the kneepad should be between 5 and 10 inches.More advanced players may want a shorter sleeve for maximum flexibility while newer players will want longer sleeves to increase their protection.

Put on your bathing suit.,
Go barefoot.,
Apply sunscreen.,
Bring sunglasses and a hat.",How to Dress to Play Volleyball3," When you play beach volleyball—even competitively—the standard uniform is a bathing suit. While regulations vary from league to league, generally women will wear one or two piece bathing suits while men will wear swimming trunks.


Teams should have at least two colors for their uniforms.Bikinis are the most common type of uniform for women, although you can usually wear a one-piece suit if you choose. If you don’t want to wear bikini bottoms, you can also opt for swim shorts or spandex shorts.
Not all leagues require men to wear shirts. If you are playing competitively, check with the regulations of your local league. Even if you are not required to wear a shirt, you may want to wear at least a tank top to prevent sunburn., Players do not typically wear shoes for beach volleyball. On warm, sunny days, the sand can be extremely hot, so you may opt for a pair of socks. Generally, however, you will be playing barefoot., It may not be clothing, but it is just as important to put on as you will be spending a long time out in the sun. Take an one-ounce dollop of sunscreen, and rub it all over your body. Don’t forget your ears, neck, or face., While not required, many beach volleyball leagues encourage players to wear sunglasses and a hat.These will help protect you against the sun.


Make sure your sunglasses fit snuggly on your face. You do not want them to fall off as you play.

Get your feet into position.,
Ready the ball.,
Lower the ball.,
Lean your shoulders forward.,
Choose a strategic place for the ball to land.,
Adjust your angle to the net.,
Squeeze your hitting hand into a fist.,
Determine the arc of the ball.,
Draw your hitting arm straight back.,
As you swing your arm, step forward.,
Follow through with your arm.,
Get into a ready position.",How to Do an Underhand Serve," Stand with your non-dominant foot in front with your toes facing forward. Your dominant foot should be in the back with toes pointed slightly out.


Shift your weight to your dominant foot.
Make sure your hips are facing straight forward, not angled to the side.;
, Cup your non-dominant hand slightly and place the ball in it. Make sure the ball securely balanced so it won't wobble or fall out of your hand. Keep your fingers slightly loose to distribute the weight of the ball. This will help it stay balanced.
Don’t grip the ball with your fingers. You want it to be stable, but it still has to be able to fly out of your hand when you hit it.

, Bring the arm holding the ball across to the side of your body in front of your hitting arm. The ball should be at the height of your mid-thigh. Straighten the arm with the ball in it, and move it to the side by shifting your arm at the shoulder, not the elbow.
You want the ball to be low so that you can put more power into it as you move your whole body forward and up.

, Move your hips back and keep your upper back straight as you bring your shoulders towards the ball. This brings your a little closer to the ball so that you have more control.


Don’t hunch over but make sure you aren’t standing up straight.
As your hips move back, you can raise the toes on your front foot so your heel is touching the ground and your toes are pointing up.

, You want to confuse the opposition as much as possible. If you are practicing on your own it might not seem as important, but when you’re playing on a team you will want the ball to go where you aim it-- so practice aiming!


First, practice aiming for the deep right or deep left of the court. This will force passers to move out of formation.
After you practice that, begin aiming for places between players. This will cause players to be confused about who should get the ball, which will improve your strategic advantage. , If you are aiming for the deep left, your shoulders will point left and your back foot will move slightly right, and vice versa. Trace a straight line with your eyes across the court. Bring your eyes from your chosen landing spot to the point on the bottom of the ball where you will hit it.
If you have to move your head to the side to trace a line from your landing point to your contact point, you should adjust your feet and shoulders so that you are facing your chosen landing point.

, Then, rotate your arm so that your closed fingers and the inside of your wrist are facing up.


Picture your fist hitting the contact point on the ball, and following a line to the point where you want it to land.
It is also possible to have your fist facing the side, with your wrist turned inside and your thumb facing up.

, The desired arc of the ball depends on whether you want the ball to land in deep on the opposing side, or closer to you. Hitting the ball with more force forward will mean that the ball will fly lower and faster to the back of the court, while hitting the ball upward will mean that the ball will fly higher and land closer to you.


Usually, low arcs that end deep are desirable in volleyball. They are hard to pass and control, and so it is more likely that you can score points on them.
If you know that two people closer to the front will be confused by a serve landing between them, you can aim for a higher arc that ends there.
If you are looking for more speed and control, you may want to try an overhand serve.

, It should move quickly, like a pendulum. Then swing it forward firmly, hitting the bottom of the ball with your closed fist.


You should hit the ball just below the center so it will follow an upward trajectory over the net.Speed up your swing just before you make contact with the bottom of the ball.

, You should shift your weight onto your non-dominant foot, which should be in front. Move your whole body forward and up, propelling the ball over the net.

, Your arm should continue in an upward arc after you hit the ball. Bringing your arm all the way up will better guarantee a straight and true flight path over the net. Keep your arm straight. It should swing straight up like a pendulum, to a height equal to or just above your head.
Recall the imaginary line you traced from your landing point to your contact point. Your fist should trace over that line as it follows through.

, After you serve the ball, get ready immediately. Stand facing forward with your feet shoulder width apart, legs bent, and arms straight down in front of you with hands clasped together.


Allow your arms to linger on the follow-through before clasping them together to get ready.
You can briefly check to see how your ball lands, but don’t get too distracted to do your part when the ball comes back over the net.

Keep an eye out for “tells.” Does he strongly favor spiking to his left? Does she exaggerate her backswing when faking a spike?;
, Even deceptive spikers tend to align their shoulders in the direction they intend to hit.Take an educated guess on where the ball is headed, but also don’t assume it has to go there. (Lean a bit that way, don’t “sell out.”)

You are creating a “platform” from wrists to elbows upon which the ball will bounce.You’re not a carpenter but a volleyball player, so don’t make it a level platform unless you want the ball to bounce back over your head (or off your forehead). Keep your wrists lower than your elbows to direct the ball forward.
To hold your hands together, place your thumbs side by side and overlap the fingers of your stronger hand over the curled fingers of your weaker hand., Remember your footwork, and don’t lunge unless you have to. Otherwise, take a quick step or a shuffle and remain in your ready position. Keep low as you relocate.

, Your goal on a dig is not just to get the ball up in the air, but to pass it to a teammate to set up your offensive series.You’ll most likely be aiming for your setter up by the net. Align your body as much as possible towards that target while receiving the spike. Use all that geometry you learned in school to set your platform at the right angle.

/images/thumb/4/4b/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-8-Version-3.jpg









Aim a little short of your target if necessary to keep from digging the ball back over the net. Don’t give your opponents an easy second chance.

, You don’t need to swing at the ball; the spiker has supplied all the necessary power (and then some, most likely) for your purposes. Keep your elbows locked and your angle of deflection the same, but let your shoulders dip to absorb some of the power of the shot.
/images/thumb/0/07/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-9-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/0/07/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-9-Version-3.jpg









Even though you aren’t swinging at the ball, do follow through with your platform, moving your arms slightly upward and towards your target. Think of it as nudging the ball in the right direction.

, A good spiker won’t always give you the luxury of properly setting your feet and platform to direct the ball cleanly to your teammate. Sometimes, you’re just going to have to hit the floor (or the sand).

/images/thumb/6/6b/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-10-Version-3.jpg









To dive for a spike in front of you, bend your knees to get even lower and drive your body forward. Your platform and your upper body will be parallel to and close to the ground. Slide on your chest as you hit the ball, ideally on your platform but even with your wrist or knuckles.
When you really need to stretch out as far as possible, you can try a “pancake.” Extend your hands, palms down, while you dive so that the ball bounces off the back of your hand(s). Slide on your palms along with your upper body.
Keep your head up as you dive. Do this not only so you can see the ball, but so you don’t smack your chin on the ground as you land.

, Similar to a dive, a sprawl is directed more toward one side or the other. If the ball is to your right or left, step out in that direction and extend outward as in a dive. Dip your inside shoulder (the side away from the ball) while keeping your arms together. This will allow you to maintain the angle of your platform in the intended direction./images/thumb/f/fc/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-11-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/f/fc/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-11-Version-3.jpg









Bend your elbows more or curl your wrists if necessary to keep them off the floor as you stretch and to maintain at least part of your platform at the correct angle.

, Proper technique is fantastic and will make you a better and more consistent digger, but in the end, you essential job is to get the ball back up in the air. (They don’t award points for good technique as the ball bounces past you.) Especially on partial blocks or deflections that send the ball on an unexpected trajectory, you may have to lurch your body, flail your arms, and land a little less gracefully. Do what you have to.
/images/thumb/0/0e/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-12-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/0/0e/Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Dig-a-Volleyball-Step-12-Version-3.jpg









Unless you’re in the Olympics or something like that, don’t risk injury just to dig a spike, though. Landing awkwardly can cause leg, arm, or even head injuries. Proper equipment, such as knee pads and ankle wraps, will help quite a bit.

Make sure everyone on your team understands the game.,
Be communicative.,

Coach volleyball professionally with a college or university team.,
Coach at the high school level.,
Look for opportunities to coach youth leagues.,
Join an adult recreational league.",How to Coach Volleyball," The tactics and logistics are necessary, and you may need to teach them if you are coaching beginners.


Teach the rules. Your players cannot play well if they do not understand the rules of volleyball, and you risk losing points, not to mention games. Make sure your team knows what they can and cannot do, what gets them points and what results in penalties.;
, Talk to your players supportively, and if you are coaching children, talk to parents openly so they know what is going on at practice.


Keeping your communication positive rather than competitive will demonstrate that you have the best interests of the players in mind and provide a model of good sportsmanship. This is especially important if you are coaching kids.

, The Socratic method of coaching uses questions to get players to think critically on their own. This may be a slower method, but it yields better results. Ultimately, players need to make high-level decisions themselves when on the court. For example:


""Carl, what do you think you can do differently to make your serve stronger?""
""OK, everyone, what do you think we're going to focus on in this drill?"", Including players in decisions builds trust and encourages them to think critically about the game.For example, during a timeout you can ask the team for feedback on their opponents and suggestions for strategy., For example, ""We need to . . .""Keep it pithy. You can easily lose your players' attention if you talk too much, too generally. Concentrate your verbal feedback on helping each player focus on what's important in the moment., Whether you are coaching kids or adults, professionals or amateurs, the physical court needs to be safe. Inspect the practice and competition courts before every practice and match.


The ground should be free of sharp objects and glass.
Check what's above the court. There should be 23 feet of overhead clearance. Remove objects like portable basketball goals, lighting fixtures, and tree limbs from the space above the court.
If you're using a net supported by wires, they should be covered with soft material.
Players should never grab the net or hang on to supports; this can cause the net to overturn and fall on them.
To reduce risk of collision, players should ""call"" the ball to reduce the chance of colliding with another player.
Having knowledge of first-aid is vital. You should know how to treat common minor injuries like facial cuts, bruises, or minor tendinitis, strains, or sprains.
Have an emergency contact plan for more serious injuries that require a medical professional., Planning can be time-consuming, but it is important to figure out in advance what to do during practice.


Decide what warm-ups, drills, and/or practice games you're going to do.
Decide how much time to leave for each element.
Writing out your plans not only gives you something to refer to during practice, but also serves as a reminder of what you've done and what you're going to do.
Some websites provide downloadable planners for volleyball coaches. These templates might help you get organized., This shouldn't be intense: go from 40% heart rate gradually up to 60%, then follow with a 5-minute recovery period.

, Dynamic stretches are done during movement. Research suggests they are much more effective than static stretches (e.g., touching your toes for 30 seconds) in reducing the risk of injury. Some ideas:


Straight-leg march (hamstrings and gluteus muscles): Kick one leg straight out in front with the toes flexed upwards, and meanwhile reach the opposite arm to the upturned toes. Lower the leg and do the opposite leg and arm. Repeat 6-7 times.
Scorpion (lower back, hip flexors and gluteus muscles): Lying on the stomach with arms outstretched and feet flexed so only toes are touching ground, kick right foot upward toward left arm, and then left foot toward right arm. Work slowly, repeat up to 12 times.
Handwalks (shoulders, core muscles, hamstrings): Stand straight with legs together and then bend over, putting the palms of hands flat on the ground. ""Walk"" hands out in front until back is almost extended. Keeping legs straight, walk your feet towards hands. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Drills are focused and repetitive movements and plays that players need to be comfortable executing quickly, without thinking. There are three types of drill:


Skill- and movement-specific: This most common type of drill employs repetition to improve skills like blocking and setting. Use these drills to build good habits and correct bad ones.
Tactical, systematic and strategic: These drills practice combinations of playing skills and should be incorporated after your players have developed their basic skills. These types of drills are also the time to teach the team how to communicate on the court.
Conditioning: These drills build strength and stamina. Note that the energy required for conditioning drills may detract from the execution technique. For that reason, keep conditioning-oriented drills separate from skill-specific drills during in-season practice.Keep drills focused and fun. Make your practice plan based on skills you want to improve and/or the problems you want to solve. For each drill, set a goal and focus, and communicate these to the players. Knowing what to concentrate on helps them get the most out of the drill.Find what works for you. You don't need to constantly incorporate new drills; instead, focus on finding a handful of drills that you and your team enjoy, and use these in rotation, adding variation where necessary., Divide your players up and have them play against one another. This will give new players a feel of the rhythm to a volleyball game and will allow seasoned players to practice where they need it.

, This will be essential when your volleyball team begins competing against other teams. A good coach will be tactical and able to strategize based on the players' strengths and weaknesses.

, A large part of this decision involves your qualifications: coaching professionally requires a high level of experience and expertise, while recreational coaching is a less competitive field.

, The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) oversees volleyball programs at all division levels in colleges and universities.


You will need to have years of volleyball playing and coaching experience in order to apply for a job with a college program. The school's athletic director is often responsible for hiring coaches.

, Many high school teams have men and women's volleyball teams. Whether these positions are paid or volunteer will depend on the school and the budget.

, Local park and recreation departments and community associations use professional and volunteer coaches for youth programs.


Check out nationally popular programs such as I-9 Sports, Diversity Youth Sports and We Play Sports.
Express interest to youth sports leagues that are specific to volleyball, such as the United States Youth Volleyball League or the Youth Volleyball Association. The national leagues can put you in touch with your local chapters.

, If you are better at coaching than at playing, you can coach an adult single sex or co-ed team. Check with your local community college, recreational center or YMCA for leagues and teams.

"
Know who is getting the ball at all times.,
Make sure there is no uncovered space.,
Say the score before you serve.,
Praise good plays.,
During the game usually you get three hits to get the ball over the net, and the last one is usually the hit/attack.,
If the opposite team is serving the ball to you, and the serve isn't going directly to the back row players, you call ""SHORT"" so the back row know to move up and adjust there position.,
Whenever you are on serve receive, make sure when the server tosses the ball up to serve you say, ""Ball's Up!"",
Tell the coach if you're getting tired.,
If and when you get pulled out, you're still on the team.",How to Communicate in Volleyball," It happens all too often: two guys run to the ball, and they both assume the other will get it, so in turn, no one hits it. ""I thought you had it!"" The main reason this happened: lack of communication.


Call the ball. Say something like, ""I got it!""or ""Mine!"". Make sure it's loud enough for everyone to hear.
Don't say ""You got it!"". The person will most likely have thought you were going to call it, and will not be prepared to hit the ball. Instead, if it's coming at one of your teammates and they don't notice, yell their name to get their attention.
If you and someone else go for the ball at the same time, try to call them off. Yell ""Mine mine mine!"" Before you both reach it so they realize that you can get it, so you don't bump into each other and lose the ball.;
, Within minutes of the game, people tend to move closer to each other, leaving a lot of ground open. This can result in a point loss.


Tell your players where to go. You don't need to be bossy, but if you find that everyone is moving inward, say something like, ""Suzie, make sure that spot's covered!"" Make sure you say this before the next serve, or people will think you don't pay attention.

, Say it loud enough so that people on the other side can hear. If enough people forget to say the score, you will most likely lose track.

, If someone makes a dive, and hits the ball up for the next play, don't stay silent. ""Nice play, Bob!"" is a good way to get your point across, and it will make them feel good about themselves. If someone misses the ball, don't yell at them for it. Give them a tip, but don't try to shove it on them. You can say something like, ""Good try, next time, just spread your legs apart a little. Good job!"" This will praise them for their effort while telling them what to do next time.

, But, if the ball is being tipped, set, or forearm passed, you need to call ""FREE"" That requires the people at the net to move back, and the back row players to move back as well. Essentially you should form a W because the setter will be hidden in her position. If this confuses you your coach is the best person to ask. (This is a more advanced way of playing.)

, And likewise if the serve is a long one, call ""BACK!"" and everyone will know to move back.


Watch certain servers and find where they usually serve, and how far. Once they come up to serve, if you remember their strategy, yell to your teammates ""Short Server!"" or ""Hard Server!"" so they know where it is coming.

, However, this can be seen as unsportsmanlike because it distracts the server.

, If you're afraid to go out because you're letting the team down, the truth is, you're letting the team down playing while you're tired. It's better if you simply call in a substitute, and rest. This is especially important if you feel sick or injured. You might be suffering from dehydration, making it even more necessary that you rest. If you're injured, you could be making the injury worse by flexing your muscles.

, Remember that. Now you can do twice the cheering! So for whoever goes in for you, be sure to keep support. ""Come on, Lacey, you got this!"" Or whatever. You're still a part of the team and cheering is communicating.

Be ready at all times.,
Stand with your feet shoulder-length apart square to the net.,
Keep your knees bent.,
Keep your arms high.,
Keep your palms facing the net.,
Stay a half arm’s length away from the net.,
Learn proper timing.,
Communicate with your teammates.,
Use proper footwork.,
Jump straight up.,
Angle your hands inwards as if you are grabbing the ball.,
Keep your fingers spread wide and relaxed but straight.,
Keep your wrists rigid.,
Position your arms at an angle over the net.,
Work on your jumping skills.,
Practice your footwork.,
Practice hand and arm position drills.",How to Block Volleyball," Timing is one of the most important aspects in blocking; a fraction of a second could be the difference between stuffing an opponent’s attack and missing the ball completely. Being in the ready position will allow you to move more efficiently when attempting a block., Keeping your feet the proper distance apart will help with your footwork, another essential aspect of blocking. With your shoulders and hips square to the net you will be able to jump straight up more quickly.

, Keeping your knees bent is an essential part of the ready position. By keeping your knees bent you are ready to jump immediately rather than having to lower yourself and then jump up for the block. Be careful not to get lazy and stand straight up while waiting to block.

, Keep your arms high with your elbows around shoulder height. This also reduces the time it takes to get your arms up for the block. If they begin by your sides then they have much farther to travel to get high in the air.

, This puts them at the correct angle for blocking and again reduces the time needed to get your hands in position, making you a faster blocker.

, If you touch the net while attempting to block you will get a violation. Allow sufficient space between your body and the net to ensure you do not accidentally touch it.

, Watch the ball before it reaches the setter and then watch the setter. After watching the setter follow the ball and watch the hitter. Watching the entire sequence rather than just the hitter or the ball will help you prepare the best block.


Watch the setter for a number of clues. If the pass to the setter is in a particular position or angle then it might limit the setter’s options for the set. You can also watch where the setter’s shoulders are angled or where he/she is looking to see where they plan to set the ball.
Watch the ball right after the set to help you strategize your block. If the ball is far from the net after the set then the hitter probably cannot hit straight down and will take longer to get into position. You will need to delay your jump slightly and reach high to block the shot. If the set is close to the net then you should get maximum penetration on your block attempt. If the set is very low then you will need to be quicker to jump for the block because they will hit the ball quicker.
Watch the hitter for different clues. Watch his angle of approach to see where you should line up when getting ready to block. If the hitter’s shoulders and upper body rotate then they may be preparing to hit across their body. If their shoulder or elbow drops then they may be preparing for a shot.
Jump right when the hitter is making contact with the ball. You may have to adjust a little depending on the ball position and particular hitter.

, Most teams will designate one person (usually the middle blocker) as the blocking captain to aid in communication regarding blocking. They will coordinate the other blockers to prepare the best blocking strategy.


It is important to watch the hitters and the setter as these are the people to whom your defense will need to react when attempting to block.
It is helpful for the blockers to call out the setter location and who the hitters are before the serve to prepare your team for defense.

, It is important to move quickly on your feet in order to get your body in front of the hitter’s hitting shoulder to make the block. There are two footwork patterns that can be used to quickly get to the correct position: the sidestep and the crossover step.


The sidestep is used when the hitter is within 3–5 feet (0.91–1.5 m) of you. Take one step with the foot closest to the hitter and then follow with the other foot so they are shoulder-width apart once again. Keep your hips and shoulders square to the net as you sidestep. If it takes you more than two steps to reach the hitter then you should rather use the crossover step.
The crossover step is used when you need to cover more ground, for example if the hitter is more than 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5m) away from you. Step first with the leg closest to the hitter and then cross the other leg in front of your body. Although your hips may angle towards the hitter during the cross step, your shoulders should remain square to the net. Step again with the foot closest to the hitter to bring your feet back to shoulder-width apart and make your hips square to the net once more.

, Get yourself directly in front of the hitter shoulder of the hitter and jump straight up to attempt a block. Make sure you are balanced before jumping and jump at the same time as the hitter makes contact with the ball.

, Your hands should be close together (about 4-6 inches or 10-15cm between them) and angled inwards while blocking. This will direct the block back down into the opponents’ court and reduce the chances of deflection away from your other defenders. Keeping your hands together prevents the ball from going in between them.


You do not want your hands to form a flat surface or else the ball can deflect in many different directions off of them.
If you are close to the edge of the court, angle your outside arm and hand inwards so that if you deflect a shot it will go into the court rather than outside the lines.
If you are a shorter player and cannot penetrate to the other side or cannot penetrate for another reason, keep your hands angled backwards. This is attempting to slow down the ball through touches for your defenders rather than block it., Keeping them spread out makes a bigger surface area for the ball to touch and makes your fingers slightly softer so major deflections don’t occur. Big deflections might make it difficult for your other defenders to get to the ball.


Keeping your fingers tight, flexed and rigid will make it impossible to direct the ball. Often times the ball will bounce outside the court even if it is blocked. You want them to be straight and strong without being overly rigid.

, You will need to keep your wrists rigid to work against a hard spike. Be careful about your wrists as they can become sore or injured if you do not keep them rigid.

, Arms should be straight and go over the net as far as possible. This will get you closer to the ball. Even though you lose a little bit of height with this technique, it is more important to penetrate to the other side of the court than to have additional height. This way the ball will deflect back into the opponents court rather than in another direction.


Make sure when you do this that you do not thrust your hips forward. Rather your upper body should be angled forward with your abs tight to pull your upper body towards the hitter.
If you are a smaller blocker you should rather keep your arms straight up with your fingers angled slightly backwards. This also works if you are late and cannot penetrate to the other side.

, Height, arm length and jumping ability can greatly help one to block in volleyball. You cannot change your height but you can train your jumping ability, for example by doing squats, calf rises or strength training. Train yourself to jump at your maximum height to enhance your jumping ability.

, Quick feet are an essential aspect of any blocker. Plays can happen very fast and include decoys to distract you. Practice your sidestep and crossover step.


The sidestep is used when the hitter is close. Take one step with the foot closest to the hitter and then follow with the other foot so they are shoulder-width apart once again. Keep your hips and shoulders square to the net as you sidestep. Practice this step sideways back and forth in front of the net, keeping your feet as light and fast as possible.
The crossover step is used when you need to cover more ground. Step first with the leg closest to the hitter and then cross the other leg in front of your body. Although your hips may angle towards the hitter during the cross step, your shoulders should remain square to the net. Step again with the foot closest to the hitter to bring your feet back to shoulder-width apart and make your hips square to the net once more. Practice this step sideways back and forth in front of the net, keeping your feet as light and fast as possible.

, Have an assistant hold the ball up on the opposite side of the net. Jump and catch the ball and bring it back to your side. Your hands and arms should be bent over the net but not touching the net. This practices proper hand and arm position for the block. .


The ball should be as far as possible on the other side to help you train your skills.
You should never keep your arms straight up when blocking but rather bend them slightly forward over the net. This exercise will mimic proper technique when blocking.
The hands should be next to each other when grabbing the ball, which is proper technique when blocking.
To advance the training the assistant should move the ball to the right and left to help you practice blocking different kind of shots such as angle shots and line shots.

Get in position.,
Create a platform with your arms.,
Use your legs.,
Hit the ball with both arms.,
Move to the ball so that it will come down squarely in front of you.,
Pass the ball.,
Aim the ball.,
Keep your eye on the ball after you bump it.",How to Bump a Volleyball," You should stand with your legs about shoulder width apart and should lean forward a bit. Your knees should be bent a little bit, ready to spring your legs into action. Your hands should come together in the last moment before the ball comes to you; when you approach the ball, you can keep your hands about half a foot apart, and bring them together when the ball comes toward you. Otherwise, it'll be hard to maneuver yourself to get in the right position to hit the ball.






;
, The platform is the area between both your wrists and elbows which is the ""sweet spot"" for hitting the ball. To create your platform, the most important thing you need to do is to clasp your hands together correctly while holding your arms straight in front of you, slightly below your waist, with your shoulders arched. Clasp your hands in front of you, with your thumbs together, side-by-side. Don't lace your fingers together, for this will make you lose control of the ball.









You can either make a fist with one hand and wrap the other around it (the ball method), or you can bend one thumb down to its palm, and rest it on the other hand (the cup method), thus cupping it with the other hand.
If you're using the cup method, then your thumbs should be parallel with each other, and your four fingers on each hand will be parallel with each other as well.
Remember to keep your elbows locked and your knees bent.

, Using your knees, and your arms, push through the ball. If you're a younger player (12 and under), you can benefit from bending your knees and using them to power your legs and get momentum to guide the ball.








, Position yourself so that you hit the ball with both. Otherwise, you won't be able to aim the ball correctly and could be fouled. This can be a bit tricky, when the ball is coming at you at an unexpected angle, but it's always important to position yourself so that your ball hits your arms with equal force so you can aim and hit it correctly.








, You can bump the ball backwards, of course, but you still want to make sure that you make contact with the ball right in front of you (you may need to turn away from the net). You should face the direction the ball is coming with your shoulders and the front of your body for best results.









If you don't need the ball to go back, swing your arms or bring them above your shoulders. If you do need it to go back, carefully swing your arms backward, as much as is needed.

, Keep your eye on the ball. Follow the trajectory of the ball as it comes down and even as you hit it. Make contact with the ball at about waist-level. When the ball is right above your forearms, straighten your legs so that your arms move up to meet it. Try to contact the ball on your forearms (above the hand but below the elbow joint.). At the same time, move your arms forward and up slightly, but do not swing your arms. Contrary to what a lot of people think, the majority of the force should come from your legs.








, Dip or twist your shoulder to aim the ball. You can't really aim with your forearms, because you need to keep them flat in order to provide a good platform for the ball. Instead move from the shoulders so that both arms stay together and move as one unit. Ideally, you can square up with the ball (point your feet at the target) so you can just hit it straight forward. Remember to aim the ball slightly to the right of the center of the net, since that is where the setter should be standing.









You should drop the shoulder and put the weight on the ball that is moving towards the target. Use your platform to help you aim the ball.

, Watch the ball with your eyes, not your whole body, try to keep your chin down, because it gives you more control of the ball. Some coaches will even have you put the collar of your shirt in your mouth to keep your chin down.









Once you release the ball, separate your hands, but still keep them half a foot or so apart, anticipating the ball's next movement and get ready to hit the volleyball.

Be in good shape.,
Possess a high vertical.,
Be able to make decisions quickly.,
Anticipate your opponents.,
Develop good setter relationship.",How to Be a Middle Blocker in Volleyball," A middle blocker needs to be built for speed since you take off in either direction to block a hitter. You have one of the most important positions on the team! It's one of the most demanding positions in terms of the cardiovascular system.;
, This means that you can jump high; you can achieve this by working out with plyometrics or ""strength"" training. It helps to be tall and have long arms.

, The strength of a middle blocker is not usually power, but speed. Almost all of the sets that middle gets are either immediately above the net or about a foot above. This means that you have about a second to get to the ball before it drops below the net. So, if you haven't decided what you are going to do then you will miss your chance.

, YOU own the net. Any ball that gets near the net, try to wrap your hands around it. Call out opposing hitters, call stacked plays, be the first to cheer your teammates as you are usually a part of every play and your intensity will inspire your team. Know where you will be needed most according to the opposition's line-up. Know where their key hitters are and shut them down.

, Since your sets are typically faster, with less reaction time, it is essential for the setter and MB to be on the same page. Repeatedly practice with your setter from a variety of angles, making you more of a target during plays that would typically omit you from the play, i.e. bad pass, no approach.

Realize that you are a good player!,
Focus on the positive things about your skills.,
Improve the things you aren't very good at.,
Be a team.,
Don't dwell on your mistakes.,
Bounce back!,
Let the team know about your faults.,
Don't let a loss ruin your whole day.,
Laugh.",How to Be Confident During Volleyball," People would let you know if you were not very good. Also, realize that if you auditioned for a team and made it, it's not because of luck, it's because of talent.;
, For example, if you aren't very good at spiking, don't try to do that at all. If you're good at bumping, try to do that more during play. You are more likely to get the ball over more if you do what your good at.

, Take the example above, get a parent, guardian, or even a neighbor to help you. If you don't feel comfortable asking them, tell your coach. Maybe they will help with some one-on-one time with you. After all, they are the expert. Eventually, you will get better!

, A team is nothing if they don't come together and are there for one another. Celebrate your wins, but don't give someone the death glare if they miss. It happens to the best of them! Say something like, ""Shake it off"", or, ""It's OK! We'll get 'em next time!"" Just treat them like you would want to be treated if you missed the ball.

, We all make them! Just look at the best player on the team. They most likely miss just as much as you or anyone else does. It is natural to think your mistakes stand out so much that you become consumed with grief that and cannot bounce back!

, Miss a huge, game winning point? Stop and think, does it matter? No, not in the long run. How many times have your team mates missed the ball? You are not alone. Get back on your feet, and spike the ball!

, Telling your teammates about your weaknesses allows them to know not to give the ball to you for certain hits throughout the game. However, this isn't a confess-it-all showdown. Just say something along the lines of: ""Hey guys, I would prefer it if you didn't set it up to me as much. I am more of a setter-upper myself.""

, It is just a game.

, It makes everything better!

Study the zones in volleyball.,
Use a variety of hitting methods.,
Communicate with your setter.,
Watch championship games of volleyball to increase your knowledge.,
Share strategies with other hitters on your team.,
Talk to your coach if you are struggling with your position.",How to Be a Middle Hitter in Volleyball1," It’s important that understand the zones in volleyball. In volleyball, you have 6 players and 6 zones on each side of the court. Each team has a front row called an attack zone and a back row called a defending zone.Middle hitters will typically play in zone 3, or in the middle, front row.


The front three attack positions from left to right are Zone 4, 3, and 2.
The back three defensive positions from left to right are Zone 5, 6, and 1.
During the serve sometimes middle hitters will play the back middle zone, or zone 6.;
, To be an effective middle hitter in volleyball you need to constantly keep your opponents guessing on how you are going to attack the ball on any given play. Hitting the line means that you’ll be hitting the ball parallel to the sideline. Hitting an angle means that the ball will be traveling at an angle towards the outside defenders.A hard driven spike can be used at an angle or along the line, and is very difficult to defend.
A short or long line tip is used to trick your opponent into thinking you’re going to spike the ball, but instead, you lightly hit it through their defense., The teamwork you have with your setter will determine how well your shots are going to be set up, and the tempo and timing that you share. Create verbal or nonverbal ways to signal to your setter, so that you can improve each other’s timings.


You can signal the setter with your non-dominant hand to let them know where they should set the ball.Talk to your setter about the tempo that you're both keeping. If the ball is being set too early or too late, make sure you adjust your timing.
Remember that it’s not always about you. If your setter is having a difficult time finding the right tempo, try to alter how quickly you are approaching the ball.

, Watch champion games from the NCAA so you can observe technique from the best players in the world. Make sure to observe how they spike the ball, their timings, and any other strategies that their team may employ in order to make your attack more effective.


Visit the official NCAA website for volleyball at http://www.ncaa.com/.
You can watch volleyball games on sports channels like ESPN.

, You aren't the only offensive position on the team. You also have outside hitters who will also be going for setups, and can help to throw off the defense when the ball is being set.


One hitter can fake the spike, while you go up and execute it for a quick kill. This technique is called a tandem attack.Another strategy you can use is to fake an angle shot, then go for a shot down the line., If you have specific questions, then your coach should be the first one you go to. They will be able to help you understand where you fit in the team, and what’s lacking depending on the team's chemistry.If you are having chemistry issues with other members on your team, bring it up to your coach and see if he can determine solutions for you.

Acquire good equipment.,
Practice the basic volleyball stance.,
Practice shuffling your feet.,
Learn how to serve the ball.,
Learn to pass the ball.,
Learn to set the ball.,
Learn to spike the ball.,
Develop a good sense of timing.",How to Be Good at Volleyball1," In order to practice volleyball, you need access to good equipment, including a comfortable outfit that allows a range of body motion, shoes specifically designed for volleyball, and a good quality volleyball. As well, you should have access to a volleyball net and court.


Men, especially taller men, may need to opt for a basketball shoe instead of a volleyball shoe.In order to do some volleyball drills, it can be helpful to practice against a tall smooth wall or a basketball hoop.;
, When you play volleyball, you will assume a basic ready position. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees. Make sure your body weight is more on the balls of your feet so that you are ready to move quickly.Hold your arms loosely in front of you

, Many volleyball moves require you to move quickly from side to side. Minimize the amount of movement (and the amount of energy required) by shuffling your feet side to side. Stand in the basic ready stance and move sideways in a straight line. Keep your body low to the ground.Do not cross your feet over one another while shuffling. You might trip.
Once you’ve got the hang of shuffling your feet, start integrating it into other drills, such as passing the ball to another player.

, Serving the ball is done from one back corner of the court. The ball is hit over the net. This puts the ball in motion in the game. To serve the ball, toss the ball straight up into the air with one hand. Bring your other arm up over your head to hit the middle of the ball. Make sure to fully extend your arm, and make contact with the ball when your arm is extended. It is also important to make sure the ball is in front of you when you make contact with it. Keep your arm moving downward in order to follow through with the hit. Your footwork is also very important here, as it can determine how hard you hit the ball, and if it even goes over the net. you can either start with the foot opposite of the hand you're hitting with, or on the same side as your hitting hand. If you start on the same side that you hit with, you will take another step, and lean on that opposite foot for leverage.If you start on the opposite foot you hit with, you will simply toss the ball, and lean in as you hit. You will need to see which works best for you, and also practice your timing., Stand in the basic ready position as the ball is moving downward. Position yourself just behind where the ball will land. The earlier you’re ready to hit the ball, the more time you have to make minor adjustments.


Put your arms together in front of you with your elbows close together. Hold the back of your hand in the palm of your other hand and press your thumbs together. Don’t swing your arms; rather, move your shoulders to pass the ball.Use the force of your core and lower body to power the ball in the right direction.

, Setting the ball is a maneuver in which one player makes contact with the ball, setting it up for another player to spike the ball. Set the ball by raising your arms above your head. Touch all of your fingertips together and then pull your hands apart so there is just enough room for the volleyball. When the ball comes down over the net or is passed from another player on your team, get under the ball and bounce it up with your fingertips.Do not touch the ball with your palms. A correct set uses only the fingertips of the thumbs, index fingers and middle fingers.
Work up to properly setting the ball by first catching the ball in between your fingertips. Once you’ve mastered the ball settling into your hands smoothly and with balance, then work on springing the ball into the air with your fingertips.

, Spiking the ball is a technique to hit the ball forcefully over the net so that the other team has a hard time recovering the ball. Spike the ball after another player on your team sets the ball. As the ball moves upward in the air, jump up to meet the ball at its highest point. Hit the top of the ball with the middle of your hand: this will give the ball a solid top-spin, sending it over the net.Spiking the ball effectively requires good timing. If you jump too early or too late, you’ll miss hitting the ball at the best position. Practice spiking frequently to hone your timing.

, Volleyball is a sport that demands keeping your eye on the ball at all times and knowing when to pass, spike or hit the ball over the net. Having a good sense of timing will strengthen your defense.


Develop your sense of timing by practicing drills that emphasize timing, such as blocking the ball at the net. Blocking the ball will demand that you watch the ball carefully and keep your eye on other players’ movements."
"
Consistently approach the ball to confuse your opponent.,
Expose holes in the opposing team’s defense.,
Penetrate the net when blocking the ball.,
Mix up your shots and hits to confuse your opponent.",How to Be a Middle Hitter in Volleyball2," If you always approach the ball the same way, the defenders will be tricked into thinking that you’ll be hitting the ball the same way every time. If you master your approach, you won’t have any tells and you can alternate between hitting down the line, hitting on an angle, spiking the ball, and short tips.Every approach should look the same as the last one.
Think of each approach as a systematic progression of 3 to 4 steps, a leap, and a hit., In order to score against the opponent, you need to expose holes in their block. Look for a hole in between the outside and middle defender Watch the opposing team’s timing and try to find times where they are not synchronized when blocking the shot.


Watch the middle and outside defender’s timing when they leap to block the ball. Try to find tendencies in their play that you can exploit to get a kill.

, Part of being a middle hitter is also being a good middle blocker. When you block the ball, make sure that you penetrate the net deep so you can hit the ball straight down.


Penetrating the net also brings you closer to the opposing attacker which makes it more difficult for them to attack the ball., You never want to become predictable as the middle hitter. Mixing up your shots while having the same approach will confuse the defense. Do a variety of shots, and practice shots that you aren’t good at.


Alternate between tips, and spikes, shots down the line and shots at an angle in order to really confuse your opponents.

"
"
Practice hitting down the line and at an angle.,
Drill different plays regularly with your team.,
Master your vertical leap.",How to Be a Middle Hitter in Volleyball3," You will be performing mostly angle or down the line attacks when you are playing. Make sure that you master both of these types of attacks to become an efficient middle hitter.Drill with a hitter and setter on the other side of the net to improve your technique.

, It’s important that other than honing your own skills, that you refine your team’s chemistry. Make sure to practice with the setter that will be setting the balls for you during actual games.


Teams run different types of set-ups, like a 4-2 system where 4 players are designated as hitters and 2 players are designated as setters.Don’t skip practice or you may not know how your team will react to plays in the game.
If a teammate needs help, make sure that you try to assist them in any way possible.

, Exercise your core, legs, back, and hip muscles to increase your vertical leap. You will need a high vertical in order to jump up for the ball that the setter sets for you.


Jumping hurdles and other plyometrics exercises can also assist in increasing the height of your vertical leap.
Do conditioning drills 2-3 times a week if you have a less than average vertical leap height."
"
Practice serving to a target.,
Practice with a basketball hoop.,
Practice against a wall.,
Practice like you’re in a game.,
Practice other drills.",How to Be Good at Volleyball2," Set up a target such as a ball cart at an opposite back corner of the court from where you’re standing. Practice serving the ball to the target. Count how many balls hit the target or land in the ball cart., A basketball hoop is a good partner for practicing techniques such as passing, setting and serving.


Pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Stand at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Toss the ball into the air and pass or set the ball towards the hoop. Try making a basket with your passes.Serve the volleyball at the hoop. Start at the foul line, or about 15 feet (5 m) away. Aim for the square on the backboard. Try hitting the square 10 times in a row., When you don’t have a partner, you can still use a solid, smooth wall as an imaginary partner. Use the wall by passing the ball towards the wall. Hit the ball when it rebounds to you., If you are able to practice on a volleyball court with a net and a partner, always practice like you’re playing in a game. For example, if you are working on passing the ball, have your partner send the ball over the net to you. If you are practicing spiking the ball, do so over the net., There are many combinations of drills that integrate serving, passing, setting and other skills. Search online for suggestions, or talk with your coach or trainer to learn more drills.

Measure your current vertical jump height.,
Jump onto a box or bench.,
Do jump shrugging.,
Try jump roping.,
Strengthen your leg muscles.,
Re-measure your jump height after 2 weeks.",How to Be Good at Volleyball3," Having a high vertical jump will enable you to be a more formidable player, giving you an advantage over your opponent. Achieve high jumping with plyometrics, which are movements that are completed with a lot of force very quickly.Measuring your current jump height will give you a good indication of how much you are improving. To measure your height:


Ask someone to observe you. Jump up as high as you can next to a wall while reaching your arms upward. Have your observer mark on the wall how high you jumped and measure the height.
You can also put a bit of chalk on your hands. As you jump up against a wall, extend your arm upward and touch the wall at the highest point you can reach. Measure that height.

, Use a surface that is about 2 feet off the ground, such as a jump box or bench. Face the box and jump on it with both feet landing flat and balanced. Do 3 sets of 20 repetitions every day. When this height becomes easy for you, add more height and challenge yourself further., Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and hold 10-pound weights in each hand at your sides. Bend your knees and jump up in the air. At the same time, shrug your shoulders to help lift the weights. Land back down with both feet firmly balanced on the floor. Complete 3 sets of 25 repetitions every day.When this weight becomes easy, increase your weights in 5-poumd increments.
Alternately, use a medicine ball instead of weights. Lift the ball above your head as you jump up. Bring the ball back to your chest when you land on the ground., In between other exercises, jump rope as quickly as possible for 30-second intervals. This will not only improve your ability to jump quickly and with height, but it will also improve your endurance and cardio performance.

, Training your leg muscles will help you jump higher with more force. Do squats, deadlift weight training, and other strength training for your legs 2-3 times a week., After spending two weeks on these types of jump training exercises, re-measure your jump height to see how much you have improved. If you haven’t improved as much as you’d like, keep working at these drills.

Schedule rest and recovery days.,
Get lots of sleep.,
Eat well.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Be Good at Volleyball4," Doing a variety of exercises, from cardio to strength training, will help you get your body in shape to play volleyball effectively. Plan to exercise for an hour 4-5 times per week.


Consult with your physician before starting any exercise program.

, Having a strong upper body is essential so that you are able to block and spike the ball with force. Do exercises that build muscle strength in your chest, shoulders, arms and core, such as rowing, bench pressing and push pressing. Doing core strengthening exercises, such as Pilates, will also help.

, Training your leg muscles will help you jump higher with more force. Do squats, deadlift weight training, and other strength training for your legs 2-3 times a week., Your muscles will need breaks from intense training that you will do, so be sure to schedule days off to allow your body to recover. Have an intense training day on Friday, for example, and give yourself rest days on the weekend.

, Being well rested will replenish your energy level every day so that you are ready to give it your all on the court. Get about 7-8 hours of sleep every night, and 1-2 additional hours per night if you are a teenager.

, Feed your body with foods rich in nutrients and vitamins. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with protein and whole grains. Avoid refined sugars and refined carbohydrates.

, Keep your body hydrated, especially when you are exercising rigorously every day. Before you exercise, drink an extra 25-30 ounces of water, and then drink 8 ounces of water for every 15 minutes you exercise."

Talk with the coaching staff at your school, community center or at a volleyball camp in your area to find a person who is willing to take you on.


Alternately, find a player with more years of experience than you. This person may be willing to mentor you and help you improve your skills.

, Volleyball teams are organized through schools, community centers and YMCA centers. Join a team or league to get regular practice and to participate in scrimmages or matches.

, Ask your coach or other teammates about summer camps or clinics that they might recommend. These range from one day clinics to week-long camps. Search online for a camp or clinic in your area., Watch how professionals play the game. Pay attention to their strategies, strengths, weaknesses, and interactions with other players.

After reaching your opponent, break down and hit as low as possible.,
Try to wrap up as low as possible, preferably at the legs.,
The next thing is drive - keep your feet moving and your legs pumping.",How to Tackle Like a Pro," Keep your head up so you know where your opponent is and you don't let the runner juke you. Keeping your head up also 'locks' your helmet into your shoulder pads and help to prevent neck injuries. Breaking down is a lot like coiling and striking similar to the way a rattlesnake strikes.;
, If you don't break down first, you won't be able to get a nice low tackle. If you don't wrap up, unless you are considerably larger than the person you are trying to tackle, they will get away from you - it's their job. A one arm grab isn't a tackle and most likely will just spin you around and make you look silly.

, Try to pick them up if you can (using your legs like you do when you squat at the gym), a back can't run if their feet aren't on the ground. If you can't lift them up then continue to drive as hard as you can until help arrives.

Breaking tackles is an important thing to learn as well.,
Finally, you need to be prepared to be tackled.",How to Train to Be a Wide Receiver," Catching the ball is the primary responsibility of a Wide Receiver. Practicing alone is fine, but you will get the most out of it if you practice in a group.;
, After you catch the ball, you need to run with it. You can build up your speed by running around the block, using an exercise bike or treadmill, etc.

, Juking, spinning around, or jumping over a defender may be necessary at some point. Agility training is something that primarily is taught in practice, but there are ways to improve your agility at home. You could create a homemade obstacle course or just practice some basic moves in your yard.

, A good Wide Receiver can catch and be tackled, but a great Wide Receiver can catch and break a tackle. Breaking tackles is something that can really only be taught in practice, since there are many ways and scenarios in which you could break a tackle.

, This will happen nearly every time you catch the ball. The best way to avoid injury from a tackle is to build up your muscles, primarily in your shoulders. Tackling is also something that is best taught in practice, since you have pads and experienced personal available.

Prepare yourself for different situations.,
Keep focused on your role.,
Study your opponents.,
Look for ways to disguise your plans.,
Find distractions before and after the game.",How to Win a Football Game1," There are many different circumstances you can find yourself in during the course of a football game, so you won’t be able to prepare for them all. That being said, there are some areas that you can expect regularly, like third downs, short yardage, or the red zone. Have a clear idea of what you want to do in these circumstances, and practice them regularly so you can be confident when those moments arise., With 22 different people running around on each play, plus many coaches shouting instructions, there is a lot of information. Make sure you are clear on what you are supposed to be doing in any given situation. Focusing on your role and your actions will allow you to remain calm and perform them to the best of your abilities.Teamwork is vital here because you need to trust that the other members of your team are doing their jobs. That can be hard, but repetition in practice will help build that trust between players and coaches.

, Watch film and read reports about what your opponents like to do. Scout in person if you can. You’ll want to highlight the other team’s key players and favorite plays so you can think of ways to neutralize them.Make sure you also take time to study yourself. If you have already played a game, watch yourself to identify mistakes and areas to improve. You will probably need to focus on bad plays, as those are areas you will need to improve. Of course, if you are a coaching, showing a few good plays to highlight successes is important for building morale and confidence as well.

, Just like you are watching the other team, they are scouting you, and unless you are far more talented than your opponents, you won’t be able to get away without something unpredictable. Look for different formations or shifts you can run, and study your patterns to vary plays and techniques. Anything unexpected for your opponents makes it more likely to get a big play.


For example, learn how to vary your formations on defense. Have your defenders line up in different places, or move around before the snap. It only takes one or two of their players being out of position to create problems with a specific playcall., You will spend plenty of time in practice getting ready for your opponent and finding ways to win. Make sure you take some time before and after the actual game to do something else to distract you from the moment, and give your mind a rest. This will help you relax, and can make your focus during the game that much better."

Keep your hands free of the face mask.,
Don't leave your feet.,
Worry about stripping the ball last.",How to Tackle in Football," To tackle properly and safely, you always need to maintain good tackling form, staying low and striking with a wide base. To learn the correct form, start by keeping your feet shoulder width apart, your knees flexed slightly.






;
, To give yourself the most power and the most control in your tackles, work on keeping your shoulders back and down. It might feel kind of silly, like you're jutting your chest out and standing like a duck, but practice standing with a wide, strong base and keeping your shoulders back.








, Proper tackling form involves getting low and keeping a roughly 45 degree angle with your back, which should be straight because your shoulders are back. Squat with your feet still shoulder width apart and bring your hands up into what is sometimes called the ""Breakdown"" position, your basic tackling form.







, As you move, you'll want to take many small quick steps when you're getting ready to tackle. Some coaches call this ""buzzing"" the feet, taking small, quick steps in forward progress.









Practice shuffling sideways, forward and back in this basic position, keeping your feet moving and bouncing at all times. You need to be able to spring in any direction at any moment, especially when you're defending the run. The first fundamental of tackling is getting mobile in this position.

, When you're moving, when you're tackling, when you're on the other side of the field from the ball, you need to have your head back and your eyes up at all times on the football field.









You need to maintain what is called the ""laconic position,"" in which your neck is flexed back slightly, not perfectly straight so your eyes are pointed down. Doing this will keep your eyes up, giving you a good sight of the field, and will keep your neck safe during play.
Dropping your head during a tackle or leading with your helmet can result in injury, paralysis, or death. This is a crucial part of proper tackling form.

, On the field, run as you normally would and then drop into your breakdown position, feet buzzing, any time a player you need to tackle gets close. Usually, you'll want to do this when you're in a bubble of 3 or 4 steps from your opponent.









Dropping into breakdown will decelerate you, making you more accurate in your tackle, setting you up for a well-timed and on-point hit.

, Most of the power that comes from your tackle will come from springing forward into the ball carrier with your hips. Because you're low with a wide center of gravity, you've got the ability to spring from your core and stop their forward progress, as long as you're tackling correctly.









As you prepare to tackle, take one plant step and ensure that your head and eyes are up before spring into the next step in the tackle. Have a coach or other player check your hit prep step to make sure your back is straight, your butt is out, and your eyes are up.
Tackling has much less to do with arm strength or speed and much more to do with proper form. A very strong player with poor fundamentals won't be as good a tackler as a player who maintains good form and strikes correctly.

, From your plant step, you'll explode up and into the player you're tackling, bringing both of your arms up and under his arms, and both of your hands up behind his back. Bringing your arms up will help take the player off the ground, forcing them to lose their momentum, balance, and footing.









When executing a proper rip, your hands should end up somewhat higher than your eyes. Both of your arms should move up and pull back after you've ripped. Hugging the player back into you.
Always keep you head up and eyes on the the ball carrier. As you make impact with your shoulder your arms keep your face-mask up and your eyes to the sky.

, After you've accelerated into a well-timed rip, let your legs do the rest of the work. Pump your legs hard to push him backwards and up, taking him off his feet and to the ground.








, Most jukes or other fake-outs that'll leave you tackling nothing but air are done with feet and the upper-body movements. The hips don't lie. Watch the player's belt-bucklet to see which direction he's progressing and anticipate his movement. Maintain good breakdown position and keep your feet buzzing to be able to shift direction and catch up with his movements.







, If you execute a good rip and your player doesn't go down or get taken off his feet, stay with him for as long as possible, wrapping up and holding on. If you slip down, that's ok, just keep holding on to his waist, legs, or feet to slow him down as much as possible and wait for the cavalry to arrive. Don't try to do anything fancy, just stay wrapped up and deadweight the other player to make it as difficult as possible to move.








, When tackling from the side or behind, it's a possibility that'll you'll unintentionally get your hand wrapped up in the other player's face mask, which is a serious penalty at all levels.









Do your best to stay clear of the face mask by keeping your hands in fists as you tackle. Your fingers won't do much for you during a well-executed tackle, so you might as well keep them safe by tucking them in and avoiding a risky penalty or injury.

, Whether you're a linebacker or a safety, it's important to stay on your feet and maintain good breakdown position to make accurate and powerful tackles. Don't jump unless you're defending a pass, and only tackle up and back, executing accurate rips.









Watching games on Sunday, you might see players in the backfield flying around, parallel to the ground, making highlight reel helmet shots that are both spectacular and inaccurate, as well as extremely dangerous and illegal. These players are taking lazy shortcuts and getting lucky.

, Many players get excited about causing a fumble and start immediately pounding at the ball, trying to tear it loose as soon as they make contact, allowing the offensive player to gain extra yardage. Worry less about the highlight reel and worry more about taking the player to the ground. Shoot and rip.

Look for big plays.,
Return every kick-off.,
Win the battle for field position.,
Go for it on 4th down.,
Go for touchdowns, not field goals.",How to Win a Football Game2," Games rarely turn on steady execution. Instead, the result is usually governed by plays that gain or lose lots of yards at once. Look to make plays on both offense and defense that will open up big holes or allow you to gain big chunks of yardage. Aggressive teams that try to force their opponents out of a comfort zone and set up big plays are usually more successful.Your average yards per play can be important too, especially if you like to run a lot of plays. That being said, a few big plays that turn into touchdowns can make up for a lot of little plays that end up leading to punts. It is very difficult to maintain long drives of small gains, especially with any real consistency.

, If your returner takes a knee, your offense gets the ball at the 20 or 25 yard line (depending on the rules). While running it out of the end zone means you may start slightly further back, it also increases the chances of a big play. The average return out to the 15 yard line does not significantly decrease your chance of scoring on the drive., Where drives begin has a huge impact on how successfully they end. Consistently making the plays to drive down the field is difficult, and the longer your opponents have to go, the less success they are likely to have.


The most common way to impact field position is through special teams, particularly punts and kick-offs. You need a good kicker who can hit the ball deep, and coverage that teams know their responsibilities in order to prevent big returns.
You can impact field position while on offense or defense as well. Not only does picking up good yardage on 1st and 2nd down make 3rd down attempts easier, but it also gives you a few extra yards of field position if you fail. Those yards add up, and forcing your opponent to consistently need 5-7 more yards for a touchdown adds up over a game., This is a great way to be aggressive during the game. Rather than giving up after three plays and punting, have the confidence that your offense can pick up the yardage needed to get another first down. Extending drives gives you more plays and improves your overall field position.This is especially true on 4th and short. You probably have many plays in the playbook that can are designed to pick up 2 to 3 yards, and do so regularly. Go with the odds and run them, instead of just giving the ball back to the other team.
This is a risky step, and not one that coaches commonly use. This is especially true if you are deep in your own territory, or facing a long way to go before picking up the 1st down (5 or more yards). If you are looking at a 4th and long, or are already pinned deep on your side of the field, you are better off punting to help change field position.

, While this seems simple, many coaches and play-callers become more conservative as their offenses get closer to the end zone. They are worried about losing the three points from field goal if there is a turnover or a bad play. Instead, get aggressive as you get closer. The additional points you get from a touchdown are going to be more helpful for winning the game.Be sure to consider the situation. There are some cases where a field goal is helpful or necessary to shape the game situation, such as kicking a field goal to extend a 1-score lead into a 2-score lead (6 points to 9 points). This is especially important late in the game when there is less time remaining. If it is early in the game, you can afford to take more risks because there will be time to make up for mistakes.
Similarly, there can be a big advantage to going for 2 after a touchdown instead of kicking the extra point. Unless the single point is more important (taking the full game situation into account), you should have a good shot at picking up the 2 yards needed for the extra point."

For example, if you bet on Houston as a 4 point favorite (listed as “Houston -4”), you would lose if they only won by 3.
Over/under. Another common way to bet on games is to guess how many points each team will score. For example, in a game with an over/under of 50, the two teams’ scores must add up to 50 or more points for bettors who take “over” to win.
Survivor pool. Another common way for people to gamble on football is through a weekly “survivor,” “suicide,” or “knock out” pool. Each week, you pick one team to win their game. If they lose, you are out of the pool and have to pay up. If they win, you get to pick again the next week. The pool keeps going until there is only one person left.

, Different casinos and odds makers will provide different bets for particular football games. If you don’t like the odds you see for a certain set of games, go to a different source. Make sure you are comfortable with your bet before you make it., Football is played by many teams at a variety of skill levels. Rather than trying to track all of it, you might be more successful developing an expertise about a small group of teams, like a single college conference. That way, you only have to learn the tricks and tendencies of a small group of teams, and learn how they match up with one another. This will give you a leg-up over most other bettors, and give you a better chance of winning more often than not.


This is more likely to work with a smaller collegiate conferences like the MAC or Sun Belt. Most oddsmakers and gamblers don’t pay as much attention to these leagues, meaning you will probably know the likely outcomes better than they do. It probably won’t work as well with very popular leagues like the NFL or SEC., Your money is on the line, so you should do a little research before making a decision about which teams and games to bet on. For example, you don’t want to pick a low-scoring team to blowout their opponent and win by a lot.One thing you can look for is to see how teams perform “against the spread.” Rather than tracking their wins and losses, gamblers study how often the team meets its betting expectations. A team that is consistent with its results (both meeting expectations and failing to meet them) could be one that is undervalued, and a good team to look at for picking.

, Think of your gambling money as “extra” money that you wouldn’t need if you lost it. When gambling, there is always a chance you will lose. You don’t want to get into financial trouble just because some kicker missed a chip-shot field goal.Give yourself a “standard” amount for betting on games. This amount can be flexible, especially if you feel particularly confident about a certain result. Keep in mind, though, that adding more money could put you deeper into a hole.
Avoid playing “catch-up.” If you have a bad day, or bad week, don’t try to win it back all at once with a big bet the next night or week. This is just as likely to put you in a deeper hole.

Maintain the proper position and tackling form.,
Close the distance between yourself and the ball carrier.,
Go into breakdown position and buzz your feet.,
Watch the hips.,
Make contact.,
Wrap up.,
Don't worry about stripping the ball.",How to Tackle1," Your head should be up and your eyes should be on the ball carrier at all times when you're playing defense. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your knees bent and your shoulders back. Ideally, you want to have your back at about 45 degrees relative the ground.


This is sometimes referred to as ""breakdown"" position. While you're working out, practicing hopping into breakdown and ""buzzing"" your feet, switching your weight between them very quickly, like you're standing on hot coals and you want to get them off. Stay light and mobile, and you'll be in good form.;
, Accelerate toward the ball-carrier as quickly as possible, then slow down when you get without about three yards of the offensive player. If you keep moving at breakneck speed, you'll be out of position and the player will blow right past you. When you get close, slow down and drop into breakdown, relying upon your lateral movements to make the tackle.


It'll take some practice to determine the proper angle of pursuit. This depends on the distance between you and the ball carrier and the speed of the ball carrier. If the ball carrier is particularly fast, take a wide angle of pursuit that will allow you to stay between him and your end zone.

, Bend your knees, get your hips down, and keep your hands back. Maintain an even center of gravity by keeping your feet at least shoulder width apart. Don't flat-foot it, either, keep moving and watch the offensive player's movements.


Always keep your head up and your back straight. This position is more balanced and safer. Under no circumstances should you ever lead with your head down, which is extremely dangerous for both you and the ball carrier.

, Ideally, you want your head to be across the ball carrier's body and in his path. If the ball carrier is going to your left, when you make the tackle he should be on the right side of your head. The opposite is true if he's running to your right. Watch the player's hips closely to tip you off on changes in direction as you close and as you make contact. Proper tackling placement will take the opponent off balance, making him less likely to fall forward for an extra yard or so, which can make all the difference on third down.

, When the ball carrier is within your reach, push off with your feet as hard as you can and use your legs to drive through your opponent. Drive your lead shoulder into the ball carrier's hips. Keep pushing and driving with your feet until the ball carrier goes down. Pick your knees up high in the driving motion, following through the tackle.

, As your shoulder pads connect with the ball carrier, wrap him up with your arms just under his butt. This allows you to not only knock him over, but pull to his legs out from under him when you extend through him, resulting in a lower chance of your tackle being broken. It also results in some spectacular, highlight-worthy ""hits"" where you really don't have to hit very hard, just with good technique. Don't stop driving until the ball carrier is down and the whistle is blown.

, Good tackles happen because of proper form and hit-placement. Although the NFL highlight reels are filled with spectacular-looking flying tackles and hits that jostle the ball loose, focusing on making that happen every time will make you miss tackles, pure and simple. Stay focused on getting the ball player on the ground, not stripping the ball.


If you're assisting a tackle, go for the ball, trying to get a hand on it and rip in a down-and-out motion. If your teammate clearly has the tackle in hand, you can do some good by going for the ball at that point, but not before.
Never leave your feet to make a tackle, and never lead with your head. This is an illegal maneuver and extremely dangerous.

, The safeties will be playing close to the middle. If you see the safeties and cornerbacks freeze in coverage, attack the space between them.

, This is the most important thing to look for. If a receiver is not going to be in a hole, change the route.

, If the linebackers or safeties are cheating toward the line at all, be ready to dump the ball off. Remember that linebackers might try to sack you. If you see a linebacker that looks like they will blitz, let the linemen know by saying something like this: Cover him! or Get this guy! so that they can keep them away from you.

, Know what to expect in each game. You need to be able to recognize cover-1, 2, 3, and 4.

, The two typical defense you will see are 4-3 and 3-4. 4-3 consists of 4 defensive lineman and 3 linebackers. 3-4 consists of 3 defensive lineman and 4 linebackers.

, Know the zones of the field that are easiest to exploit for each specific type of coverage.

, For example, a safety in cover-2 is creeping up and jumping the 15-yd quick post. A QB must recognize this and make the safety pay by pump-faking and then airing the ball out for the double-move fly route. This requires great focus.

, If they are keeping a cushion, you need to make the quick throw such as a WR screen, quick out, curl, stop, or slant. If they are playing tight bump-and-run, you need to look to the fly, corner, fade, deep post, or deep out.

, If you are lucky enough to have a standout wide receiver, there will be times when the defense gets locked into a mismatch. You must instantly recognize it, seeing when a poor defender is on that receiver, and exploit it by going to that receiver. Get the ball in his hands and let him go to work.

, If you're going to be able to read a defense like a book, you first need to understand the language the book is written in. Watch the film carefully and pay attention to the body language of each and every defender before each and every play. Look for patterns, and when you actually get on the field, you'll know exactly what's coming. You can also play realistic video games such as Madden NFL 16. That can help you read a defense and get game-time experience outside of practice.

, You won't have very much time to read the defense after the snap. After the snap glance to make sure the defense wasn't disguising the coverage, and then make the throw that you know will be open.

, If the safeties are next to each other while the corners are tight on their receivers, the safeties are going to be in cover two while the corners will play man. If a safety lines up on the tight end, all the defensive backs are playing man.

, During your drop-back, remember the location of the routes. The defense has the ability to follow your eyes.

, Safeties, linebackers, D-line. Read what coverage the safeties are running, which will tell you what all the DBs are doing. Then the LBs: if one is missing, find the receiver in that hole. Then look at the D-line to find out where the first pressure will come from.

Improve your balance with balance exercises.",How to Do a Herkie," As with any form of exercise, it's wise to warm up your body before cheerleading with light cardio exercise and stretching. Elevating your heart rate before beginning your routine ensures that your heart can gradually ease into its high ""workout"" rate. Additionally, stretching out your muscles is thought to help improve your flexibility during your performance and to protect against injuries from over-flexing (though in recent years this has been the subject of some debate. Warm up for your herkie by doing a few stretches (focused mainly on your lower body and core, the muscles you'll be relying on the most), followed by some jumping jacks or jogging to get your heart pumping.


One stretch that's particularly useful for cheerleaders attempting the herkie is the aptly-named ""herkie stretch"". In this stretch, the cheerleader mimics the mid-air position of the herkie on the ground. Note that this stretch requires you to do the splits, so if you're not flexible enough to do so, you may need to gradually build your flexibility with a stretching routine. To perform a herkie stretch, follow the steps below:

Sit on the floor with your back straight and your head up.
Shift your stronger and more flexible leg straight out in front of you. Simultaneously shift your other leg so that it is bent out to the side.
Gently reach for the toes of your outstretched leg. Hold this position for 30 seconds, feeling a mild stretch as you do so.
Switch legs. When you do your herkie, you'll be stretching your stronger, more flexible leg out in front of you, but practicing the stretch for the other leg can improve your overall flexibility and make your muscles feel ""evenly"" stretched.

;
, When you're ready to perform your herkie, get into a a proper, erect starting posture. Stand upright with your feet about shoulder-width apart and your back straight, keeping your chin up and your shoulders back in a relaxed, pulled-back position.


Don't forget to smile! Cheerleading isn't all about your athletic ability - it's also about your ability to strike an emotional connection with the crowd. Keeping a happy, excited expression on your face as you perform allows the audience to share your outward emotions. Ask yourself which would do more to get the crowd cheering - a routine from a dour, sullen group of cheerleaders, or one from an enthusiastic one?

, Like many cheerleading moves, the herkie is performed in time to a beat. Start counting ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"", with each number at a regularly-spaced interval. When you reach 8, return to 1 and repeat. Your eight count should become a repeating loop of ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4..."". When you do the herkie, you'll time your moves to this beat, ensuring your routine stays rhythmically coordinated. This is especially important if you have partners, as having members of your group out-of-sync with one another can look amateurish on the field.


If you're having trouble holding the count in your head as you move, try turning on some dance music! Most modern, club-ready dance music has a nice, steady four count beat that's perfect for practicing to.

, When you've gotten a feel for the beat and you're ready to try the herkie, count ""...5, 6, 7, 8, 1..."". On ""1"", clap your hands together in front of you. Your arms should be roughly vertical and your hands should be clasped together in front of your chin or upper chest.


Hold this position for ""1"" and ""2"".

, There are several common variations on the arm motions you can perform as part of your herkie. However, almost all of them involve making this high V position on the ground, as, by swinging your arms from this elevated position, you can gain momentum for your jump. On ""3"", quickly bring your arms from their position in front of you into a powerful ""V"" shape, stretching each diagonally above you.


Hold this position for ""3"" and ""4"".
Make your arm movements quick and snappy and keep your arms straight. Pretend you're performing for an audience - you want to look energetic and excited, not disinterested.

, Next, on the five count, swing your arms down across your body. They should momentarily cross at the wrists, forming an ""X"" shape. As you do this, bend your knees in preparation for your jump.


Avoid bending over at the waist as you make this motion - this is a common beginner mistake. You'll want to maintain a fairly straight, erect posture throughout the herkie (with the exception of when you're in the air). Remember, you're jumping with your legs, not with your waist or lower back.

, Use your thigh and glute muscles to propel yourself into the air as high as you can go, pushing into the ground with the balls of your feet. As you leave the ground, thrust your stronger leg out to the front so the inside of your leg is at least parallel to the ground (if you're flexible enough, try to have this leg point slightly up and out, rather than straight forward). Thrust your other leg under and behind you. Simultaneously, strike a pose with your arms. You have several options when it comes to your arm motions. A few of the most common are listed below:


Swing your arms back up into a high ""V"" position.
""Punch"" your arms straight overhead.
Swing your arms out to the side so that they are parallel to the ground. This should make a ""T"" shape.
Make a fist with the hand on the same side as the leg bent beneath you and place it on your hip. Raise the other arm up above your head in a triumphant ""touchdown"" pose.

, After making your mid-air pose for a brief instant, swing your legs back down underneath you and bring your arms down to your sides. Keep a slight bend in your knees as you make contact with the ground to avoid injury. Keep your arms fairly straight as they hang by your sides. You should land around the ""7"" count.


When you land, hold this position, with your knees bent and your hands by your sides, for the ""7"" and ""8"" counts. Spring back into a straight upright starting position on ""1"". Congratulations! You've completed your herkie.
Try to maintain a straight back as you land. You don't want to collapse into a hunched, shrunken stance the instant you touch the ground. Keep a bend in your knees and your arms by your sides, but avoid bending at the waist, hunching, or letting your head hang down.

, When you've practiced the individual parts of your herkie to the point that you're comfortable with them, try to work them all into one smooth movement. To recap, you should match your actions to the following eight count:


...5, 6, 7, 8 (optional): Warmup count. Gives you a steady beat for the following eight count.
1: Clap your hands together in front of you.
2: Hold your position.
3: Bring your arms into a high ""V"".
4: Hold your position.
5: Swing your arms down across your body and bend your legs.
6: Jump and strike your herkie pose in mid-air.
7: Land with knees bent.
8: Achieve balance and hold position.
1: Spring back to starting position.

, No one was born knowing how to do a perfect herkie - not even Lawrence Herkimer. To get to the point where doing a herkie feels effortless and natural, a great deal of practice and conditioning is necessary. Be persistent - even if you're barely able to get off the ground at first, you will eventually be able to do a herkie if you work at it for long enough. In this section, a few ideas for building the strength and flexibility necessary to perform a herkie are detailed. However, there's no better way to actually get good at doing herkies than to try to do herkies, so get out there and start trying today!


Keeping a good sense of humor about your practice can help make repeated failures bearable. Remember that while the cheer of an audience can feel amazing, you should ultimately working at your cheerleading skills for your own entertainment and satisfaction.

, In addition to using a great deal of muscular strength, a herkie also requires a fair amount of flexibility. To loosen your muscles up for optimal performance, start practicing a thorough regimen of static stretches. Because the herkie involves jumping and performing leg movements while you're in the air, you'll want to prioritize lower body and core stretches. For instance, the herkie stretch (described above) works well as part of your flexibility routine. This doesn't mean you should completely neglect stretching your upper body, however. Below is a sample stretch routine you may want to use. Every day, hold each of the following stretches for 20-30 seconds at a time, repeating each three times.


Herkie stretch (see above)
Hamstring stretch (try the wall hamstring stretch)
Hip stretch (try the kneeling hip flexor stretch)
Groin stretch (try the butterfly stretch)
Lower back stretch (try the cat yoga pose)
Thigh stretch (try the standing front thigh stretch)
Shoulder stretches (try the leaning shoulder stretch)

, High-flying herkies require powerful muscles. To increase the amount of time that you're in the air and the speed and power with which you can perform the motions that make up the herkie, start performing strength-building exercises that target your lower body and core. Though the muscle strength in your lower body is primarily responsible for the power with which you'll be able to jump, your core muscles are also important because they are vital for maintaining balance and stability and preventing injury.Below are just a few of the types of exercises you'll want to focus on if you're looking to improve your herkie:



Squats. These exercises should form the core of your lower body routine, as they exercise several muscle groups used in the herkie. When performing squats, use caution to avoid injury. Consult an experienced trainer if you're unsure how to do squats safely.

Lunges. A wide variety of lunges (like side lunges, walking lunges, and so on) can help build leg strength. Thus, these exercises are a great choice for improving your herkie, especially when you don't have other exercise equipment handy.

Deadlifts. These strength exercises not only improve your lower back, glute, and core strength, but also stretch your hamstrings. However, like squats, this exercise carries the risk of injury if performed incorrectly. So, consult an experienced trainer if you're unsure of how to perform deadlifts.

Crunches. These basic ab exercises are great for building the all-important core strength that's important for your balance and safety while performing physical exercise. Best of all, crunches come in countless variations, which allows you selectively target muscle groups that need work.

, Since herkies require you to make a high jump, make large, demonstrative motions in mid-air, and land perfectly, balance is an important concern not just for making your herkie look as great as possible but also for preventing injury. Everyone's natural sense of balance is different - if yours leaves you feeling ""shaky"", consider working to improve it with a regular regimen of balance exercises. Below are just a few balance-improving exercises you may want to consider:


Standing on one foot. For an added challenge, try one-legged squats after you've built up leg strength!
Performing core exercises with a stability ball.
Closing your eyes and keeping your legs together as you perform bicep curls. This forces you to use your core muscles to maintain your balance as you move the weights.

Be sure to maintain proper, erect posture as you perform this exercise - don't lean back. Not only does bad posture rob you of the balance-boosting benefits of this exercise - it also can lead to injury.

Only go to the ground as a last-ditch defense.,
Run parallel to the player in possession.,
Watch the ball closely and wait until you see separation.,
Check your emotions at the door.,
Slide into the tackle, don't jump into the tackle.,
Make sure you get the ball.,
Protect yourself.",How to Tackle2," Slide tackles should be a relatively rare element of your game. A defender should only go to the ground if there is no possibility of defending the play while standing up. If the offensive player is going around you and you have no support, it might be appropriate to go to the ground to stop an offensive charge and give your support a chance to catch up. A good slide tackle usually takes the ball out of bounds, changes possession, or otherwise clears it.


Making an unsafe slide tackle warrants an automatic red card and ejection from the came, with the possibility of further punishments from the league or your coaches. Only use the maneuver if absolutely necessary.

, The best time for a slide tackle is when you and your opponent are running parallel, toward the ball, and that you're going to lose possession very quickly if you don't make a move now. If you can't get a foot on the ball while you're in a standing position, and you're about to lose ground, it's the perfect time for a tackle.


Never make a slide tackle from behind. Tackles from behind or from head-on are very dangerous and the possibility of a penalty is high. It's possible to do it correctly in some situations, like if you're both going for the ball but neither is in possession, but not recommended unless you're sure you'll be able to get to the ball first.

, The ideal moment for a slide tackle is just after the player in possession has kicked the ball, creating separation between that player's body and the ball itself. That will give you the most room to maneuver and get your foot in the way. Keep your eye on the ball and watch absolutely nothing but the ball while you slide through to tackle. A good slide tackle should be focused on nothing but getting the ball out of the way., Before you decide to take it to the ground, do a quick double check of your emotions. You don't slide tackle a player, you slide tackle the ball to get your team control. Targeting a player will get you ejected and possibly kicked off the team.

, Lead with your dominant foot–the foot you use to kick with–and hook your leg into the ball, making contact with ball first and foremost, and sliding as softly as possible onto the ground, through the ball, and across your opponent's path.


A proper slide tackle is just like a baseball slide. You shouldn't leap up into the air and come crashing down on your hip, or you risk hurting yourself. Drop the shoulder closest to the ball and slide with your leg extended.
Never slow down before taking it to the ground. You should accelerate into a slide to make sure that your leg follows through with the motion, clearing the ball, not just falling flat.

, The legality of the slide tackle depends totally on whether or not you contact the ball first. If you clear the ball, then your opponent trips over your and lands face-first on the ground, it's legal. If you clip your opponent's shin and then clear the ball, you're going to get at least a yellow card warning, and probably worse.

, Never slide tackle unless you're wearing form-fitting shin guards of the proper size. You're throwing your leg out there to be tripped over, potentially, or stepped on by a pair of cleats, making it essential that you guard yourself. Shin guards might not be the most comfortable things to play in, but if you're going to be taking it to the ground, they're absolutely essential.

Learn when tackles and takedowns are appropriate in a fight.,
Use the double-leg takedown against heavy strikers.,
Use the body lock takedown if you miss a punch.,
Use the half-guard tackle pass.,
Go for a suplex.",How to Tackle3," In mixed martial arts, ""tackles"" are generally called ""takedowns,"" and are used to–you guessed it–take your opponent to the mat and fight on the ground. It's appropriate especially when you're fighting someone who is primarily strike-oriented, and you're more of a mat-wreslter, or think you have a better chance winning with your ground game.

, The most common takedown in MMA is the double-leg takedown, in which you drive your shoulders into your opponent's hips, grabbing both legs behind the knees and pulling them in close to you. Many fighters will drive the opponent up into the air slightly after being taken off their feet, to make the impact on the ground more powerful. For added bonus points, cage fighters can drive their opponents into the cage first, using it as an ally.


Wait for a flurry of punches to shoot down and take out the legs. Georges St. Pierre is particularly good at waiting until the opponent has dropped guard to strike and opened up to the double-leg.Freestyle wrestlers will also commonly use this move, but often somewhat lower than the MMA fighter. Technique-wise, a freestyle wrestler will often drop to their knees very quickly, shooting into the opponent's shins to pull them backward off their feet, whereas the MMA fighter needs to defend from strikes, which makes it more necessary to stay upright.
In Judo, the double-leg takedown is called the morote-gare, and has been a legal maneuver since the early 80s.

, Find yourself having thrown an overhand haymaker and missed wildly? The good news is you've probably worked your way in close enough that you can grab on for a body lock. In a body lock, you'll basically wrap your opponent's waist in your arms, with your head next to their head. To take it to the mat, wrap your dominant striking leg behind your opponent's and rotate your shoulders to turn and bring him off his feet, into the mat.


Be prepared to get a knee to the gut, or defend elbows. This isn't the most defensive-minded position, but if you execute it quickly enough, it can be a good way to get yourself out of a sticky situation, and cause cause a lot of damage.

, If your opponent is on his back in half-guard, the tackle pass is an excellent way of breaking it and getting back in control of the fight. To execute the maneuver, you basically want to roll your opponent over using the weight of your shoulders on his hips, using enough pressure to get one arm under his hip and butt area. Shoot that hand underneath and wrap up with your other hand, applying pressure and rolling him onto his back.

, They're not just for pro wrestling anymore. From a clinch or a double-overhook, a suplex can be an excellent and surprisingly legal way of taking your opponent to the mat. In the suplex, you'll wrap your opponent's torso, from either the front or the back, then twist them in the air and slam them to the mat. Easier said than done, and much more amenable to a weaker or smaller opponent, it's a common part of some MMA fighters offense, like Jon ""Bones"" Jones.Practice this in this gym before trying it. A lot. Done incorrectly, your opponent with land on your instead, and you'll end up with an angry dude sitting on your chest ready to pound your lights out.

, With the quarterback holding the ball in his natural passing grip, and slightly above his head, shoot a close up of the grip as you walk completely around him.
Shoot long snappers from ground level with views from front and behind.

, Stay in the same position for at least 10-15 seconds.

, Sit as straight up as you can, and lift one leg at a time off of the ground. This is probably going to be pretty painful and your leg might get cramped, but try to lift it for at least 10 seconds. It helps your toe-touch get higher.

, Your straddle may not be as spread out as it was, but just try to focus lifting your leg.

, You'll see a drastic improvement.


Try to record yourself doing toe-touches. It lets you see your mistakes better.

",How to Do a Cheerleading Tic Toc," Bases arms should be in front of them making a cupping position with their hands while elbows are bent and by the sides. The flyer will position herself behind the bases with her arms on their shoulders. The backspot will then be behind the flyer with her hands on the flyer's waist.;
, The bases should bend their knees so they can use their legs to absorb weight. The backspot will communicate that they are loading in by calling out ready, 1, 2 or tic toc, 1, 2. After the two is called the flyer will jump with the assistance of the backspot. The bases will keep eyes on the flyer and catch her feet.

, The flyer will extend both legs and lock out. Backspot will help the bases lift the weight by holding onto the ankles and pulling up. Weight should be divided equally from the flyer.

, The backspot will then will call out switch two and the base that has the left foot will switch her hands over to the right foot with the other base. The backspot will move both hands onto the right ankle of the flyer and continue to pull up the weight.

,, The bases and the backspot will all dip their arms down to shoulder level. The flyer should stay tight for this step and keep locked out.

, The backspot will release the right ankle while throwing the flyer back up. The flyer will switch legs that the bases will be holding. The flyer will place her left foot right into the spot that her left foot was at and should hit a lib once again. The bases will catch the foot and the stunt should be at extended arms.

, The bases and the backspot will all dip their arms down to shoulder level. The flyer should stay tight for this step and keep locked out.

, The backspot will release the right ankle while throwing the flyer back up. The flyer will switch legs that the bases will be holding. The flyer will place her left foot right into the spot that her left foot was at. The bases will catch the foot and the stunt should be at extended arms.

,, On the Two the bases will dip using their legs. The bases will flick their hands throwing the flyer into the air. The backspot will dip with the bases and also release the flyer.

Try the lunge stretch.,
Do the toe stretch everyday.,
Practice the split by doing the table stretch.,
Do ten reps of each stretch every day.",How to Do a Full Split1," Place one foot forward with your knee bent. Put your other foot behind you with your shin on the ground. Now shift your weight forward while keeping your back straight. This will help loosen the muscles in your hip. Hold for this stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat with the other leg., Stand up straight and then bend at your waist like a hinge. Let your arms fall down and try to touch your toes with your fingers. Don’t bounce up and down. Breathe deeply and try to feel the stretch in your hamstrings.

, This is a great stretch to simulate exactly what your legs will be doing once you actually do the split.Stand at a table or chair that you are able to lift your leg up on to. Place your foot on the chair so that it is at a ninety-degree angle from your body. Lean your torso into the stretch until you feel your hamstrings start to tighten. As long as you don’t feel pain, you can hold it here or keep pushing slightly further.

, Consistency is important to gain flexibility. Continue doing these stretches over the course of several weeks and you’ll find doing the split to be much easier. If you try to do a split without having any flexibility in your hip and hamstrings you risk injuring yourself.

One of the best exercises to strengthen all of your leg muscles is walking lunges. In addition, walking lunges can boost your abdominal strength when done properly.Stand with your feet hip-width apart and rest your hands on your hips. Contract your abs by pulling your belly button towards your spine. Step forward with your right foot and bend your left knee until it is almost touching the floor. Push yourself back to standing and then lunge with your left foot.
Lunge from one end of the gym, field or your room to the opposite side. Repeat until you have 10-12 reps on each leg for one set. Gradually work up to 3 sets.
Hold light hand weights or dumbbells to build leg, arm, and core strength.;
, Squats are another exercise to build overall leg strength. You can choose to do squats using your body weight or hold dumbbells or kettlebells to boost strength. If performed properly, you can also build key abdominal strength.Stand up straight with your feet hip distance apart. Keep your toes, knees and hips in a straight line. Pull your abs towards your spine by contracting them.
Lower yourself slowly until your butt makes a straight line with your knees, which should be at 90 degree angles. Make sure to keep your knees are behind your toes to prevent injury. Slowly push yourself back to starting position.
Perform 10-12 reps for one set. Gradually build up to 3 sets.

, Pliés are another great way to build leg strength. They also target some of the smaller muscles in your upper leg that help provide stability. You can also do pliés with light weights to increase your leg as well as upper body strength.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and point your toes facing outward. You’ll probably think you look like a ballerina—this is the right position. Slowly bend your knees and lower down until your bum and knees are in one line. Then slowly raise back to starting position.
Perform 10-12 reps for one set. Build yourself up to three sets. You can also do as many plié squats as possible in 45 seconds, working up to 3-45 second rounds.

, You need strong lower leg muscles to balance out your upper leg. Doing simple raises that engage your calf muscles can strengthen them and the smaller muscles of your ankles and feet. All of these will help you be a stronger and more stable base.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips. Push up slowly by lifting your heels off of the floor. You should now be balancing on the balls of your feet. Then slowly lower your heels back to floor. Do this 10-12 times for one set. Build up to 3 sets.
Hold a 5-10 pound dumbbell in each hand to increase strength in your calves and arms.

, In addition to needing strong legs to stabilize you and your teammates during moves, you also need a lot of arm strength. This helps you stabilize stunts when they are extended overhead.One of the best exercises to build arm and upper body strength are pushups. They target your chest, arm, and shoulder. Pushups can also build back and abdominal muscles.Start in plank position. Extend your arms completely and keep your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Slowly bend your elbows and lower down your body until your chest almost reaches the floor. Engage your abs and leg muscles during each pushup to help build core and leg strength.
Perform half-plank, or knee, pushups if you can’t do full pushups from plank position. Get into full plank and then place your knees on the ground for half-plank position.

, Pull ups are another very effective ways to build the upper body strength you need as a base. Try different types of grips or pull up variations to develop your arm, shoulder, and back strength. In addition, pull ups can also challenge your core muscles.Grasp an overhead bar with a narrow or wide grip. Hang securely from the bar and engage your upper body and abs. Then pull up your entire body until your chin clears the bar.
Try alternatives if you can’t do a full pull up from hanging position. Place a box under your feet and jump up until your chin is over the bar. Then return to starting position on the box. Keep doing the alternative jumping pull up until you build enough strength to perform regular pull-ups.

, Your shoulders also need to be strong to be a strong cheerleader base. Presses are a great way to build up your shoulders and arm muscles by lifting weight directly above your head.Use a set of dumbbells or weighted bar for overhead presses. The weight should be comfortable but challenge you. Grip the dumbbells or bar slightly wider than your shoulders. Stand upright with your feet slightly apart and contract your abs as you press the weight straight upward until your arms are straight. Lower the weight back down and repeat for 10-12 reps.
Build up gradually to 3 sets of 10-12 reps.

, Tricep dips are another excellent exercise that can build arm strength and help you be a stronger cheerleading base. They also help build overall upper body and core strength.Sit in a chair or on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the floor. Hang on to the front edge and rotate your palms so that they face away from you. Walk your feet out in front of you so that your back lightly skims the chair or bench. Bend your elbows and slowly dip your body down. Lower down until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle. Straighten your elbows and push back up to the starting position.
Repeat for 10-12 reps for one set. Build up your strength until you can do 3 sets.

, Being a cheerleading base requires not only physical strength, but also endurance. Combining your strength training with cardio can boost your overall strength and ability to perform routines that usually last a few minutes. You should get at least three days of cardio every week, but may want to do up to 5 -6 days.Aim for 150 minutes of activity every week. This total can include your cardio and strength training. You may want to do 75 minutes of vigorous cardio and 75 minutes of more moderate strength training.Choose cardio that challenge your body and complements your cheering. For example, running, biking, and jumping rope can build endurance and leg strength. Other sports such as rowing swimming boost endurance while building overall body strength. You can mix these sports to get the most benefit out of them.

, If you find it hard to motivate yourself to do cardio, consider trying out different classes at a local gym. Cardio burn, barre, and boot camp classes can help you get build endurance. Many classes work with free weights that also make your muscles stronger. Take part in a class as an alternative to cardio.Ask a coach for suggestions about the types of classes that may benefit you as a cheerleading base. Something that is a mixture of cardio and strength may be a great option for you.

, Consider adding a day of yoga or Pilates to your weekly exercise to be a stronger cheerleading base. You can take a class in a studio or online. Yoga and Pilates are lower-impact exercises that can strengthen and stretch your muscles. They may also boost your cardiovascular endurance.Recognize that yoga and Pilates have poses and exercises that can target specific muscle groups, such as your legs and arms. They are also great at building flexibility, which is an important part of being a strong base., Every individual needs enough rest to recover from any type of activity. This is especially true if you’re training hard to be the best cheerleader and base you can be. Allowing yourself to rest when your body is tired can help your body recover as well as promote strength and endurance. Not getting enough rest may even reverse all of your hard training.Sleep for 8-9 hours every night. Take a 30 minute nap to relax and refresh if you feel tired., A great way to build more strength to your bases and put your conditioning to work is to practice your routines. See if your teammates or fellow cheerleaders would like to practice with you. This can help you—and them—become stronger and better bases or flyers.Figure out what skills you and your fellow cheerleaders need to practice. It could be things such as dipping to lift, timing, or hand position. Once you’ve done this, come up with a plan to practice the skills you and your teammates want to develop. Remember to build up skills gradually.
Make sure you have someone who can spot moves as you practice. This can minimize the risk of injury.

, As a base, it’s your job to boost flyers and be their stable foundation and landing spot. Using the strength you built with weights and endurance training, practice your lifts with your teammates or fellow cheerleaders. This can not only refine your base skills, but also build more strength.Use any routines you may have as your guide post for what lifts to practice. Specifically targeting moves you’ll use can help you be a stronger base and develop your skills.
Consider starting out with toss drills, which can prepare you to move on to full lifts. For example, maybe you need to work on dipping deeper to lift your flyer higher. You could start out with some deep squats by yourself, move to practicing deep lifts with a partner, and then try a few full lifts.Make sure you’re paying attention to elements such as proper hand position and timing. Both are components of being a strong base.

, Another key job of a cheerleading base is catching flyers. After you lift or boost your flyer, you’ll need to catch the person in the most stable way possible. As you work on your lifting skills, make sure to practice your catching as well.Work on catching as a unit with other bases as well as individual catches. Focus on elements such as hand position, timing, and keeping your muscles as engaged as possible. These elements can ensure that you and your flyer stay safe during catches.
Talk to flyers and coaches to get tips on how you might be a stronger and more effective base.

Help her dismount.",How to Do a Cheerleading Basket Toss," Have the other person acting as a base do this, too. This will form a platform, in a square shape, for the flyer to stand on and catapult off of.


Grab your own wrist and their wrist just below the wrist bones. Keep your grip loose and flexible. Too much rigidity will keep the toss from going anywhere. Adjust as necessary until you two feel comfortable.;
, Keep your hips over your toes and your feet a little more than shoulder width apart. Always keep your back straight! If you don’t, you could injure yourself.


Make yourself the height of the other base, if possible, by widening your stance (or having them widen theirs). The best pairs of bases are roughly the same height. What’s more, the taller you are, the easier it will be to hoist the flyer higher into the air – don't compromise height if you don't have to.

, When you’re practicing, take the time to make sure the flyer feels secure. Are her hands nestled into the crick of your neck and do they feel sturdy? How is her right foot placed on your hands? Is it centered? This initial stage is very important to the success of the stunt.


Do plenty of basket drills before you go up in the actual stunt. Essentially, all you do is set up the flyer and stop when her feet touch your hands. If, in that position, her hands and feet are sturdy, centered, and secure, you're doing it right. Try to limit the time it takes to make the process as fluid as possible.

, The flyer sets up the stunt with her right foot on your hands and her hands on your shoulder. Then, the backspot is going to help hoist her whole body onto your wrists and hands. As her left foot touches down too (that's all her weight now), bend down slightly as if you’re starting a slingshot.


There should be no jerky movements in this stunt. You and your base partner simply bend your knees and your arms lower with the rest of your body and her to accommodate her weight. It is one giant, slingshot motion.
If you are jerky, do a practice drill. Do everything up until this point, and then mimic like you’re going to throw her into the air, stopping much before you actually would. This will help all of you get the timing of it.

, Straighten your legs and throw your arms up, giving the flyer as much height as possible using all of your body. Release the other base’s wrists as soon as you feel them moving away – don’t hold on. With a little flick of the wrists, she's into the air.


The more oomph you put behind this movement, the more you use your entire body, the higher she is going to fly. As you’re dipping down with the placement of her left foot, take the power from your feet and drive it upward.
You can even jump a little bit, adding even more height to your basket. Let’s say you’re 70 inches (177.8 cm) tall, with a thrust of 48 inches (121.9 cm). That’s a basket toss that’s 118 inches (299.7 cm) high. With a jump, it becomes 122 inches (309.9 cm) – and it all adds up! Each inch more is that much more impressive.

, She may move in the air and you’ll have to follow her below. If you threw her to the right or left (like a human bowling ball), you're going to have to catch her to the right or left.


Of course, ideally, you throw her straight up, plant your feet, and she comes directly back down – you should barely have to move an inch. But if that doesn't happen, adjust your positioning to catch her.

, Make sure to stay in front of the other base at all times – you two should move as one. You'll be on one side of the flyer and the other base on the other. The flyer's arms should land around your neck.


Absorb her body weight as she comes down, bending your arms and knees as she lands into your makeshift cradle. Aim for one arm around her back and one around her knees.

, To dismount, you have two options:


From your dip, simply hoist her in front of you, slightly lowering your arm around her knees and pushing your arm around her back forward. She should then be easily able to stand just in front of you.
From your dip, bounce her back up to where her feet can land in your hands again, and move onto a different stunt right away – another basket toss or elevator perhaps?

, Do whichever feels more comfortable for you. For most girls, nestling your hands in the crick of the bases’ necks feels the most secure. Your thumb should be on their collarbone and your fingers towards their back.


Make sure you feel sturdy. If you don’t, adjust. Don't worry about hurting or strangling the bases – you definitely won't.

, Their wrists are interwoven to provide you with a platform to step up. Rest your right foot on the right side of the platform in preparation for the stunt. This is your starting position.


When you're ready, the backspot will count off for you, cuing you for each movement. On cue, she will hoist you up to put your left foot on the platform, too. You will be in a crouching position.

, Put all your weight in your arms, taking the weight off the bases' hands. This will help send your body skyrocketing, allowing you to propel yourself, in addition to the bases providing you that effortless power.


Don’t jump. You want contact for as long as possible to rev up and gain velocity. If you do jump, odds are your jump will be slightly off the timing of the bases, which will result in a choppy, unpowerful lurch into the air.

, You should mainly contact the bases’ hands with the balls of your feet – this helps you act as a spring instead of a dead weight that has to be hoisted into the air. It's also easier to point your toes from this position.


Think of how you jump. Do you jump flat-footed? Probably not. When you're crouching on their hands, make sure the balls of your feet are where the brunt of the action is taking place, so you can lift off from there.

, When you feel the bases propelling you upwards and your feet are about to leave their hands, pull yourself up. While airborne, keep your back straight and legs locked out, so that your body is in a straight line. It should feel as if a cord is pulling your entire body along an even plane.


You should remain in this position until you reach the peak of the toss. At that point you can hit a motion or do a trick.You want it to look as clean as possible from beginning to end.
Keep your legs and hands tucked in so you don’t hurt those on the ground as you go up. A flailing arm or leg can do some serious damage.

, During a straight ride, put your arms straight in the air or in a high V and keep your legs straight. Point your toes and that’s it!


A few options other than a straight ride are a toe touch, kick-arch, pretty woman, back tuck, full tuck, and many more. The higher you get into the air, the easier a trick will be (the more time you'll have to do it).

, Aside from the normal basket toss, a toe touch is the most common add-on. Do as you would normally do for a traditional basket, but instead of coming down riding up as a layout you will add a quick toe touch.


Ride up as high as you can then quickly pull a toe touch, keeping your back straight. When pulling back into a layout then v shape, snap down from your toe touch quickly, it will look much cleaner than slowly coming down to your final positions.
You also won't have that much time to get into your layout/v sit so snapping down will give plenty of time to land in the bases arms.

, Keep your arms up in order to wrap around the necks of your bases when you land (and to avoid knocking them in the head when you do). To pike, bring your toes up toward you (still pointed!), putting your body in a slight curve to be cradled.


As long as you don't flail about and stay relaxed, it will be easy to catch you. Don't worry! At the very least, you'll land on them and they'll break your fall!

, This is a very complicated move to pull in a basket toss so practice the less complicated moves first. The whole back flip will be completed in one motion, so there's no snap down into the cradle.


Once you feel yourself leaving the bases arms, start to rotate into your back flip, keep in mind most people don't grab their knees or tuck in the back flip.
Most people come around piked, this makes it a lot easier to land in a V shape when you are caught.

, Once you’re cradled, the bases will bend down and place you gently on the ground (or they should if all has gone correctly). You can then resume the cheer from the safety of your own two feet.


Or go back into a stunt. From a cradle, the bases can bend once again, and on the upward bounce you pull your feet in – they can then rest in the bases’ hands, ready for the next basket toss or elevator.

, Make sure you have a firm grip on her and can’t slide on her shirt, shorts, or skirt. If you need to, make skin-to-skin contact to be sure.


Always be a bit tighter than you think you need to be. You are not running the risk of hurting the flyer or impeding the stunt if you're holding on tightly. In fact, that way you can give her more power.

, You time the stunt, keeping everyone in sync.


For an eight count, “1, 2” should be the team getting into position. On “3,4” the bases bend their knees and the flyer lifts her right foot into their hands. On “5,6” the flyer loads in her left foot and the rest of her body and the team dips down. On “7,8” she is thrusted upward into the air.
With everyone in position, instead, you can count, “1” for the flyer putting in her right foot. “2” for her left foot, “down” for the dip, and “up!” for throwing her into the air.

, You have the ability to put the flyer exactly where she needs to be placed – on the center of the platform the bases are making with their wrists. Make sure she's in the right spot for lift off.


You are also the reason she can get into their hands in the first place. Without a boost from you, she won't even be able to get off the ground. Use your legs to hoist her into position and to put you into position for throwing her upwards.

, Straighten your legs, using them for power, to give her that initial thrust. With your hands still on her hips, drive her up into the air, breaking contact when you feel her moving away from you.


Make sure to throw her straight up so she doesn't curve to the left, right, backwards, or forwards. Your hands guide her direction more than anyone else's.

, Sometimes the flyer doesn’t go straight up into the air and instead moves off in a different direction entirely. This is either because her weight was unevenly distributed or because she was veered into another direction by you or base propelling unequally. Because of this, it’s incredibly important to watch her so you can adjust your placement to catch her.


Follow the bases, staying slightly behind them. You'll be catching her arms, back, and neck.

, The bases will be in front of you, catching her around her torso and legs, off to her side. You are behind her, catching her by her armpits – her arms will be wrapped around the bases’ necks.

Make fists with your hands, so you don't end up slapping or poking the flyer or the bases. Your arms should jut out in front of you as you see her coming down, but your elbows should be relaxed. No one's body, including yours, should be rigid.

, You have two options:

The bases will lower their arms around her legs, and she will go onto the ground. All you have to do is give her a little nudge forward with your forearms and then move out of the way.
If she goes up into another stunt immediately, use your arms to hoist her up to where she can place her feet back into the bases hands. Immediately move your hands back onto her waist and send her up into another toss or an elevator.

, It’s a good idea to take off your socks so that you are able to keep your balance. Consider using a yoga or exercise mat too – if you slip and fall into the split too quickly you might seriously strain a muscle or pull your hamstring., As you stretch your left leg back, put your left foot on the ground with the outer side of your foot facing down. You should begin to feel some tension in your hamstrings at this point. Don’t be afraid to put your hands on the ground so you can keep your balance and ease yourself down., As you get lower your right leg should get straighter Continue using your hands for balance, as you get lower. Breathe deeply and relax – trust your flexibility. If you’re tensed up preparing to feel pain it will be much harder to do the split.As you learn, consider putting yoga blocks to your right and left. This way you can place your hands on them and have stability much earlier.
If you feel any pain at all, stop. Continue your stretching regimen and try again in another few days.

, You right foot will slide forward and your left leg will slide back. Your weight should transfer to your heels as you start to move into a deeper split, and then the pressure will transfer to your hamstrings.

Lean against the ground with both palms firmly grounded and your hips lifting up high and back.Pause and rock back and forth on your legs a little bit to loosen up your legs more.

, Keep a steady deep breath and try to step forward on an exhale. You want your right foot to step out between your two hands so that it is planted in between them. Now start leaning into your left knee, which will naturally release the top of your left foot from the ground., The goal is to have your hands by your hips with your fingertips touching the ground. If you don’t feel flexible enough to do this yet, try using blocks to give your hands a higher surface to rest on. Once you have gotten your hands out to your side you can begin the process of slowly sinking the weight down into your hips., As you sink into your hips, flex your foot and let your right heel slowly move forward. Be smooth and breath deeply. As you do this, keep wiggling your left knee backwards to maintain an even weight.

, Don’t force your legs onto the floor. If they don’t fall down naturally while you breathe and sink your hips, just keep your hands propped up on the floor or on the blocks.

, If you try to roll out of the split you might hurt yourself.

If you became a cheerleader, congratulations!,
If you don't make it, don't give up!",How to Become a Cheerleader in Middle School," If you don't know the exact date, begin training as soon as possible. Besides, training more is better. Also over the summer you should take a tumbling class. Most middle school cheerleading is all or mostly tumbling.;
, You should have plenty of protein, fruits, vegetables, and carbs in your diet. Make sure everything you eat is super healthy. Eat 3 meals a day and 3 snacks a day. You should train before and after school. A healthy meal plan to follow is for breakfast, eat a small bowl of oatmeal, a banana, a small slice of cheese, a spoonful of peanut butter, and 3 glasses of water. Straight before morning practice eat an energy bar or a cereal bar. This is your morning snack. For lunch, eat a nice sandwich that has 5 slices of meat, 1 slice of cheese, no mayo, and lettuce. Also, eat 10 baby carrots and 5 grapes. Before your afternoon workout eat another nutrition bar. Eat whatever your parents make for dinner. For dessert, eat vanilla yogurt with peanut butter mixed in.

, You need to train for specific cheer moves like jumps, motions, and tumbling, and for overall endurance, strength, and flexibility. To train for jumps, you need to do at least 30 straddle leg lifts on each leg. A straddle leg lift is when you sit in a straddle and lift up one leg at a time without letting it touch the floor. You also need to do 30 squat jumps, 15 hops on each foot, 30 toe raises, and 30 squats. Don't forget cheerleader crunches, which is where you lie on your back with your arms above your head and crunch up into a toe touch on the floor, do 15 of these. Also, doing 10 of each required jump is great! For your motions, learn how to do bow and arrow, daggers, go or punch, hands on hips, left L, right L, left K, right K, left diagonal, right diagonal, T, broken T, high V, low V, touchdown, and low touchdown. Keep these motions stiff and tight. For tumbling, do 10 cartwheels, 10 round offs, and 10 handstands. Make sure you keep your arms and legs straight and tight and your toes pointed. Imagine you are a board. For endurance, do cardio 4 days a week. Do a cardio workout routine video. For strength training, which should be done 3 days a week, do a workout video that focuses on strengthening your arms one day, your legs one day, and your abs another day. For flexibility, do stretches twice a day. You need to have a good split.

, Practice speaking loud and clear. Make sure you don't sing your words and they are low pitched, loud, and clear. Practice a good voice everyday by doing breathing exercises, speaking loud, and making sure every word that you say isn't too quick, slow, or mumbled.

, You should be able to do a good toe touch, right herkie, and left herkie. You also need a solid cartwheel and round off. You need to have good motions, a split, and a strong voice.

, You need to stand out at tryouts. If you can do a herkie, toe touch, split, cartwheel, and round off, you should be able to make it. During cheerleading tryouts, dress neatly in a school shirt, dance shorts, dance or cheer shoes, your hair in a high ponytail with a bow, your nails painted with a clear polish, clean makeup, and a tattoo on your cheek or hand. For school shirts, make sure they are in your school colors and not a polo or collared shirt. Tie up the back if it is too long. Wear black dance shorts if you aren't super duper tan and pastel shorts if you are super duper tan. Your dance/cheer shoes should be either white or black with white ankle socks. If you go with dance shoes, jazz are the best. For your hair, brush it into a ponytail that is behind your part and high. Wear a bow in either white or your school colors. Make sure your hair is straight. For your nails, take off any nail polish and cut them so they are kind of short, but not too short. Round them off and paint with either a clear or clear with glitter nail polish. You can do some sparkly rhinestone nail art to one nail if you want. You should do your makeup simply and flawlessly. Apply a tinted moisturizer, skin colored eyeshadow, light bronzer, and lip gloss. For your tattoo, make it have to do with your mascot, for example a paw print, animal, or school initials. On the first day of tryouts, they will have you perform a cheer, a toe touch, and optional tumbling. Do your cheer with gusto, make it loud, snappy, and sharp. Make sure you bring your legs up high in the toe touch and your back straight. For tumbling, do your cartwheel, round off, and handstand. In the breakout and warm up/stretching sessions, show off your split, straddle, and bridge. Give girls advice if they ask about your moves. On the second day, add some glitter to your lips and eyes, but not too much. You will perform a toe touch, herkie, split, cartwheel, round off, handstand, and cheer. You will do similar things to yesterday, but you have to be even better than before. Show off your oversplit if you are there.

, Don't slack off of your diet, endurance, strength, and stretching routines. You don't have to do the other stuff because you will be doing it at practice. Don't stuff your head with ideas about cheerleaders and think you are better than the others. Make sure you are an awesome cheerleader and bring it! You can wear tank tops to practice if you want.

, You can try out for an All Star team if you want or you can keep training on your own for the next year. Try to fit the cheerleading stereotype if you think that you were good enough but didn't look like a cheerleader or stand out. If you fit the cheerleader stereotype, but weren't good enough, train even more and for longer sessions until you have the best jumps in town!

Get fit.,
Take private lessons.,
Buy equipment and practice at home.,
Improve your basics.",How to Become a Better Cheerleader1," Run at least twice a week for about 1hour minutes. Do other things like push-ups, crunches, and planks. Also improve your flexibility. Having flexible shoulders, arms, and back will help you a lot with your tumbling. Exercises that can help improve flexibility are snake/seal stretches, bridges, splits, rocking bridges, backbend kickovers, front walkovers, straddle, pancake, and others.;
, Private lessons will help you work on a skill you need to improve on or really need to learn on something, like a back handspring or tuck.

, Mats, handspring machines, octagons, and rebound machines can really help.

, If you have a bad handstand, all your tumbling tricks will have bad landings. A round-off is another basic skill that is one of the most important skills in cheerleading and gymnastics.

Make a tee out of an old 1.5-liter bottle for a quick and easy kicking platform.,
Clean out the bottle and remove any labels.,
Use a boxcutter, sharp knife, or a fresh pair of scissors to cut the bottom off the bottle.,
Make a mark 4.5"" from the bottom of the bottle.,
Make a mark 9"" from the bottom of the bottle directly opposite your first mark.,
Connect your two marks with a circle around the entire bottle.,
Cut along your outline to make the tee.,
Customize your tee to make it heavier or suit it to your needs.",How to Make a Rugby Kicking Tee1," There are no hard and fast rules about what can and can't be a kicking tee, so as long as the finished bottle doesn't have any jagged edges it should be perfect. In fact, Dartmouth recently used a water bottle against Yale in a game where they forgot their tee., Give the bottle a quick rinse to get the juice or soda out, then remove any labels and caps. You just want a plain clear bottle to work with.

, You want to cut a clean, straight line across the bottom, roughly 1.5 inches up. The final cylinder should be smooth and regular, forming a perfect circular opening on the bottom.


This is the part of the tee that sits on the ground, so the more evenly you cut it the better it will balance.

, This is going to be the lower end of your tee. Most rugby tees are angled, allowing you to balance the ball so that you kick the nose of it, so you'll need to make two different cuts. Mark them out first to make sure the finished tee is even.

, This is going to be the high end of your tee. Look through the bottle and make your mark so that it is lined up across from the 4.5"" mark.

, This is easiest if you just connect the two marks with your marker. You'll be left with a diagonal ring around the bottle.


Try your best to make these lines identical. It is not crucial for a quick, makeshift tee, but it will help the ball stay in place.
Try to connect the sides with a gentle, sideways ""s"" shaped line, so that the highest point on the tee is just before the 9"" mark., Once you've finished your lines, use the box cutter again to cut along your line, making your final tee.


Depending on your cutting tool, the edge may be rough and jagged. If it is, simply cover the entire edge with electrical tape. This has the added benefit of making the tee easier to see as well.

, The basic design can be easily tweaked if you need, and requires few other tools:


Tape 4-5 quarters to the tee to make it heavier, which will keep in place on windy days.
Cut a gentler line if you usually kick horizontally. If you kick on the nose, simply cut the 9"" mark further down, near 7-8"" instead.
Trace out the arc of a real tee and cut it into your bottle for a better tee. The ""s"" shaped curve of a real tee is hard to replicate, but you can study real tees and trace their shape on paper. Transfer this paper to the bottle, trace the line on the bottle, and then cut."

Start with the scrum.,
Change your strategy if they have the ball.,
Move onto the line-outs.,
Stay in place if the other team has the ball.,
Cover 'loose play'.",How to Play Hooker in Rugby," In the scrum the hooker is the middle of the front row. Usually if it is your teams ball, you will be able to signal, via your hand which should be visible to your Scrum half, when the ball goes in, This way, you have the element of surprise. Now that the ball rolls in, you want to sweep it back. The ball always (should) comes in from your left. If you are right footed, you want to sweep across the ""tunnel"" with your foot and gently roll it back between your Loose head Props legs. It sounds pretty easy but it's a challenge whilst the other teams hooker is contesting you.;
, You have no idea when it rolls in and the other Scrum half may try to roll it towards their own side (illegal but popular). The best thing you can do is to shoot out with your good leg and try to either kick or steal the ball. If you can kick it out to your scrum half, he might be able to keep possession of it. Another move involves trying to kick the ball onto the other hooker's legs and so it bounces back to you.

, If it is your teams ball, you are most likely throwing in, so you want to call out your play and throw it through the 'tunnel' so it falls down close to the 'pod' you are throwing to. If your team maintains the ball and the line-out becomes a maul, you want to join in the action.

, If the other team has the ball you will stay in the same area as before, but this time facing side ways towards the other team. So on your outside you have the Opposite Hooker/thrower and on your inside you will have the line-out. When the play is called, you want to read it. If you can learn their calls throughout the game, and give calls/codes of your own, you might very well be able to counter the enemy's move, but if you fail, it might not go down too well. When the ball is thrown, you want to follow the ball on your side, and as soon as it is caught/given to the scrum-half you want to rush into him and tackle him.

, When the ball is being handled by the backs, you want to have a supporting role; following the play and making it to the breakdowns. As a hooker, you are one of the faster/lighter forwards and you should be one of the first on the scene. In rucks/mauls, you are a third prop, and your job is to wreak havoc in the other team's setups. A play might be called where the forwards would advance as a whole to smash through the opposition's defensive line, in this situation, all you can do is smash forward.

Use long, accurate spirals for big passes.,
Place your right hand on the back of the ball.,
Place your left hand underneath the ball at the other end.,
Pull the ball back to your right hip.,
Turn your upper body to face the target.,
Toss your arms at the target, keeping the ball low and horizontal.,
Pull the fingers on your right hand back towards your body.,
Follow through with both arms extended at your target.",How to Spin a Rugby Ball1," A clean spiral is essential, especially for the scrum and fly-halves. A spiral is the classic, across the body throw, where a player uses their arms and a quick snap of the wrist to quickly launch the ball as far as possible.


Accuracy is always more important than spin. You should focus on hitting your target before getting the spin right.
If you're doubtful about your ability to pull off a long throw, take the ball into a tackle. You'll maintain possession of the ball, which is far more valuable than risking a difficult pass.;
, The ball is horizontal in front of you, and your right hand is near the end of the ball. The arc between your thumb and first finger should point at your desired target. The most common pass is a standard throw with your right hand, across the body to your left, and behind you. Remember, a rugby pass can never be thrown forward, so don't practice throwing ahead of you.


Place your right hand on the top of the ball, then slide it towards the point until just the edge of your palm is touching the end of the ball.
If you have big hands, move them slightly towards the front of the ball, fingers curled around the sides. You should be able to hold onto the ball with just your right hand, so adjust your hands until this is possible., The left hand is a guiding hand, meaning it doesn't have to grip tightly. Simply place it underneath the ball, palm up, so that your thumb is near the left-most point (nose) of the ball.

, While you use your right arm for most of the power on a right-handed throw, you want to get your body as involved as possible for maximum strength. Pull the ball back to your hip, leaving it roughly horizontal as you do.


Try and keep the ball pointing the right way as you bring it down -- you don't want to try rotating it into the right alignment as you throw it.

, With the ball still down at your hips, rotate your shoulders to your teammate. The better your shoulders are squared up to them, the more accurate your throw will be.


It is often best to practice in a horizontal line. This allows you to focus on throwing sideways, turning your shoulders for each throw while your feet face forward., Keep the ball at roughly the same level, roughly hip/belly height, throughout the throwing motion. Your right arm will give most of the power, so focus on pushing from the right on a right-handed throw. Use your left hand to guide the throw to its target.


Your inside arm will stay relatively in place, elbow slightly bent.
Your outside arm should curve a bit outside, with the elbow pointing out., As you finish the throw, slide your right hand down and towards your chest, ""pulling"" the skin of the ball down and into a spin. This is the hardest part of the motion, but is easy to learn with some practice.


As you get better you can also snap your left thumb down to put even more spin on the ball., Keep your hands moving until both arms are fully extended. They should point at your target. In general, your left palm will face up from guiding the ball and your right palm will face down from the wrist snap.

Learn Tackle 1: You have formed a defensive line, and the ball has just come out of the ruck - you have two options.,
Depending on the situation, you have to make your mind up.

,
We now come to the contact situation.,
Decide where to tackle.,
Dump Tackle.,
Tap Tackle.",How to Rugby Tackle Everyone That Runs at You,"


Look for and follow the ball, but make sure that you stay opposite your man






Keep your eyes solely on the man that you are intending to tackle.





;
,,

When you first go into contact, the first thing you want to do is hit with your shoulder.






This can be difficult for tall people that are tackling smaller people.






But if you imagine that there is a circle around every player, you must put your foot into their circle before you make the tackle. If you don't, then the tackle that you make won't be very strong and chances are, the person that you are trying to tackle, gets away.






The first point of contact should be your shoulder. If you are tackling a fast person, then you should try very hard to get into their circle. When making first contact, you make the tackle with the same shoulder as the foot you put in their circle e.g., right foot, right shoulder. And after you make the tackle, you should do a motion with your legs called, leg drive. This means that as soon as you make the tackle, you keep your legs moving as if you are running flat out. This will hopefully allow you to win the contact situation.







, You should aim to hit the person around the stomach area with your shoulder and follow through with leg drive. This is really important as if you tackle too high - high tackle - penalty - possible yellow or red card. If you tackle too low then you risk getting a knee to the face. This isn't good either.

, You should do exactly the same before contact ""run up"" as you do in the normal tackle, except that when you make contact you still lead with your shoulder, you still hit the stomach area, but after the initial hit, you pick up the players legs and lift to the side. Watch pro rugby players for actual dump tackles. The only advice I can give you for doing this kind of tackle is, be careful that you don't drop the person on their neck or head as this could result in them getting SERIOUSLY injured and/or you being sent off. You want to AVOID this at all costs so, I recommend doing a dump tackle if the person is running near to or straight at you.

, When you are chasing someone, and they are to far in front for you to make a real hit on them, you can attempt a tap tackle. It sounds exactly like what it is. You dive for their feet in an attempt to tap their ankles and bring them down or make them trip. This should be used as a last resort at bringing someone down. Don't cower out of a tackle and then chase and do a tap tackle for two reasons.


You will look like a coward for letting them through, and you will find it harder to tap tackle than normal tackle.

Use your heel to spike a divot in the ground.,
Use a practice cone.,
Use your other shoe.",How to Make a Rugby Kicking Tee2," As long as the ground isn't bone dry, you can prop the nose of the ball in a small divot and use it as a makeshift tee. To do so, simply kick your heel into the ground, aiming with the point where the back of the shoe meets the bottom. You want to be facing the direction you're kicking when you make the divot. Then ease the nose of the ball into the ground.


If you normally kick with a tee, you'll need to take a few practice hits to get used to the new ball placement. It is slightly lower than a tee, meaning you need to get your foot a little further under the ball to get it up.

, You want one of the round, low cones. While a little bit higher than a standard tee, you can balance the ball easily on the hole in the tip and use it to elevate the ball for a perfect kick.

, While it is not the most elegant solution, a high school team in the United States once used the opening in the top of a cleat to prop the ball up, allowing the kicker to make full contact with the ball."

Use gentle spins for short passes and quick pops.,
Hold the ball with both hands, nose pointed up.,
Slightly pull the ball to your right ribcage.,
Push the ball to the target, keeping the nose up.,
Snap your fingers back towards your chest as you release.",How to Spin a Rugby Ball2," Spinning the ball keeps it stable, meaning that your teammates can prepare their hands to grab the ball seamless out of the air instead of trying to manage a wildly flailing or rotating ball. A simple spin pass is one of the quickest ways to move the ball short distances.


Accuracy is always more important than spin, so make sure you're hitting your target on throws first., This is a good position whenever you're running in open space, as it gives you lots of options. Focus on using your fingers, not your palms, to grip the ball as much as possible. From this stance, with the ball in front of your body and pointing up, you have lots of options for moves:


You can spin pass to either side.
You can drop the ball down to either hip to prepare for a long pass.
You can tuck the ball into your chest for a tackle.
You can fake throwing the ball either direction., If you're throwing with your right hand, you'll be pushing the ball to your left. Cock the ball back slightly to get a little extra power by pulling the ball over to your ribcage.

, You're aiming for your teammate's chest. Push the ball out towards them with your right hand.

, As the ball, pull your fingers back towards you, as if you were gripping a bar on a subway or train. This puts the spin on the ball. You can also work on snapping your left thumb forward, spinning the ball clockwise as you release."
"
Practice one-handed throws to improve your technique.,
Improve your throw with a lighter grip.,
Try some throwing drills to improve your play.,
Know when to spin it an when to keep it simple.",How to Spin a Rugby Ball3," One of the best ways to start beginners is with one-handed throws. This helps them master their dominant hand motion for a full spiral. Have them grip the ball with their dominate hand, cupping along the side and underneath the ball, towards the back. From there:


Grip the ball near your hip, holding on to the back half.
Cock the elbow back, pointing the nose of the ball at your target.
Snap your arm forward to throw the ball.
Twist your wrist over and to the left, snapping your fingers to spin the ball out., It may seem counter-intuitive, but a light grip on the ball actually leads to greater power and accuracy. Once you're comfortable with the motion, work on holding the ball only with your fingertips, allowing you to pull on them to get perfect spin., The best way to improve your throw is to practice. While you should always throw back and forth during practice, there are some focused drills that can make your a better thrower over time:



Quick Hands: From a straight horizontal line with 3-5 players, 3-5 meters apart. Keeping your feet in place, work on throwing the ball down and back across the line as quickly as possible. As you get better, increase the distance.

Mini-Lines: Get three players and jog down the field with a ball in a line. As soon as you pass it, drop back so that you are behind the player with the ball and they can legally pass it. As soon as you get the ball, sprint ahead 2-3 steps to put your other players in legal throwing position. Keep throwing and moving amongst the three of you the length of the field.

, A spin gives the ball stability, helping to retain speed and accuracy as it moves through the air. This makes it the most reliable throw in your arsenal, but that doesn't mean you should use it every time. Sometimes you shouldn't pass at all, or you should use a simple, unspun ""pop"" pass instead, such as:


When you're being tackled. If your arms aren't free, you won't be able to spin it accurately enough for a throw.
When you're out of space or time. A good throw takes a little time, and your arms cover a wide distance. If a defender can clip one of your arms while throwing your accuracy is going to be way off, and you could cost your team a turnover.
When making very short passes. The best thing to do here is simply pop the ball up, without spin. This allows the teammate to run through the ball, ideally catching it when it is still barely moving in midair."
"
Approach the tackle with confidence.,
Stay upright as long as you can.,
Keep your head and eyes focused.,
Position yourself at the correct distance.,
Determine the safe side of the ball carrier.,
Perform proper collision tackles.,
Make a proper tackle when chasing the ball carrier.,
Utilize a tackling form that fits the situation.,
Drive forward with the power of your legs.,
Apply pressure with your arms and shoulders.,
Prepare to keep playing.",How to Tackle in Rugby," If you go into a tackle without thinking you’re going to succeed, you’re making a big mistake. Having the mental edge makes a big difference. You have to be the one who wants it more. It doesn’t matter if you’re outsized, as long as you utilize proper tackling technique you can prevail over larger ball carriers.


Don’t panic! Losing your confidence leads to hesitating, which could cost you your advantage as the initiator of the contact.;
, When you lose verticality you lose the ability to move laterally. This makes staying in line with your target very difficult. This is where the right stance comes into play. Keep you knees bent with your feet shoulder-width apart, your head up, and your back straight. Keep your arms up and ready to engage the runner.


It’s imperative to maintain a low center of gravity relative to your target. Whoever gets lower has more leverage through the hit.

, Committing to the tackle and putting your head down too early can cost an embarrassing misfire.Watch your opponents waist instead of his eyes, shoulder, or legs. Typically, the waist is a reliable indicator of the direction the runner will take.

, You want to begin your tackling process about 2 meters from the ball carrier. This gives you enough space work through your tackling technique and generate power while staying in close enough proximity to ensure you won’t miss.


Imagine there is a circle around the target player that extends about the length of their body in all directions. You should only begin your tackling motion once you’ve stepped inside the circle.

, The runner rarely approaches a defender head-on, as this would decrease his chances of escaping the tackle. Therefore, it’s up to the defender to recognize the angle the runner takes and intercept that path. The side closest to the defender is the safe side, and focusing on landing the tackle on the safe side increases the likelihood of a solid hit.

, When you and the ball carrier are heading towards one another, it’s important to use proper technique to bring him down. Once you’ve identified the safe side and assumed a good stance, establish first contact by pressing your shoulder into the midsection of the ball carrier.


Hitting too high or too low can allow the runner to break out of the tackle easier, so focus on the are between the thigh and torso.
Once you've entered the imaginary tackling circle, wait for the last possible moment to lower your upper body and drive your shoulder into the runner, with your head to his side.
As you connect with the shoulder, wrap your arms tightly around the ball carrier’s thighs. Swinging the arms into the runner adds momentum and force to more effectively hinder his progress at the onset of the tackle.
Don’t slow down! Many players make less effective tackles, or miss them completely, by giving up their forward momentum. Avoid planting your feet as you make contact and be sure to drive through the hit by pushing forwards with your legs.

, Not all tackles are made face to face. Often times, you’ll have to track down a ball carrier by sprinting down field. When this happens, there’s no opportunity to drive them backwards, so understanding how to bring them down from behind can be the difference between giving up a try and saving one.


Jersey tackling, or pulling a player down by his jersey is frowned upon and may result in a penalty. Many refs turn a blind eye to this if there’s no flagrant intent to harm a player. Consider it as a last resort, and be careful not to inflict unnecessary harm.
A tap tackle is made by grabbing at the ball carrier’s leg beneath the knee. At high speeds, even the slightest contact can disrupt a runner when planting his foot and lead to an effective trip up.
Dive at the runner if you can't catch up to make a full tackle and try to put as much force as you can into the contact against their feet or ankles.

, Sometimes you can’t get in front of a player, or the pace of play is somewhat abnormal and you have to adjust your technique. If you can’t position yourself in front with enough time to make the hit, try slowing a ball carrier down with an outstretched arm. While a strong runner will likely brush you off, it may allow a teammate the extra second to get into position and finish the job.Also consider smothering your opponent. When wrapping the waist isn’t an option, you may be able to throw your arms over the ball carrier’s shoulders or around his chest to weigh him down by holding tight and hanging on him.
As always, never give up momentum with any type of tackle. Keep your speed up and be sure that you're the one initiating the contact, not absorbing it.

, You got low in your stance and you kept the momentum going as you made contact. Don’t make the mistake of thinking the tackle is over before the ball carrier hits the ground.


This step is about more than pushing with your legs, it’s about continuing to move your feet.
Think about trying to push the runner backwards and keep your feet churning with small, hard steps.

, This applies mostly to the collision or shoulder tackling technique used most often in rugby. Once you’ve wrapped you arms around the ball carrier’s thighs and positioned your shoulders against his midsection, you’re ready to create opposing forces to knock his body off balance and take him down.


Pull up and in with your arms to disrupt the motion of the ball carrier’s feet.
At the same time, use your upper body (head and shoulders) to drive his midsection backwards.
Driving through the ball carrier this way will uproot him from the ground and knock him off balance, completing a solid tackle., After you’ve made the tackle, the game goes on. Retain your focus on the greater goal of winning the game and making the next play as well as the last.


No matter what you’ll have to release the ball carrier.
The ball may be played out, in which case you should hurry to rejoin your team and get back in position.
Other times play will develop on top of the tackle, most often in the form of a scrum or ruck. In this case, it’s best to cover your head and face for protection and be careful not to obstruct the play, as it could result in a penalty."
"
Tackle low, leading with your shoulder, to bring down any runner safely and effectively.,
Bend your knees gently and crouch into an athletic stance as the runner approaches.,
Step up to your opponent as she approaches.,
Step at the attacker once he is closer enough to tackle.,
Find the ""safe side"" of the attacker when planning the hit.,
Throw your shoulder into their gut to initiate the tackle.,
Wrap your arms around their thigh and squeeze in.,
Keep driving with your legs to bring them to the ground.",How to Rugby Tackle1," A rugby tackle is quick, simple, and safe if you keep your head up and lead with your shoulder. A good tackle has several components, and mastering them will prevent injuries and bring down opponents with ease:


Start in an athletic position, on your toes to adjust to the attacker's movement.
Lead with your shoulder, driving it into their thigh or stomach.
Keep your head up, tucking it along the butt of the attacker.
Wrap your arms around their thighs, squeezing in to take them off balance.
Let your momentum carry your shoulder through them, using your arms to ""squeeze"" them to the ground with you.;
, You need to be ready to move in a moments notice as the tackle approaches. The best way to prepare is to be on your toes, knees slightly bent, and arms in front of you. Imagine an Olympic wrestler in their starting position and you have a good idea of your stance:


Knees bent.
Weight forward, on the balls of your feet and ready to spring.
Spine straight.
Hands out in front of your body, ready to tackle. Your elbows should not be ""chicken-winged"" outwards.
Head up and looking at your opponent., Don't wait her him to come to you -- take the tackle to him. As she runs at you with the ball, take short, choppy steps to close the gap. Make the attacker make a decision before they're ready, all while staying on your toes and closing in. Once you're 1-2 meters away you're ready to start the tackle.If you're chasing them down, or running over, slow down and gain control of your body 5-10 yards away from them.
You don't want to run at them. You simply want to move your feet with quick, short steps towards them, allowing you to change direction on a dime if they try and fake you out.
Watch their waist as you approach. A player usually fakes with their head, their arms/shoulders, or their feet. A person's waist, however, must point in the direction their body is moving., This is how you build the momentum needed for a good tackle. Once you've closed the gap and know what direction he's going, step towards him, aiming roughly right between his legs. Once you've reached this point you need to be committed to the tackle, and the next few moves need to happen in rapid succession, without hesitation, to succeed.


More often than not, the attacker will pick a side of you and run for that, trying to get around you. This actually makes your job even easier -- once they've picked a side you can step right at them and tackle from the side, as they've eliminated their forward momentum.

, This is usually up to the attacker to decide, so be adaptable. The safe side is where you're going to place your head on the tackle. Most often this is their backside: a player chooses a direction to run around you, and you don't want to tackle them on the same side as their pumping knees and legs. For example, if an attacker runs to your right, the safe side would be on your left, right along the attacker's butt.


In the rare instance when a player runs right at you without making a move, never fear -- keep your head up and step right at them, positioning your head to whatever side you're comfortable with., Follow up on your big step by throwing your momentum, shoulder first, into the opponent's midsection. Your head needs to stay up to watch out for injuries, and your cheek will slide along their butt cheek if you've made proper contact. As you make the move, drive with your legs, pushing yourself ""through"" the tackle for the maximum power.Keep your elbows close to your ribs as you tackle, not out wide. The majority of your tackle is done with your shoulder and body weight, not your comparatively weak arms.
You can hit anywhere between the upper thigh and just underneath the chest. Know, however, that the lower you hit the easier they will be to bring

, This is the best way to pull someone off balance, no matter how much bigger or stronger they are. After you've made contact, wrap your arms around their legs and squeeze into your chest, like you were giving their thighs the biggest hug you can give.


When warming up with teammates, practice this quick grip and squeeze around the thighs. You'll notice how easily your teammates lose their balance and get lifted off the ground.

, Once you've made contact and wrapped up their legs, keep your legs moving and arms squeezed to bring them to the ground. More often than not you'll end up on top of the tackle, making it easier to get up and join the ruck. If you've lost your footing on the tackle, keep squeezing with your arms. If this doesn't bring them down on its own another teammate will soon be there to finish the job.Keep your feet moving the entire time you're tackling. You want to be constantly in motion and driving the opponent back.
Once the player is down, jump back up to your feet immediately. You cannot keep playing the ball from the ground, but once you're on your feet again you can grab the ball or ruck for your team.

Know that the ruck is over once the ball is exposed.",How to Ruck," In rugby, a tackled player must immediately release the ball, either passing it or placing it on the ground. A ruck forms when multiple players contest the ball on the ground, fighting over the turf until one team can claim the ball. As long as a ruck is formed, no players can pick up the ball until the ball is exposed again, usually because one team has pushed the other team back far enough that they have won the ball.


A ruck can be formed over any ball on the ground, but is most common after a tackle.
Rucks must have, at a minimum, one player from each team. However, as many players can join a ruck as they want.
As defined by the Rugby Laws of the Game, ""A ruck is a phase of play where one or more players from each team, who are on their feet, in physical contact, close around the ball on the ground."";
, If no ruck is formed (ie. it is just you, the ball, and the tackled player on the ground) you can pick up the ball and run with it as long as you are on your feet. However, if there are defenders nearby, even if they haven't formed a ruck yet, it may be best to set up for a ruck and defend the ball. In general, if you can pick the ball up, you should. That said, the decision of when to ruck and when to run depends on the situation:



Pick up the ball when there is open space, when a ruck is not yet formed, when you have a chance to steal possession from the other team.

Form a ruck when there is already another defender nearby, if your team needs time to set up on defense, if you don't have any supporting teammates, or if you're sure you can hold the line until your team can set up an offensive strike. Remember, if there are other players their contesting the ball, a ruck has formed, and picking up the ball is illegal in a ruck., Once you reach the ball, plant one foot firmly in front of it so that the ball is between your legs. Stepping over the ball puts it in your court -- the other team must now push you back past the ball in order to win it. You may have to step over the tackled player to do this, but that is also okay -- legally they cannot touch you or the ball and they must return to their feet in order to play.

, Whether you are the first one their or about to meet an opposing player over the ball, you want to get low, stay on your toes, and keep your back straight. Your shoulders and head should be above your hips at all time -- keeping you safe and giving you leverage.


If you're the first one there, hold this crouching position to make it difficult for an opponent to bowl you over.
If an opponent arrived first, use this position to lock in, getting underneath him and sliding your head underneath his armpit.

, This is crucial to avoid penalties and injuries. You must, using your whole arm, bind onto someone else already rucking. You can't just put a hand on them, and you can't grab a handful of jersey. The easiest way to do this is to sling your arm up over the opponents back, reaching for their opposite rib cage. You can also reach around your teammates torso, holding on to lock you both together. Whatever you do, referees will be looking for this arm bind as a sign that a legal ruck has formed., If there are already players in a ruck, you must join from the gate. The gate is the back foot of your last teammate, and is perpendicular to the goal line. You cannot hit a ruck diagonally or from the side -- you must join from directly behind your last teammate.


Work on putting your shoulder right under your teammate's butt, using them like a battering ram to push through the other team.
There is some leeway to this, of course. If you already have three teammates in the ruck, don't worry about which one is ""last."" Simply join from the back, not the sides, and you'll be fine., Most rucks have at least 2 players per side, though they do form with more or less depending on the game. The more players there are in a ruck, the less there are defending the rest of the field, so a good rule of thumb is to only join rucks you know you can win. Knowing when to join your teammates in a ruck is a crucial skill to develop, and will come with experience.


If you're winning a ruck as a team, don't join it. All you'll do is limit your team's options when the ball comes out. Similarly, if you've already lost or almost lost a ruck, get out of there and defend the rest of the field.
If you see a teammate being tackled and know that there are more defenders than teammates, get over there before he hits the ground to support your offense and hold onto the ball.
If you're near a stalemating ruck, throw yourself in quickly -- this could be the best chance to shift momentum and win the ball., Once you're off your feet you can no longer legally ruck, but the lower you are the more leverage you have over your opponent. The best way to prepare is to crouch, lowering your butt and bending from your waist so that your spine stays straight. Think of an Olympic wrestler at the start of a match, or your position right before a tackle.

, One of the best ways to win a ruck, especially against a player bigger than you, is to get them off their feet. The principles are the same as tackling -- by taking away their balance you gain the upper hand and can put your momentum to good use. Once you've locked on to them, get lower than them while still keeping your shoulders above your hips. Push diagonally up and out, simultaneously lifting them onto their heels and driving them back, to win almost any ruck.


Remember that this strategy only works if you can get lower than your opponent. Drop your butt and keep your spine straight as you engage, then push from your quads.
If they are their first and have a foot over the ball, pick up their thigh to put them on one foot. This ""leg-lift"" is one of the best ways to clear a ruck you arrive late to.

, Drive yourself through the opponent, always moving your feet. If you're low enough, this should be enough to win rucks against less experienced players, as the natural instinct is to plant your feet and try to hold your ground. Always keep pushing, imagining that you're driving the player back off the ball.


On offensive rucks, there are some times when you want to set your feet. If you've won the ball, you have support, and your team is planning an attack, hold your ground once you're sure your team has the ball.
On defensive rucks, your goal is to blow the ruck up. Keep pushing and fighting the opponents back. At the very least, force them to scramble a few new players to the ruck or pressure them to remove the ball and pass it before they're ready., You cannot use your hands once a ruck is formed. But you can use your feet. If you're on stable enough footing or have started to gain an advantage in the tug-of-war with your opponent, hook the ball back with your heel and send it towards your teammates. If you're in danger of losing the ball, or the other team already has the advantage, you could even try kicking the ball up against their legs, the deflection may come back your way, and at the very least you can disorganize whoever they have reaching for the ball.Only lift a foot for a kick if you're sure you won't be immediately pushed back after losing balance. Holding the ruck is priority one, hooking the ball is a nice bonus if you can manage it.

, Blowing up a ruck, or breaking it down and removing players, is a good way to turn the tide of a contested ruck in your favor, or simply make life difficult for the opposing teams. Removing players from the ruck is especially crucial on defense, or if one sneaky enemy arrived first is about to steal the ball. The idea is that you sacrifice your own role in the ruck to take out an opponent out as well, allowing your teammates to get the ball. No matter how you do it, focus on clearing one player away, not multiple at once. There are several ways to take a player out of the ruck, including:Leg-lift: This is basically a tackle, but you must bind with the player and stay on your feet for it to remain legal. When there is one player in a ruck, stay low and run into the contact. Try to grip one arm around the opponent's back and the other around his thigh or waist, lifting up one leg as your drive forward.

Twisting out: This is best for group rucks, or when you're engaged with one person but have support coming. While engaged, drop one of your shoulders. This should cause you both to rotate up and out, falling away from the ruck. Keep pushing to the side you dropped your shoulder to peel both of you off the ruck.

Throwing him through the gate: If a you see a player bowling into the ruck with a lot of speed, set up and let him approach. As he goes to make contact, shift out of the way, grab his back or jersey, and throw him right over the ball, letting his own momentum carry him uselessly into your territory. He cannot, once crossing the ball, play again until he returns to his side of the field., There are a lot of rules to rucking, but most of them are easy to avoid if you stay on your feet, play the defender instead of the ball, and enter through the gate. That said, the following infractions will lead to a turnover and chance for your opponents to score, and should be avoided whenever possible:


You cannot collapse a ruck by falling, tripping, jumping, or otherwise causing the ruck to hit the ground.
You cannot ruck or play against anyone on the ground. You cannot intentionally step on a grounded player.
Any player on the ground in the ruck (such as the tackler) cannot play the ball and must make an effort to leave the ruck.
You cannot fake that the ball has left the ruck when it has not.
You cannot fall on or otherwise smother the ball at any point, even as the ball leaves the ruck.
You cannot use your leg/feet to pick up or trap the ball, it must be free to move., If you don't participate in the ruck, stay behind the offside line. If you don't enter the ruck, be sure to stay behind the offside line, which is the line formed by the rear foot of the backmost teammate in the ruck. In other words, you must be behind every single player in the ruck to be onside.


If the ruck moves, you need to move with it. The offside line will change, and it is your job to watch it.
If you exit or are ejected from the ruck while participating in it, you must immediately move behind the ruck. Loitering near the sides will result in a penalty., When a player is tackled, but propped up by a teammate before she has hit the ground, a maul forms. A maul is just like a ruck, except the ball moves with the maul. Both teams can commit as many people as they want to the maul, pushing and fighting for space.


Mauls have their own set of rules, but all players must still bind with one full arm before joining.

, You can only join the ruck from your feet, so once a tackle is made, you need to get up. You cannot hold onto the ball or the other player once the tackle is made. However, once you're on your feet again you can grab the ball or form a ruck, depending on how quickly you got up., The easiest way to tell if a ball is loose is if it could be rained on. If a bird high above the field could see the ball without a player blocking it, the ball is out. Anyone can pick it up and play it. As long as the ball is under someone's foot or within the ruck, no one can use their hands.


Referees are lenient with this rule once a team has won the ball clearly. For example, if the ball is between the feet of your last teammate in the ruck you can pick the ball up and pass from the ground."

Practice making appropriate contact and head position with drills on your knees.,
Try group tackling drills.,
Practice jogging tackles once your form feels correct.,
Work on one-on-one match-ups to improve your overall tackling.,
Do not over-rely on tackling bags.,
Practice ""landing"" tackles and getting quickly back to your feet every time.",How to Rugby Tackle2," Get a partner. One of you should have a ball, they other will be on their knees 5-6 meters away. Have the ball carrier approach at half speed, then choose a direction to run around the ""defender."" The player on their knees must then commit to the tackle from the ground, focusing on placing their head on the opponent's butt cheek and wrapping them up. When done correctly, the wrap alone should bring the attacker down safely.


This is a great drill for beginners and to warm up for tackling before practices and games.
As you get better, try the same drill on your feet. Line up across from the attacker and make a slow, technically perfect tackle, bringing them to the ground gently.
You can turn the drill an endurance test as well. Place 3-4 defenders, all on their knees, in a row and make the attacker run through each of them, taking contact and bouncing up after each hit., Group 5 players in square, with one in the middle holding a ball. Have them toss it to a player on the corner, who will run in at them, choosing a side to run to. The center player must get low and make the tackle, then get to their feet and grab the ball. As the tackled player gets up and returns to the corner, have the center player throw the ball to a new person and then make another tackle. Switch out the player in the center after 1 minute or so, depending on skill and fitness level.


Start with very small squares so that attackers can't gain much momentum. Once you're confident in everyone's tackling ability, increase the distance so that players must make more challenging tackles in the middle.Similar drills can be done in straight lines, where the tackler must move through everyone, or in small 2v2 scrimmages.

, The best way to get used to game pace is to slowly ramp up the contact. For jogging tackles, simply have an offensive player jog straight forward with the ball. Approach them diagonally and tackle them from the side, without them dodging at all. While you should still practice this at only 75% pace, it gets you used to hitting a moving target and placing your head correctly on the butt.

, Oftentimes the best way to practice tackling is to just go and do it. Mark off a thin rectangle, no more than 10 yards wide, and give your teammate the ball on the end. Have them run at you at attempt to get by with whatever move, trick, or speed they can muster. Your only job is to prevent it from happening. Keeping the field thin allows you to approximate a game setting, when an attacker would just hit another defender by going out wide, and forces you to make solid, firm contact in order to win.


To minimize head-on contact, start both players on the same side of the field. On the count of three, both players run around opposite corners of the box and then meet in the middle of the rectangle at an angle.In practice it is generally best to practice tackling at 75-80% speed. No one wants to get injured, especially in practice.

, A tackling bag is a good, safe way to learn contact. However, many coaches use them far too often, which teaches kids to make odd tackles that they would never make in a game. Use the bags to warm-up, practice some contact on days where you don't want anyone hurt, and to illustrate where to hit with your shoulder. Otherwise, stick with natural contact, even if it is only at 50% speed, to teach your players more effectively.Tackle bags are soft and safe, meaning players can take tackling risks they never would in a game.
Bags have a place in training still, of course, just not every day.

, No matter what drill you are doing, you need be focused not only on the tackle but immediately after. A good tackler is back on their feet immediately, using the tackle to gain an advantage over the opponent that could lead to a stolen ball. As your tackling improves, work on.


Ending the tackle on top. Make sure you get up before they can.
Popping immediately to your feet. Once you're on your feet you can play the ball. That means, if none of their teammates have made it to the ruck yet, you can simply steal the ball and run forward.
Step over the ball as soon as you're up. This ensures the ball is in your possession, even if you can't pick it up. The other team must ruck through you to get the ball back.

Build up your base level of strength.,
Get low.,
Work on your tackling.,
Aim.,
Ring of steel.",How to Make Big Hits on the Rugby Field," Resistance training and gym work are vital. Not only defensively but for rugby in general, use your 4 key exercises:bench press, incline bench press, squats (be careful with squats, they can damage your knees and back and slow you down) and dead-lifts. Don't forget core and speed work though, rugby is not American football, stamina and fitness are vital.;
, A good low body position is key. Practice getting low, despite position, anyone can work on the scrum machine. It is a fantastic device for not only props, but all team members, improving tackling and rucking alike.

, Practice makes perfect. Outside training and during the off-season, get some friends together, a work. Simple drills, with tackle bags and one on ones work a treat.

, For the tackle, try to aim your shoulder below the chest, at the stomach area of the man you are tackling- remember going in too high (the chest area) will give your opponent a better chance of breaking-through the tackle, because that is where he is strongest. Lift both of his legs from behind the knees and drive through with your shoulder by pumping your legs (like you are running with him in your arms), always begin the tackle from a low body position and drive upwards.

, The ring of steel is crucial, wrap your arms round the player, preferably just above the knees, and squeeze, lifting him up or driving them back will be easier and you will be able to hold onto them without them slipping away.

A rugby team is comprised of 15 players, which are divided into forwards and backs.,
Numbers one and three are called “props”; they are usually the biggest and/or strongest ones on the team.,
A hooker is usually one of the smaller players and their job is to “hook the ball” back for the scrum-half during a scrum.

,
Numbers four and five are “second rows” and are usually the taller ones on the team.,
Numbers six and seven are called “flankers” and they attach to the scrum next to the second rows.,
The number eight position is called “eight man” and that player is allowed to act as the scrum-half and get the ball when the offense is winning the scrum.

",How to Know Positions and Basics of Rugby1," One of the easiest ways to identify a forward from a back is by their number; it indicates their position. The forwards are also the stronger ones on the team and are responsible for getting mauls, rucks, and comprising the scrum. The forwards wear numbers one through eight and the backs wear nine through fifteen;
, A prop’s role is to “prop” up the number two position, which is called a “hooker”.

,, Second rows go behind the front three during a scrum and provide support.

, They help drive the scrum forward when it is in motion. They are also usually the first ones out of the scrum and are the faster forwards.

,"
"
Number nine is the “scrum-half”.,
Number ten is called the “fly-half” and they are usually the ones who do the kicking if the ball is in a certain area.

,
Numbers eleven and fourteen are “wings” and they are exceptionally fast.,
Numbers twelve and thirteen are “centres”.,
The last position, number fifteen, is called the “full back”.",How to Know Positions and Basics of Rugby2," The scrum-half is generally the fastest player on the team. They are responsible for getting the ball out of the scrum once it has reached the back of it and also putting the ball in once a scrum has been called.

,, During kick-offs, they usually receive the ball and they do most of the scoring.

, The centres are involved in most of the back line passing and are also very fast.

, The full back is behind the defense and near the back of the field. They are usually the ones who catch the ball when the other team’s fly-half has kicked it during play.

The rules and regulations of rugby may be confusing.,
The game begins when the “sir” (referee) blows the whistle.,
Once the ball has been kicked and received by the offensive team, play will begin.,
Unlike football, the ball can not be passed forwards; only backwards.

,
The backs do most of the ball handling, as they are the faster ones on the team.",How to Know Positions and Basics of Rugby4," A regulation rugby match lasts 80 minutes with a 5-minute halftime. Injury time is also added on to the clock when necessary. Since it is not native to the U.S., the field measurements are metric.

, Similar to football, there is a kicking and receiving team at the beginning of each half.

, Once the ball is in play, it may be passed or kicked to other members of the team; however, kicking is usually only used when the ball is on the ground or to advance on the field.

,, Likewise, the forwards do most of the tackling, as they are the stronger or bigger ones on the team.

A scrum is called when something occurs within a ruck or maul, or it is offside.,
Usually the hooker is the one that throws the ball in from the touchline.",How to Know Positions and Basics of Rugby5," The scrum-half of the team the penalty was not called on puts the ball in the scrum once it is in formation. Once the ball is put in, the hookers from both sides use their feet to try to hook the ball back for their team to get possession of the ball. Once it reaches the eight-man, the scrum-half or eight-man may pick up the ball and resume play. However, if the ball goes out of bounds, a line out occurs.

, The pods vary in size (there may be only one or multiple) and the offensive team chooses how many they wish to do; the defensive team has to match. During a line out, the hooker (or whoever throws the ball) calls the play and the specific pod, comprised of two lifters and a jumper, will jump up to try to knock the ball down to their team’s side. Once the ball is knocked down, the game resumes as normal.

When a try is scored an opportunity is given to the scoring team to make a conversion kick which is worth 2 points.
The other way of gaining extra points for Your team is with penalty kicks, this is awarded when a member of the opposing team breaks a rule or if the play of the game is stopped by more than one member of that team. a Penalty kick is worth 3 Points.
The last method of gaining points is with a drop-goal attempt, the ball is played backwards to a back-row player who then attempts to place the ball in between the uprights during ongoing game play, this is also worth 3 points.;
, If you get the ball into your opponent's try zone you get 5 points, as well as a chance to attempt a conversion kick for an extra 2 points. The winner is the one who scores the most points in 80 minutes of play.


You have to touch the ball down to score in rugby. That means after you've entered the try zone the ball must be placed on the ground to score.You can also kick the ball through the uprights during free play (with a drop-kick only) or after the referee awards your team a penalty (place kick) for 3 points., To score tries, offense teams form big horizontal lines, passing sideways and backward until they expose a hole in the defense and push forward. This is the big rule to remember when playing rugby. You cannot pass the ball forward with your hands or it is an automatic penalty. Whenever passing, you usually pass the ball across your body to get power and throw the ball diagonally to your teammate.


Dropping or bobbling the ball counts as a forward pass if it hits your hands then hits the ground in front of you.
You can, of course, carry the ball forward. However, any passes by the hand cannot be forward., While you cannot ever throw a ball forward, you can kick it forward at any time. Once you kick the ball, any teammate that was behind you when you kicked it can run forward and get the ball without a penalty. Kicks are a great way to surprise a defense, or boot the ball way down the field to get your team out of trouble.


Players can even kick it to themselves, chipping it over an opponent and running around to pick it up.
You cannot kick the ball to a teammate who is already further down the field than you unless you run past them at some point. If a player was behind you at any time after your kick they can touch the ball. If not, they are offside., Rugby defense is all about making tackles. You can only hit the player currently holding the ball, and you cannot block or screen the other team or other players. When you tackle an opponent, your goal is to bring them to the ground as quickly as possible, preferably with teammates around to quickly help win the ball. General tackling rules include:


You must tackle someone below shoulder height.
You must wrap your hands around the player, not just spear them with your shoulder.
You cannot pick up and drop players, especially on their head or neck.
Once down, you must return to your feet before trying to win the ball from someone you've tackled., When a player goes down, they must release the ball. From there, either team can fight to win the ball off the ground and take possession. This usually takes place as a ""ruck."" A ruck is when 1-3 players from each team lock into one another, right above the ball (and tackled player), and push each other back and forth in an attempt to win possession. One player on each team stands behind the ruck and grabs the ball when it appears behind their rucking teammate's back foot. Because the tackled player can put the ball down wherever they want, the team that had the ball first usually controls it. There are a lot of rules and strategy for contesting a ruck, but some basic reminders include:



Stay on your feet. A ruck is when at least two players lock shoulders above the ball and try and push the opponent away from the ball. You cannot reach in to grab the ball or push off the ground with your hands.

Enter through the center. For safety reasons, you must enter a ruck straight up and lock in with the other team. You must be perpendicular to the end line, and your body must be straight over the ball. You cannot run into a ruck diagonally or from the side.

Stay behind the back foot if not in the ruck. Once a ruck is formed, you must stay behind the back foot of your final teammate until the ball comes out, no matter what team gets it. The entire space of the ruck is a ""neutral zone"" that no players can enter it., When a penalty (such as passing it forward) is called for your team, you get several options of restarts, depending on the foul. One of the most common is a scrum, where both teams form into battering rams and connect over the ball. A scrum is essentially a test of strength. In a scrum, 8 players from each team weave themselves together in rows to create a unified mass. The two teams then go head-to-head, each pushing against the other, with a tunnel formed on the ground in between them.


In a scrum, one team throws the ball in the center of the two teams and they push and hook each other to try and win the ball.
Scrums suck all the biggest players to one area of the field, leaving the other seven players with much more free space. If your team wins it, you're often off for a big gain.
Scrums are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of rugby, and you should not try them without a coach and well-trained, athletic players., If a ball goes out of bounds the referee will call for a line-out. A line-out is like a throw-in in soccer, except the ball must be thrown straight forward. Each team forms a line on the field around the thrower. The team that did not touch the ball last gets to throw it in. They then toss the ball straight in between the two teams, who lift each other up to try and win the ball. The game then restarts as normal.


Teams often use signals and codes to win their own line-outs. Basically, a thrower will signal to their team when they will throw it, and their teammates will hoist a player into the air, out of reach of the other team, to grab the ball quickly., Each team is made up of two smaller sections, each with their own positions and strengths. Forwards take part in the scrum, and this is the only real difference between them an backs as far as rules go. However, forwards and backs have evolved their own specialties on the field, making each vital to success:



Forwards/Packies: These are the big guys -- the bruisers and muscle-men who power the scrums and win most of your rucks. Forwards generally take short, powerful runs with the ball, pass less, and do the majority of tackling and defense. Generally thicker and stronger.Backs: The runners and speedsters. Backs form a long diagonal line on offense and pass the ball quickly down the line, to the outside of the field, where they can take on a defender 1v1. On defense they form a wall across the field to prevent enemy backs from breaking through. Generally quicker, backs are good kickers, have solid passing skills, and tons of speed/endurance., Watch local and professional teams’ matches or practices in order to see how the game is played. You can also watch matches on television or recordings such as DVDs. Watching how a game is played in real life or through recordings allows you to see the intricacies of the sport.


There are a lot of small rules, specific situations, and intricacies to rugby that are impossible to learn without playing or watching. Ask questions of fans and/or the referee when confused, and keep learning each game each time you play.

, A good rugby throw is powerful and quick, which protects your teammate from a nasty tackle as they watch the ball approaching them. Practice throwing to your side, not in front of you. To get a good throw, use both hands and focus on accuracy first, hitting your teammates right in the chest every time. Once you feel accurate you can start working on a professional-looking spin. To throw from the right hand:


Start with the ball horizontally in front of you. Place your right hand on the back third of the ball, so your palm faces down and your thumb towards your target. Place your left hand on the bottom left half of the ball, thumb pointing left.
Bring the ball to your right side, keeping the point of the ball still roughly pointing at your target.
Using your left hand for aim and right for power, bring the ball across your body and towards your target.
As your hands are almost extended, curl your right hand back towards you, spinning the ball.
Release the ball with both hands simultaneously, rotating your wrist completely over on the follow-through. Both arms should be fully extended and pointed at your target, and your arms should stay low, around belly height. the whole time., Tackling is a skill that can be developed over a lifetime, but the basics are simple. You want to let your whole body do the work, not just your arms, to protect yourself and to ensure that you bring the guy down. Practice doing the following steps near simultaneously -- keeping your head up, driving with the shoulder, wrapping your arms, and driving to the ground:


Set up on the balls of your feet. Make sure you are in a good athletic position for the hit -- knees bent, muscles relaxed, on your toes.
Keep your head up and aim for their thighs/stomach. Keep your head up to see contact coming and line up the hit. This is a crucial step for safety.
Aim to make contact with your shoulder right at their upper thigh. Slide your head next to their butt to keep it safe and drive in with your shoulder.
Wrap your arms around their thighs and pull back. Pull their thighs into a deep hug -- this causes them to lose balance easily.
Drive with your legs to bring them down. Once you've got your head in place and your arms wrapped, you want to push with your legs to bring them down.

, A ruck is your regular chance to keep or steal possession, and a good rucker is an invaluable asset on the team. If you see a teammate go down with the ball and you're nearby, try and be the first one in the ruck. Set one foot over the ball so that it is underneath you, then lean down into a low athletic position. When you've made contact with someone, win rucks using strength and leverage:


Get underneath the opponent and push up and out. If you can get your shoulders or head under their chest, you can push them up to throw them off balance, then back to remove them from the ruck.
Push teammates from behind to win contested rucks. If it looks like your team needs a boost, push your ruck through like a minor-scrum. Remember, however, that committing more than 2-3 people to a ruck leaves a lot of holes in the defense if you lose.
Keep your feet moving through the ruck. To really crush rucks, chop your feet and push forward with every step. Imagine running straight through the player to the other side. This is called ""clearing"" a ruck, and it opens up a lot of space. If you're on defense and you can clear a ruck, even if you can't win the ball immediately, you'll throw the other team into disarray., Rugby is not an individually dominated sport. Even the best player will be unable to do anything without the support of teammates, as there are very few times a solo athlete has space or time to make a play themselves. On both defense and offense you should be in the best possible place to support your teammates, no matter what:


On defense, you need to be in a horizontal line with your teammates, sliding left and right to close up any holes the opponent might try to push through. Once a teammate makes a tackle, you should either jump in the ruck if it is open or winnable or slide to either side of the teammate to make sure the other team doesn't exploit the gap while he is down from the tackle,
On offense, you need to spread out, forcing the other team to cover many angles. When a teammate is running, make sure you are always behind them and they have 1-2 people in passing range. If they get tackled, they may try a quick pass to you as they go down, leaving you plenty of time to run., Rugby can be played in any large field, so long as it is relatively flat and evenly sized. The size of the field will largely depend upon how seriously you intend to play. If you wish to simply play the game with a few friends, a local park with any large field may be enough. However, if you wish to play a proper match, you will need a field with two uprights for the extra point. Contact your local Parks and Recreation department or a local rugby club to find out about proper fields in your area.


As long as you can mark out try-zones for each team, any rectangular patch of grass should be fine.
Though the dimensions are slightly different, an American football field can fill in for a rugby field in a pinch.

, There are three commonly played forms of rugby, where the biggest difference is in the number of players. Real games have 15, 10, or 7 players on each team, but you can play with as many players as you want if you're just with friends. Each player should have:


Athletic shoes, preferably with cleats in the bottom.
Light, breathable clothing.
Mouth guards and/or head protection, if desired.
Water., Forwards are generally placed in position based on the scrum, and their positions does not necessarily impact where they will be during the rest of the game. What matters most is your scrum position:



First row. The first row contains three players: the loose head prop and the tight head prop, who grip the hooker in between them.The role of the hooker is to gain possession of the ball during scrums and usually throw the ball in at line-outs. The role of the loose and tight head props is to support the hooker during scrums, support other players during line-outs and provide strength during rucks and mauls. The props are your two biggest players.

Second row. The second row consists of two locks. These are the tallest players in the team and are generally used in line-outs to gain possession of the ball. They drive their shoulders into the props and are the engines of your scrums and rucks.

Back row. The back row of forwards consists of three players: two flankers and the eight-man. They clasp onto the two sides and back and control the direction of the scrum, as well as the ball if it squeezes out. Generally these three are your fastest forwards, as they can quickly dart off the scrum when play restarts., Backs need to be good with their hands, and the best players need to be the first ones touching the ball. To visualize your back line, imagine the ball on the right side of the field. Each player will be 10-15 feet diagonally to the left of the other, starting with the scrum-half:



Scrum-half: They start the ball from a ruck or scrum, pulling it out and determining the first player to get the ball. They must be light, small, and have considerable endurance to reach every ruck or scrum first. Most importantly, they need to see the whole field and distribute the ball accordingly.

Fly-half: The quarterback for the backs. They run most of the kicking and run plays, like skipping a pass or fake passes, to try and break down the opponent's defense.

Centers: There are two of them, and they are good overall players who can tackle well on defense, run and pass well in the middle, and kick if need be. They get the ball often and challenge the opponent's back line.

Wings: Two wings that stay on each side-line, these are usually the fastest players. Your goal is to get them the ball on the outside, where they can hopefully outrun the opponents wing for massive gains.

Fullback: She/he sits 15 meters or so behind the line, ready to get an opponent's kick, make a last-second tackle, or sprint forward to unexpectedly join the offense and overload a team. Must be versatile, able to kick and catch, and fast., There are several ways in which a penalty may be earned, and it is impossible to play the game and keep an eye out for every infraction. Minor infractions will likely result in a scrum being awarded to the other team. Others may cause a referee to take more serious action, giving a penalty kick, a ""back ten"" (when the team gets 10 meters to run the ball for free), or removing a player for some time.


Common offenses include incorrect tackling, collapsing a scrum or ruck by leaving your feet, holding the ball when on the ground, and entering rucks incorrectly.
The team awarded the penalty has several options. They can take a kick or punt, which will allow them to gain field position. They can take a penalty kick at the uprights for a chance at 3 points, or they can take a scrum, all in the location of the penalty.

, A game of rugby is physically intense, and you're incredibly prone to injury if you don't prepare. A good warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles for the beating to come. A good, simple warm up to start with would include:10-minute light jog. Running is an excellent way to warm up for rigorous physical activity. Begin by walking briskly for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of light jogging to prepare yourself for running. Dynamic stretching. Run with high knees, kick your ankle with your heel with each step, do some lunges, jump in place, swing your arms, and skip. These exaggerated, mobile stretches loosen your muscles more effectively than static stretching.

Warm up rugby skills. Pass with a partner, take some kicks, and do some light rucking. Get used to rugby specific actions, even tackling at half-speed. Your forwards should do some practice scrums and lineouts, and your backs should get used to passing in a line.

Drink water and eat at least 2 hours before playing. Hydration is essential in physical activity. In order to combat the loss of and increased use of water during exercise, it is important to stay well hydrated throughout the day but especially right before activity. The other essential nutrients used and expelled by your body during exercise are salt and potassium, eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and sports drinks/food., This is traditionally started by a coin toss, in order to determine which team will have first possession of the ball. You can toss coins or decide who starts in some other manner. Positioned at the center of the field, the team which has first possession will then kick the ball towards the opposition.


Most rules state that this must be a drop-kick. It needs to go 10-meters before the ball can be played.
If you are on the kicking team, you cannot pass the kicker until the ball has left his foot.
After your team scores a try, the other team must kick it off to you again."
"
Stick to your position instead of switching frequently (unless you're new because you need to find the right position first).,
Play as a unit, not as a superstar or a hero.,
Support your team's runs by staying diagonally behind the ball carrier.,
Keep your head up and scanning at all times, even in tackles.,
Make ball possession your first priority.,
Know when to commit to a ruck and when to set up outside.,
Commit to every ruck, tackle and play with full confidence.,
Watch Professional Rugby, focusing on your position.",How to Become a Better Rugby Player1," You will never make a good player if suddenly you move from prop to center. Each position has its own requirements and needs, and you won't become a better player if you switch positions just as you're learning one of them well.


You should, however, have a basic understanding of each of your teammate's positions. Rugby is a fluid, fast game, and you can best support your teammates if you know what they're trying to do.
If you're uncomfortable with your role on the field, check out diagrams of each position and its role.
;
, Do not try to be a hero, just play the game and do what your position is designed to do. There are 30 players on the field at any time in a game of rugby -- making it nearly impossible for one player to try and win the game on their own. Successful rugby teams are filled with players who know their role and stick to it.


Each position is designed to compliment the others. If you decide you want to start rucking as a scrum-half, you may win a few more lose balls. Your fly-half, however, will lose the connection that gets him the ball, effectively destroying your offense.
Everyone will leave position occasionally for a tackle or run. The key is choosing your moment wisely -- will you be putting your team at a disadvantage by leaving?, If your teammate is on a run, the best place to be is a few yards behind them and a few yards to their side. This makes you a viable, legal passing target at all times. If someone is already there, set up alongside them, providing a quick passing outlet should they get the ball. The best teams set up these small diagonal passing lines almost instantly.


If there is already a small line of players, stay just behind them, ready to ruck if one goes down, or take a short offload pass as they're falling., The best way to improve your on-field intelligence is to keep tabs on everything. Are you in line with your teammates? Are the opponents overloading more people on one side of the field for an attack? You should keep your head up on tackles too -- watching the contact the whole time to safely place your head and adjust to defenders.Grab any loose ball you see, or fall on it and place it for a ruck.
Are you in step with your teammates? Make sure your lines are tight and there are no holes.

, In rugby, any team can grab possession at almost any time, and offense switches to defense on the fly. This makes it much more crucial to hold onto the ball, tiring the other team on defense until a good scoring opportunity arises. While all good teams take occasional risks, the majority of their efforts are spent keeping the ball.


If you don't have any support, slow down and wait for it. You can keep the ball in the ruck a little longer while your team catches up, or skip out on a risky run up the sideline until you have someone to pass to or ruck for you.
Only make passes you know will connect. If you don't have a good pass, simply go into contact, let your teammates ruck, and reset.
Don't be worried if you go 3-4 plays without gaining a lot of ground. Being on defense is much more tiring than offense, and you'll expose a hole eventually.

, Beginners often aren't sure when they should join the ruck, and will often either jump into every single ruck they find or never join in at all. Knowing when to bind on and help your team can be tough to decide, but there are some guidelines:


If you're winning a ruck as a team, don't join in. Similarly, if you've already lost or almost lost a ruck, get out of there and defend the rest of the field.
If you see a teammate get tackled there are more defenders than teammates, get over quickly in order to defend possession.
If you're near a stalemating ruck, throw yourself in to turn the tide.
Scrum-halfs and fly-halfs, with a few exceptions (losing a crucial ruck, the only player near enough to join) should stay out of most rucks -- they are too essential for organizing the offense and defense to be rucking., The biggest hurdle for most beginner rugby players isn't a skill, idea, or trick -- it's confidence. While confidence factors into all sports, in rugby the knowledge that you can take a hit (or hit an opponent) and be okay is not something everyone is born with. It takes time to get used to the physicality of rugby. However, the ability to give it your all, and not to slow down or loosen up before contact, will actually make you safer in the long run.


Gain confidence by tacking hits in practice. Start at 50% speed, or by tackling from your knees, and gradually work up to full contact.
Think of going through an opponent, not at him. Keep your feet moving at all times to drive through tackles and rucks with ease.
Mentally prepare yourself for games and hits. Remind yourself that you've done this before, and that playing soft or trying to avoid contact will just lead to more injuries., Watch any team that you like, from the best teams in the world like South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to the premier club teams in England, France, New Zealand and Australia. Watch out for several thing in particular:


Where is your position on defense? Where are they on offense?
How does each team dictate the pace of the game? When they attack, do they go wide or jam big players up the gut?
When and where are the appropriate times to kick?
When is it best to try a last-minute pass and when is it best to just go down?

Remember, not every dump tackle will be like the ones you see on youtube, even if you drive them back just a little, and lift them up just a small height, the rush and the tackle will be brilliant.,
Commit to the hit.,
Look and track the ball.,
Imagine a circle around the player you are going to tackle.",How to Dump Tackle in Rugby1,";
, Commitment is 90% of a proper and successful tackle. You have to have intent and confidence. Serious injury can occur if commitment is lacking, not only on your body but also on your ego.

, While doing this keep in mind who and where your mark is. Visualize their future move.

, You MUST put your foot in this circle before tackling to ensure proper body position.

In rugby, there are 15 players, divided into 8 forwards and 7 backs.,
Forwards are the big men of the team, responsible for rucks, scrums, lineouts, & mauls.,
Backs are the smaller, faster members of the team.",How to Know Every Rugby Position and What Each One Does,";
, They are:



Props: The two smaller, sturdier men at the front of the scrum. You are most likely to see these guys rucking.

Famous Props: Tony Woodcock, All Blacks and Phil Vickery, England.



Hooker: Stands in between the props in the scrum. A hooker has to throw the ball into a lineout and hook it back to the scrum half or Number 8 in a scrum.

Famous Hooker: John Smit, Captain of South Africa's 2007 World Cup winning side.



Second Rows: These two men are usually the tallest on the team and their main responsibility is jumping in lineouts.

Famous Second Rows: Paul O'Connell, Lions Captain 2009, Munster Captain and Martin Johnson, England World Cup Winning Captain (2003).



Flankers: There are two flankers--blindside and open side. The Blindside is usually a bit bigger than the openside, since a blindside has more players to chase after a scrum.

Famous Flanker: Richie McCaw, All Black captain.



Number 8: The player at the back of the scrum between the two flankers. He can pick the ball and run with it instead of the scrum half if he wants.

Famous No. 8: Sebastien Chabal, France & Sale No. 8



, They score most of the tries.



Scrum Half: The player who takes and passes out the ball from rucks, mauls, and scrums.

Famous Scrum Halves: Mike Blair, Scotland and Edinburgh Scrum Half and Matt Dawson, England World Cup Winner (2003).



Fly Half: Usually the kicker of a team. Stands between scrum half & centres.

Famous Fly Half: Jonny Wilkinson, who won England the 2003 World Cup.



Centres: There are two: inside and outside. These guys are fast and powerful players.

Famous Centre: Brian O'Driscoll, Ireland and Leinster captain, Irish & British Lions captain, RBS Six Nations player of tournament 2006, 2007, 2009.



Wingers: The fastest men on the team who can score some brilliant tries. They stand on the wing and receive the ball from the centres.

Famous Winger: Jonah Lomu, All Blacks. Probably the most well known player of all time after his play in the 1995 world cup. International Rugby Hall of Fame member.



Full Back: Stand behind all other defence. You are most likely to see these guys catching kicks.

Famous Full Back: Percy Montgomery, South Africa and Perpignan kicker.


Don't forget the person standing on the side screaming at you. That is of course your coach. They are apart of the team and don't let them forget it.

"
Research everything you can about the position you wish to play.,
Run sprints and intervals!,
Do up/downs.,
Start lifting weights.",How to Condition for Rugby," Most positions have specific body types that fit them.


For example, if you're tall and wide you'll play a second row, short and stocky you'll be a prop, small and fast you'd play a back position. Figure out what you'd be playing and tailor your conditioning to that position.;
, This is one of the best things you can do - no matter what your place on the field. The thing that distinguishes Rugby from American football is everyone goes non-stop, almost like soccer (but worse because everyone except the full back is moving with the ball all the time). Even if you're a prop or a second row you'll still need to be running so you can make tackles. Running is probably the single best way to improve your game. Jogging, however, won't cut it.

, What are up downs you say? They're like squat thrusts. They are useful because you are constantly getting hit in Rugby, or hitting someone else, and you need to get up quickly. You'll also need to dive on the ball, tackle, and generally haul your weight around. Make sure you're pushing yourself beyond the point where you think you can't do any more; by the end of a game you are so tired you can't move your little finger, but you have to keep going. Up/downs show you how conditioned you really are.There are 2 ways to approach up/downs:


As a team: Everyone lines up on the field (I prefer to do them in an exploded scrum formation) and the coach blows the whistle. On the sound the team gets onto the ground as fast as they can - face down. On the next blast everyone gets up as fast as they can. Repeat. This should start out slow, giving time to get up and down, and increase in intensity until it is constant.
Do it solo/in a small group: just get you your butt up and down as fast as you can and as long as you can.

, Go to the gym and get someone on your team to show you a lifting routine and then make yourself do it. Pack players should be looking to increase muscle mass, while backs should be looking to increase tone. Tailor your routine accordingly. Be sure to have someone spot for you while lifting weights. The best lifts to perform are front squats, overhead squats, and power cleans. Rugby is a lot of core and explosive hip power.

"
"
Warm-Up.,
Place the ball on a tee.,
Step away from the ball preparing your run up.,
Focus your energy into your kicking leg.,
Begin your run up to the ball.,
Shift your weight onto your non-kicking foot, and allow your kicking leg to swing through striking the ball.

,
Strike the ball with your instep on the sweet spot of the ball.,
Follow through with your foot for maximum height and distance.

",How to Kick for Goal (Rugby)," It is very easy to strain ligaments in your leg while goal kicking so being warmed up and stretched is essential.;
, There are numerous types of tees available and you can even use a mound of sand but ideally you want the ball leaning slightly forward, to expose the sweet spot, with a seam pointed at your target. Aim to just to the right of the posts. Point your non kicking leg to the middle of the posts.

, This is all about personal preference. You may take 3 long steps backwards, look at the goal to make sure you are lined up correctly, and then take 2 long steps to the right, if you are a left footer. If you are a right footer, you may want to step to the left, but it is up to you. And if you prefer a different style, that's fine too: do whatever works for you.

, You can do this lots of ways such as swinging your arms or clapping your hands together.

, As you approach the ball try to plant your non-kicking foot as close to the the tee as you can.

,, The sweet spot is located about 1/3 up the ball.

,"
"
Keep your spine straight on rucks, tackles, and scrums.,
Learn to run effectively with the ball anywhere on the field.,
Learn how to get tackled.,
Ensure that you can throw accurately to both sides.,
Execute perfect offloads as you take tackles.,
Whenever possible, receive and throw the ball while moving forward.,
Practice your position-specific skills in your own time after practice.",How to Become a Better Rugby Player2," One of the biggest improvements you can make playing rugby is your technique. The best players use their bodies efficiently, wringing out every ounce of energy to gain an advantage over the opponent. One of the best things you can do, in almost any situation, is flatten your back. Not only is a curved spine dangerous, it cuts your power down significantly. There are several ways to work on proper back technique:


Keep your butt down by bending at the knees and waist, not through your back.
Never let your head and shoulders dip below your hips.
Do a low-key rucking or scrumming drill, then lock in your ""driving"" position. Stay in place and have a teammate place a ball horizontally on the small of your back. It should not roll off.

, Rugby is much more fluid than football, so you don't want to keep the ball locked up under your arm like a running back. Instead, you need to adapt your hold depending on the situation:



General Play: Hold the ball with your fingertips right near the center of your chest, with the point facing up. This allows you to quickly pass , fake or kick in any direction.

Under Pressure / Being Tackled: Grip the ball horizontally with both hands and forearms. Your left forearm is on the top of the ball, your left hand gripping the right end, and your right forearm is on the bottom of the ball, with your right hand gripping the left point. This is for the moment you know you'll be tackled or someone tries to steal the ball, and is usually used by forwards.

Open Field: Tuck the ball into the crook of your elbow, gripping it with one hand. This gives you plenty of speed and mobility for a one-on-one or open field run. As you get tackled, you place your other hand over the ball to protect it, turning away from the tackler., With all the focus on ""huge hits"" and the best tackling form, many players forget how often they are the ones getting hit. Learning to take a tackle well helps your team win more rucks, helps you gain ground on a defender, and protects your from injuries.



Turn the ball away from the defender. As you approach, pick a side to run at and turn the ball away, lowering your shoulder slightly towards the opponent.

Keep moving your feet forward. This might seem terrifying, but you want your momentum running through him, not the other way around. The player that eases up or slows down is almost always the one who gets hurt.

Fall ""in order."" You should hit the ground first with your knees, then hips, then shoulders to distribute your weight when you fall.

Place the ball back towards your team. You have 1-2 seconds after going down to place the ball, so do your team a solid and reach back. Remember that any defender is going to need to step over you to get the ball, so placing it far back gives your team crucial time to run.

, You want, at a minimum to make a 10 yard pass to either side of you, hitting your teammate in the chest every time. The only way to get there is to practice, so make sure you spend time every single day throwing a rugby ball to both sides.


Spiral or spinning passes are great, but unless you're accurate the beauty of your spin doesn't matter.

, The offload is when you pop the ball up to teammate as you're going down, allowing them to dodge your tackler and keep running. Most beginners are told not to offload, and for good reason: it is very easy to make a terrible pass while you're being pulled violently to the ground. However, as you get better you'll notice how often the pros offload, keeping a run alive and slowly chipping past the defense. To perfect the offload--


Ensure that your teammate is ready for the ball my making eye contact with them.
Do not spin the ball, it is too difficult under pressure. Instead, use a a short, quick 1-3 yard ""pop"" to toss the ball to them.
If you're in doubt, go into contact. If you don't think you can pull the pass off, or if a 2nd defender is coming in, just take the tackle. Remember-- possession is more important than on good run., You do not want to be caught standing in rugby, as this is the easiest way to get lit up with a huge hit. You want your passes to lead your teammates so that they can keep their momentum up as they catch, and you want to be in full stride when your catch the ball. This keeps the defense guessing your movement, makes you more painful to tackle, and helps your team gain ground quickly. Once you can pass accurately, you need to learn to pass accurately on the run. A line of 4 players, running and passing simultaneously, is very difficult to contain, especially if you can ""swing"" the ball from one pass to the other.


Adjust your grip on the ball as you catch it.
Drop the ball towards normal hip-height for a throw.
Open your hips up towards the direction you're passing.
Swing the ball across your body, pointing with your hips.
Follow through with both hands pointing at the target., Each position is different, and the best rugby players carve out extra time to get better at their specialty. Spend 10-15 minutes after practice working on your skills. If you don't know what to work on, ask your coach.


Kickers should hit penalties for at least 10 minutes every day, from all points on the field.
Forwards can hit the scrum sled, focusing on their scrum, ruck, and tackling technique.
Fly-halfs and backs should work on kick and catching punts.

Push yourself as hard as possible in drills, scrimmages, and practice.,
Know how to train for your position.,
Focus on interval training to build endurance.,
Develop a total-body weight lifting program.,
Add plyometrics and body-weight exercies to your workouts for explosive speed and power.,
Use planks and body holds to strengthen your core.,
Cross train with other sports to build total body muscle.",How to Become a Better Rugby Player3," Rugby requires full body strength, and the best way to develop your strength is simply by playing rugby. This activates you muscles the way they need to activate in a game, but you won't get the benefits if you're only giving 50% at practice. Rugby practice should be your fitness every day you go, and you should be prepared to give it all each drill to grow stronger., Each player on the field needs a slightly different toolkit in order to succeed. While every player should be able to run for at least 80 minutes and have good overall muscle mass, training to play prop is very different from training to play wing. Though each position has it's own needs, in general you can group training schedules by backs and forwards:



All Players: Core exercises, endurance training, strong quads, butt, and back.

Backs: Should focus on sprint training, being able to run near top speed even towards the ends of games. Strength training is imperative, but not so much that you lose speed and mobility.

Forwards: Need to focus on strength and mass. Bigger people make a bigger impact in the scrum and on rucks, and are harder to take down or get through. More of a forward's time is going to be in the weight room than the a back's.

, A rugby game is a constant ebb and flow -- sprint, jog, ruck, rest, jog, walk, recover (penalty call!), scrum, etc. While long, 3-5 mile runs are fine for general endurance, rugby players will get more out of interval training. Intervals are when you alternate short, high-energy sprints with jogging and walking. Some good routines to start with might be:


Sprint the try-line, then jog up the sideline to the other end. Sprint that try-line too, and repeat 5x. Rest and do it once more. Add an extra lap each day you train, or add the half-field or 22-meter lines into the mix.
Run at 80% top speed for 30 seconds, then jog for a minute. Repeat 10 times. As you get better, decrease your jogging time until you are at only 30 seconds.
Run up a set of stairs, then lightly jog done. Rest for 10 seconds at the bottom, then repeat.
Mix in push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and burpees (A push-up followed immediately by a jumping jack) during your jogs. Stop, perform the exercise for 30 seconds, then immediately keep jogging., Running, tackling, driving, jumping, throwing, diving -- a rugby player needs to be strong enough for almost any physical activity imaginable. This makes strength training a major part of any serious rugby player's schedule. While you should work with a coach or trainer to develop a routine for you and your position (a scrum-half, after all, should not be as bulky as a prop), there are a few exercises every rugby player should do. All of these exercises activate multiple muscles, meaning that you can even do them 1-2 per week in season to stay strong.


Squats
Deadlifts
Bench Press
Military Press

Power Clean, Plyometrics are bounding, jumping, and other explosive workouts. You usually do them with high-reps, getting your body used to the types of movements it would make in a game. What's more, you can often do these workouts without the aid of a gym. Focus on doing enough reps so that the last 5 of every set are difficult -- this is when you make the most gains.Try bounding, which is when you ""run"" 30 meters while keeping yourself in the air (both feet off the ground) for as much time as possible.
Box jumps
Pull-ups
Chin-up
Push-ups.

Core exercises., Your core is where you transfer energy from your top half to your bottom, and this sort of power is essential to turn the drive of your legs into a successful tackle with your arms. Try out:


Planks.
Abdominal holds.

, The English National Rugby Team has wrestling and judo coaches on staff, as the sport helps safely develop the grappling strength needed in mauls, rucks and tackles.Try out:


Swimming sports, like water polo. Swimming uses your whole body with minimal pressure on your joints.
Biking and running. They are essential for total endurance, and hill-sprints build valuable butt and quad muscles needed to drive back opponents.
Rock climbing. Scrambling effectively up a wall requires coordination, fine motor control, and serious leg and forearm strength that will make you more effective on runs and tackles.

"
"
Run toward your opponent at pace and have low body position, bending at the knees.,
As your driving foot steps into your opponents circle, center the tip of your shoulder on your opponent’s midsection.,
Keep your arms raised, elbows out, and your head on the outside of the tackle.

,
Run through the tackle with streaming forward momentum.,
Using your momentum, wrap your arms around the ball carrier’s thighs and drive forward and upward, lifting the opponent a short distance off of the ground and to the side.

,
Forcibly drive your wrapped opponent to the ground with you, landing them on the flat of their back.

,
Quickly stand up and be ready for the next play.",How to Dump Tackle in Rugby2," A low body position ensures a hard hit and excellent center of gravity. High tackles equal penalties from the referee.

, Make sure you use the shoulder on the same side as your driving foot. i.e. right foot/right shoulder.

,, Your tackle should NOT stop at contact.

,,, Feel the rush of a great tackle.

"
"
Exercise regularly to ensure that you are physically fit enough to withstand the strain of a rugby match.,
Train thoroughly to learn good techniques, especially for tackling and scrums, before you play competitively.,
Before playing a match, warm up for 15-30 minutes, with plenty of stretches.

,
Use a mouthguard (gum shield).,
Protect your head with a plastic scrum cap.,
Drink plenty of liquids during a match to avoid dehydration and heatstroke.

,
Always follow the rules of the game.,
Withdraw from the game immediately if you suffer a blow to the head resulting in even momentary loss of consciousness, or in temporary mental confusion or loss of balance.

",How to Avoid Injury at Rugby," Developing strong core muscles in the back, in particular, will prevent injuries.;
, Many injuries occur from avoidable play errors.

,, This will prevent damage to your teeth and give some protection against injuries to the head and jaw. Either obtain a custom-made mouthguard from your dentist or buy a 'boil-and-bite' shield.

, Wear lightweight padding on your shoulders and chest.

,, They are designed to minimise serious injuries. In particular, never deliberately cause a scrum, ruck or maul to collapse.

",How to Be a Level 2 Cheerleader," A back handspring is a very important skill in level 2 cheerleading. If you can't do one and want to be in level 2, take private or tumbling lessons so you can learn one. Most teams will let you in a level 2 team if you're close to a back handspring or have it on the trampoline, so just because you don't have a perfect one on the ground by yourself doesn't mean you won't make the level 2 team. It's better to learn a standing back handspring before you learn a round-off back handspring.;
, In level 2 you'll most likely do things like round-off back handsprings or standing back handsprings, but you can also learn things like dive rolls, front handsprings, and other things that are not legal in level 1.

, Jumps are also important in level 2. Most teams have you do toe-touch pause back handsprings in routines some girls don't even know if they should connect or separate. In level 2, you always pause in between jumps and back handsprings.  But, as you go on to higher levels you WILL connect. Its just a rule that certain levels have to do and respect an order to not be disqualified.

, In level 2, you won't be doing any single-legged extended stunts or twist tosses. Learn the rules of level 2 before you make the level 2 team, otherwise you won't have any idea what type of things you'll be doing at practice or in the routine. As you try out for level 2, they are sure to tell you want they're looking for on a sheet or the expectations they have or a certain thing you MAY NEED to have. The rules level 2 are different from any other level. But the number one rule is u mess up u keep going because it's better to keep going then to cry in the middle in the routine. Only you and the people who choreographed know if you messed up or our coaches. The judges don't know what our routine is. They just know what to look for IN the routine.

, In level 2, you start doing tosses. In level 2, you can only do a 1/4 rotation in a toss and you may not perform a toe ouch or a kick in any kind of toss. If you're a base or a spot, learn how to catch the flyer correctly otherwise she can fall and get really hurt.

, Some stunts in level 2 are single-legged half stunts, extensions, tosses, log rolls Single legged extended stunt are not allowed unless they are braced by a stunt at prep level or below(shoulder sit). .

,, Remember that you can get in a level 2 team by having a back handspring on the tumble track or with a spot, because you'll most likely learn one when competitions start. Most teams also practice during the summer.

Look nice.,
Make sure you practice everything you learn and know.,
Improve your current moves.,
Have good facial expressions.,
Be confident and loud.,
Work on the tumbling you have.",How to Be Accepted Into a Cheerleading Squad With No Tumbling Experience," You don't want to look messy when trying out for the cheer squad. Wear a pair of Soffe shorts or a similar brand and shirt that says something about cheerleading. If you don't have a shirt like that, then wear a shirt from a school club or in your school colors. Make sure your hair is in a ponytail with a big bow. Keep your makeup minimal with some long lasting lip gloss, concealer on problem spots, and waterproof mascara. You can wear some eyeshadow if you want, but it is not needed.;
, Practice your dance, cheer, and chant. If you don't learn it until tryout day, learn basic motions, kicks, and jumps. Make sure your motions are sharp and tight. Your motions can't be floppy or it will just look weird. You need to learn a toe touch, herkie, pike, kicks, right, left, and center split, bow and arrow, bridge, punch, hands on hips, daggers, L, K, T, touchdown, buckets, candlesticks, diagonals, among other moves. Practice these every single day until tryouts.

, Tense up your arm muscles when doing motions. Kick with a straight back, leg, and pointed toe. When doing your jumps, keep your back straight and your legs up. To improve your jumps, follow this jumping routine to make your jumps higher and neater. Do 30 straddle leg lifts on each leg, 30 crunches, 30 oblique crunches, 50 bicycle crunches, 30 squats, 30 squat jumps, 30 toe raises, 30 hops on each foot, 15 ""cheerleader"" crunches (look them up), 10 kicks on each leg to the front, side, and 45 degree angle, and practice! Doing this every morning when you wake up will give you stronger legs, a higher jump, and help your legs raise higher in your jumps. Stretch everyday too. Do a straddle (left, right, center), pike, touch your toes, pigeon stretch, butterfly, frog, lunge, floor lunge, split (left, right, center), bridge, shoulder stretch, tricep stretch, bicep stretch, wrist stretch, and ankle stretch. Hold each move for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If you do this twice a day everyday along with any other stretches you can think of, you should get your splits in a month!

, When doing your dance, wink, smile, stick out your tongue, anything that makes people smile and gets the crowd going. If you want your smile to really shine, whiten your teeth with some baking soda, whitening toothpaste, floss, and/or whitening strips. Add some pink lip gloss with some glitter and your smile will really shine.

, They want to hear you when cheer because that's what cheerleading is! And be confident, you always want to be confident when you cheer. Practice having a loud and clear voice at tryouts.

, You may not have any cheer leading tumbling experience but if you have skills from other activities like gymnastics or even circus skills, try working on perfecting back handsprings, tucks, or aerials. You can teach yourself the basics, such as a handstand, cartwheel, and round off. Chances are that they will teach you some tougher moves on the squad. When doing basic tumbling which you have no experience of, make sure your toes are pointed and your legs are straight.

Develop your breath and voice by strengthening your diaphragm.,
Open up the back of your throat.,
Understand vocal placement.,
Put more energy into articulation.,
Add projecting to cardio.,

Avoid yelling cheers and chants.,
Choose a cheer.,
Warm up and warm down your voice.,
Perform the moves that go along with the cheer.,
Use your voice in cheerleading.",How to Be Loud and Clear as a Cheerleader," Use your diaphragm to project versus your actual vocal cords and do this by concentrating on using breath and voice from that area around your lungs.Practice diaphragm exercises 5-10 minutes daily to help you strengthen your muscle for use during your cheering.


Lie down with your body flat against the ground. Make sure your knees are bent, as if you are in the resting position during crunches.
Put one of your hands flat against your abs and the other one flat against your chest.
Inhale your breath deeply through the nose. While doing this, make sure that your chest is completely still and that you are moving the stomach out.
Exhale your breath through pursed lips. Pull your stomach in at the same time. Your chest should be still.;
, Sound propels forward when you utilize the space behind your tongue as a resonance chamber.To open up that area, practice yawning or pretend an egg is lodged in your throat. This will help you visualize where that area is and help you open it., Projecting your voice is easier and quicker to do when you imagine a mask being there. This will help you concentrate on the area below your eyes and along your nose, which is where sound vibrations are easily felt.Wear a Mardi Gras mask to help you further understand where you should be projecting your voice. The undereye area and the nose area is where you should feel vibrations when you speak.Practice opening the throat (see previous step) while placing your voice forward toward the mask area.

, This causes your voice to lift up and away from throat muscles and into the resonators of your face instead. Projection happens because your sinus cavity and cheekbones create more resonance., Practice being loud as you run because your cheer voice while you run makes you less tired and winded when it’s time for your actual cheer performances. Over time, this will help you become better at breath control while exerting yourself physically.

, When all your air goes into one word or phrase, it results in a yell. Control how much air goes into each of your words by taking a deep breath so that you are able to deliver the rest of your chant evenly.


Using breath support like this will increase the volume of your words healthily versus straining them.

, Talking in your normal everyday voice and cheering in your cheer voice is completely different. Cheer in a lower voice (but not exactly husky) than you usually use, this will help your voice get louder., Yelling causes damage to vocal cords by tightening them. Notice the tension and lack thereof when you yell versus project.


To learn the difference between yelling words and projecting them, practice opening the diaphragm (as described in 1.1 above) to the rate of your airflow. This will help you learn the difference and protect your vocals.
When you yell, you strain your vocals by causing them to tighten in an uncomfortable way. When you project, you are getting the same effect without the damage. Even though your words will be loud as you project, it will feel softer on your chords., Do cheers the team typically performs or create a cheer of your own using the school’s mascot and name. Practice by saying the cheer repeatedly to commit it to memory.


Practice your chants with the moves in front of a mirror to get a better idea of how the crowd will see you.

, Use vocal warm ups to preserve your voice’s quality and prepare it for use. Vocal warm ups should be done before vocally intensive activities, cheering being one of them.Practice warming up your voice with tongue trills. Roll your tongue as if you are making the Spanish “r” sound. Vary the pitch up and down the scale while performing those “r” rolls.Practice lip trills by placing your lips loosely together to release your breath in a steady stream. Releasing tension this way relieves the vocal cords.Practice reciting your vowels (A, E, I, O, U) at different volumes. Practicing this with scales not only warms up your vocals, but it also helps with enunciation.

, Cheerleading moves should be sharp and precise. Make sure you are executing the movements properly. You are not only representing you, but also your school and sports’ team as well.

, Spread cheer and promote crowd involvement by smiling and using your voice.


Pronounce every word clearly through enunciation to initiate words and syllables smoothly.
Wear a smile at all times and practice maintaining your poise. Team spirit must be felt the entire duration you’re cheering during games, win or lose."

Be confident, smile, believe in yourself, and be happy!",How to Be on an All Star Cheer Team," Most people don't know what cheerleading really is. If your parents think that cheerleaders are mean people that do nothing but wave pom-poms, explain to them what you really want to do, how much you love cheerleading, and that all-star cheerleading is not the same thing as cheering for your school or football. Make sure you aren't putting them on the spot. Make sure they agree with you and you aren't pressuring them. They will more likely help you if you stay calm and show them your mature.;
, Be happy, smile, make friends, don't be mean, laugh a lot, and be sporty! Remember that being mean and rude to other teammates could get you kicked off the cheerleading team, so remember to be nice to everyone in your team and outside our team. Also make sure that you pick a good team.

, Before you become an all-star cheerleader, you need to know what all-star cheerleading is. Look up videos on Youtube or visit the USASF (US All-Star Federation) website to see how it's like being an all-star cheerleader. Know all the rules and levels so you'll have an idea what level you'll be on and what you'll be doing. And be sure to know the difference between all-star cheerleading and football/basketball cheerleading before you sign up!

, If you're tall and strong, you'll probably be a base or backspot. If you're short, flexible, and agile you'll probably be a flyer. If you're a combination of both, maybe you could be two things at a time!

, Look on the website for pictures, look on youtube for videos, and see if on the website they have requirements for the team you want to try out for. For previews on competitions go to websites like Jamfest or U.S. Nationals. Remember to find a good team. If the team only has seven girls or goes in only two competitions a year, you might not want to join if cheerleading is your passion. Make sure you join a good sized teams with plenty of levels and that goes on competitions! And if possible, try joining a team that goes to Worlds.

, Don't be lazy! You should practice a little everyday. Stretch and exercise.

, Believe it or not, the more flexible you are, the less you'll get hurt, because your body will be so used to bending. Stretch every day and do a couple of strength exercises like crunches, lemon squeezes, and push-ups about three times a week.

, Run at least once a week. Being strong can help you get better at a lot of cheerleading things, like jumping, tumbling, stunting, or maybe even dancing if your team's dance is fast and difficult.

, Do tumbling, private lessons, or a be in a recreational team for about two months before you actually do the real thing, and remember that you must know the basics. Those classes will teach you all the basics. If you already took something like gymnastics or tumbling before, you don't really have to. The better you are at tumbling, the more likely you'll be able to make a higher level in your team.

, Practice in front of the mirror and remember to squeeze your body the whole time. While doing motions, keep your fists straight up and tight, not bent! The better your basics are, the better your tumbling will be.

, Practice every day and when you're sitting down, be in the position of the jump you want to learn/improve. When you jump, whip your legs and arms as hard as possible and keep your arms tight (that's why basic motions are important in cheerleading).

, It may sound silly, but dance is important in all-star cheer. If you don't know how to dance, you'll be all messed up while your teammates are doing great in a competition, and all all-star cheer routines have at least one dance part in them. Your dance moves should be clean and tight, and remember to do facials/smile while you dance.

, They are very important cheerleading skills. Remember that in most tumbling passes, a cheerleader will do a roundoff/roundoff back handspring before she does the final trick. Even thought a back handspring is essential, don't attempt one unless your coach already gave you permission to, because if you did one by yourself and fell, that could lead to serious injury.

, If you fall backwards, just do a candle rock with your arms straight above your head, and stand back up. If you fall forwards, tuck your chin in and roll.

, If you have a fear of going backwards, just practice jumping backwards on a mattress and doing bridges. Remember that tumbling can sometimes be scary/dangerous, so be prepared to fall, because it's impossible to never fall!


Don't be scared in any position you take. If you're a base, make sure you get under your flyer and don't be scared. If you're scared then the flyer will be scared as well. Be confident. If your a back-spot, don't be scared as well. Make sure you're catching your flyer if you do cradles or baskets. You need to grab the flyer's ankles or the base's wrists and pull up to relieve some of the weight. When doing cradles or baskets, help push then step aside to catch.

, Facials give you more points in competitions and just make your team look better while performing. You need to look like you're having fun in a competition, because if you look bored, you're probably gonna lose.

, Once you feel prepared, sign up for try-outs. Don't worry, you always make the team when you're an all-star!

, Smile all the time and don't attempt anything you can't do or anything too dangerous. Be confident and always stretch first. Wear comfortable clothes. Look at the judges/coaches in the eye and pretend you're just at home and no one is watching!

, Don't make cliques in your team and don't try to mess anyone up! Also, don't laugh at someone if they fell or they can't do a tumbling trick everyone else in the team can do.


Don't cry, be upset, or be too hard on yourself. Always be positive, because all cheerleaders are supposed to have a positive attitude.

, Granola bars or energy drinks can be good, but don't drink too much caffeine or you'll get too hyper and will not be able to tumble!

, Even if you already have a back handspring, using a barrel/roller will make your back handsprings even better than they already are.

,,


Don't be afraid. The more you're afraid, the worse it may be. Stay clam throughout your routine, keep your composure, and work on facials. Facials is what wins the judges over.

Oiling.,
The first step we do is to obtain the oldest, daggiest leather ball we have and then start to softly hit the front face (blade) with the ball in one hand and the bat on our laps.,
Some people recommend doing this with a Wooden or Ball Bat Mallet straight from the start and you can do this immediately but put an old sock over the Mallet to soften the initial knocking in process.

,
During this process make sure that you are knocking every region of the blade.,
Every once in a while press a fingernail lightly into the blade.,
After these first 2 hours with an old leather ball or the sock covered mallet have a break.,
The next day or after your break use a wooden Bat Mallet without its sock to begin gently tapping the face and edges of the blade.,
Running in.,
At this stage begin to get the feel of the cricket bat.,
Get a mate to throw or bowl you some old leather balls in the nets.,
That should now be 6 hours spent knocking in your cricket bat.",How to Knock in a Cricket Bat Quickly," Oiling your cricket bat is the first step in the knocking in process. Using the Raw Linseed oil or Specialized bat oil lightly oil your new bat. No rocket science is involved here but it is important not to over oil your bat. Use an open weave cloth or a Chux Wipe to spread a film of oil over the main face of the bat. Ensure that the edges are also oiled and there is nothing wrong with giving the back of the cricket bat a very light coverage as well but avoid oiling the splice of the bat (the very top section of the blade). There should be enough coverage of oil on the front face of the bat so that you can see a thin film of oil on it. You should NOT see any oil running if you stand the bat upright. If this happens there is too much oil so wipe it away to only leave a thin film. Lie the bat down horizontally after this. After leaving it at least overnight repeat the procedure again but this time use even less oil than the first application. In other words give it only a very light rub with the same open weave cloth from before. Leave lying horizontally for at least 6 hours. After this oiling you are then ready to begin the Knocking In procedure.;
, Have a seat in front of the TV and watch some telly because you need to do this for at least 2 hours. Warn you partner or family that this procedure could become annoying but as far as we are concerned there is nothing like sitting in front of the TV knocking in a new cricket bat.

,, Work down the edges in a methodical fashion and then up and down through the central blade. A cricket bat is designed to hit a ball in its lower middle section, between 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) from the bottom, so even though you should eventually concentrate on this region you also need to knock the entire blade in as well. As much as we would like to play all of our shots from this hitting zone, even the Don miss hit a few shots.

, At the beginning this will leave an indentation but over the entire running in procedure such marks will become harder to make.

, If you are going to leave it overnight or have a few hours break then give the bat the absolute lightest of oil rubs with that same open weave cloth. There will be more than enough oil in the cloth already so no need to put any more oil onto the cloth.

, Again make sure that you cover every region of the blade. Gradually begin to increase the force of your blows. It is so important to ensure that you cover every area of the blade that a ball can hit it including the edges which should show a rounded appearance after a while. We recommend you spend another 2 hours on this procedure.

, So now that should be 4 hours you have spent patiently running your bat in. Now you can go outside and begin to bounce that original daggy ball up and down on your bat and also hit some small catches in the back yard.

, All cricket bats have their sweet spots and you will be able to easily identify yours during this process. The sweet spot should be where you play the majority of your attacking shots from. After an hour or so of this its time to finally head off to the nets.

, DO NOT use ""compo"" balls or balls that are not made from leather. DO NOT use new balls at this stage. Spend an hour playing mostly defensive strokes with the occasional gentle and well timed drive, cut or pull. Keep an eye on the face and edges of the blade. If you have knocked your cricket bat in properly these older leather balls should not be leaving any deep indentations on the blades face. If they are, then go back to the TV and continue with the original knocking in procedure.

, We said it was a long process and I suppose that is why some people prefer to pay to have their new cricket bats run in. There is nothing wrong with paying to have you bat run in as long as it is done PROPERLY. Begin to use newer balls in the nets playing these mostly defensive and gentle attacking strokes. At this stage it is vital to keep an eye on the indentations that these newer balls make. If you have knocked it in well there should be very few signs of indentations. Spend an hour or so with these newer balls. Following this (7 hours so far) begin to use new balls in the nets. Again keep an eye on the face after each stroke and concentrate on timed shots as opposed to big hitting. Its not a bad idea to follow this net session with a brief session with the mallet once you get home. Assuming you have followed these steps your cricket bat should be ready for use under match conditions.

Stumps and bails are wooden pieces that are assembled to create the wicket, one of the most important objects in cricket. Setting up wickets is described in greater detail at the end of this section.






The cricket bat is a large bat made of willow wood that is flat on one side and bulged on the other, for strength. The ball should be hit with the flat part of the bat for the best distance on a hit.






The cricket ball is similar to a baseball in size and composition, but is sewn in a straight line rather than a tennis ball pattern, creating two equal hemispheres separated by stitching. Cricket balls are traditionally red with white stitching; in modern times, white balls are sometimes used for better visibility during Limited Over games (which generally go into the night), where coloured uniforms are worn rather than the traditional white.






Cricket uniforms consist of long pants, a shirt (which may be long- or short-sleeved), and shoes. Most cricket players wear cleats (spike-tread shoes) for better grip on the field, but it isn't required. In games with a traditional red ball, outfits must always be white or off-white. Team colours may be used for games with white balls.






The wicket-keeper (a ball catcher) is allowed to wear safety equipment similar to that of a baseball catcher's: webbed mitts, shin guards, and a helmet. No other player is allowed to wear protective equipment in the field unless they are close to the batsmen in which case they get to wear a helmet and shin guards.





;
, Cricket is played on a large, oval-shaped field. The field has a rectangular strip in the center, which is called the pitch. A boundary line should be clearly marked all around the outside edge of the field.


The pitch is where the bowler (pitcher) bowls the ball to the other team's striker (batter). Regulation play has the pitch at 22 yards (20.1 m) long by 10 feet (3.0 m) wide.






A cricket field doesn't strictly have to be oval according to the rules, but it usually is.

, Areas of the pitch are divided into segments by lines called “creases.” There are four creases:


The popping crease, which is also sometimes called the batting crease, marks the boundary beyond which the batter is no longer safe from being run out (taken out of play by the fielding, or defending, team).






The two return creases run parallel to the long edges of the pitch, one on each side, back from the popping crease to the end of the pitch.
The bowling crease runs parallel to the popping crease between the two return creases, dividing the area behind the popping crease into two rectangular sections. The bowler must stand at or behind the bowling crease before he bowls.
Each end of the pitch is marked off with creases, leaving a rectangle of open space between them on the center of the pitch. Aside from the boundary marker, the rest of the cricket field is not marked.

, A wicket is a structure made from three stakes, called stumps, driven into the ground, with two crosspieces called bails set on grooves between each pair of them (left-center and center-right). In most cases, a batsman whose wicket loses a bail from being struck with the ball, is out, so defending the wickets is an important part of offensive play.


Wickets should be set 28.5 inches (72.4 cm) high, with a total width of 9 inches (22.9 cm) across the three stumps.






Wickets are placed so that the center stump of each wicket is in the center of the bowling crease, with the other two stumps equidistant on either side of it along the crease. One wicket is set up on each bowling crease, for a total of two on the pitch. Batsmen (batters) stand in front of their wickets during play.

, As in most field games, the goal of cricket is to score points against the opposing team by running from one point to another before the play can be ended or you're run out by the defenders, who are called the “fielding team.” The team at bat is called the “batting team.”

, Each team in cricket is comprised of 11 players. (An alternate 12th player may be held in reserve in case of injury, but is not otherwise used for anything.) At any given time, the fielding team has all 11 players on the field, whereas the batting team has two, called the batsmen. The batsmen try to hit the ball after it is bowled by the bowler for the fielding team, and then switch positions without getting an out to score points.


All of the positions on the pitch have official names. The person who bowls the ball is the bowler, and the batsman who is facing the bowler is called the striker. The other batsman, who stands near the bowler at the far side of the pitch from the striker, is called the non-striker. Finally, the fielding team member who stands behind the wickets at the striker's end of the field is called the wicket-keeper.






Other positions in the field have colloquial names, but none are official.



, Cricket, much like baseball, uses specialized terms to describe each section of the game. Depending on the length of the game to be played, the number of innings varies between one and two per team. Each innings (the word “innings” is used both singular and plural) can contain any number of “overs,” which are sets of bowls. Read the points below to learn about these elements in greater detail:


Every time the bowler bowls the ball, whether or not it is hit by the striker, a tally is counted. Once a bowler has bowled the ball 6 times in one direction, an “over” is declared. At the over, the bowler must be replaced with a new bowler. Bowlers can't bowl consecutive overs, but they can rotate back in after at least one bowl from another bowler, so theoretically two bowlers could trade off bowling for the entire innings. When there's an over, the position of the bowler changes from one end of the pitch to the other.






This also means that the striker can change between overs, depending on which end of the pitch he is when the over is called. Strikers also change depending on how many runs are completed, since the bowler doesn't change position except at an over. For example, if only one run is completed, the striker and non-striker have switched ends of the pitch, making the non-striker the striker for the next bowl.


Any time a batsman is declared out, he must leave the field and be replaced by a teammate. If the fielding team manages to score 10 outs in an innings, the innings is over, as there are no more batsmen to fill in the second spot on the pitch. Ways to out a batsman are covered later.






An innings is a single period of gameplay for the entire batting team. In short forms of cricket, a set number of overs are allowed to each team per innings; once that number is reached, the innings ends even if the fielding team hasn't made 10 outs. In the most prestigious and professional form of cricket, called Test cricket, any number of overs per innings is allowed, meaning that the innings normally only ends once 10 outs are reached. Once an innings ends, the fielding team and batting team switch roles, and the innings for the fielding (now batting) team begins.






Test cricket games last a maximum of 5 days, and are played 6 hours a day during that time. The shortest commonly played form of cricket, Twenty20, allows one innings per team, with a maximum of 20 overs per innings, and typically takes no more than a few hours to complete.



, Wickets are a central part of cricket. One of the chief ways to out a batsman is to knock one or both of the bails off of his wicket with the ball, which is called “breaking” the wicket. There are several conditions under which this will result in an out:


If the bowler manages to directly hit the striker's wicket on a bowl and break it, the striker is considered out “bowled.”






If a batsman is outside either popping crease on the pitch, the bowler may break his wicket, either by hitting it with the ball in his hand, or by hitting it with the ball directly. In this case, the batsman is said to have been “run out.”






Since non-strikers often leave the popping crease as the bowler is about to bowl (in much the same way that baseball players edge away from bases in anticipation of a run to the next base), the bowler can out the non-striker by stopping the bowl and breaking the wicket before he returns to the crease. This is also considered a run out.






If the striker misses the ball while attempting to hit it, and steps outside the popping crease, the wicket-keeper can break his wicket by catching the bowl cleanly and striking the wicket with the ball, resulting in an out. This type of out is called being “stumped.”






If the striker intentionally uses any part of his body to block the ball from hitting the wicket, he is out “leg before wicket.” This is usually abbreviated LBW.






If the striker hits his own wicket by accident and breaks it, he is out “hit wicket.” Hit wicket outs happen no matter what struck the wicket, but only happen if the striker was attempting to hit the ball, or has hit the ball and is attempting to run to the other end of the pitch.






On the other hand, if the striker has hit the ball and it directly flies into the non-striker's wicket, the non-striker isn't out. The bowler can still pick up the ball and redirect it at the non-striker's wicket to run him out.



, In addition to the wicket, there are several other ways to out a batsman. Some of them are very common, while others happen rarely, if ever, at higher levels of play. Some of the more technical outs can only be decided by umpires, of which there are always 2 (and sometimes 3) on the field at any given time.


A striker is “caught out” if a member of the fielding team catches it before it hits the ground. This is a very common type of out. If the fielder who catches the ball steps over the boundary line at the edge of the field, though, the batsman scores 6 runs instead. This includes catching the ball out of bounds, and stepping over the line after the catch.






If a batsman touches the ball with any hand not already holding the bat, he is taken out for “handling the ball,” unless the fielding team has given him permission first. This rule does not apply to getting hit by a bowled ball, or any other kind of accidental touching.






When a batsman tries to use his bat or body to swat away a ball already in play (usually in defense of his wicket), or interferes with the efforts of the fielding team to get the ball back to the pitch and get an out, he is taken out for “obstructing the field.” However, running so that the batsman's body is between the fielder holding the ball and the batsman's wicket is legal.






If the striker hits the ball twice on a bowl for any reason except to scoot it away from his wicket, he will be called out. Hitting the ball twice to confound fielders or attempt a better score is strictly forbidden.






When one batsman is called out, if the next batsman doesn't arrive on the field to take his place within two minutes, he is considered “timed out.”







, There are a few conditions under which extra runs can be awarded. These are noted as such for purposes of calculating player averages, but are otherwise identical to any other type of run for the purpose of determining a winner. The four types of extra are as follows:


On a call of “no ball” after an illegal bowl, batsmen can only be out by run out, handling the ball, obstructing the field, or hitting the ball twice. Runs scored on a call of “no ball” are considered extra, and every “no ball” a bowler throws must be compensated with another bowl in the same over. (Thus, a bowler who bowled “no ball” once would have to bowl a total of 7 times instead of the usual 6 to reach the over.)






If no runs are scored on a “no ball,” one run is added to the batting team's score anyway.


When a bowler bowls wide (as discussed previously), the batting team automatically scores one run. As with “no ball” extras, “wide” extras must be made up by the bowler by adding bowls onto his over.






If the striker tries to hit the ball but misses, and the wicket-keeper doesn't manage to catch it, the batsmen can try to score runs on the play. These runs are called “byes.”






A “leg bye” occurs when the striker tries to hit the ball with his bat, but hits it with his body instead. “Leg byes” otherwise function identically to “byes.” “Leg byes” can't be taken if the striker wasn't trying to hit the ball.







, One batsman stands at each end of the pitch, behind the popping crease but ahead of the bowling crease. The bowler also stands at one end of the crease, starting behind the bowling crease, and bowls to the other end. The batsman to whom the bowler bowls is the striker; the batsman at the same end as the bowler is the non-striker.


The wicket-keeper crouches behind the striker's wicket and the bowling crease. His job is to catch the ball should the striker miss or decline to hit the bowl. When the wicket-keeper successfully catches a ball, the striker is normally declared out.






The other nine members of the fielding team can stand in any configuration at any time, as long as they stay outside the pitch.







, The bowler starts behind the bowling crease, and bowls the ball before reaching the popping crease by moving forward and throwing the ball. A cricket bowl is always performed over-the-shoulder, with a completely straight arm. The ball is allowed to bounce on the pitch once before reaching the striker, though it doesn't have to.


If the bowler steps past the popping crease during the bowl, the play is called as “no ball” by the umpires. The batsmen can run as though they hit the ball, but can't be out except by a few specific methods, as outlined above.






Different bowlers have different movement styles, and may rush forward for a fast bowl, or step forward a couple of times and twist for a trickier bowl. The fastest bowls can fly at up to 90 mph (140 km/h), which given the short length of the pitch, requires a very fast response from the striker.






The bowl must reach the striker at or below the waist. If it's higher, or it sails out past the sides of the pitch, it is called a “wide” ball, or a “no ball,” especially in cases where the ball isn't far from the striker but is too high to hit.







, Using the flat side of the cricket bat, the striker can attempt to hit the ball. There are many different types of strike, each with a different advantage over the others. Once the striker has hit the ball, he and the non-striker can choose to run from end to end of the pitch, exchanging places. If both batsmen manage to run safely to the far side of the pitch, one run is declared, and one point is scored. If either batsman is declared out while trying to reach the far side of the pitch, no point is scored.


Batsmen don't have to run when they hit the ball. As long as they stay behind their popping lines, they're safe from most outs, so sometimes it's prudent not to run.






Batsmen who successfully score a run can turn around immediately and try to score another run, as many times as they think they can get away with it before the fielding team can run one of them out. Taking more than 4 runs on a bowl is very rare, but possible.






If a batsman hits the ball out of bounds and the ball bounced at least once on its way out, 4 runs are awarded automatically. If the ball didn't bounce before it landed out of bounds, 6 runs are awarded instead.







, Play according to whatever type of game you've chosen until the appropriate number of innings has been reached. The team with the highest number of points is the winner.

Be supportive and helpful.,
Be ambitious but not malicious.,
Fit in.,
Turn up on time.,
Know the moves.,
Keep fit.,
Show your enthusiasm.",How to Be Accepted by Your New Cheer Squad," When you first meet your new cheer squad teammates, be courteous to them and ask them about themselves. Do not begin your new journey by trying to hog the limelight and inform them how good you are at cheerleading moves. Instead, make it clear that you're interested in your other team members and want to learn more about them.


Ask questions about their cheerleading experiences and how long they have been in the squad.
Be genuinely interested in their experiences. You may learn some very useful information from the very beginning.
Ensure that you speak to every member of the squad, so that nobody feels left out or snubbed.;
, During practice sessions, help your team members if they need it. Pass the water bottle, make space on the mats and offer helpful tips here and there if you can see anyone struggling.


Do not gossip or say unkind things about your team members. Even if you think you have singled out a trusted team member to do such things with, it will get back to the others eventually and they won't trust you. Realize that being mean is often a reflection of feeling left out or unqualified, so put your energies into improving your skills instead.
Avoid being bossy with advice. If someone needs help, that's a great opportunity to step in and offer it. On the other hand, constantly asking your team members to change the way that they do things will soon grow irritating and they'll be worried that you think you know better.

, If you want to be the head of the cheer squad some day, that's a great goal. However, don't make this obvious from the start or constantly undermine the leader. Bide your time, learn well and wait for the right opportunity down the track. You will be a more successful leader if your team knows you well, trusts you and believes that you worked hard to get into that role.


Do not spread gossip, make unkind statements or undermine the team leadership. If you feel that something needs to be changed, use constructive questions to ask why something is done the way that it is, then make suggestions for changes in a polite and respectful way. If your suggestions aren't accepted, live with it and stay supportive of your team. You will have your chance some day.

, Get the uniform needed, wear the right shoes and do your hair as they recommend for the team. Do all of the things that help you form part of the team and ensure the smooth running of it.


If you don't know what is expected, never be afraid to ask. Ask the team leader, ask a friend on the team or check the website or manuals for help. It is better to find out than to have to undo making an error that could have been easily avoided.

, Always be on time for practices and actual events. Being late is an easy way to get your team members offside as they'll dislike your unreliability. By being on time, and ready to get on with things, you'll earn a reputation for reliability and that is something valued highly in a team.

, When you're new, it can take time to get across the new moves. Don't let this become an issue for the team––practice until you can do the moves well. Ask team members to help guide you; you should find that there are always those who love the role of teaching a newbie and will be more than happy to ensure that you get your moves right. After all, it benefits the team as a whole.

, Stay active and eat healthily so that you can give your best performance for each week. If you need tips on keeping fit, ask the other team members what they do, so that you can learn from their experiences and tailor these to your own situation.

, Be an enthusiastic, caring and engaged member of your cheer squad. Talk about your participation proudly with others, and promote the activities of the squad whenever you can. Always be positive about it in public and help others to see that you genuinely care about being a part of the squad.

Bowl over and over to solidify your muscle memory.

, Fast bowlers employ several specific deliveries in their arsenal with different ball or hand positions for each. Keep opposing batters on their toes by practicing different deliveries. Use different grips and spins to achieve variation in your delivery:


Practice dragging your fingers along the side of the ball as you deliver it to create spin and cause the ball to cut left or right after the bounce.
Try to throw the ball with little to no spin and perfect the delivery of a yorker.
Position the seam of the ball vertically in your hand so the ball bounces off the seam and veers to the side after the bounce.

, Count the number of steps you are taking as you approach the crease. Make sure you are consistent to solidify your muscle memory for your delivery.Practice several deliveries to determine your natural starting position.
Mark this spot on the pitch.
Measure the distance of your starting location to the crease or foul line.

, Body position and jump height will vary from person to person. As you practice your run up, determine what bound feels most natural to achieve the proper foot placement for your delivery.A high bound can disrupt your momentum and slow your bowling speed.
Having no bound will give you less power to deliver the ball.
Practice a moderate jump to optimize your form before delivery.

, Although the hand position and spin may vary on each delivery, your body mechanics and placement should be consistent. Practice landing in the same spot to prevent being called for no balls.

, After you have determined the optimum distance, bound height, and foot placement for your delivery, practice over and over so you don't have to think about these items during matches. Let your muscle memory guide your body, and the speed of delivery will come as a natural result., Although proper technique is crucial to bowling fast, optimizing your body's performance through a consistent work out routine is just as important.Set aside three days a week for weight training.
Do exercises to strengthen your arms, chest, back, and legs such as bicep curls, bench presses, lat pull downs, and squats.

, You can increase your body's ability to perform over time by doing cardiovascular exercises like running or jogging.

, Because of the stresses and twists your body undergoes while bowling, having strong core muscles will help prevent injury.Perform kettle twists by sitting with both hands on one weight; twist from side to side placing the weight next to your legs on each side of your body.
Do crunches to increase abdominal strength.
Hang from a pull up bar and raise your knees toward your chest.

, Be comfortable playing on the pitch by practicing each week. Make sure you take a few days of rest each week to prevent over exerting your muscles and causing yourself injuries.

Opt for cheaper bats for beginners.,
Fall back on favored brands when in doubt.",How to Choose a Cricket Bat1," You don’t necessarily need to make your final purchase from a local store, but seek out expert advice in person when browsing bats. Visit a store that specializes in cricket so you can ask experienced staff about which bat is best for your personal needs. Keep in mind that the best reviewed cricket bats that you find online are still just pictures as far you’re concerned. You’ll want to physically handle bats beforehand to find one that feels right for you personally.Follow up with some online research after hearing recommendations. Read customer reviews, online ratings, and forum comments on particular brands and products.;
, Ask yourself what level of play you intend to engage in. If you’re looking to take part in some serious competition, prepare to invest in a quality bat that’s durable enough to stand up to constant hard-hitting use. However, if you’re just looking for some light weekend action in the backyard, don’t worry so much about getting a high-end bat.Expect bats to cost anywhere from $20 to hundreds of dollars. Obviously, a $300 bat could be a waste of money if you hardly ever use it, but constantly replacing cheaper bats due to heavy use can be just as wasteful in the long run.

, If you’re taking part in competition play, you’ll likely be using a heavy ball made of leather or polystyrene. For these, plan on getting a higher grade bat since the impact will be harder. But if you’re just knocking around a rubber ball or tennis ball, save your money and look for a bat designed for casual use with lighter balls., If you’ve never played cricket before, hold off on purchasing a top-of-the-line bat for now, even if you intend on playing full-time. Expect the design of one bat to favor a certain style of play over another. Wait to see what type of player you develop into before investing in expensive equipment. For now, content yourself with something cheaper that will serve for the time being.This is especially true for kids. As they continue to develop physically, they will need new, larger bats to match their size, regardless of how much life is left in their old bat.

When gripping the ball to throw a fast ball, the joints of your fingers should wrap around the contour of the ball to hold it away from the palm of your hand.Don’t let the yorker’s reputation as a difficult throw put you on edge. Relax. Take a few breaths. A smooth, consistent throw will improve accuracy.;
, Really narrow your focus on a feature somewhere around the batsman. Fix your gaze on the crease line or the base of one of the stumps. You might even find it useful to focus on a feature of the batsman, like their toes. Lock your eyes here for the duration of your delivery.By training yourself to focus on a particular point, you’ll limit variables that could affect your delivery. This will allow you to devote more attention to other areas, like form.
An ideal yorker will land as close to the batsman as possible while still bouncing before crossing the crease.Envision yourself completing this throw to improve accuracy., Slowing things down a bit might be just what you need to nail your target. But the opposite can also be true. Try a slower and quicker than normal pace for your run up when bowling a yorker. Test each to see which works best for you.In some cases, your normal bowling speed might be your most accurate pace. Accuracy is everything when bowling a yorker., The motion for throwing a yorker is much the same as a normal fast throw, but the shoulder of your bowling arm is especially crucial when delivering a yorker. While delivering, drive your shoulder in the direction of the bottom of the stumps.

Driving with your shoulder will improve the fullness and speed of your yorker. Take time to practice this motion intentionally., Try to get as close to the batsman as possible. Ideally, the ball will land right before the batsman’s feet. This provides little time for him to dig out the ball and hit it into play.

Place your feet so you are well balanced at the moment of release. Doing so will have a positive effect on your accuracy., Small adjustments can make a world of difference.

Bend your elbow.",How to Bowl in Cricket," A worn cricket ball will have a rough side and a smooth side, separated by a seam. Depending on velocity and rotation, this difference in surface texture will cause the ball to ""swing"" through the air from one side to the other.


If bowled at velocities over 70 miles-per-hour, the ball will swing toward the smooth side of the ball.
If bowled below 70 miles-per-hour, the ball will swing toward the rough side of the ball.;
, Bowled with this grip, the seam will force the ball to bounce in a certain direction. When bowled from the right hand, the ball will bounce to the bowlers left. To the right, when thrown from the left hand.


Cricket balls that are new may have very little difference between the smooth and rough sides. This makes them less prone to ""swing"" through the air when bowled.

, When bowled from the right hand, the ball will strike the ground on the left side of the seam and will bounce away from a right-handed batter's ""off side.""

, If you keep your middle finger closer to your index finger you will be able to bowl with more velocity, however, it will be more difficult to bowl with control.


Depending on your release, you may benefit from a different middle finger position. Experiment to see what your prefer.

, When you do so, there should be very little, if any, contact between the ball and these fingers.To throw a leg cutter, place your middle finger on the seam and allow your index finger to rest on the right side of the ball.This slight variation in angle will cause the ball to hit the ground on the opposite side of the seam, forcing it to bounce the other direction (toward the ""off side"" of a right-handed batter)., You should resemble a waiter or waitress carrying a platter of food.

, As make your approach, turn from the waist so that your bowling shoulder is behind you.Be sure to keep your weight back once your twist your body.


You will generate more energy and velocity the better you can learn to shift your weight.
If you shift too early it will affect the speed of your ""run-up.""

, Once you begin to drop your elbow, allow your bowling arm to fall to your side. Your weight should still be shifted and your body should still be coiled.

, When you plant your lead foot, straighten your elbow and allow your hand to swing down toward the ground. This will straighten your bowling arm.


Make sure you plant your lead foot so that it points toward the batter.

,, When you plant your lead foot, imagine that your body is a whip and begin to thrust your shoulder forward as soon as you feel your momentum begin to carry you.


Shifting your weight properly will generate momentum.

, Keeping your elbow straight, rotate your arm behind you and swing it over-the-top toward the batter.


Throws are illegal in cricket. If you bend your arm and lead with the elbow it will count as a throw.
The shoulder must be the body part through which power is generated.
Umpires will call a ""no ball"" when a player throws or ""chucks.""

,


Snapping your wrist also prevents you from releasing the ball too late, which is often times the result of a player compensating for an improper angle of release.
Overtime, a late release can result in excessive stress and/or injury to the bowling shoulder.

, When your hand reaches the peak of your delivery arc, release the ball and allow it to roll off the tips of your index and middle fingers.Remember to keep your arm straight so that you do not suffer any elbow injuries, or illegally ""throw"" the ball.


Because of its weight, a cricket ball can cause injury to the elbow if it is ""thrown"" or bowled incorrectly.

, After your release the ball, fold your bowling arm into your chest and relax your elbow., As you bend your elbow, relax your forearm and hand, allowing your arm to wrap around your waist or stomach.

Check which type of wood is used.,
Count the grains.,
Inspect the handle.,
Check for obvious damage or defects.",How to Choose a Cricket Bat2," Expect most if not all bats to be made of wood. However, don’t treat all wood as the same. Favor willow over pine unless you’re a very casual player, since pine tends to be cheapest because it has less spring when it comes into contact with the ball. With willow bats, choose between:English willow, which is regarded as the best material because it’s the most springy. Because of this, it tends to be the most expensive. These bats are ideal for serious competitive players.
Kashmir willow, which is less springy than English willow, but more so than pine. It is also highly durable, which makes it a good in-between choice. It is also ideal for beginners and power hitters.

, Inspect the face of each blade. Count the number of grain lines you see running from top to bottom. View these as an indicator of the bat’s playability and durability. Expect some trade-off between the two, with more grains equalling better performance but less longevity, and vice versa. Favor bats with six to ten grain lines. Additionally:Favor bats with consistent spacing in between each pair of grain lines.
Make sure the grain’s profile on the back of your bat matches the profile on its face.

, First, make sure the handle is centered with the blade. Then hold the bat by its handle. Make sure it’s thin enough for you to hold comfortably and securely. Favor bats with rubber grips over the handle for extra control.Additionally, consider handles that have been reinforced with titanium, which adds more power and control.Off-centered handles will make the blade’s weight feel awkward and uneven in your grip.
Bare handles are more prone to twisting and slipping in your hands, especially when you sweat.

, Make sure the bat doesn't show signs of splitting along the grain. Also inspect the face and edges for any nicks, dents, or other surface flaws. Expect these to interfere with the ball's normal action if struck at these points.This should certainly be done before you purchase a bat, as well as before each use.

Choose a size recommended for your height.,
Look for the “sweet spot.” If you already have experience playing cricket, think of where along the bat you tend to hit the ball the most.,
Feel the weight.,
Go with “pre-treated” bats if you’re a beginner.",How to Choose a Cricket Bat3," Expect less control over the bat if you go with one that is too long or short for your build. Follow guidelines regarding a bat’s appropriate length and width for your height. Do so even if you’re a younger player who hasn’t finished growing, since picking a bat for your future self will negatively affect your performance in the here and now.Search online for sizing charts, such as this one: http://www.desisport.com/how-to-choose-your-cricket-bat


, As you inspect each new bat, examine its blade, because shapes vary from one bat to the next. Locate each blade’s “sweet spot,” which is wherever it is thickest. Choose a bat whose sweet spot is located wherever you strike the ball most often. This will translate to more durability and power during play.If you’re a beginner, favor bats that are thickest in the middle for the best coverage. As you develop as a player, take note of exactly where along the bat you tend to favor when hitting the ball for future reference.

, Take the bat in your hands and simulate gameplay to judge how the bat’s weight feels in motion. Take test swings and practice pick-ups to make sure it responds quickly when you need to react fast. Hold the bat out on arm’s length with your weaker hand to see if it tires you too soon. Also keep in mind that:The location of the blade’s “sweet spot” will affect how the weight feels in your hand. Lower sweet spots will make the bat feel more bottom-heavy, while higher sweet spots will do the opposite.This is why it’s so important to visit a brick-and-mortar store, since an online description of a bat’s weight alone won’t inform you how a bat will actually feel in your hand.

, Don’t expect all bats to be ready for immediate use. Know that bats can crack in play without prior treatment or “knocking in.” If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, limit your search to bats that have already received this treatment and are ready for immediate play.“Knocking in” refers to a process of lightly striking the wood with a bat mallet or leather ball. This strengthens the wood by compressing it.
However, be aware that too much “knocking in” can damage the bat. If you’re unsure of how to safely do it, go with a pre-treated bat as well.

Bowl a yorker towards the end of close games.,
Use a variety of throws so opponents are unprepared for a yorker.,
Save yorkers for when you feel confident.",How to Bowl a Yorker2," The yorker can give you an advantage in a pivotal moment. Delivering a yorker properly lands it on the batsman’s feet. Batsmen have practically no time to react to this kind of throw and dig out the ball., Remember, the yorker is your ace-in-the-hole. If your opponents are on guard for your yorker from the start, it could cost you later on when you need it the most.Using a variety of throws has the added bonus of improving your odds of a successful throw.
To improve variety, you might try bowling inswingers, outswingers, and throwing balls with offspin.

, Especially during a big game, you might want to hold off on attempting a yorker until you’re well-practiced and confident in your ability. Nerves could turn your yorker delivery into an easy hit if you’re not careful. "

Drill yorkers toward the end of practice.,
Perfect your speed and delivery.",How to Bowl a Yorker3," It’s easy to over practice bowling and strain your arm, so break frequently and allow your arm time to recover in between practice sessions. To keep yourself from overdoing it, try practicing with the following maximum limits:

Players age 10 to 13: 12 yorkers/practice
Players age 14 to 15: 14 yorkers/practice
Players over 16: 20 yorkers/practice, Yorkers are most commonly bowled at the end of games, so you may be tired in the moment you need to bowl a yorker the most. To give yourself the best chances of delivering a perfect yorker in tired-out condition, save yorker drills for the end of practice.

Encourage yourself when practicing yorkers by rewarding yourself with one fewer lap run at the end of practice for every good yorker thrown., Try to start and end your run-up in the same position every time. When you take your final bound, keep it consistent and controlled. Have you tried snapping your wrist when you release the ball? This can add some heat to your yorker."

To bowl a flipper, you must hold the ball as you would normally, but you must also have your thumb on the side.",How to Bowl the Leg Spinner's Variations," As you bowl, you bring your elbow close to your head and cock your wrist so that back of your hand faces the batsman. You spin the ball by rotating the fingers. If done properly, the ball should turn from off to leg for right handers. If the batsman comes out of his crease and misses the googly, he can be stumped.;
, Bowl it as you would a googly, but don't cock you wrist during the action. This should impart forward spin that will cause the ball to dip later and bounce higher.

, Bowl normally. This should impart backwards spin and should feel like a horribly failed leg break. If bowled properly, however, the ball will dip earlier and keep lower to the ground.

, Instead of rotating your fingers and wrist to give it spin, you pinch it out between your index finger, middle finger, and thumb, kind of like trying to squeeze it. The flipper will come out faster than a leg break, won't spin, and will keep close to the ground.

Select a relatively young ball.,
Choose one side of the ball to polish.,
Apply spit or sweat to the polished side.,
Inform your teammates as to which side is which to ensure consistency.,
Keep the primary seam vertical.,
Hold the ball with the polished side facing the batsman, or their “leg side.” The aim of the out swing is to force the batsman to strike the ball away from his body, on his “off side.” Since the ball will swing in the direction of its rough side, grip the ball with the rough half facing the batsman’s off side.,
Grip the ball with your thumb along the seam on the bottom.,
Aim the seam at your first or second slip fielder.The ball will swing wherever you aim the seam, so angling the seam away from the batsman, at a 15-20º toward the slips, will send the ball towards them instead of directly at the batsman.,
Allow plenty of distance for your run-up.,
Face your target.,
Balance your run.,
Increase your strides as you near the batsman.Angle slightly toward their leg side as you approach the stump.,
Bowl close to the stump.Once thrown, the ball should ideally begin to swing late in its delivery.Decrease the distance between yourself and the batsman before you bowl to ensure that the ball doesn’t swing too soon.

Release the ball.",How to Bowl an Outswinger in Cricket," Aerodynamics play a crucial role in swing bowls, and the longer a ball has been in use, the more its surface changes over time. Balls that have been in use for 20 years or more tend to effect a “reverse swing,” which means that the technique used to pitch a natural outswinger may result in an inswinger instead., The primary seam of a cricket ball runs along the ball’s center, creating two halves. Polishing one half will decrease air resistance on that side, causing the ball to swing in the direction of its other, rougher side when thrown., Rub it in with your trousers. Repeat frequently throughout the game, in between each delivery., Encourage them to shine the ball further while it’s in their possession during the match., Face it forward from your grip.,, Spread your index and middle fingers slightly apart from each other along the seam on top.,, More distance will allow you to build momentum for a powerful delivery.

, Your body’s momentum will instinctively follow the direction in which your head is aimed. Hold your head steady with your eyes fixed on your target., Speed alone can deliver a powerful bowl, but a steady rhythm helps, too.Keep your speed consistent and your motions fluid, balanced, and relaxed.,,, Aim at either the stump itself or very close to it., Keep it high at first. Then, as you bowl, pull it straight down, close to your body. This will keep the front of your body clear for your bowling arm to follow through after the ball’s release., Pitch it while your bowling arm is still high. Follow through by bringing your bowling arm down across your body so that your fingers touch your other armpit."

Place your fingers across the seam.,
Cock your wrist.",How to Bowl Leg Spin2," Hold your first two fingers up, and your last two fingers down. Your thumb, first finger, and middle finger should be straight, with your ring and little finger bent down.

, Your first finger, middle finger, and thumb should be curved around the ball. The side of the ball should rest on the bent side of your middle finger. Try to hold the ball softly. If you hold it tightly, your control will be damaged., When you go to release the ball, your arm will be straight, and your wrist should be fully bent at your side. You don't want to bend it too hard as you want to keep flexibility."

Remember that line and length is important.",How to Bowl Leg Spin3," At first, your body should not be facing forward, but turned to the side. This position allows you to twist your body so you can gain momentum when you go to throw the ball., Right before you bowl the ball with your bowling arm, lift your front arm up high, and swing it down while you swing your bowling arm around. This will help your bowling arm gain speed as you raise your arm to bowl the ball.

, As your lift your elbow and shoulder up, you will turn your body toward the front by bringing your back foot around, and stepping forward.

, Your bowling arm will swing around by going back and up over your head toward the front. You will need to use your whole arm and shoulder to perfect this motion.

, As you do this, you should unbend your wrist by flicking it over, and straightening your fingers. Allow your third finger to generate an anti-clockwise spin.Your arm will be extended in front of you when the ball releases. The ball will release from the back of your hand near your third finger.

Make sure that you angle the shiny half of the ball away from the batsman. The rough side needs to face the direction you want to swing it.;
, The run up is the preparation a bowler makes for delivery as he builds momentum and approaches the crease, which is demarcated by a painted line. Run quickly toward the line to create the maximum amount of momentum possible, while still allowing you to stay in control of your ball, body, and posture. Front-on bowling often uses a high speed run up.Swing bowling is a type of pace bowling, and in this type of bowling, the run up has been shown to contribute almost 20% of the ball’s velocity. It's important to run quickly.In cricket, the length of your run up is a personal part of the game. Many great cricket players have different approaches to the run up, approaching from different distances and angles. Practice to figure out what feels most natural.
As you are running and when you land, keep your weight in the balls of your feet.This will increase your speed and give you great control over your movements.
When you are running, utilize your back. Before you reach the crease, bend backwards so that you will be able to create a stronger forward momentum at the moment of delivery.

, During the run up, the delivery stride begins three or four strides before the crease. In these final few steps, acceleration stops, and your pace should remain steady. Your footwork is an important part of creating a smooth delivery.


As a front-on bowler, in the very last step before you deliver the ball, land with both your feet pointed toward the wicket, in other words, in the direction the ball will travel.
Though both your feet are pointed in the same direction, your dominant foot should be positioned in the back, to give you leverage when you release. Usually, right-handed bowlers use their right foot as the back foot.

, Like your footwork, your body positioning is an important aspect of successful delivery. As a front-on bowler, you will look down the inside of your bowling arm to sight the target. Place your non-bowling arm to the side of your head.


Your hips and shoulders should be open wider than 180 degrees.
Usually, the non-bowling arm is held vertically right before the delivery motion.

, After you reach the crease, it’s time to deliver the ball. At the point of release, you will be directly facing the batsman.


Make sure your delivery arm is stiff, rather than bent. You want to maintain a relaxed wrist but keep the position of your grip.
Release the ball at the highest possible point for maximum swing. Use the downward motion of your non-bowling arm to create additional power.
Run through the crease. Many front-on bowlers continue through the crease after they release the ball. This allows for a stronger release and a continuity of movement.

, This is especially important if you plan to stand up to the stumps for fast bowlers

, Both of these activities will improve your stamina, as well as footwork and coordination.

, No matter what happens, never take your eyes off the ball. Start observing the ball when the bowler starts his running. Keep your concentration completely focused on the ball.

, Successful wicket keepers will need to have good slanted postures in order to react faster when facing fast bowlers. As the bowler comes closer towards the non-striking stumps, wicket keepers, at this point, will be in a catching position. At the starting position, the palm of the wicket keeper's hand will be facing towards the bowler, their fingers pointing down onto the ground and their heads watching the ball.

, You must be able to judge the pace and turns of the ball. Good catching skills are essential to get a catch or stop the ball from reaching the boundary.

, This will come in handy, especially for fast bowlers. It is important for receiving the ball away from the body, especially swingers.

, Don't be lazy. Wicket keeping is like meditation. Its an exercise for your mind and brain. Practice with a mate and get him or her to throw ball for you.

, This helps you to keep to balls that stay low without giving away byes.


When crouching, always make sure to catch the ball below your eye level.

, A wicket keeper is the workhorse of a fielding team. Without a good wicket keeper, keeping opposition tight with a chase-able score is unbelievably difficult. If you are a wicket keeper, then you are the main part of fielding department of your team.

, A wild wide delivery wasn't what the bowler had in mind, use your anticipation, concentration and the hunger to stop the runs and nothing will go past you.

, Since wicket keeping is the most important job on the field, you should not let anything get you down, not even a dropped catch. Fielders mostly take after the wicket keeper's reactions, so it's very important to always keep up your energy levels and cheer the guys on.


Avoid getting too loud. A cheerful, loud and aggressive keeper will rub off onto the rest of the team. It isn't easy to bat when you have a foghorn going off between deliveries. A simple ""come on"" or shouting the bowler's pet name will be sufficient.

, Always keep believe in yourself. Never think, ""I can't handle it"". Always think, ""The ball is mine, it's for my keeping gloves"".

, The main thing for a wicket keeper is concentration. Always try to be cool before your match. Try to avoid fighting, yelling etc. Stay calm, collected and seem like the wise one on the field.

, Although you may be keeping wicket beautifully, you must also have a good hand on the bat. Thus, if you want to become an all-round useful wicketkeeper for your team, concentrate on your batting. If you get some important runs, this will build your confidence levels.

, Just keeping the ball straight through (without touching bat) is not your main job. You've to be ready for the edge. Don't be so nervous, think every ball that, ""There will be an edge"", no matter whether there is or not.

, This will broaden your knowledge. Include books written about great wicket-keepers of the past. You might pick up a tip or two.

Position your body.,
Deliver the ball.",How to Bowl a Successful Inswinger2," As a side-on bowler, hold the seam at an angle. It should point toward the fine leg position in the field.


Your top two fingers should rest close together on the top of the ball with your middle finger directly on the seam. Your thumb should rest on the bottom of the ball at the seam.
Position the shiny side of the cricket ball away from the batsman.

, The run up is the period of running prior to release at the crease, which is a white line marked on the field. In cricket, the run up is essential in creating the velocity of the ball, and in turn, performing an outstanding Inswinger.


Every bowler approaches run ups differently, and there is no determined right or wrong length for a run up. Practice running up from different distances and angles to see what feels most natural.
The length of the run up depends on how long you need to achieve your maximum force without losing control over your form.
In general, side-on bowlers tend to favor a slower run up speed.

, The last few paces before you reach the crease are the delivery stride. In this stride, you should seek to maintain your speed without accelerating. As you reach the crease, the positioning of your feet is important.


As a side-on bowler, your feet should stop parallel to the crease. You should maintain a comfortable width between them.
At the moment of delivery, you should transfer your weight from your back foot to your front foot. For a right-handed bowler, the back foot is usually the right foot.
The majority of your weight, during the run up and when you land, should be in the balls of your feet. This will assure you have maximum control over your movements.

, The way you set up your posture during delivery can make or break your Inswinger. As a side-on bowler, in the last step before you release the ball, you should turn your body so that your left shoulder points toward the batsman. To align your shoulders with your hips, your non-bowling arm should be in front of your head.


Usually, the non-bowling arm is held vertically before the release of the ball. Keep the ball in your bowling hand close to your head.
Rotate the front arm high, and sight your target on the outside of your front arm.

, In this moment, you want to make sure you release the ball from the highest vantage point that you can.


Make sure your delivery arm is stiff rather than bent. You want to maintain a relaxed wrist but keep the position of your grip.
To create this movement, use both of your arms. The movement should look like the beginning of a cartwheel.
When you are transitioning your weight onto your front foot, engage your whole body. Use the bend in your back to create additional momentum.

"
Keep your ball in great condition.,
Play with the length of your run up.,
Practice alone.,
Build your general strength.",How to Bowl a Successful Inswinger3," When bowling an Inswinger, it’s important to make sure you have a good ball.


Shine your ball after every bowl. Use your saliva or sweat on the shiny side of the ball, and then polish it on your clothes. Make sure you don’t get other substances on the ball, like sunscreen, as this can ruin the leather.
Shining the ball helps it to swing effectively because the smoother side lets air flow around it more easily than the rougher side, and so it creates a better swing., It can take time to find the run up that feels the most comfortable for you. Take some time to do drills, and try different techniques.Give yourself time to create a habit.


Enlist the help of a friend or coach. In a field or even in your yard, mark out a starting point for your practice run up. With ball in hand, start at this point.
With your eyes closed, run until it feels right to release the ball, but don’t actually deliver your ball. Have your friend mark where you stop. Repeat this around 15 times until a pattern begins to emerge. Count the number of strides it takes you to get to the point at which you have been stopping.
This exercise will help you determine a run up that is natural for you.

, You don’t need a coach or team to practice your Inswinger technique.


Try setting up a simple stake in the ground, made from a branch, to show you where the batsman would be.
Use a piece of rope or duct tape as the crease, so you know when to deliver the ball and can practice your run up properly.

, Like any sport, being a skilled cricket player requires a level of athleticism.


Work on your arm strength by doing simple weight lifts and push-ups every other day.
Make sure you keep up your cardiovascular strength by running moderate distances. This will help to improve your stamina.
Utilizing a handgrip strengthener can help improve your grip on the ball.
Maintaining your basic fitness will give you greater control over your game.

If you have friends that play regularly, ask them to explain the rules to you. Alternatively, watch professional games online or on TV to become familiar with the rules of cricket. Some alternative methods include:


Watching informative videos online
Getting a hands-on lesson by playing with a group of friends;
, First, purchase well-fitting cleats that will help you run faster. Next, purchase appropriate clothing. If you join a more serious team later, you may need to purchase a uniform. In the meantime, wear a polo t-shirt and long white trousers. Depending on your playing position, you may also need to purchase safety gear, including:


Gloves
An abdomen guard
A helmet
Shin guards
Batsman gloves, Many teams and clubs provide cricket equipment for you. However, if you play with friends recreationally or start a team, you will need to purchase your own gear. You will need:


Six stumps, or long white poles
Four bails that will rest on the poles
Two cricket bats
One red cricket ball., The easiest way to play cricket recreationally is to join a local cricket team hosted by your school or local community center. These teams will have equipment, playing fields, and certified referees. Alternatively, host your own cricket games with some friends to become a cricket player. However, you may have to bend the rules to accommodate your situation. For example:


If you don’t have enough players to populate two teams, you may have to play a variety of positions throughout the game.
If you don’t have the funds for cricket equipment, you may have to do without specialized safety gear.
It may be difficult to find referees, especially if none of your friends volunteer for the position.

, The more you practice, the better you’ll get. The average professional cricket player only has five weeks off per year.That means that they’re training hard during the other forty-eight weeks of the year. If you want to be competitive, you have to train whenever you can. For example:


Spend your weekends playing cricket with your team or with friends.
Instead of watching TV when you get home from work, go for a run outside.
Throw a ball around with your coworkers during your lunch break.

, Utilizing a coach is expensive and time consuming. However, a coach will be able to help you improve faster than you ever could on your own.The more time you spend one-on-one with a coach, the better your cricket game will be. To find a coach:


Ask your friends if they know any good coaches.
Do an online search for trainers in your area.
Ask around at a cricket event.
Look for postings at your local cricket club.

, Watch pro cricket games whenever you get the chance, whether it’s in person, on television, or online. While you watch, examine the different techniques that your favorite players use. Do your best to absorb as much information as you can. Ask yourself:


How do they react under pressure?
How to they interact with their team mates?
What techniques set them apart from their teammates?
How might you reenact those techniques?

, Make an effort to become friends with the most experienced members of your club or team. Ask them for advice on improving your cricket game. If you go see a cricket game, stick around after the match ends and try to meet the players. Ask the players if they have any tips for a budding cricket enthusiast.If an experienced player gives you advice, follow it. There’s no point in asking for advice if you’re not going to take it.
Don’t let your feelings get hurt. If an experienced player gives you harsh criticism, see it as an opportunity for improvement.

, A valuable player is good in many different roles. However, if you want to get noticed, you need to specialize your training to become noteworthy. To do so, base the core of your training around the repeated movements your position requires.For example:


If you’re a bowler, practice throwing the ball.
If you’re a wicket keeper, practice rising from a crouch quickly and catching the ball.
If you’re a batsman, practice hitting the ball.

, This can mean a school team, a semi-professional team, an inter-collegiate team, or a regional team.A competitive team participates in tournaments within their region. These teams will give you important training and help you get noticed by recruiters.


You may have to try out for a spot on these teams. If so, practice hard and don’t give up! Try out as many times as you’re allowed.
Always show that you’re a good team player. Otherwise, recruiters may not want you on their team, even if you’re very talented.

, Once you’ve become competitive on a semi-professional level, start looking for open tryouts for your favorite professional teams. Make friends with recruiters and other serious cricket players to be the first to hear about these tryouts. Otherwise, search for open tryouts online or look on your favorite team’s website.


Most open tryouts are held before the start of a new season.
There will be many, many people at an open tryout. Do your best to stand apart from the crowd by being a team player and performing well.

, Do a search online or talk to your school’s guidance counselor to decide which universities give you the best opportunity to play cricket. Additionally, look at the variety of academic programs offered by each school, the housing options, and the financial aid available.These criteria will help you narrow your choices down into a short list of four to five schools.


Some schools have particular criteria for financial aid. Make sure you meet these criteria before choosing a school.
Populate the list with four or five schools instead of just one to give yourself a range of options.

, If you’re looking at schools far enough in advance, you can work hard to meet qualifications that you may not meet otherwise. For example, if the schools you like require a high grade point average, work hard in all of your classes to raise your grades. For a list of applicant qualifications, look on the university website or talk to an admission counselor. Some other examples of qualifications include:


Being involved in extracurricular activities at school
Attending any university events to meet professors and show interestDoing a lot of community service

, Before you apply anywhere, talk to an admissions counselor from each university. Explain your desire to play on the cricket team and ask them if they have any advice for you. Follow any advice they give you as best you can. Other great information to ask for includes:


Information about the tryout process for the cricket team
Whether or not the cricket coach would be willing to give you application advice
How competitive the cricket tryouts are

, Apply to each university on your list to give you the best chance of attending one. Each university have different application processes and deadlines. Therefore, visit the university website or talk to an admissions counselor for information on how to apply. Common application components include:


A cover letter
An essay describing your reasons for applying
A transcript from your previous school

, Once you’re admitted into a university, try to get onto the cricket team. Find out when tryouts are being held and attend them. Additionally, talk to the coach about playing on the team. They will be able to give you good advice about playing on the team and will remember you when you attend tryouts.


Sometimes tryouts are held before the school year begins. Find out the dates and times of the cricket team tryouts from an admissions counselor or the cricket coach.

, If you don’t make the cricket team, try again next year. In the meantime, practice cricket as often as you can to improve your game. Additionally, work hard in all of your classes to make good grades and focus on finding subjects that you enjoy. Even if you don’t make it onto the cricket team, you’ll end up with a degree from a great university!

Position your fingers.,
Keep a small gap between the ball and your palm.,
Keep a loose grip.,
Get your wrist in position.,
Line your feet, hips, and shoulders up with the target.,
Set your approach and run up at a slight angle.,
Use your non-bowling arm to steer.,
Rotate your body to the front.,
Spin your wrist and ball from right to left as you release it.",How to Bowl a Leg Break," Hold the ball between your index and middle fingers. Slot the ball between these fingers, so they’re split wide but comfortably and the seam runs between them horizontally. Bend your ring and little fingers, so the inside of your ring finger touches against the side of the ball. Your little finger should rest along your ring finger.“Two fingers down and two fingers up” is a quick way to remember the grip. Your index and middle fingers are straight and point “up,” while your ring and little fingers are bent and point “down.”;
, Make sure there is space between your palm and the ball. If it is pushed too far into your palm, then you won’t have the leverage you need to properly spin it. Your wrist and middle finger will do all of the work., Holding the ball too tight also prevents you from getting the right leverage and from controlling the spin. Let it gently rest between your middle and index fingers, with your thumb held close to the index finger but off the ball. Your whole hand will give the ball motion, but only these contact points will give it rotation and curve. Keeping your grip loose allows for more freedom of motion when you spin it., Bend your wrist at a 90-degree angle to prepare your delivery, so that if you put your arm straight down and flat at your side, the palm of your hand (and the ball) face upwards. Holding your wrist at this angle will allow you to quickly rotate the ball from right to left when you release it. Remember that the leg break’s rotation comes from the motion of the wrist and middle finger, so set your wrist so you’ll be able to cock it correctly., Aligning the left side of your body with your target. This will help you aim and control your approach. It will also allow you to gather momentum when you rotate your body when you throw the ball., Get your stance ready for your approach. Your run up cannot too straight nor too angled. Either extreme will prevent you from rotating the ball properly and from using your non-bowling arm for momentum.

, Right before you bowl, lift and slice your non-bowling arm down hard in front of you. Use your arm and the left side of your body to give you more momentum. Let this motion draw your bowling shoulder forward., Use the left side of your body to guide your motion. As you throw, bring your back foot around and step forward. At this point, bring your bowling arm up and over your head towards the front., The movement is generated from your middle finger as your wrist turns, so the ball makes a counter-clockwise motion upon release. If bowled correctly, the ball will bounce quickly to the left when it hits the ground (in the direction of its spin). The back of your hand facing you the whole time, and your palm ends facing downwards.Your stride should be shoulder-length apart.
You should complete your follow-through with your bowling shoulder facing the target.

Keep practicing.",How to Be a Slip Fielder," The season ball is probably one of the hardest balls in sports. In slip fielding, the ball comes towards you at very high speeds; it may even exceed 100 mph (160 km/h). It's quite easy to eliminate your fear of the season ball. As you gradually continue to play cricket, your fear of the ball will go down less and less. This really is not a big issue to worry about.;
, Slip fielders will always be crouching down and they have very strong knees. Slip fielders need to spring whenever the ball is up in the air. They rely on their knees a lot.

, Improving hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes is the most important of aspect of being a slip fielder. With the ball coming at you at great speeds, you literally have a split second before the ball comes to you. Training for this can be done with much practice

, Even when you do reach the goal of becoming of a skilled slip fielder, you must continue practicing to make sure your skills are always sharp.

,, Don't doubt yourself or your ability. You will do what you've been asked to do.

The primary difference is that in softball the ball is pitched underhand, while in baseball the ball is pitched overhand. As the name implies, there is also a difference in the balls used as well.


Softballs are larger and a bit heavier than baseballs, although they are less dense. You will often see them in shades of neon green or yellow in addition to the classic white.
Softball fields are typically smaller than baseball fields, and the games last for seven innings instead of nine.
The bats you use in softball are a little shorter and have a wider barrel than the bats used in baseball do.;
, There are two subtypes of softball, with slight differences between each. Both follow the same general rules though.


Slow pitch is typically coed, and as the name insinuates, the ball is pitched by lobbing it slowly into the air.Fast pitch is played primarily by women and has the main difference of the ball being pitched very quickly with a large wind-up.

, Each softball game is comprised of seven innings, each with two halves. The top half, or first half, is when the away team goes up to bat. The bottom half, or second half, is when the home team goes up to bat. Each half of an inning is played until the fielding team makes three outs.


The pitcher will pitch to the batter until one of three things happens.

They get three strikes, which is when they throw the ball into the strike zone and the batter doesn’t swing, or they swing and miss.
They throw four balls, which is when they make bad pitches outside the strike zone.
They walk the batter by hitting them with the ball.


To get a batter out, a pitcher can throw three strikes, or a fielder can catch a fly-ball mid-air that is hit by the batter. If a fielder catches a pop fly by the batter they are automatically out, even if it was a foul ball.
To get a runner out, the fielders are responsible for getting the ball in a timely manner. Once they have the ball, one option is to tag the runner out by physically touching them with the ball in their mitt as they run between bases. Another option is to do a forced out, which is when you throw the ball to the base which the runner is forced to run to (first base is always the safest base to throw to for this reason).
Players up to bat will go to home plate, make a hit, and attempt to run all the way around the bases back to home plate. Every time a player crosses home plate, they get one “run” or point.
At the end of the seven innings, whichever team has more runs wins the game. If there is a tie, the choice can be made to end the game at a tie or play extra innings until one of the teams scores more runs.

, When a team is fielding, each player will take a specific position on the field which they will not move from unless directed to by their coach. There are two parts of the field, infield, and outfield.


Infield is the dirt section of the field comprised of the catcher, pitcher, first base, second base, shortstop, and third base.
Outfield is the grassy section of the field and has three primary positions: left field, center field, and right field. Depending on the league or specific game, center-field may be divided into two positions: left center and right center.
Although the catcher and pitcher are infielders, they are specialized positions that require extra practice off the field. Often they will practice together separate from the rest of the team.

, Your mitt is the glove you wear to field balls when you aren’t up to bat. It is made of leather and is worn on your secondary (non-writing) hand.


If you purchase a new mitt, you will have to break it in order to remove the stiffness of fresh leather. There are several methods of doing this, including baking it in the oven with special oil, leaving it in the sun, and playing a lot of catch.
Playing in the catching position uses a special glove, so if you are interested in being a catcher consider this before purchasing.

, Softball bats are not all equal, and must be chosen to match each player’s unique size and strength. When you look for a bat, you must look at three primary factors: the length, the weight, and the style.


To find a bat that is the right length, stand up straight and hold a bat over the knob at the top. If you can hold your arm straight down (without stretching) and the bat touches the ground easily, then it is the right length for you. If you have to bend your elbow or reach, it is too long or too short.
To find a bat that is the right weight, look at the drop. The drop is the term referring to the numerical difference between the height (in inches) and weight (in ounces). The drop will range anywhere from -8 to -12. Lighter bats (near -12), are good for weak or slow batters. Heavier bats (near -8), are best for strong batters. You can also place the bat in your writing hand and hold it out straight. If the bat is completely straight in the air, and you have no problem holding it, then it is the right weight for you.
There are two main types of softball bats available, aluminum or composite. Both are great for beginners or pros, but aluminum is typically used the most. These are also available in single or double walled. Single walled are cheaper but slightly less effective than double walled bats. Composite bats will have the ball go farther, but they can crack easily in cold weather, Playing softball, especially fast pitch, can be very dangerous if you don’t take the correct safety precautions. Most leagues require all batters to use a caged batting helmet, but even if they don’t it is best to always wear one when you are up to bat.

, Cleats are used in most sports, and are good for giving you better grip while running between bases or on the field. For softball, purchase cleats with a plastic or rubber bottom. Metal cleats are often outlawed in softball leagues, as they pose a danger to players who slide or fall on them. Make sure they fit you well.

, These include batting gloves, which aid in removing the sting of batting and giving better grip, and specialized clothing and uniforms. If you are a catcher, you will also have to purchase the required catching gear including a chest plate and shin guards.

, When you’re up to bat, it is not enough to just stand at the plate. There are a few very important batting stance tips to keep in mind every time you go up to hit.


Keep your feet shoulder-width apart and even. Don’t stagger your feet so one is further back or forward than the other.
Bend your knees and lean forward on your feet into the “ready position.” Your back should not be going straight up and down, but should have a slight forward tilt.
Put your weight on your back foot. When you swing, you will push off using your back leg to give you power.
Back the appropriate distance from the plate. To know how far you should be, stick your bat straight out in front of you perpendicular to your body, as if you were in full-swing. Back up or move closer to the plate so that the barrel of the bat is centered over the plate.

, When you pick up the bat, you should be holding the rubber grip near the end. Your hands should never rest against the base of the bat or touch the metal at the top, but should rest somewhere between the two.


Line up your knuckles on the handle of the bat, and make sure your hands are touching together.
When you hold the bat up, it should never be pointed directly up, down, or horizontal in the air. instead, hold it at a slight angle upwards past your shoulder.
Make sure you are holding the bat far enough back, with your hands parallel to your ear.

, make sure you are still in the right position, with the bat held properly above and behind you and your knees bent.

, When you swing, keep your bat level and avoid reaching for the ball. Always wait for a good pitch, as swinging at a ball can either give you a strike if you miss or a bad hit if you make contact.


When you swing, remember to do so “shoulder to shoulder.” This means that your chin starts out directly above or resting on your dominant shoulder, and you swing all the way around so that it ends on your opposite shoulder.
Swing hard with a strong follow-through. When you hit the ball, don’t drop the bat as soon as you make contact, as you will lose half of your power. Use all your strength and swing the bat all the way around your body.
Move your feet. Some batters prefer to take a small step with their front foot, but the back foot should always stay on the ground. Instead of stepping forward with the back foot, use the “squish the bug” technique. This is when you pivot on the ball of your back foot as if you were squishing a bug with it.
Rotate your body with the swing. Good batters avoid stiffness by moving their torso slightly in time with their arms and feet. This will help to add power to your swing.
Keep your eye on the ball. Never look up into the field or at other players when you are swinging. Instead, always keep your eye on the ball to guarantee contact.
Once you hit the ball, don’t throw the bat. Instead, drop it as softly as possibly outside the baseline so that nobody trips over it.

, Your goal is always to make it on base, so take every opportunity you can to expedite the process of getting there.


As soon as you finish your swing, regardless of whether it is a foul ball or fair, always take a few quick, shuffling steps towards first.
Don’t stand around to watch and see where your ball went. Always run as hard as you can to first base; if you are out or it was a foul, the first base coach will tell you and direct you to where you should be.

, Injuring your arm is easy to do if you don’t warm-up the muscles first.

, Although often it is easy to get overly ambitious and want to start throwing at 100 feet (30.5 m) away from your target, this is definitely not what you want to do. Throwing too far away to start can increase the likelihood of you injuring yourself and nearly guarantee poor throws.


Start throwing at ten feet from your target. Although this may seem very close, as your arm gets used to throwing you will slowly back away.
To start out very basic, practice this by kneeling and holding your throwing elbow in place. This will force you to practice the correct motion your wrist should be making in all throws. After doing this for a while, you can progress to standing.
After every twenty or so throws, you can begin to take steps further away from your target. Never back away further than what you are comfortable with to start, and avoid backing away too far.

, You want to start your throw with your throwing shoulder facing away from your target. You will likely be standing perpendicular to your line of throw when you start.


Your feet should be shoulder width apart, and not staggered.
To start a throw, you will probably want to hold the ball inside your mitt near your chest. Keep a grip on the ball while it is sitting in the glove though.

, The best way to hold the ball is with your fingertips laying over one set of the seams.

, You will drop your arm down and back, and then bring it up and around past your head to throw.


Avoid drawing your elbow straight back as if you were pulling a slingshot or bow and arrow. This will limit the power of your throw, and make it harder to give a lot of distance to it.
Don’t worry about dropping your throwing arm all the way down your side before bring it back and around. You wind up your arm to aid in using the torque of your body to make the toss.

, If you are playing catch, your target should always be your partner’s chest. This goes for mid-game as well.

, Bring your throwing arm down and back, and then around past the top of your head. Release the ball when your arm is fully extended in front of you, perpendicular to your body.


You should have a heavy follow-through on each throw you make. Your throwing hand should end up down the middle of your body at the end of each throw after you have released the ball. This will help prevent a sidearm from forming, and injuries to your shoulder or elbow.
Turn your shoulders and head towards your target at every throw. Be sure to maintain eye contact with your target to help direct the muscles in your body to throw towards it. Looking away will redirect the course of the ball from your target.
Take a small step with your front foot, and pivot with your back foot similar to when you are up to bat.
Use your gloved-hand to point at your target and then drop your arm to your side at each throw, if desired. Your mitt should always be at your side by the end of a throw.

, The most important part of throwing is accuracy, not speed or strength. When you are first starting, always focus on simply getting the ball to your target rather than doing it the fastest.

, When you are playing catch, it is important that your mitt be held in front of you near your chest.


Never hold your mitt so that you can see the inside of your wrist and the tip is facing down. If you catch a ball in it in this position, it could roll up and hit you in the face.
Avoid holding your mitt directly vertical, because if you don’t have a good grip on the ball it will simply fall out of your glove after you’ve caught it.
Hold the mitt wide open so that there is space for the ball to land. If your mitt is even partially closed, the ball will hit the end and fall to the ground instead of landing inside.

, If you are playing catch, the best position to be in is the “ready position,” with your knees slightly bent and your torso leaning slightly forward on the balls of your feet. This allows you to shuffle in any direction to catch a ball that doesn’t make a straight path.


Never rest your elbows on your knees in the ready position, as that blocks your legs from moving when the ball is hit or thrown.
Keeping your feet too close together will make you more susceptible to tripping and having a slow start to catch a ball in the distance.
Always be watching the ball. Softballs, contrary to what the name suggests, are very hard and painful if they hit you. Be sure you are always holding your mitt at the ready to catch a stray ball in your direction.

, The best way to practice catching is to simply play catch. Practice throwing a ball back and forth, while being in the ready position and holding your mitt the correct way.


To start, have balls thrown towards your chest. This is the most basic catching practice and will help you to warm up.
Squeeze the ball in your mitt every time you make a catch to keep it from rolling or falling out of your glove.
Have your partner throw balls softly to start before making strong throws. This will help you get used to the contact and grip necessary to catch the ball.

, Grounders are any ball that is hit or thrown that rolls across the ground to you. Because they aren’t in the air, a different method is needed to catch them.


Get in the ready position, but instead of holding your glove to your chest, hold it to the ground. The tip should touch the dirt or grass to prevent the ball from rolling under it.
Be ready to shuffle to either side, as rocks and oddly shaped clods of grass can cause the ball to make a last-second change in direction.
Although your glove should be open towards the ball with the tip at the ground, don’t hold your mitt so that the ball could roll and hit you in the face. Keep it at a slight angle to prevent this.
Always stand up after catching a grounder to make a throw. Don’t try to make a throw from your position near the ground.

, A pop-fly is a ball that is hit high in the air and must be caught coming from above. These can be dangerous if you don’t know how to catch them, because they can fall and injure you very easily.


Hold your mitt near your face instead of your chest. However, avoid holding your glove high in the air as that gives you less control of it.
Stay in the ready position and shuffle from side to side to catch the ball. Never run backwards; instead, turn sideways and shuffle towards it’s projected landing spot.
Never reach for the ball, instead position yourself underneath it so that you catch it directly in front of you. Reaching for it will increase the likelihood of the ball bouncing off the tip of your glove or of you dropping it soon after catching it.
Block out the sun with your glove before making a catch to help you to see where the ball will fall.
Bring the ball back to your chest before taking it to make a throw. This will help you to realign your body into the correct throwing position.

Know the boundary line between you and short stop.",How to Play Second Base in Fast Pitch Softball," Since this is infield a 12 inch (30.5 cm) should be just fine. A broken in glove is best.;
, This is your starting position. From here, you can move to cover first or second base, and you're filling the space in between so that you can get any balls hit there.


If you have a left handed batter, take a small step closer to 1st, not more than a few steps though.
If there is a runner on first, step a little to second base. More than likely you will get a throw, and it's faster to run to second when you're closer to the base.

, Prepare for every possible situation. Know where to throw the ball if it comes to you, and what base to cover if it doesn't. Talk to your teammates so that you all know where to play the ball.

, Always know where the runners are. Try to get the lead runner. They have a better chance of scoring, and getting them out first will make it easier to get future runners. If you are not sure where to play, throw to first. That is your best bet.

, This gives you a chance to warn the catcher or the player if the runner tries to steal. This can help them respond faster when the runner starts running.

, Stay on your toes, ready to move any direction at any moment. Always keep an eye on the batter and the ball. Be ready for anything that comes your way.

, Playing is all about having fun. Don't give off negative attitude. It boosts your spirit and friendship with the other team and also makes the rest of the players on yours and the others team happier and spirit lifted. Encourage your teammates and always thank the other team for a good game.

, More than likely you will receive a throw. Don't worry, shortstop will cover your position!

, Shortstop can't cover, so you have to run!

, If you cover first, the catcher,first baseman, or third baseman can throw the ball to you to get the batter out.

, Shortstop can't cover second because the have to back up third base.

, Most of the time shortstop covers second base. If there's nowhere else you're supposed to be, back her up.

, If it is hit far out in left field you cover second base. If it is far out in right field, then you are to run and be the cut off. Short stop will cover second base.

, If there is a runner, they will go on a bad throw from the catcher. If you back up the throw you could possibly throw the runner out.

, You have to remember to watch the runner and back up the throw in case the runner does run to second. Alert the pitcher when they have the ball if the runner on first is attempting to go to second because they may not be paying attention and they could throw it to second or first and possibly get the runner out.

, Just start backing up the pitcher once there is a runner on second.

, In this scenario, you don't have to tag the runner. There will be other events where you have to tag the runner.

, Think of an imaginary line from the pitcher to the actual second base. Don't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to them and they won't intrude when a grounder or pop fly is hit to you.

Grip the softball properly.,
Position your body perpendicular to your target.,
Position your throwing arm.,
Throw the ball.",How to Play Outfield in Softball1," Traditionally, softball players use what’s called the four-seam grip. This grip consists of the index, middle, and ring finger and requires you to grip the ball perpendicular to the seams, with your fingertips across the top of the “C” or horseshoe pattern. Your thumb should grip the seams on the underside of the ball below your index finger.


Always hold the softball with the tips of your fingers and avoid “palming” the ball. Palming occurs when the ball is situated too far back into your grip and results in loss of speed and control.
Holding the softball properly should result in a backspin when you release the ball. This is often referred to as “snap,” and gives you more control and better speed.;
, When you’re preparing to throw, the instep of your rear foot should directly face your target and your front foot should be aligned with your back foot. This stance puts your upper body in line with your target and results in more accurate throws.

, Your elbow should be at shoulder height and forming a right angle with your forearm in an “L” shape.


Keep your palm facing away from you as you prepare to throw to give your wrist more torque.

, Once you’re holding the ball correctly and in the right position, lead with the elbow of your glove hand while bringing your glove close to your body. Your elbow will point toward your target and your throwing arm should arc over it and release toward the target. Snap your wrist as you release the ball for extra torque and accuracy.


For longer throws into the infield, use the crow hop to gain momentum. Simply lead with your throwing-side foot, and raise your knee up high. Hop off your rear foot to help boost your knee upward. As your knee begins to drop, leave the ground entirely and repeat the process with your other foot, bringing it just as high. Make the throw as soon as your back foot lands."

, Fast bowlers tend to bowl immense pace for many overs. This requires stamina. Be sure to run long distances so you can handle bowling a lot of overs, and get faster on your sprints, so you can maintain a quick run-up.

, Before you focus on line and length, you must work on speed. You do not need to reach the fastest you can bowl, but gradually improve speed until you feel comfortable with the pace you bowl at.

, As you may realize, raw pace won't do the trick. Fast bowlers vary line and length to give batsman a hard time. Make sure the line you bowl is generally on middle stump to off stump, try not to bowl down the leg side, as most of those tend to either be hit or called for wide.

, A great fast bowler will pitch most of his deliveries good length, and will bowl the occasional yorker or bouncer to stump the batsman. Try not to bowl too short or too full, as those tend to be hit away for boundaries. However, do not always bowl good length, as the batsman may recognize where you pitch it and play attacking strokes according to where the ball will bounce.

, Fast bowlers tend to swing or cut the ball many times when they bowl. Cut is used to surprise batsman after the ball bounces. A leg cutter may be used to get the batsman caught behind or caught at slip. An off cutter is generally used to either bowl the batsman or get him LBW. Although cut is very helpful to a bowler, how a bowler swings may sometimes define him as a fast bowler. Swing the ball in and out to stump batsman where the ball is going. I cannot get very detailed with inswing and out swing for that will require a completely new article.

, As you learn and become better, you can make use of the wrist speed as a third technique. Know that the wrist plays a vital role in fast bowling. Many players use hand speed with regards of the jump.

, During the run up, do not keep your wrist straight. Instead, keep your wrist facing right upwards. At the time of release, throw the ball with help of wrist; this will add the wrist speed to the existing speed, allowing you to generate a great pace.

, Bowl certain deliveries to see how the batsman would react to them. Perhaps bowl one a little wide on off or leg to see how he would react to them. See if he'll hit short deliveries or duck. Observe how he faces swing or cut. Find out if he is defensive, attacking, or both. Know his role for the team, if they need to save a wicket, or just slog. Having knowledge of the batsman will ultimately help you to get him out.

, Part of being a bowler is keeping your cool, not matter if you have just taken a hat trick or if you've been hit for many boundaries. Don't listen to batsman taunts. Also, never let your emotions affect the way you bowl your next delivery, always keep the same face.

, Bowlers are at leisure when they bowl, they enjoy ripping one through middle stump or just realizing they bowled the perfect ball, even if it means not getting the batsman out. Bowlers love the feeling of pressure and joy if they succeed. Don't let the intensity of the game take up the pure joy it is to bowl.

, Never give up, always remember that good fast bowlers persist for hours and hours just to get it right. Whenever you are bowling (at the nets in a game) always try to bowl as fast as you can - don't worry at first that you will be a bit inconsistent as that's normal. After a while you will start generating pace and be bowling in the right areas (i.e. outside the off stump).

Get a first base glove or a regular infield glove.,
Stand about 4-5 steps in front of the base, depending on how fast you can get back to the base.,
Stand in your position, knees bent and glove in grounding position or out in front of you when the batter is in the batter's box.

,
After every hit (if the ball is not coming to you) run to the base and put your stronger foot on the white bag and reach towards the player throwing the ball at you.,
After every pitch if there is a batter on base, run back to the base and look at the catcher to expect a throw.,
Watch out for bunts.,
Take charge on pop flies.",How to Play First Base in Fast Pitch Softball," It would be great if it was already broken in.;
, Also be around two feet from the baseline.

,, Catch it and that's one out. (Remember, always put the foot opposite your catching hand on the bag. This will allow you to reach further and get that good first-baseman stretch.)

, Once the ball is in the pitcher's hand you can return to your position.

, The third baseman, pitcher, and you must run up to get the ball. If you get it, throw it to first where your second baseman should be covering. If the third baseman or pitcher gets it, duck.

, If you know that you can get the ball for sure, yell ""I GOT IT!!!!!"" loud and repeatedly. Your second baseman should back off. If you hear your second baseman yell ""got it"", back them up. If nobody says anything, well, that shouldn't happen.

Line up with the ball.,
Use two hands.,
Practice your footwork.",How to Play Outfield in Softball2," You should determine the angle of approach while watching the ball in flight. Drop back a step while you assess how you can align yourself with your future target. You may not always have time to plan ahead, but if you do, circle around the ball and move into the catch with your momentum forward and towards your target. If you need to act fast, just line up your body directly with the path of the fly ball.Remember to keep your eyes on the ball at all times. When playing outfield, it may be helpful to wear sunglasses so you don't lose a fly ball in the sun's glare.

, A good position for fielding a fly ball in the outfield is with your hands above your head and slightly in front of your throwing shoulder. Catch the ball in your glove hand and cover it with your bare hand as soon as it’s in the glove., Use drills like the zigzag to improve your speed and dexterity. Good footwork is key to effective fielding and these drills can teach you how to react to fly balls from the second they’re hit. Practicing these techniques can also improve your agility and overall fitness.The drop step is a helpful technique for fly balls that are hit longer than you anticipated. Simply drop your right or left foot behind you depending on the direction the ball is hit, and use it to pivot into the correct running position.
Run on the balls of your feet instead of using your heels. This will improve your speed and agility."

Make a safety stop.,
Make an infield stop.,
Make a do or die stop.,
Assess the infield.,
Make the throw.",How to Play Outfield in Softball3," For a “safety stop,” keep your shoulders square to the ball and assume a hurtle position with one knee on the ground. You should field the ball in front of your body in an even, balanced position. Safety stops are used primarily when the runner in the infield cannot advance or in the case of a ground ball that bounces or moves unpredictably.

, Infield stops are generally considered the go-to method for fielding ground balls that don't require any special consideration. Start by squaring your shoulders to the ball while keeping your hand and glove on the ground. Keep your body low, but don’t kneel like you’re making a safety stop.


Although your shoulders should always be square to the ball, you should never run directly at it. Keep the ball in line with your glove hand in preparation for the catch.

, When making a “do or die” stop, keep your momentum going forward and round the ball so you’re in a good position to throw. Catch the ball on your glove side and scoop it up quickly. Do-or-die stops are used when the runner has the opportunity to advance and you need to make a quick throw to the infield., Being aware of plays that could be made in the infield will affect how you prepare to make the throw. For instance, when the runner cannot advance, the primary objective is to make the stop, and you don’t need to pay as much attention to rounding the ball in preparation for a throw. If the runner can advance, field the ground ball aggressively on your glove side in preparation for the throw.A good rule of thumb to follow when assessing the infield is to throw two bases ahead of the lead runner. For example, if the lead runner is at first, throw to third., Throws from the outfield need to be strong and accurate. Keep the trajectory of the ball low as you aim for your target in the infield. It’s better to make an accurate throw that bounces a couple of times than an inaccurate, airborne toss.

Get the right kind of bat.,
Find or purchase a bat rolling machine.,
Perpendicularly roll the first section of the bat.,
Remove the bat and move to the next section.,
Roll the bat parallel.",How to Juice a Softball Bat1," Not all bats will be well suited for use in a bat rolling machine. Alloy or metal bats are not meant for rolling and won't gain much benefit. Composite bats are the best to roll and can gain a noticeable increase in performance. Make sure your bat is a composite bat before having it rolled.Rolling a bat will simulate the wear and tear that will come from regularly using your bat.
Composite bats are made from graphite and carbon layers. These bats will perform better the more you use them, allowing them to benefit from being rolled.
Aluminum and wooden bats won't benefit from being rolled.
Because rolling your bat increases its performance levels, you may have an unfair advantage over other players. This advantage is the reason that juiced bats are illegal to play with.;
, You will need to have access to a bat rolling machine in order to get the best results. Rolling a bat is an accelerated way to break the bat in and increase its performance during play. Bat rolling machines will evenly break the bat in, targeting all areas along the “sweet spot” and giving your bat a bit more power.


A bat rolling machine is a vice with three rollers. These rollers allow the bat to move while it is compressed.
There are bat rolling services that will roll your bat for you.
You can try purchasing your own bat rolling machine.

, You will begin by rolling the length of the bat first. Place the bat into the machine perpendicularly to the machine's rollers. You'll then need to turn the top lever to increase the pressure and compress the bat. Use the side lever to move the bat back and forth, compressing the bat's “sweet spot”.Insert the bat into the machine, perpendicular to the the rollers.
Start with one quarter turn of pressure.
Do around 7-10 passes for each pressure increment.
Increase the pressure on quarter turn.
Don't go any further than 1 or 1¼ turns of pressure.
Avoid getting to close to the taper or the end cap.

, Once you've rolled one section of the bat, you can move on and roll the next. You will need to roll the entire face of the bat in order to get a fully balanced roll. After you've completed rolling each area of the bat's barrel, you can move onto rolling the bat parallel to the rollers.Rotate the bat about ¼” and roll this new section.
Once the section is rolled, move to the next section on the bat.
Roll all the way around the bat and end at your starting point.

, Now that your bat has been rolled perpendicularly, you can roll it parallel to focus on areas that may have been missed. Insert the bat in the side of the rolling machine so that the rollers are hitting the area between the bat's end cap and the taper. Try to focus on this area as you work to roll the bat parallel to the rollers. Start with a quarter of a turn of pressure.
Do around four or five full rotations before increasing the pressure another quarter of a turn.
Continue until you've reached around 1 ¼ turns of pressure.

Find a softball field with a pitching mound and a home plate.,
Practice your grip.,
Work on your pitching motion.,
Begin your motion.,
If you start from behind the rubber, step forward with your right foot so that it lands on the rubber.,
In one smooth motion, step toward the plate with your left foot.,
Release the ball when your hand is at about waist level.,
Work on your ""follow-through."",
Get into a fielding stance as soon as you are done with your follow-through.",How to Pitch in Slow‐Pitch Softball," Becoming a good pitcher requires a lot of practice. Having a pitcher's mound to practice on is important only if you will pitch from one in actual games. (Lots of fields do not have mounds.) Having a home plate to throw to in practice is critical. Without it you won't know whether you're making good pitches. It also helps to have a friend or teammate act as a catcher who can double as an umpire, although you can usually tell when you've thrown a strike by noting where the pitch lands.;
, Pitchers use many different grips and hand positions in slow-pitch softball. While you are learning, it is best to use a circle grip. Grasp the ball with your thumb and index finger around the full width of the ball so that your hand almost forms a circle, as if you're holding a soda can. Place your other fingers on the ball below your index finger.

, Most right-handed pitchers begin with their right foot on the pitching rubber and their left foot either on the rubber or just to the left of it. They then take one full stride toward home plate with their left leg while simultaneously swinging their right hand (holding the softball) backward. Immediately as they plant their left foot they swing their right hand forward (underhand) toward the plate.


An alternative motion is to begin with both feet behind the pitching rubber, step forward onto the rubber with your right foot, then continue forward with your left leg as outlined above. As you gain experience, you will learn the pitching motion that works best for you, including how far apart to place your feet before you start your motion.

, Most pitchers start by holding the ball at waist level (often with the ball and their right hand inside the pocket of their glove).

, At the same time, bring your right arm straight back behind you, as if it's a pendulum hanging from your shoulder. If you start with your right foot already on the rubber, move your right arm back as you begin to lean toward the plate, preparing to step forward with your left leg.

, While you're stepping, swing your right arm forward, underhand, as if your hand is swinging on that pendulum.

, This is called the release point. You will have to experiment to see at exactly which point you should release the ball. The earlier you release, the lower the ball's flight path and the farther it will travel. The only rule here is that one of your feet must be in contact with the pitcher's rubber until you release the ball.

, Let your right arm continue upward after you let go of the ball. This helps to maintain balance and lessens arm strain.

, Be ready for a batted ball before the batter swings. The ball may be hit right back at you on a line-drive or a one-hopper, and your reflexes will have to be quick. Some pitchers quickly back up several steps after letting go of the ball so they'll have additional time to react.

First base is different from the other infield positions in several ways.,
Start by positioning yourself correctly.,
When awaiting the pitch from your pitcher, play a little deeper than the base if it's a right-handed hitter and a few steps further back for a left-handed hitter.,
When awaiting the throw from one of your infielders, as mentioned, get to the base quickly and make sure you've located the base and put your foot on it.,
If a fielder throws one that's clearly going to bounce before it gets to you, position yourself low (keeping your foot on the base) almost like a catcher, ensuring that you will block the ball and maybe even catch it in your gut.,
If a fielder throws wide of you, you'll need to make a split-second judgment call -- if you think you can stretch and reach the throw, then do so, keeping your foot on the base and reaching out, timing your stretch so that if you fall, it is just a second after you'll have caught the ball and recorded the out.,
""Scoops"" - Good first basemen make scooping low throws an art.,
If a ball is hit on the ground to you and there is no one on base, make catching it your first priority.,
If a ball is hit to you on then ground and there are runners on base, you have to consider a few things: A) if there is a force play at the other bases, you may want to consider throwing there to get multiple outs or to get the ""lead runner"" out.,
TAG & BAG - This play is best used by advanced first basemen.,
TAG & BAG Triple Play - With a similar scenario as above, except this time you have runners on first and second or the bases are loaded with no outs.,
Backing up other positions: As a first baseman, you're involved in nearly all infield plays.",How to Play First Base in Slow Pitch Softball," The largest difference is that you're involved in nearly every ball hit to an infielder. You're required to catch balls that may or may not be thrown accurately and you're expected to make difficult ""scoops"" look routine. You'll do less throwing than the other infielders but when you do throw, it won't usually be an easy play and will need to be accurate.;
, Remember that if a ground ball is hit to the second baseman, third baseman, pitcher or shortstop, they're going to be throwing it to you very soon. As soon as a ground ball is hit to someone other than you, sprint to first base and position yourself with your foot opposite your glove hand (i.e., right foot if you catch with left hand and are thus ""right-handed"" and the other way around for lefties) against the edge of the base. Do not put your foot on top of the base or you'll end up with a broken ankle when the runner spikes you.

, Remember not to stray too far from the base, though, since you'll need to be able to get there quickly. If you're left-handed, play a bit closer to the foul line since anything hit down the line will be a ""backhand"" play for you. Conversely, if you're right-handed, you can play ""off the line"" a bit more since balls hit down the line will be easier for you to snag since your glove hand will be nearer to them.

, This will entail taking your eyes off the play to find the base (you don't want to be feeling around for it with your foot). Once you're in position to catch the ball, bring your glove up and open it as wide as your hand will allow, giving your fielder a big target and confidence that you'll be catching the ball. Reach toward the fielder so that the ball is in your glove as soon as possible in case there's a close play at first.

, Remember, as long as you hold on, it's an out provided you get the ball in your hand or glove before the batter-runner reaches first base (note that trapping the ball against your gut is not yet a catch).

, If there's no way you'll be able to reach it, leave the base and stop the ball from going past you. While this isn't ideal, obviously, it will keep the runner from moving on to second or third base.

, Typically, you'll know when a ball will potentially need to be scooped, especially if you play with the same infielders for a while and get familiar with their throwing habits. If a ball is thrown your way but is low and may or may not bounce just before reaching you, position your glove with your wrist facing up and the glove wide open, with the webbing of your glove touching the dirt. It is instinct to react upwards to protect yourself, but you have to react to reach down to the dirt. Most short-hops will bounce into your glove in this scenario. Scooping the ball is something that comes with practice and a lot of playing first base.

, Yes, you'll then need to beat the runner to first base, but you need to make sure you have the ball first. Once you do, run directly to first base. Only throw to the pitcher if he is covering the base and you don't think you can make it there in time yourself.

, B) If you simply want to get outs (or if there are two outs already) and not take risks, just get the out at first and then be ready to go after any base runners who are venturing far off of other bases. C) How accurate your arm is.

, Any time you have less than two outs and a runner on first, play even with the bag in the baseline. If a grounder is hit to you field it while trying to stay in the base path. Then reach out to tag the runner trying to advance to second and then touch first base. Unassisted double play!

, Once you have executed the Tag & Bag, you can make an immediate throw to third or home. If you get the ball there before the advancing runner, the fielder will need to make a tag. If practiced and executed you will have yourself a triple play!

, However, you're involved in very few outfield plays. If a ball is hit into the outfield and there may be a play at second base, third base or home plate, be ready to back up those bases in case a throw gets loose. This is fundamental baseball/softball.

While still practicing the thing you're good at, you should set a goal for yourself on the thing you need to work on so you can get better each time. Once you accomplish that goal, set a new one. Keep that thread going, and you'll start to be better at that than the thing you used to be the best at!
, You can do this in a variety of ways from playing catch with family or a friend to hitting a balled up sock off of a tee with your bat! If you have a personalized softball at your house, you can just lay in your bed, toss it in the air, and then catch it. There are so many ways to practice at your house, you can make something up on your own!, If you're not on a softball team yet, you should try out for one. If you live in a suburban area, there should be a community softball league at the nearest park. Once you're on a team, you will usually have practice for two hours, two times a week. During that time, you should work hard!,


Watch The Ball! It might sound crazy, but the first thing is to watch the ball. You'll be able to tell if the pitch is a ball or a strike, and if you should swing or not.
Stride forward with the foot that's closest to the pitcher, and take your swing at the ball. Don't forget, keep watching the ball.

,


Pay attention. Don't stop watching the game if nothing comes to you.
Get into a ready position as the ball is being pitched. Keep your glove down and be able to move from side to side very quickly.

,


Use two hands if a grounder is coming to you. This means have your glove down on the ground and keep your other hand above the glove to trap the ball. This way if the ball takes a bounce you're not expecting your hand will block it. Also, when you get the ball in your glove your hand will be on it very quickly so that you can throw the ball to your target faster and beat the runner to the base.

,


Use two hands. If you have to do a basket catch, have one hand close so you can throw it quickly and to help keep the ball in your glove when you catch it.

,


Keep your eyes open and on the game. You must resist the urge to space out, even though the game can be dull for an outfielder.
Back up the infield. Stay behind them and in a position to recover the ball in the infielder misses it.

, One day, you'll get to a point when you're not sure why you signed up to play softball. You'll start getting bored and upset when you have to go to practice. Why? Because you need to work harder! Since you're not working hard anymore, your coach is getting onto you because everybody else is working hard, and you're not! Don't worry. Once you get there you'll be glad you came."

Gain access to a lathe.,
Remove the end cap of your bat.,
Use the lathe to shave the bat.,
Replace the end cap.,
Let the end cap dry.",How to Juice a Softball Bat2," To properly shave a bat, you will need to either know someone who owns a lathe or have access to one yourself. The lathe will be used to accurately and evenly trim the inside of the bat, removing material and increasing the performance of the bat. If you don't have access to a lathe of your own, try asking someone who does to learn if they can help you shave your bat.You may consider using a professional service to shave your bat for you.
Do not attempt to operate a lathe if you have not had proper training.
You can shave aluminum or composite softball bats.
Shaving a bat removes material from the barrel, resulting in thinner walls. These thinner walls will compress and spring back with more force than a regular bat. This extra force can increase the speed and distance of your hits.
Because of the unfair advantage a shaved bat can bring, they are illegal in any official baseball game or league.

, The end cap of the bat will need to be removed before it can be properly inserted into the lathe. The lathe will need to shave the inside of the bat's barrel. Caps can be easily removed using a screwdriver and some leverage. You can follow these basic steps to remove the end cap from your bat:Some people will apply gentle heat to the end cap before trying to remove it.
Insert a screwdriver into the gap between the end cap and the barrel of the bat.
Gently use the screwdriver to apply leverage against the end cap.
Work to push the end cap up and out of the barrel of the bat.
Don't apply too much force as you could damage your bat or the end cap.

, Fix the bat into the lathe in a way that will allow the bit to shave down the inside wall of the bat's barrel. Set up the lathe so that it will trim off no more than .075” from the inside of the barrel's wall. Shaving more material off might result in greater power behind your swings. However, taking more material off of your bat will also make it less durable and more likely to break.Composite bats seem to benefit the most from shaving.
In one case, shaving off four layers of material from a composite bat added 6.5 mph (10.5 km/h) to batted-ball speed.

, After the bat has been shaved, you will need to replace the end cap. Putting the end cap back on will help make your bat look as good new. You can use these basic steps to replace your bat's end cap.Clean the inside of the bat's barrel.
Put a coat urethane epoxy on the inside of your bat's barrel.
Place the end cap back into the bat. You may need to lightly hit it with a mallet to make the fit a secure one.
Wipe away any excess epoxy that may have spilled over the edges.

, Before you can begin using your bat to play ball, you'll need to let it completely dry. Allowing the epoxy time to form a tight bond between the bat's inner walls and the end cap will prevent the end cap from coming loose during play. Make sure the epoxy has had plenty of time to dry before using your bat again.


Allow the bat up to two days to dry.
You can secure the end cap with a ratchet strap while it dries. This can help achieve a firm bond between the bat and the end cap.

Find the right kind of bat to end-load.,
Remove the end cap of the bat.,
Add polyurethane to the end cap.,
Replace the end cap.,
Clean up the bat and wait for it to dry.,
Purchase a pre-made end-loaded bat.",How to Juice a Softball Bat3," End-loading your bat can give you more power behind your hits. To get started, you'll need to find a softball bat that is hollow and will allow you to remove the end cap. Many aluminum and composite bats will be capable of being end-loaded. Before you continue, make sure your bat is capable of being end loaded.


End loaded bats will have weight added or shifted to the end cap of the bat. This extra weight can add more power to a hit, sending the ball flying faster than normal bats.
End loaded bats are usually not permitted to use during an official game. The advantage that these bats provide is considered unfair to players who are using regulation bats.
The inner barrel of your bat should be hollow.
You should be able to remove the end cap from your bat.

, To end-load a softball bat yourself, you will first need to carefully remove the end cap from the bat. Removing the end cap will allow you to add material to the cap, causing the weight of the bat to shift to the end. You can use these steps to help you remove the cap from your bat:Gently work a screwdriver in between the end cap and the wall of the bat.
Use the screwdriver's leverage to begin pushing the cap up and out of the bat's barrel.
Move the screwdriver to another spot between the cap and the barrel.
Don't push too hard. Forcing the cap out could damage the bat or the cap.
Some people have found applying gentle heat to the end cap can make it easier to remove.

, Once you've remove the end cap, you can apply polyurethane to add weight to the end cap. The end cap should be entirely filled with polyurethane to ensure that enough weight has been added. Allow at least one full day for the polyurethane to dry completely., After you have made sure your polyurethane filling has totally dried, you can add the end cap back onto your bat. Adding the end cap will make your bat ready to use again. The new end cap will have shifted the weight of the bat into the end, changing your swing and adding more force to your hits. Use these steps to help you add your end cap back to the bat:Make sure the inside of your bat is clean.
Apply epoxy to the inside of your bat's barrel.
Place the end cap back in the bat. You may need to use a rubber mallet to get it all the way back into position.

, Don't start swinging your bat just yet. You'll need to give the epoxy plenty of time to dry before you can use the bat. If the epoxy doesn't dry completely before you use the bat, the end cap may come flying off of the bat. Make sure that the epoxy is fully dry before heading out to use your new bat.


Allow your bat around two day's time to dry.
Clean up any epoxy that has spilled onto your bat. Any epoxy that dries outside your bat will be very difficult to remove once it dries.

, There are many end-loaded bats that you can purchase, saving you the trouble of creating your own. These bats will come with a polyurethane filled end cap, putting extra weight in the end of the bat and your swing. If you want an end-loaded bat without the hassle of making one, try looking on-line for one that you can purchase.


You can also find pre-made end caps that are already weighted for you.
You can find end-loaded bats for around the same price as a regular softball bat.

Your coach or manager will probably check that out first. The bat should not be too long or too heavy for you to have excellent control and feel comfortable swinging it. Bat speed is much more important that the size of the bat in how well or how far you will hit the ball.;
, If you bat righty, you will put your right hand above your left and opposite if you bat lefty. Grip close to the handle, but feel free to choke up if you need greater control.

, Make sure you are clear of hitting anyone and get your muscles ready to swing hard. Swing all the way through and practice good technique.

, Most people stand directly parallel to home plate. You will want to adjust your distance from home plate to give you room to hit the ball if inside but not so far away that you could not reach a pitch on the outside of the plate. You will want to have good balance and move your feet about shoulder length apart. Make sure your back foot (one closest to the catcher) is well planted as you will use this foot to push and gain power as you swing.


When up to bat, measure your bat with the middle corner of the plate.

, Make sure your swing covers the home plate. The pitch has to make it over home plate so make sure you are standing where the ball will pass you between your chest and mid thigh. You can hold up a hand if you need longer than a few seconds to get set and then just lower it when you are ready.

, The ball will have to arch between 6–12 feet (1.8–3.7 m) and land just past home plate. Determine as quickly as possible if this will be a pitch that you will be able to hit well. Many times you can make contact with a pitch that is outside of the strike zone but it will not be your best hit so try not to swing at those. If the pitch is flat (does not arch 6-12 feet), even if it crosses the plate, you do not have to swing and the pitch will be called a ball. If you are not going to swing, relax and step out of the batters box once the ball crosses the plate. Make sure your bat is back and ready to go if you are planning to swing.

, Remember bat speed is key here and make sure to swing through the ball. Your goal is to try to get the barrel of the bat to meet the middle of the ball. You will have more time to wait because the ball is coming in at a slow arch so make sure you time your swing to make contact with the ball as it crosses your strike zone and where you hit the ball best.

, Line drives are fast and usually hard to catch unless hit directly at a fielder so that is why you want to swing level.


If you pop the ball up (hit the ball high in the air) without much distance, you are swinging up too much. Pop ups will give the fielders time to get under the ball to make the out, so adjust your swing if needed.
Also, don't swing down either as this will cause a grounder and will also give the fielders a better chance to get you out. If you hit a foul ball (ball that is not between the white lines that extend to the outfield fence), you may have swung too early or you may have not hit the ball squarely.
Try to make sure you are making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of the ball or at the widest part. Most metal softball bats have a larger sweet spot that makes it easier to hit the ball well.

, Always run past the bag if the coach is not waving you on. If this is practice, get your bat back and get ready to hit again.


Run as fast as you can and don't look at the umpire unless it is a pop up near any bases.

",How to Hit the Ball Properly in Softball,",, If you can't touch the edge of the plate farthest away from you, adjust yourself so you can.

, Stiff legs require you to tighten your muscles, which will reduce the power of your swing.

, Your ""knocking knuckles"" (your middle knuckles that bend the middle of your fingers) should line-up. This means that your left hand's knocking knuckles should be in line with your right hand's knocking knuckles. This position will help you snap through your swing, which will add power to your swing.

, This is called the ""rest"" position. You will hold this position until the pitcher starts his/her pitch during a real game.

, If you have completed this step correct, then you should be able to stick your back hand's thumb out and touch your ear.

, This will ensure that your swing will ONLY GO FORWARD. This is a positive swing. Unlike in baseball, you do not want to pull your bat back for power. That is a negative swing. The pitcher in softball is closer than a baseball pitcher, so negative motion will only work in baseball.

, This is the whole concept of positive motion.

, When you make contact with the ball, roll your wrists overs and extend your wrists out toward the outfield.

, Turn your hips toward the pitcher.

, Do not stop putting your strength into your swing when you contact the ball. This is a common mistake, and it will reduce the power of your swing. Pull your back arm and tuck it underneath your shoulder.

, Maybe wear a tank top or a t-shirt.

, Compression shorts are tight shorts usually made out of Spandex. They keep everything in place while you are running and you wear them under your regular shorts. Sliding shorts are just like compression shorts, but they have padding on the outer thighs to protect your legs and thighs when you are sliding

, It is recommended that you wear the netted kind, but ask your coach about the best color. Sometimes coaches require certain colors to complete your uniform and to make everyone look the same.

, The shirt tends to look best when ironed.

, Make sure you have softball cleats, and tie them tightly. The umpire could call you on untied shoelaces, and it wastes precious game time and presents a general annoyance.

Obtain the uniform.,
Pay attention to weather.,
Wear sliders.,
Tuck in your shirt.,
Wear cleats.,
Own a snug glove.,
Wear softball socks.,
Don't wear jewelry.,
Have a kneepad if necessary.",How to Dress for Softball," There are multiple methods to this step, depending on your situation.


For a Game: If you are going out to play an organized softball game, you should obviously be wearing the same uniform as everyone else. This isn't just preferred, it's in the rules. If you aren't wearing the same shirt and shorts as everyone else, you can potentially be kicked out of the game, depending on the umpire's discretion.

For a Practice: Unless your coach has specific dress guidelines for practise, the choices are pretty much open. The simplest option is simply a comfortable t-shirt and shorts. Make sure the shirt is neither too tight or too loose because you need to have a full range of motion to be the best you can be.
;
, Softball games can end up being played in pretty horrible climates, so make sure you check the forecast before heading out for softball. If it's fifty degrees or under, the best idea would be to wear a turtle neck, long-sleeved shirt under your uniform, or at least pack one. And if it's sixty or over, a simple under shirt beneath your uniform would be sufficient.

, Sliders are basically thigh-cut leggings that protect your upper leg from getting scratched when sliding. They should fit quite snugly, and should have pads on each outer side. They should be worn under your shorts.

, Make sure that you tuck in your shirt all around, and not just in the front. The umpire may or may not call you on it if your shirt is only tucked in the front.

, You can have metal spikes or molded/plastic cleats , and should fit you well. Your shoes should also be tied before the game, you may even want to double knot them to make sure they don't come off. Be aware that there are in fact more than one type of cleat; be sure yours are specifically softball cleats, and not any other kind.

, Your glove shouldn't be too big nor too small. Make sure that you can properly snap the glove shut to grab a ball before you go into a game, which could mean breaking it in. Here are some ideas:

Put a softball in your glove and then place it under your mattress. Sleep on it through the night, and it should be flexible in the morning.

Many sports stores own an oil that you can put on your glove before putting it in the oven which does wonders for it's stiffness.

Place a softball in your mitt, and wrap the glove entirely in twine. After a few days of being wrapped up, the mitt should be ready to go.


, Your socks can be any colour: as long as your entire team matches during a game. At a practice, it isn't necessary to wear socks unless your coach prefers it, or if you don't have sliders for any particular reason.

, The umpire can call you out on it if you are wearing jewelry, and you can miss your inning to bat. If you have studs in your ears that cannot be removed for any reason, put tape on your ears. You are not allowed to wear any jewelry, which includes rings, necklaces, metal hair pins/clips, and earrings.

, Although it isn't supposed to, your calf can scrape the ground while sliding. If you think you may accidentally do this, you may want to invest in a good knee pad. While you’re in the field or doing field work, your kneepad can rest at your ankle. However, once you’re at bat, your kneepad should have migrated to your shin. This will do a load of good when you slide. There are two types of kneepads, one of which is placed at your knee. In most cases, people keep it there even when they're not up to bat.

, Gloves separate your fingers from each other for greater dexterity. Mitts omit this feature due to their heavy padding; even if they did separate your fingers, the thicker padding would make it harder for your fingers to move independently of each other.Browse gloves if you’re an outfielder, pitcher, or second- or third baseman, or a utility player.Browse mitts if you’re a catcher or first baseman., Learn the difference between velcro, D-ring, lace, and buckle adjustments. Decide which one you prefer.Velcro: loosens or tightens your glove quickly with minimal fuss.D-ring: allows you to adjust your glove's fit by pulling on one lace.Lace: uses multiple laces to change your glove's fit.Buckle: uses a clasp to secure your glove's fit., Buy a glove or mitt made from synthetic materials for younger players who expect to grow out of their current size, since these tend to be cheaper. For more durability over longer use, invest in a leather glove or mitt. To break your glove or mitt in more quickly after purchase, opt for treated leather that has been pre-conditioned for this purpose., Avoid the cheapest mitt or glove available, since the price usually reflects the quality of craftsmanship. At the same time, resist grabbing the most expensive one automatically. Choose the right glove for you, which may or may not be the highest priced item."
"
Choose the right mitt for your position.,
Test the fit.,
Judge the weight.",How to Choose a Softball Glove2," Browse mitts that are specifically designed for either catcher or first baseman.


Catcher’s mitts are the biggest; their circumference typically exceeds 30 inches.First baseman’s mitts resemble gloves, with less padding and more length than a catcher’s mitt.Adult sizes range from 12-13""., On your way to the mitt section, grab a ball and bring it with you. Judge your ability to grip it securely through all that heavy padding.


For younger first basemen, especially aged 10 and under, be sure they are able to close the mitt. If this is too difficult, use an infielder’s glove instead., Although all mitts will feel heavy in comparison to gloves, avoid buying a mitt that feels too heavy. Be sure that the mitt’s weight does not impede your ability to transfer the ball to your free hand for a quick throw to your teammates."

Bring along someone who knows the game to stand in for the batter. Pose for them to see whether or not they can tell what sort of pitch you’re about to make.


Adult sizes for pitchers range from 11.5-13""., Avoid gloves with open webbing when pitching, since these may offer the batter a glimpse of your grip on the ball., Know that, as a pitcher, you will be making catches continually throughout the game. Be sure your hand is well protected from so many impacts., Avoid gloves that feel too heavy.

Trap the ball.,
Perfect the Indian dribble or reverse stick.,
Hit it!,
A large part of the game is endurance.,
Get comfortable with your gear.,
Don't give up!",How to Play Field Hockey," There are plenty of brands; shop around and find a stick that's of a comfortable weight and height for you, not just one that's pretty. The size of the stick should come up to your waist. Shin and/or ankle guards are a good idea, too. Like in many sports, a mouth guard is usually required if you want to get into league. See the stuff you need at the bottom for a full list. Make sure to buy a beginner stick if you are just starting.;
, With your left hand, grip your stick at the top with knuckles lined up and thumb pointing down towards the hooked bit of the stick, roughly aligned with the bit that's pointing up. Hook thumb around handle if desired (people have been known to break 'em on collision). Your right hand should grip your stick loosely at a point lower on the stick that is comfortable to you. You should be able to stand with the hooked tip grazing the ground, the flat end facing out. Let all fingers grip the stick and practice going low into a crouched stance. Make sure you keep your chest up and bend at the waist. This will allow for better vision of the field and more control.

, There is no such thing as a ""lefty"" stick, so make sure you always use your left hand.

, Left foot pointing front, right foot back support. Bend your knees slightly, aim for the ball, which should be in line with your left foot or slightly before it, but not ahead. It is important to remember to not bend your back so much as keep your KNEES BENT. Otherwise, you will be very sore the next day! Practice getting the edge of the flat side on the ground as a stop. The ball should be a sticks' length away from your body.

, Many people put their sticks down, parallel to the ground (to maximize obstructive surface area), but with practice you'll be able to just get behind the ball and use the head of the stick. To stop the ball, as it's coming towards you, move backwards, to slow the ball before stopping it. Just keeping the stick still often means the ball will roll over the stick, and hitting the ball will often cause it to go in a completely different direction. Let the ball come slightly across your body, and lean the stick in to catch the ball. Be gentle receiving the ball; pretend it is an egg and make sure you receive it lightly and carefully.








, When the ball is on your left, twist the stick with your left hand so that the flat side is again facing out correctly. Let go of your right hand as you twist, grip again once stick is in position. Make sure you never touch the ball with the rounded side of the stick; always use the flat side. The Indian dribble consists of tiny taps across the ball to move it forward. It is great to use to keep the ball in your possession. Don't give up! Even experienced players can have a hard time with the Indian dribble.








, Move your right hand closer to your left hand (i.e. up) (but note: this isn't golf), the ball should be in line with your forward foot. There are several different types of shots:









Slap-shots: Choke down your right and pretend you're playing cricket. Be careful though, sometimes the ball can go a different direction to the way you're intending it too if you're not experienced with hitting. Only hit the ball in a desperate circumstance, or when you're shooting for a goal.
Pushes: grip should be between that for a hit and a slap-shot; ball should be right in front of the flat side of your stick, which should be somewhere around your back foot. Transfer weight from back foot to front foot, lean into it and push. A push is often used for passing, as it is swift and easy.
Hook variation: place stick almost parallel to ground, hooked portion curving lovingly around the ball. The ball and hook end of the stick should be behind your back foot. Transfer weight from your back foot to your right foot, pull hard then push in one smooth motion.
Flicks: hands in slap-shot grip, dig edge of stick beneath ball, much as you would toe scoop a soccer ball, lift and push, transferring weight from back foot to front foot.
Drives: Holding both hands at the end of the grip, like a golf club, bring the field hockey stick back until about waist-height, and swing towards the ball. Don't over swing, or you can hit another player! Keep your eyes down at the ball and do not look up after hitting; just like in golf. Just remember, this is not a golf swing! Bend down at your knee, and make sure the toe of your stick is facing up. Your foot should be facing in the direction you want the ball to go.

, Make sure you keep in shape by running in season, especially if you are a midfielder. This will allow you to run without tiring the length of the game. Remember you are not just simply running the whole game, but running and using your stick skills which wears you out just as fast. Even defenders need to run, so make sure you are toned and fit for the game.








, Bounce the ball along the flat length of your stick. Dribble it down corridors. Walk it. Figure-eight it. Work on turns and pulls. Pass with a friend. Everything helps to become a great field hockey player! For help, talk to your field hockey coach or sign up for practices. Don't worry about being the greatest; even the professional players started somewhere. Remember to have fun with it! Field hockey is about growing in many different areas than sports.








, We all know that practice makes perfect. Getting frustrated makes playing the game boring and aggravating for everyone. Have the confidence, practice the skills, and you will do just fine!

STICK HANDLING - Stick handling is the most important part of playing attack.,

KNOW WHEN TO PASS OR SHOOT - Shoot only if there are no defenders around you.",How to Play Attack in Mens Lacrosse," You should know how to cradle and do dekes to be a good attackman.;
, You need to be explosive when you have the ball. This will help you get towards the net or away from a defender faster.

, Most of the time you are very close to the goalie, so accuracy is key. Practice on a net and just aim and fire away, taking as many repetitions as possible.

, There are three main positions: point, bottom right, and bottom left. If you are at point you need to be able to get passed defenders and have a quick, fast shot. If you are playing either bottom position, it is better if you are dominant on the side you're on. (bottom right for righties)

, Do not take a shot simply because you have the ball. Look for the open shot and if you don't have it, maneuver to get open, or pass to a teammate.

This check can annoy and hopefully disrupt your opponent without making you lose body position. If you use one check, use the poke.;
, Just what it sounds like. Put your stick under their bottom hand and lift. This is a good check to interfere with passes and shots.

, Hit the attackman with the head of your stick, using a slashing motion. Be careful! This check is the most likely check to get you called for slashing, and it makes you lose body position.

, When your attackman is cradling with his back to you, hold your stick in a two handed grip, and wrap the stick around him while using your bottom hand to throw the end of the stick under your arm.

, Use the wrap, but throw it over their head, instead. Be careful not to hit their helmet, as a head check is a penalty and will make your defense man-down.

, Start by faking the overhead check, then when your attackman tries to roll under you, bring your stick down backwards on their stick/forearms.

, Constantly move your stick back and forth over your attackman's head, and when he brings his stick back for the cradle/pass/shot, bring your stick down as hard as you can.

, Choke up on your stick and hack at your opponent's stick with the end of your shaft.

, Choke up on your stick; then, keeping your stick perpendicular to the ground, bring it over the attackman's head and bring it down on their head.

, Hold your stick at about the middle and, keeping your stick perpendicular to the ground, throw your arms out wide across your attackman's face, hitting their stick.

, Get your opponent in the V-hold, and when they try to roll off, turn and throw a one-handed backhand check.

, Wear appropriate softball clothing; if your club has a uniform, get this organized ahead of time, either new or used. Be sure that it fits comfortable before purchasing.


Don't forget the appropriate shoes, again sized for comfort.

,,, And start out by throwing overhand first; this helps you to loosen up a little.

, Every league makes you start off with at least one part of your foot on the rubber. If you're right-handed, put your right foot on the rubber at a favorable angle and put your left foot on a small backward angle.

, It's similar in position to when you're about to run a race but you're not totally bending down.

, Then bring them together at about the neck-line. The form should make a circle. Then push your arms out in the same circular motion until your arms make a K-position with your body.

, At the same time, snap your pitching wrist and fold it up like it's trying to slap you.

,, Do this without the ball. Snap it hard.

,,, This means aiming to hit every pitch in the same spot.

, Then aim to pitch at different speeds. This will make you the best pitcher on your team.

Hold the stick as you would for a push, your left hand at the top of the stick in an inverted 'V' grip, and your right hand at the bottom of the grip or at where the grip and stick meet.,
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, your left shoulder pointing in the direction you want to flick in.,
Position the ball in the middle of your stance at a stick's reach from your body.,
Begin by placing the stick behind the ball and transferring your weight to your back foot.,
Roll the ball forward on your stick to start the shot.,
As you become more proficient at flicking, aim to keep the ball on the stick for longer to flick it higher.",How to Flick in Field Hockey," (which ever is comfortable for you.);
, Bend your knees slightly and keep your back straight. You can also stand with your feet together. Step with your left foot and lean with your right.

, The ball should be further out from your body than for a push.

, Drop the right shoulder and open up the stick face by rotating the stick with your left wrist to the right. Make sure you get really low so you can have more power behind it. A flick only works if you get low.

, Transfer your weight to the front foot as you push the ball in a straight line into the air. Follow through smoothly by wrapping the stick around and below the left shoulder.

, You can also control the direction of the flick, opening up the stick face early to flick right, or twisting the stick to the left to throw the ball left.

How to hold the lacrosse stick: Place your dominant hand at the top of the stick, and your non-dominant hand towards the bottom of the stick.,
How to pass the ball: When passing the ball, there is a basic pulley-and-lever motion.,
Sharpen the saw.",How to Pass in Lacrosse," Evenly space your hands out, so that both hands divide the shaft into thirds. A common misconception is that a player will generate more power on the throw if their hands are close together. This, of course, is not true.;
, Your dominant hand, which is placed at the top of the shaft, will be pushing upward. Your non-dominant hand will be pushing downwards. This motion generates the force needed in order to propel the lacrosse ball. It is important to start out slowly, especially if you are new to the sport. Gradually, add speed to your passes. Additionally, it is crucial to learn both hands in lacrosse. In being able to use both hands, it makes it MUCH easier to work on both sides of the field.

, Practice constantly. Pass with friends, experienced or non-experienced. An excellent idea is to purchase a bounce back, or a Lax Wall, so that you can practice when no one is around. Practicing is crucial to learning how to pass. In practicing these skills constantly and putting time aside to practice, you can master the pass in lacrosse.

Hold your stick correctly.,
Position your body correctly.,
Generate maximum power from your lower body.,
Bring your arms and wrists into action.,
Practice as much as you can.",How to Get a Better Lacrosse Shot1," It is easiest to generate power with your bottom hand as close to the butt end of the stick as possible. This maximizes the power generated by the shaft. Your top hand should be a

round ten inches away from your bottom hand, or whatever feels the most comfortable.
, If you are shooting righty, place your left foot out front and vice versa. Point your shoulders at an angle close to perpendicular to your target.

, Be sure to step into your shot. It is important that as you step into your shot, you should point your front foot at your target. As you are about to release your shot, swivel your hips and push off the ground with your legs, maximizing torque. Also, be sure to rotate your shoulders with your hips to increase the power generated.

, Your release should be about three quarters, or halfway, between straight up and down and sideways. As you follow through, it is important to snap your wrists over to keep the ball from flying off target.

, Try taking at least 100 shots on both hands (righty and lefty) every day, at the least. Then, work on combining shot power and accuracy to become one of the best shooters on the field!

Don't worry about the speed and power of your shot quite yet.,
Bring as many balls as you can out to a net and create targets in the four corners.,
Try to hit your targets on the run.,
Keep practicing.",How to Get a Better Lacrosse Shot2," The main way to increase accuracy is through loads of repetition, practice, and dedication. It is important to understand that a part of becoming a better lacrosse player includes enduring those states of frustration and anger to get to the feelings that derive from winning those big games and scoring a nice goal.

, The targets could be as simple as empty water bottles hanging in the corners. Start with the top left corner. Shoot at it five times with both hands.


Do the same for the top right, then bottom right, then bottom left, then finally the bottom center of the net. Repeat until you can hit your target three out of five shots on both hands in each area. This will ensure that you are able to hit the general area desired every time you shoot.

, You can simulate running off of a pick and shooting, or catching and shooting quickly from closer range. This will prepare you for almost any game situation where a well placed shot could mean the difference between an easy save and a sweet goal.

, Set new goals for yourself. Try to increase your speed while maintaining the accuracy of your shot. Most of all, keep improving. Your shot can always be better, and a better shot makes you a better lacrosse player.

Use your non-dominant hand to grab the bottom of the stick, while grabbing the other end of the stick with your dominant hand somewhere near the middle of the shaft.,
Place a ball in your Lacrosse stick as you set the shaft of the stick over your right shoulder.,
Grab the middle of the shaft of your Lacrosse stick with your dominant hand, but keep it at the same angle, now that the stick is balanced.,
Give a long enough push/pull to toss the ball to the other player on your team.Pull the stick with your non-dominant hand and push with your dominant hand.

",How to Pass a Lacrosse Ball with a Short Stick," Never go above the middle of the shaft to pass the ball.


If you are right-handed, the stick should be on the right side of your body.
If you are left-handed, just change the position to your left side.;
, Hold on to it with your left hand at the bottom of the stick.

, The head should be facing up.

Take jogs around your block or on a treadmill if available.,
Do Push ups.,
Do Situps: again, same as the pushups.",How to Get in Shape for Lacrosse1," Jogs are much better for your body because it is more natural and your muscles have to resist naturally, making you stronger and more fit.;
, 5 times a week, do at least 20 push ups in a row. After 20, keep going to failure. 2-3 reps.

, Do 20 sit ups and continue to failure. 2-3 reps 4 days a week.

Make sure to shoot and keep you accuracy up so you can pluck corners.",How to Get in Shape for Lacrosse2," Shooting is crucial for attack. Take the effort to do at least 50 pushups in a row. This may take time, but strength is needed for shots.

"
"
Run.",How to Get in Shape for Lacrosse3," Middies run for the mass majority of the game. Running is necessary if you want to play this position. Jog at least once a day. I recommend jogging a mile while using the sprint jog technique. Sprint for 30 seconds, then jog for 1 minute. This helps your heart get ready for the harsh running. In a typical game, you will be running on and off for about 1.5 miles (2.4 km).

Gain Strength.",How to Get in Shape for Lacrosse4," Brute strength is the key to this position. This is for the big people. This position, you're going to want to lift some weights. To lay the wood to them, you are going to have to bench press at least 200 in high school. If you're in middle school, free weights are good. Dumbbells are a good source for strength, just make sure you don't overdo it and lift your capabilities. Weights only stunt your growth if you lift improperly. Also, defensemen should stretch their bodies a lot because height is crucial.

"
"
Work on your reaction.",How to Get in Shape for Lacrosse5," Reaction speed and jumps are crucial for this position. To work on your jump, do jumping rope. Believe me, this works. You need to step to the ball in order to increase the percentage of saving it. Jump rope gives you flexibility. Reaction speed is essential also. If you have a sibling, make them throw lacrosse balls at you from 2 feet (0.6 m) away. At first, catch the ball with your top hand(left hand if lefty, right hand if righty). After a while, use your stick. You will need to get used to the weight of your stick while moving it especially to your off side.

Put the stick in your right hand.,
When the referee sets you and your opponent up for the draw, ""crank"" your hand forward, aka lift your wrist that is closest to the butt of the stick.,
When the referee blows the whistle, push your cranked wrist down slightly to ""lock"" the ball in your stick.

,
Push the ball to one of your team mates( that is incorrect the ball in NCAA, CIAC, and CISAC rules all state that the ball must go over the opponents heads indicating you cannot push the ball), or up in the air if you want to draw to yourself (if you are tall and can catch well, drawing to yourself can really work!",How to Do a Draw in Girls Lacrosse1,";

Plan out the stick design first.,
Prepare the stick for the first dye.,
Start mixing the dye.,
Remove the stick when you are satisfied with the color and place it immediately under the tap of the sink under ice cold water.,
At this point, you can dry the cold water from the stick with an old dish rag of some sort.,
If you are dying the stick another color, then you need to leave the tape on the stick that you placed on there before to keep the white parts of the stick.",How to Dye a Lacrosse Head," Before you buy the appropriate color dye, decide what the color scheme and the pattern is going to look like. Also figure out if your design is possible. This is important so you do not make a mistake and dye the stick the wrong color first. Draw a basic outline and picture first in order to be sure to remember each step and to get an idea of how the colors will look when finished.;
, At this point you want to use the tape and letters or numbers to cover the plastic. Remember that what you are about to tape is going to remain white when the stick is complete. Also, remember to heat up the tape a bit to make it adhere properly to the plastic. Unless you want to dye the pocket as well, I recommend removing the string first!

, At this point you need to measure out how much water is required to completely submerge the stick. Then place the water in a container over the stove and bring it to a boil. When the water starts to boil, turn of the stove and let it cool a little bit. When it stops bubbling add the dye to the water, you may want to use an old kitchen tool to stir it a bit if it is in the powder form. While the dye is still very hot, place the stick in the dye. It should only be a matter of minutes until the stick has come to its full color, the hotter the dye, the faster it takes to the stick. Also keep in mind one of the rules of dying: If you are dying the stick more than one color, make sure that this is the lightest of the colors.

, This will wash off all the remaining dye that could drip off the stick and potentially ruin the carpet in your house or your clothes! It also cures the stick, meaning that the dye will not bleed off of it and onto your hands. After rinsing the stick, place it back in the dye for another 5-10 minutes. This lets the color stay longer, insuring that the color won't fade. Rinse the head again in cold water, and once you dry it, put it in the freezer for about 25 minutes. This is so that if you chip your stick, it won't look like the original color, but instead the color of the dye. If you have taped the stick in order to create designs, by leaving the stick under the cold water it also makes it a lot easier to take off the tape!

, If you are only dying your stick one color than you are ready to remove the tape if you had used any to keep some of the stick white, or if you just dyed it one solid color, then you are ready to string it up and go play.

, Now add more tape to keep parts of the stick the color that you just dyed. Then repeat steps 1-4 again only this time use a darker color dye. Feel free to get as crazy as you can imagine to create a crazy designed stick all your own.

Have a budget in mind for what you can spend.,
Decide what material you prefer.,
Choose the proper length.,
Find your best shaft flex.",How to Choose a Hockey Stick1," You can get sticks starting at $20-$30 that will be of good enough quality for young or casual players, or you can choose a specialized and finely crafted stick that will run you around $250 or more. The price of a stick does not automatically determine the quality, and it definitely does not determine if the stick is a good fit for you. Have an idea what you are willing to spend for a stick, but keep in mind that the right stick for you is determined more by feel than price., Hockey sticks are made from a range of materials including wood, fiberglass, Kevlar, aluminum, and even titanium. Ask yourself what level of player you are and what purpose the stick will serve you. For beginners, a wood stick can be a good option because wood sticks are said to give a better feel for the puck. For serious players that know the game better and will be using their stick frequently, a composite stick of graphite or Kevlar may be the best option. These tend to be more specially designed with advanced players in mind.Wood sticks tend to be pretty heavy and less durable, so serious players tend to stick with composite sticks. Fiberglass is lighter than wood but also not super durable. Kevlar tends to have the best lightness to strength ratio.
There are multiple materials used for hockey sticks because different players have different preferences for how they want their stick to feel and to perform. If a player tends to be rough with their sticks, making lots for slapshots for example, then they need something strong and durable.

, Hockey sticks comes in a range of shaft lengths, and the best fit is determined first by your height with a slight variation depending what position you play. To fit yourself for a stick, place the toe end of the stick on the ground and line the grip end up with your face. The right stick length is between your nose and your chin. It is best to measure for a stick while you have skates on, but since this is not always an option, be sure to add at least 2 inches for the height of the skates.The basic length guide is: a stick that doesn’t reach your chin is short, one that touches the bottom of the chin is average, and one that goes to your nose or past is long.
Some positions tend to prefer different lengths. Forwards usually favor a shorter stick, which allows more mobility and makes stickhandling easier. Defensemen generally opt for longer sticks, which are better for poking the puck away from opposing players.
It’s better to choose a stick that is a bit longer rather than a little shorter because you can always trim a long stick to a better fit.

, The flex rating for a hockey stick corresponds to how much flexibility the shaft has. The general principle for flex ratings is how many pounds of pressure are needed to bend the stick 1 inch, so the heavier the player, the higher the flex rating. The rule of thumb is to cut your weight in half and this will give you the flex rating you need.A stick with too high a flex rating will lack the amount of “give” a player is looking for when taking a slap-shot, while a stick with a low flex rating will bend too much and cause a lack of power.
If you do cut a stick down to be a more appropriate length than it was originally, the flex rating will increase because the shortened stick will be stiffer than it was.

"
"
Put the stick in your left hand.

,
When the ref sets you up for the draw, ""crank"" your wrist closest to the butt of your stick down, aka lower your wrist as far as it can go (don't move your stick from where the ref has set it.,
When the ref blows the whistle, push your cranked wrist up slightly to ""lock"" the ball in your stick.

,
Then, pull your stick and the ball should go over your shoulder, or you can pull straight up to give the ball to yourself.

,
Both of these draws are great, although everyone has their preference.",How to Do a Draw in Girls Lacrosse2,", You may have to lift up your hand to crank).

,,, Just practice both draws a few times to see which one is right for you.

"
"
Choose a blade curve.,
Pick the grip option that feels right.,
Select a lie angle.",How to Choose a Hockey Stick2," The curve of the blade affects both stickhandling and shooting. Blades can have many different combinations of curves which include left or right, heel, mid or toe curve, and slight, moderate or deep curve. Choose right or left based on your dominate hand. Beginners should opt for a mid-level curve, which is not too straight and not too deeply curved.Most leagues have restrictions on how much of a curve you can have, so be sure not to exceed the allowable limit.
Those who want more control when handling the puck should opt for a straighter blade, while players who take a lot of wrist or slap-shots stand to benefit from a blade with a greater curve.

, As with most other stick options, choosing whether or not to use a stick with a grip is about personal preference. Sticks with no grip will have a smooth finish and are ideal if you want to be able to easily slide your bottom hand up and down. The downside is that when your gloves get wet, you may have less control on the stick. Gripped sticks may be made with a slight texture on the end of the stick you hold, or they may have a grip that is a separate piece added onto the stick. It may be just rough or it may have a bit of tackiness to it that gives the grip a sticky feel., The lie of a stick means the angle where the shaft connects to the blade. The lie ranges from 4 to 8, with a lower number indicating a wider angle. The lie you choose will affect how the stick feels and how you can best use it. To determine the proper lie for you, think about if you would usually skate with the stick out far in front of you or close to your body. If you keep it out in front of you, a lower lie number is better, such as 4. If you keep it closer to you, a higher number is better, such as 6-7."

, You'll not only want to keep up your endurance, but also your ability to handle the ball (get the ball: keep it or pass it).

, Tell yourself that you are a part of the best set of soccer players ever. Remember that soccer is all about team effort, so pass the ball every now and then and let everyone take a shot.

, If you play goalkeeper, remember you are the last line of defense. Know what position you are playing and maintaining it. Fill others' position if they are not in theirs. Commit yourself to the ball—that includes diving and big smacks down the pitch.

, Love the sport. Having fun is one thing that makes the game worthwhile. Learn to love the game, and practice all the time. You will slowly but surely get better and enjoy the game more.

, Try your absolute hardest. Don't even bother if you aren't playing your complete best. Run as fast as you can. Shoot carefully. Pass well. Keep your head up. And never-ever- give up.

Make sure that your pocket is deep, but not illegal.,
Adjust your pocket.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Ball1," When you place a lacrosse ball into the net of your stick, it should not sink completely below the uppermost plastic rim of the pocket. If the pocket is too deep, it will be unfairly easy for you to keep the ball in your net, and your stick will violate game regulations. In a game situation, a referee will not hesitate to penalize you for a non-regulation pocket—so make a habit of checking your stick before you play. If your pocket is too deep, you can untie and adjust the strings.For men's lacrosse: Make sure that the pocket is not too shallow. When a ball is in your pocket and you hold the stick perfectly horizontally, the ball should not be visible above the rim of the head. If the pocket is too shallow, you will not be able to control the ball when you cradle, pass, and shoot.
For women's lacrosse: As opposed to men's lacrosse, no pocket is allowed. The pocket of the ball must protrude from the top of the wooden or plastic rim when you hold the stick horizontally. This shallow pocket rule makes it easier for other players to dislodge the ball from your control—and it also means that you will need to cradle differently to keep your ball in the stick.;
, Untie the knots that protrude from the head where it meets the shaft. Pull the strings slightly further from the head of the stick, then retie the knots so that the pocket is shallower.


Ask a coach or a teammate for help.
Be aware that you may need to adjust and readjust the pocket several times until it feels right.

"
"
Use your dominant hand to control the stick.,
Use your non-dominant hand to loosely support the bottom end of the shaft.,
Hold your stick parallel to your body with your shaft resting near your hip and the head near your ear.,
Use your dominant hand to curl the stick toward you, then back, in one smooth rhythm.,
Practice cradling while you run.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Ball2," Hold the shaft of the lacrosse stick just below the head. You will slide this hand up and down the shaft to catch and throw the ball—so think of your cradling position as an intermediate step between those actions.

, You should feel the weight of the ball in the stick.


Always cover the butt end of the stick with your bottom hand so another player cannot hit it and knock the ball out of the stick. If you leave your ""tail"" hanging out, you are giving another player the perfect opportunity to disarm you.

, Keep your stick at a 45 to 60 degree angle with the ground, and try to keep the head of the stick about a foot in front of your face. The open side of your net should face forward.

, The motion is neither full twist nor full rotation. Twist the shaft by curling your wrist while rotating the whole stick about your elbow. The centripetal force created by the rotation of the stick will keep the ball inside the pocket.


Try to keep your technique as tight and efficient as possible. Do not cradle widely or wildly. Be conscious of how stable your cradle is, and try not to leave the head of your stick hanging for a defender to strip the ball away.

, You will need to run the ball down the field at some point, so it is important that you are able to cradle in motion as well as when you are standing still. The most important aspect of running with the ball is to cradle in cadence with your natural running motion. Say you cradle at a rate of 7 times in 10 seconds, but you take another running step at a rate of 10 times in 10 second—it will be much more difficult to control the ball in the pocket. Since you'll need to be running at varying speeds, you'll need to be able to cradle at different cadences to match your body's motions.


Make sure that whenever you run at practice, you run with your stick cradling. If you run around your neighborhood, consider cradling a lacrosse ball as you go. Practice this until running with a stick is just as natural as running without.
At first, practice cradling while you are standing still. As you improve, try to cradle while you run. Learn to switch sides, cradle the ball one-handed, and perfect the shooting cradle to become an even more effective player.

"
"
Plant your feet wide and bend your knees slightly.,
Swing the stick low between your knees in a V-motion, and fluidly place your non-dominant hand above your dominant hand on the stick.,
Cradle with your non-dominant side.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Ball3," Hold the stick with your dominant hand, near-vertically, so that the open rim of the head faces you. Leave a few inches of space between your dominant hand and the head of the stick.

, Pull the stick up to a cradling position on your non-dominant side, letting your dominant hand slide to the butt of the stick.

, Work on using the same techniques you use to cradle with your dominant hand. It may feel awkward at first, but with practice it will become more natural.


As you grow as a player, it is very important that you can switch your cradle between your dominant and non-dominant sides. If you are right-handed, for instance, you probably tend to cradle with your right hand on top and your left hand near the butt of the stick. If a defender attacks from your right side, it can be extremely useful to quickly switch your hands—you can dodge to the left or avoid the defender with your left hand on top and your right hand near the butt of the stick."
"
Position your body between the ball and the defender.,
Grip the stick just below the head.,
Swing your stick arm back as your stick side leg steps forward.,
Flex your wrists to keep the ball in the pocket.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Ball4," One-handed cradling will allow attackmen to move at full speed and use their body to shield the ball from defenders. However, it will take longer to pass or shoot as you must move your free hand back in position before you will be able to do either.

, The stick should be nearly parallel to your torso. #*Use your free hand to create room from the defender. Hold your arm out with your hand pointed to the ground while you run to keep defenders from getting too close.

, Keep your elbow bent. Make sure the face of the stick head faces your chest at all times., The side-to-side motion generated will generate the same kind of force as the up and down motion of the two-handed cradle technique.

"
"
Turn your stick vertically to catch the ball.,
Start cradling as soon as the ball hits your pocket.,
Curl the stick out of the cradle so that the head faces straight up to throw or shoot.,
Pull your stick back over your shoulder, directly out of the cradle.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Ball5," Slide your dominant hand up to the ""throat"" of the head. When the ball sails into your pocket, pull your stick back a little bit so that it doesn't bounce out.

, Bring your stick back down to its 45-60 degree cradling angle, curl the stick, and cradle close to keep the ball in the pocket while you run down the field or look for a pass.


Practice catching—have someone throw the ball to you, or throw it to yourself against a pitch-back or brick wall.

, Slide your top hand down the shaft until it is directly above your bottom hand.

, Whip the stick forward in the direction that you want to throw the ball. Make sure to look in the direction that you plan to throw. Practice this motion while you are standing still, then while you are running. Keep working at it until you can fluidly transition from cradling the ball to passing or shooting.

Aim for the opponent's stick.,
Check from in front of a player only.,
Check with a poke.,
Disrupt a throw.,
Check with a short, controlled swing when the opportunity is right.,
Check with your shoulder.,
Push the other player with your hands.",How to Check Well in Lacrosse1," A check is a defensive move aimed at an opponent's stick, or the hands holding the stick. You are not allowed to strike the legs, back, above the shoulder, or an arm not touching the stick.
, It's very difficult to legally check from behind, and some refs won't allow it at all.Save your checking for situations where you're facing a player's front or side., Hold your stick directly outward and poke it at the opposing arms or torso. Keep up this check to disrupt the player's ball control. This is easier to control than a swing check, and more difficult to foul with., While you're checking with a poking motion, you're in the perfect position to disrupt a throw. As the throw starts, get your stick under the opponent's lower hand, and push it upward. When done correctly, this will disrupt their aim completely., Check with a swing if you have a clear line to the other player's stick, and he looks off balance or vulnerable. Plant your feet at shoulder width and swing with a fast, short motion in front of you. Strike at the center of the shaft or directly at the pocket, with just enough force to jar the ball loose.

Never swing your stick like a baseball bat when checking. A wild or overly strong check will earn you a penalty for ""slashing.""
If you're playing an offensive position, your shorter stick is generally less effective at checking, but you do have more control over your swing. You should still wait for a vulnerable moment, but be aware you can react a little faster.

, You may ""body check"" a player only on the front side, between the shoulders and the knees. You may not do this while the other player is scooping up a ground ball, or is in another unprotected position where the contact may cause injury., This gives you more power at close range, but puts you at risk of a ""cross check"" foul if you push with the stick shaft instead. To avoid this, make sure your hands are together on the stick as you are pushing. They should never be more than six inches (15 cm) apart on the stick, and if your referee is strict you may want to hold them closer.

Be extra careful not to hit from behind or above the shoulders, or you could easily injure the other player.

Educate yourself on the basics of a hockey mask.,
Determine your hockey mask needs.,
Use a measuring tape to measure your head's circumference at your forehead.,
Search for a hockey mask.,
Ensure that the mask is certified.,
Place the hockey mask on your head.",How to Buy a Hockey Mask," The goalie mask has a cage, shell, and specific padding, while a player's mask generally consists of a cage or face mask.


The cage or face mask is the most basic type of mask for a hockey player who is not a goalie. Usually a wire grid or clear polycarbonate shield covers the player's face, protecting him or her from flying pucks or errant sticks. The wire cage tends to impair the player's vision. For those professional hockey players who want a mask, they most often opt for a half shield, which only protects their eyes. Goalies also have wire cages, which cover their entire face.
The shell pertains to the construction of the helmet. Most professional hockey players have a plaster cast made of their face so a hockey mask can be made specifically for their facial configuration. However, this can be a very costly endeavor.
The helmet's padding protects your head from impact. The more expensive helmets utilize lightweight material to minimize the overall weight of the mask. It is recommended that the padding is 5/8 inches (1.6 cm) thick.;
, Skaters should choose a mask that best fits their head, but goalies need a mask based on their skill level. There are several types of masks that goalies can choose from. If you play in the net, you need to be aware of the different types that are available.


If you're a novice goalie, opt for a mask constructed of a fiberglass shell with single foam padding. Beginner hockey players tend to not have a hard shot, so you don't need a mask that can withstand high-powered shots.
Mid-level hockey masks are the most common option and can be used by high school goalies and adults who play pick-up hockey games in net. These masks are similar to elite masks since they're both made of fiberglass, but the mid-level masks tend to have more padding.
Elite goaltender masks tend to be handcrafted and the most expensive option. The mask's shell is oftentimes made of carbon composite material and the padding tends to conform to the goalie's head.

, Sizing can vary by manufacturer, but you must have your head size before buying a hockey mask. Manufacturers may provide a sizing chart for each mask model, which can help you narrow down your choices.


If you know your fitted hat size, you may be able to use this number instead of measuring your head.
Keep in mind that this is just a general guide and that it doesn't take into consideration if you have a narrow or wider face. This measurement may not work well if you are considering an elite hockey mask.

, Although there are options online, if you are looking to buy a mid-level or elite mask, you may want to visit a brick-and-mortar store and try on a mask. This way you can ensure that the mask fits your head properly.

, Many hockey leagues recommend that the masks be certified by The Hockey Equipment Certification Council (HECC) or the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) if you play in Canada.

, Push the mask against your forehead, and strap it into place. You can adjust the straps to make the helmet tighter or looser. Your chin should fit snugly in the chin cup. Make sure there are no gaps between your head and the foam inside the mask. If there is, your mask may move around while you are playing hockey and prohibit you from seeing the puck clearly.

Aim for the top of the stick.,
Check from in front.,
Stay controlled.,
Avoid striking toward the other player.,
Bring your stick back up.",How to Check Well in Lacrosse2," In women's lacrosse, you are only allowed to check the area of the stick above the hands of the player holding it. The area between the two hands gripping the stick is off-limits., It is illegal to check from behind. You are also not allowed to bring your stick within 12 inches (30 cm) of the other player's face.Because of this, it's illegal to reach across the other player's body and try to check from the opposite side., A wild or violent swing will earn you a penalty. It's a good idea to hold your stick with both hands to avoid the appearance of an uncontrolled swing., During a check, your stick should not move toward the other player's body. Aim the stick to the side, knocking the other stick away from the player's body., Your check should be a sharp rap downward. Once the two sticks collide, bring your stick back up again. A strong follow-through to the ground will be considered excessive force."

Grip the stick correctly.,
Move your arm into position.,
Practice the cradling movement.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Stick1," For the one-handed cradling technique the use of proper grip technique is critical. Start by practicing with your dominant hand, using it to grip the stick just under the head. Avoid gripping the stick any lower or higher than this spot in order to get maximum control over the cradling movement., Once you've gripped the lacrosse stick properly you can move your arm into position. Bring your hand up so that your stick is vertical, with the head of your stick at about the same level as your own head. Your elbow should be bent at a ninety degree angle for the proper position., The single-handed cradling movement will primarily use your shoulder and wrist. The goal is to move the stick in a crescent motion, rotating the head and net with the movement to keep the ball in the cradle.Move the stick towards your chest, rotating from the elbow. Curl your wrist inward at the same time.
Move the stick away from your chest, rotating your arm outwards at the elbow. Turn your wrist out and away from your body as you move your arm.

Get your hands into position.,
Keep your hands loose.,
Move the stick up and down.,
Practice cradling while running.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Stick2," Part of handling your lacrosse stick and proper cradling technique is having your hands in the correct position. By putting your dominant and non-dominant hands where they need to be, you will be able to get the most out of your practice and effectively cradle the lacrosse stick.Place your dominant hand a few inches below the head of your stick
Place your non-dominant hand at the other end of the stick.

, While you don't want to drop your lacrosse stick, keeping a grip that is too tight will prevent you from cradling the stick properly. Both your grip and your wrists will need to be kept just loose enough to properly perform the movement and keep the stick in your hands.The stick should be able to slightly rotate under your grip.
When cradling the stick, your wrists will need to go with the motion, twisting with the head of your stick.

, The two-handed method of cradling will require you to move the stick from waist level up to head level. During this motion you will need to use your wrists to rotate the head of the stick, keeping the ball from falling out of the mesh. Practice the following steps to learn the proper cradling movement:Start with your stick at hip level. The open side of the mesh should be facing upwards.
Place the ball in your mesh.
Bring the head of the stick up to head level, as if you were curling a dumbbell.
As you bring the head up, both your wrist and the head should rotate so that the open face of the mesh points downward at the top of the motion.
Bring the head back to starting position to complete the motion.

, A good exercise when learning how to cradle is to incorporate the technique into the rhythm of your running. Since you will need to cradle as you move, practicing your cradling technique in conjunction with running will allow you to do the motion naturally and make you a more effective lacrosse player.Bring your stick up at the same time as you are leading with the leg on your dominant side.
Bring the stick back down as your opposite leg leads.
Keep working until this movement is natural and the ball stays securely in your net.

"
"
Keep your movements smooth.,
Practice your technique.,
Use both your hands to cradle.",How to Cradle a Lacrosse Stick3," Tightening up on the stick or moving your arms rigidly when cradling will result in less efficient motion. Learning to keep your cradling technique smooth and intuitive will take practice. Fluid cradling will allow for you to focus on other aspects of the game during play instead of being overly focused on how you are handling the lacrosse stick.Try to keep your grip and muscles loose.
Always keep your stick moving when cradling the ball.

, The only way to get better at your cradling technique is to practice. Regular practice has been shown to build skill and allow that skill to stay fresh and strong. Try to practice cradling as often as you can to increase your skill quickly and effectively.Keep your stick handy so that you can easily practice in your free time.
Try to practice at least once a day to keep your skill fresh.
You can still practice the motions even if you don't have your stick nearby.

, Although it can be tempting to exclusively use your dominant hand and arm to cradle, making use of both hands can make you a more versatile and skilled lacrosse player. There may be times during a lacrosse game that using your non-dominant hand can even give you the advantage. During your practice sessions make sure to practice cradling with both hands.Chances are your off hand will require much more practice than your dominant hand.
Looking in the mirror and watching how you use your dominant hand can give you a good idea of how to move your non-dominant hand.

"
Learn to shoot quickly while still maintaining accuracy.,
Practice putting the ball on net immediately out of the air.,
Focus on trapping the ball out of the air with your entire body.,
Practice challenging defenders one on one, getting around them without teammates.,
Develop both feet into dangerous weapons of scoring.",How to Play Forward in Soccer1," The faster you can pull off a shot, the more deadly you'll be up top. You should work on a two-touch shot. Your first touch creates space to swing your leg, either to the side of a defender or off a trap from a pass. The second touch is the shot itself. If you can take these two touch shots, you'll be able to push the ball to the side of a defender and fire off a shot before they can even react.


Once you feel good on these quick shots, creating space and striking rapidly, work on it on the run, dribbling towards goal, taking a touch, and shooting.;
, Typically, this is a header on goal or a ""volley,"" which is when you strike the ball before it hits the ground. Difficult but essential, a great forward can redirect an aerial ball towards the goal without settling the ball, which gives the defense time to react. You can practice this easily with a friend hitting your crosses and corner kicks, but keep some things in mind.


Follow through towards your target. For headers, this means your shoulders will turn to face the goal. For kicks, the indicator is usually your hips, which will turn with the shot to face goal on accurate finishes.
This skill is almost useless if you're standing still. Always jog, move, or attack the ball on the run, even in practice. It is rare to have time to stand still in a game with the ball approaching the box.

, You will have to be good at trapping, bringing the ball from the air to the ground smoothly, because a lot of the game for a forward comes from long balls and aerial crosses. You want your touch to end on a time, setting the ball about a foot in front of you so that your next touch can immediately pass, shoot, or dribble. Good ways to practice include:


Juggling is a great way to practice full body touch, but only if you challenge yourself. See how high you can get the ball and still maintain control.
Hit long balls with a friend. Start about 20 yards away, and slowly get further and further. As you get better, pick up the speed between trapping and hitting the ball back.
Hit against a wall, drilling shots or crosses at a hard surface and reacting quickly to trap the rebound., Once you have the ball, you must be able to dribble around the defenders and to the goal by using a variety of ""moves"" such as the Maradona, the step-over, or the scissors. Some good dribble moves are shoulder feint and step over. Not all forwards need to play silky, technical soccer like Messi, but you need a few ways around a defender to make them step up and respect you instead of hanging back and waiting for you to pass.


Get a close friend or teammate and challenge them to 1v1 drills. Simply make a thin rectangle and alternate attacking and defending. Crossing the opposite end line with control of the ball is a ""goal.""
You don't always get to beat a defender straight up -- sometimes you have to shield and control the ball with your back to goal, too.You can work on moves by yourself. Set up a box and work on dribbling, cutting, and throwing movies at full speed, staying inside the box to work on control.

, The infamous Arjen Robin aside, there are few dangerous forwards who can only use one foot. Feeling comfortable on both your left and right foot greatly expands your toolkit, as good defenders will punish you if you only have one side of the field to use. Whenever doing drills, do them with both feet, and spend extra time developing your shooting and passing skills on your ""bad"" foot. It will never be as good as your dominant foot, but you'll give defenders fits if you can cut to the other direction and make a clean pass with your weak foot.

"
"
Always be looking to shoot, staying hungry for a goal.,
Dart, weave, and sprint into open space to create defensive chaos.,
Time your approach to crosses so that you hit them near full speed.,
Check to the ball instead of always running away from it.,
Challenge the defense one on one when you have space to run.,
Follow all shots and crosses into the goal.,
Come back to the midfield on defense, holding up the back defenders and waiting to receive the ball off a clearance or a punt.",How to Play Forward in Soccer2," A forwards number-one goal at all times is to put the ball on target. Even if they don't score, shooting on target creates corners, deflections, and rebounds that lead to goals and put defenses under pressure. Your mindset should always be to create the space needed to pull a shoot off for either you or your teammates.


Note that you want your team to shoot, not just you. Some forwards will get lots of direct chances, others will feed their partner forwards with good chances and take only a few themselves.

, A mobile striker is the most dangerous. Even if you don't get the ball every time, good forwards know that they need to keep the defense on their toes for 90 minutes, as this is when they make mistakes and reveal the sorts of gaps that create goals. When your team has the ball, look up for the open space and make a run.


Always be on a light jog, or on the balls of your toes, to get the jump on defenders when space opens up. They'll be looking to close down space as you try to fill it.
Keep your eye on your other forward(s). Timing runs to weave and criss-cross with them will throw the defense for an enormous loop., If you're simply standing in the box, waiting for the ball to arrive, you're incredibly easy to mark up. Instead, time your runs so that you get to the ball as it is arriving, allowing you to cut it out before the ball reaches a defender and get a running start for any jumping header. Keep your eye on the ball and reach it just as it becomes available to play and you'll win many more headers, volleys, and long balls.


This is also the best strategy to avoid offside traps, letting you go from jogging to sprinting once the ball is played instead of trying to hit full speed from standing.
Curling runs are great for making time and space. Instead of sprinting into the box straight on, take a curving path as the ball is coming down the wings, then cut straight in once the ball is in the air. Your curling run lets you approach the box on the run while still letting you change directions quickly.

, Checking means running towards the teammate with the ball, opening up space and making the pass shorter. This is particularly important when working with another striker, as the space you just ran away from is now open for him if your defender follows your check. If you don't get the ball and a defender is on you still, keep moving. If you do get the ball, try to turn to face the goal -- greatly pressuring the defense.


Always look over your shoulder quickly as you check. If you caught your defender sleeping you may have more time with the ball than you think., A striker can't be selfish, but they also can't be passive. You need to be able to run at a defender with the ball, throwing a move to beat him, sprinting around with a big touch, or sucking in the defense to make a last-second pass. Great forwards force the defense to react to them, which creates space for the rest of your team. The best times to attack are when you have the defense in motion, particularly as they track backward. Go at them, forcing them to make a decision.The wings are a good place to really challenge defenders. They usually have little support, and a turnover is much easier to win back with the sideline to your advantage.
Don't take on defenders in near the half-field unless you're sure you can beat them -- a turnover here is particularly dangerous.
Even if you lose the ball, no defender wants to be under pressure all game. They will start to break down and make mistakes -- and all you need is one goal.

, This is especially important for younger players, as inexperienced defenders and goalies will make mistakes that lead to easy goals. When you or a teammate shoots, run after the ball towards goal, ready to quickly re-shoot any rebounds, deflections, or partial saves.


It is very, very difficult to clear the ball on defense when facing your own goal. Make this job even harder and you'll pick up a few easy goals a season., You're no good to your team on defense or offense if you just sit up top and wait. Come back to midfield to keep the defenders from settling the ball and playing easy crosses in without pressure. Most importantly, be ready to check or sprint on counter-attacks. If the ball is being crossed or cleared, it is your job to hold onto possession until your team gets into offensive position."
"
Tweak your strategy and runs depending on your team's offensive system.,
As the center striker, hold the space as far up the field as the defense will let you.,
As a striker, control and direct the middle of the field quickly and efficiently, looking for shots.,
As a winger, focus on quality crosses and dangerous diagonal runs.,
Watch professional forwards with an eye towards what they do without the ball.",How to Play Forward in Soccer3," Not all forwards can play with the same style. The biggest variable is how many other strikers you're playing with, as this greatly changes how you handle yourself. If you're the only one up top, you're going to want to stay high up on the defense, spreading the field for your team. If there are three strikers, you're necessarily going to have to come back on defense at times.


The high forward, used to hold onto the middle of the field and create space, is often called a center forwards. They are big targets who hold up the ball and create offensive space for others.
Wing forwards, or wingers are basically offensive outside midfielders. They must be excellent one-on-one dribblers with great speed and crossing ability.

Strikers often hold underneath a center forward who controls the ball with his/her back to goal. Their goal is to get the ball to a striker in a dangerous position, making the striker your fastest trapper and shooter., You need to create space for the rest of the team, so hold the off-sides line as deep as the defense will let you. When you get the ball, try to turn to face the goal, but know that this isn't necessary -- you simply want to hold the ball as your teammates sprint up to support you. Your goal is to suck the defense in, forcing them to play you so that they open up oodles of space along the wings.If there are two center strikers, try staggering yourselves with one up higher and one sitting closer to the midfield. This opens up space for both of you to each sideline, as well as for dangerous combination play in the middle.

, Whether as part of a two man or three man systems, striking forwards want to get the ball facing the goal whenever possible. Strikers are trying to create just enough space to get a shot off, punishing the defense for lapses and laziness. Your bread and butter is going to be quick, one-touch passes and one-two combinations, or throwing a quick scissors and ripping a shot with space. Don't stand around with the ball -- keep it moving and always look for shots, making 10-20 yard sprints through the defense for quick, slotted passes and shots.


Shooting, even when you don't score, is useful. As defenses feel shots coming from further out, they will push up to prevent you from shooting more often. This often opens up space behind them for through passes and crosses., Attack the end line ruthlessly, driving down at defenders and forcing them to make tackles that lead to corners and deep throw-ins. Your goal is to get the ball down near the end line and then put it into the box, preferably as the defenders are running towards their own goal. Furthermore, keep your eye on the middle of the field. If the center defenders are getting lazy or seem to forget about you, a sharp diagonal run straight at goal will open you up for crosses, through balls, and shots.


As soon as your team wins the ball, get out as wide as possible. This will stretch the defense considerably, making tons of space for you and others.
Depending on the team formation, a winger may be expected to play a lot more defense than most forwards. Be sure to coordinate this with your coach and outside backs., Next time you watch a professional game, pay attention to where the forward is when they're not touching the ball. Note how good forwards are always moving, which makes the defense constantly look up and readjust. As you watch more, pay attention to how the two or three forwards work together, holding their space and crisscrossing to manipulate the defenders into creating space.


Watch both team's strikers. How does their movement differ?
What do the strikers do in different parts of the game? If a team is winning, they tend to sit back, whereas losing teams like to push strikers up further to create goal-scoring opportunities."

, It's heavier and bounces less than a soccer ball.

, Because there are only four players and a goalie, positions tend to be less structured than soccer. Everyone moves up and back.

, Futsal allows unlimited substitutions, made on the fly. The player must leave the pitch at a specific location before the sub can come on. You have to pay attention to directions from the sidelines to know when to come off.

,
* There is no Offsides Rule, which everyone likes.
* When the ball goes out of bounds, you don't throw it in. You must place the ball on the line where it went out and kick it in, and you have four seconds to do it. If you haven't kicked it by then, the other team takes possession.

Check the high school’s website for details. Make sure that you get the date and time for tryouts at your grade level.


For instance, freshmen and sophomores might be eligible for any team, whereas juniors and seniors may be required to place on a specific varsity team. Read the instructions about tryouts to find out which one you should attend.;
, If you make the team, you’ll need to balance the stresses of school with a rigorous athletic schedule. For instance, a high school soccer team may have four days of practice per week, plus games and your individual conditioning and practice.The school will most likely require that you maintain at least average academic performance in order to stay on a school team.
High schools often post team rules on their websites, so check the sports section of the school’s site for any such lists, and read them thoroughly. You want to know exactly what will be required of you.
Plan to attend every practice, meeting and game. Schools may not accept unexcused absences from practices and games, and may not even accept certain excused absences (depending on school policy).

, The Cooper Test measures how far you can run in twelve minutes, so make sure that you can run for at least twelve minutes straight. This shows coaches that you will have the stamina to run during the games. You may also be asked to sprint specific distances, such as the 40-yard dash.Practice alternating between jogging and sprinting as you build up the endurance to sprint.
Make a schedule by yourself or with a personal trainer, that works backwards on the calendar from the date of tryouts to gradually increase your speed and distance.

, There may be a roll call or the coach may ask students to give a brief introduction, such as your name and why you’re interested in making the soccer team. This will likely be followed by collective or individual warmups.Practice warmups on your own, so that you will know how to warmup before tryouts. That way, if coaches just tell you to “warm up” when you arrive at tryouts and don’t give you specific instructions, you’ll know what to do. Start with light aerobics like jogging and running backwards. Then do light stretches, holding each stretch for about ten seconds. Move on to jumping, twisting and turning. You can practice warmups with or without a ball., Coaches will likely be looking for your ability to shield, control and win the ball, regardless of which position you’re interested in playing. Practice speed dribbling, defending, and most of all scoring!, Visit the National Federation of State High School Associations at https://www.nfhs.org/activities-sports/soccer/. There you can view eBooks, PDF files and videos on the latest rules of high school soccer.

, Conditioning involves repetitive activities that improve your preparedness for sport performance. This will help you to build strength and stamina. Create a personal fitness plan for yourself.Alternate between different types of exercise so that you give your whole body proper conditioning., Incorporate stretching and jogging into your warmups and cooldowns. Gradually increase your repetitions. When you’re confident at sprinting, add ball dribbling into your sprints., It’s important to eat healthy so that your body has the fuel it needs to keep up with your athleticism. Eat when you’re hungry, and don’t skip breakfast. Eat foods that will help you build muscle, such as fiber, complex carbohydrates and lean protein.


Replace trans and saturated fats with good fats like omega 3 fatty acids., You can find lots of videos on Youtube of soccer professionals giving tips, explaining drills, and demonstrating moves. If there’s a professional soccer player you particularly admire, you can specify them in your web searches as well.


Pair keywords like “tips,” “skills,” “tricks” and “improve” with the category of skill you’d like tips in. For example, to find dribbling-related videos, enter “dribbling tips” into the search box on Youtube.
For instance, you may want to search for the name Cristiano Ronaldo or David Beckham, and add the word “tips.” You can enter this in a regular search engine or one with specifically video results, such as Google Videos.

, Becoming good at sports involves setting goals for yourself and building your self-confidence. It’s important to learn how to be a good sport, not just good at sports.


Your school most likely has a code of conduct they expect students to follow as members of the soccer team. Focus on showing good character by graciously accepting defeat when you lose and being equally courteous when you win. These are important core qualities that coaches look for and schools often demand of you.

, High school sports teams can be very competitive, and oftentimes there are more students trying out than are needed to fill the spots. Preparing yourself for this reality beforehand will make it easier on you to accept if you end up not making the cut.Make a conscious decision to look on the bright side, regardless of the outcome. If you make the team, great! If you don’t, you’ll have an entire year to hone and prepare your skills for next season’s tryouts. You may decide to try out for a soccer club instead, or focus your efforts on other skills you have, such as another sport or extracurricular hobby.

, Do ball work for about 15-30 minutes per session. Each session should involve dribbling, juggling, controlled kicking of the ball into the air, and striking the ball against the wall. There are many other common drills you can mix into your routines as well.You can find lists of soccer drills online that target specific skills, for example shooting drills or defending drills. Go to a search engine and type in “soccer practice drills.” You can further narrow down lists by age group or skill level.

, A good way to practice dribbling is the cone weave, or “cone drill.” Arrange a line of ten to fifteen cones approximately a foot and a half apart. Dribble the ball in between the cones with controlled touches as tight as possible (about a couple of inches each). Dribble the ball in between the cones in a zig-zag pattern.Try to use three touches with the inside of the foot, then three touches with the outside of your foot, and repeat.
Examples of other dribbling drills are close space drills, The George Best Game, and lane dribbling.

, Use both feet. Kick the bottom of the ball back and forth from foot to foot, using the top of your foot. Keep your feet loose. Also try using your knees, chest and head occasionally., Practice using both feet, and with correct form. Kick the ball just a couple of feet, focusing on having as little spin to the ball as possible.


For example, practice bicycle kicks to score goals backwards. Throw the ball in the air or have someone kick the ball to you. Get in the line of the balls’ flight and jump up with the opposite leg than you will kick with. Then whip your kicking leg upward to kick the ball behind you with the top of your foot., Practice basic kicks using the inside of your foot at the base of your ankle. Lock your ankle for surface area and power, and strike the ball with a quick motion.Practice “chipping” by sweeping the inside of the ball from underneath with your toe. Tilt your striking foot upward and lean your body back for more power.Look for drills that involve corner kicks, shooting on the run, improving accuracy, and using varying distance, angles, and heights., This not only helps you kick, it also gives you practice at control when the ball rebounds. Try hitting low and high targets. Practice making a second shot, as well as spinning before driving the subsequent strike at the wall.Try striking the ball continually while alternating feet.
Practice adjusting the angle of your approach prior to shooting.

, Practice passing at different distances, in both tight and wide areas. Do drills that incorporate controlling, looking and passing with speed. Aim for movement and accuracy.Examples of passing drills are Split the Defenders, No Mans Zone, and The Bank Game., Shielding is defending the ball from other players by protecting the top and sides of the ball. Roll the ball over horizontally with your foot as you move from side to side.Use four cones – try this with the cones spaced about ten feet apart in a square formation, and also with them spaced out on a larger scale. This way you can practice shielding backwards, to the left, frontwards, and to the right.
Incorporate shielding and stopping. Practice various methods of defending, for example triangling.

, Do so against a defender, whenever possible. Practice receiving the ball aerially and heading it into score., Tuck your shirt into your shorts. Wear socks, shinguards, and appropriate footwear. Don’t wear any jewelry. Wear a medical alert bracelet and a jockstrap/cup if applicable.Your cleats should fit well and shouldn’t have any sharp edges on the bottoms.

, Play the position you are the best at, if possible. Don’t be nervous. Work hard at every drill. Try to score, defend, and provide assists. Be a ball-sharer rather than a ball-hogger; incorporate a balance.


Rather than socializing, dribble or pass the ball before tryouts. Between drills and water breaks, jog instead of walk. Try to win the ball back immediately if you lose it. Be vocal while playing. All of these things will indicate your eagerness, which is a good sign to coaches., You may play a simulated game. There will likely be drills as well, which you might be timed and/or graded on.Pay close attention during all drills, even when you’re not the person being evaluated. Hustle for each drill and show enthusiasm, for example by nodding and smiling., Coaches won’t be as excited to work with you if they notice that you don’t have a good attitude and teamwork skills. On the contrary, being team-oriented and showing great effort may be even more desirable than skill, since the field is for coaching skill more than effort or work ethic. So be cooperative and upbeat!

, This is an important quality coaches look for in potential soccer players. You don’t want to act disagreeable or hot-headed. Act amenable and eager to listen and learn., The coaches will likely let the group know at some point during tryouts. If not, you can approach a coach afterwards to ask. Tryout results may be announced on the last day of tryouts, through a list at school, or on the school’s website.

You need to have written documentation for your tournament costs so that you can keep your finances organized and easily explain the costs to your funding sources. Insert all of your figures into a spreadsheet, including a contingency fund. Calculate a total cost for the tournament so that you can plan how to fund it.


Try an Excel spreadsheet for easy calculations.
Try Google sheets that you can access from any device, making it easier to input expenses from your phone.;
, You need to have a general idea of how much it will cost to rent fields for your tournament. Contact your local government, schools, and athletic clubs to ask about available fields and the rental costs. Insert the number range on your spreadsheet.


While you're asking about costs, consider getting information about rules and policies.

, Your tournament will need trophies, so contact local shops that sell them or go online. You will need to decide if you want to give participation trophies or just rank trophies. Estimate the number of trophies by multiplying the projected number of teams by the average number of team members.Your anticipated number of teams for budget purposes should be the most you can accommodate or the number of teams in your area if you're keeping it local.

, You will need referees, concession stand operators, security, cleaning crew, and people to help during game transitions. Ask other local organizers for rates they pay or go online for a pay range.


Consider asking for volunteers to referee, clean up, or work the concession stand. You may be able to make it a condition for entering the festival that the team provides a certain number of parent volunteers during times the teams are not playing.

, A concession stand can bring in a lot of money for your organization, but you need to supply it with snacks and drinks. Calculate these costs and any related costs, such as renting a booth or table.


Remember to ask about permits and codes if you plan to cook food in the concession stand.
Consider ordering pre-made food such as pizza, and include that expense in your budget.

, Sponsors can offset a lot of your costs if you’re willing to promote other organizations or events. You may even be able to partner with another organization to share the costs and the proceeds. Make sure that you get any sponsorship deals in writing and fulfill your side of the bargain.


You may be able to sell advertisements as a form of partnership. These ads can be placed on t-shirts, signs, or promotional materials that you use to advertise the tournament. Consider placing signs around the edges of the field.

, Before you can book your venue, you’ll need to choose a date so that you can make sure that the location you want is available on the day or weekend you plan to host the tournament. Your tournament should not conflict with other tournaments, and it will probably attract more established teams if you choose a date during the normal soccer season in your region.


You may need to have your tournament over a weekend, depending on how many fields you have and how many teams you plan to accommodate. Make sure that you budget enough time for games.

, Your tournament will need to allow for at least one playing field, though more fields will allow for more teams to enter. Refer to the list of fields you called during budgeting to choose the best one.Call local facilities, particularly those that already host soccer games.
Consider how many teams will be playing in your tournament to help you find your field needs.
You may be able to get the field for free as a sponsorship opportunity. For example, a local school may allow you to use their field if you promote them as a sponsor.

, Your tournament will draw spectators who will want a comfortable means of watching the teams play. Don’t count on your spectators to bring their own seating. You need to choose a field that has seating, such as stands., The field you choose should have nearby bathrooms. If you think that you won’t have enough bathrooms to accommodate your event, consider renting porta potties.


You may also want to provide changing facilities., You will likely need to purchase insurance for your tournament’s use of the field, so ask the field owner how much insurance you will need to purchase. You also need to find out what you need to do to prepare the field and clean it after the tournament., Choose a name that will attract attention and tell people what kind of tournament it is. Depending on the size of your area or the type of your organization, you may want to include the area’s or organization’s name in the tournament. Teams are more likely to want to participate in a tournament that sounds elite or like it’s for a good cause, so keep that in mind.


For example, if you are raising money for something like a charity or school playground, you could call your tournament “St. Marks Playground Benefit Soccer Tournament.”
Alternatively, a tournament in a large area could be called “Uniting Houston Soccer Tournament.”
If you want to try something fun, you could name it “Just for Kicks Soccer Tournament.”
An elite tournament name could be “Bay City Cup Soccer Tournament.”

, Using volunteers will allow you to collect more proceeds since you won’t have to hire as much staff. Contact local colleges and civic organizations to look for volunteers to help with refereeing matches, serving concessions, picking up trash, providing directions to guests, monitoring the area, reminding people of the rules, and other basic duties.


If you plan to require teams to supply volunteers, consider that when recruiting.
It’s better to have too many volunteers than too few.
Don’t use volunteers for security unless they work in law enforcement or security. Instead, rent a few security officers by the hour.

, By setting rules, you can make sure that you fulfill the obligations that you agreed to when renting the field, such as keeping it clean and not destroying the turf. You can also set standards for good sportsmanship and protect yourself in case of an incident. For example, having established rules can allow you to remove someone who is behaving inappropriately.Example rules include: No littering, no hitting, no profanity, no altering of facility property, and no food on the field.

, Make sure that the authorities know about your tournament in case there’s an emergency. You can also ask them if they have any recommendations to keep your tournament safe or if there are any laws that you may not be aware of relating to tournaments like yours.You may want to hire off-duty police officers to serve as your security personnel.

, Tell the public about your tournament by posting signs or ads about your tournament. Ask local clubs and schools if you can include your tournament in their newsletter or if you can post the information in a location where soccer players or coaches will see it. Be sure to provide details on how to register the teams, such as your email contact and telephone number.


Hang fliers in local sporting good stores or near athletic clubs.
Publish ads in the newspaper and on local internet sites.

, Go to where the teams are to tell them about your tournament. If your area doesn’t have a local soccer organization, call the local athletic clubs or little league organizations, depending on your target age group.

, If your area doesn’t have established teams, you can still have a tournament if you encourage the community to create their own teams just for your tournament. This can work especially well for adults since many adults enjoyed playing sports as youths but no longer get to play on organized teams as adults. Teams can be built around workplaces, churches, and social groups.

, Have each team provide registration details, including the team name, a team contact, and a roster of players. If your tournament is ordering t-shirts, it’s a good idea to have players submit their sizes during registration to make it easier to distribute shirts during the tournament. You can register teams by email or via a website that specializes in registrations.


Ask teams to pay all or part of the entry fee at registration so that teams don’t back out.
Get a team roster so that you know how many trophies to order.
Get t-shirt sizes so that you can create a bundle for each team, making it easier to distribute the shirts at check-in.

, After registrations are in, build a schedule and tournament bracket that allows each team proper play. Make sure that you have enough time for each game, as well as time to clean up between matches. When you finalize the schedule, make copies so that each team will have access to it on the day or weekend of the tournament.

, Wait to buy supplies until after you have an idea about how many teams will participate. Supplies will include trophies, concessions food, signs, check-in materials, and t-shirts if you have them. You may need to order food in advance, so contact your supplier to find out what you need to do to be ready on tournament day.

, To be professional, your tournament should be ready to go before participants start to arrive. Go out to the field the day before to make sure that the facility looks good and then get to the field early in the morning to set up the check in table and concessions stands.


Tell your volunteers the exact time that they should arrive so that they don’t assume that it’s at the start of the tournament. Otherwise, you may be setting up alone.

, Your volunteers need to know what their job is and how to properly do it. While some can do double-duty, don’t just expect your volunteers to do every job. Set them times to be on duty and where they should be working.


For example, a volunteer assignment could be 1 pm-3 pm in the concession stand or 8 am-10 am providing directions near the entrance.

, A team representative should be expected to come check in with you or your tournament staff. Put the check-in location in a central area, such as near the gates to the field or where most people enter the field from the parking lot. Provide a copy of the tournament rules, the playing schedule, and a map to each team representative.


Try using a table or booth to make the check-in area more noticeable.
If your tournament has t-shirts, you can distribute shirts during check-in. Bundle the shirts by team name, and then you can hand each bundle to the team’s representative.

Learn small moves to trick the opposite team.",How to Play Indoor Soccer," Soccer is a relatively simple game in that the objective is simply to get the ball into the opposite team’s goal box. Getting the ball into the goal box scores the team one point and is known as a goal.


There are two teams in a soccer game and they face each other on a field, with the goal boxes placed at opposite ends of the field. Therefore, the players must compete to get possession of the ball in the opposite team’s territory and eventually shoot it into the goal to score a point.A typical game involves one team dribbling (running with the ball at their feet) the ball up the field and passing it amongst each other to get it close enough for one player to shoot a goal. The opposite team also tries to take possession throughout so oftentimes the ball moves throughout both sides of the field.;
, Perhaps the most important rule of soccer is that players (with the exception of the goalkeeper) cannot touch the ball with their hands or arms while the ball is in play.


Players also cannot tackle, push, hit, or otherwise intentionally hurt or sabotage their opponents.
If the ball goes out of the field, the team that caused the ball to go out loses possession and the other team is allowed to kick or throw the ball back into the game. However, indoor soccer differs in this respect as, depending on the venue, it is often impossible for the ball to go out of the field as it simply bounces back in off the walls.

, Each soccer team is roughly divided into defense and offense, with different players having specific objectives, such as shooting the ball or defending. With indoor soccer, there is less differentiation between the players so, though they are assigned the following positions, they have more flexibility and move around the field more freely than in outdoor soccer.Two people are assigned in the defense position and help the goalie prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal.
Two other players start by standing a few feet in front of the defenders and they are known as forwards. They are on the offensive, meaning they work to play the ball into the opposite side of the field to score a goal.
One person plays midfielder and begins at the very front and center of their team’s side of the field. This person plays both forward and defense as needed.
The same rules apply to each player regardless of their position with the only exception being the goalkeeper (also known as a goalie). The goalie is the last line of defense against the opposing team and is allowed to use their hands to catch or block the ball from going into the goal box., A soccer game begins with a kickoff and ends after a set period of time, with the team having the most goals by the end designated as the winner. A professional soccer match is 90 minutes long, but the length of time can vary depending on the type, whether either team has scored or not, and so on.A kickoff is when both teams take their positions on their halves of the field with the ball at the center of the field and two players on either side. Once the referee calls the game into play, the two players try to take possession of the ball first. A kickoff begins the game and also restarts it after a goal has been scored.

, The referee is responsible for overseeing the game and making sure that the players abide by the rules. The referee also signals the beginning and end of the game and gives the ultimate call on who wins.


Referees can give out different cards when someone has broken the rules of the game, which is known as a “foul.” When the referee sees a player fouling (by pushing another player for example), they can give the player a yellow card which indicates a warning.
If a player gets two yellow cards, they are ejected from the game and the team must play on without a substitute player. If a referee decides a player has committed a number of fouls or one that indicates extremely poor sportsmanship, he can give a player a red card which automatically ejects them from the game., Indoor and outdoor soccer varies in some crucial ways (mostly due to the smaller size of the field for indoor soccer), including the different positions players can be in. With indoor soccer, there are only 6 players, including the goalkeeper, on each team.


The players that would normally be considered defense or forward have more flexibility in their roles and can play both offensive and defensive roles. Basically, all players (including the goalie) have more freedom to move around in the arena and are less bound to one specific function in the game.

, Because indoor soccer is played in a smaller, enclosed area, there are certain rules that differ from outdoor soccer. Many of these rules are similar to other arena sports.


Players can be substituted at any point during the game.For example, with indoor soccer the game continues without any penalties or stoppage if the ball hits the walls enclosing the field. The game simply continues with each player rushing to take possession of the ball. This practice is known as “play off the walls.”Only if the ball goes over the walls and out of the field entirely is there a stoppage and the team that didn’t strike out the ball is allowed to throw or punt it back in (as in outdoor soccer). However, some indoor arenas have walls that completely enclose the area, in which case it is impossible for the ball to go out of bounds.

, Though there are many differences between indoor and outdoor soccer, the overall objective and methods of playing are more similar than they are different. Therefore, knowing the similarities will help you pick up the mechanics of indoor soccer more quickly.


For example, standard rules of no contact apply in indoor soccer. You cannot hit, intentionally kick, or otherwise physically obstruct another player during the game.
The method of scoring a goal is also the same. To score a goal, a player must kick the ball into the opposing team’s goal box, passing over the goal line, between the posts, and under the crossbar.If the referee calls a foul for breaking a rule (such as using your hands), the same rule of a free kick on the part of the opposite team applies.

, Professional indoor soccer matches are played for sixty minutes at a time, in quarter increments with three minutes of rest between each quarter and a fifteen minute break at halftime.However, in casual games and nonprofessional leagues, the amount of play time and breaks differ so either find out beforehand or, if you are creating your own game with friends, decide ahead of time how to divvy up the playing time.


If a professional indoor soccer game is tied, there can be two extra fifteen minute halves of playtime with the agreement that the team that scores a goal first wins the game.

, Just as with outdoor soccer, you will need a pair of shin guards, long socks, and shoes. However, instead of outdoor soccer cleats, you will need a pair of indoor soccer shoes, which differ by having flat outsoles.Lightweight sneakers or running shoes can also work in a pinch, but you will not have the same speed and ease of movement.

, If you are an outdoor soccer player adapting to playing indoors, spend some time getting used to juggling the ball indoors. Whether you are playing on astroturf or a hard, smooth surface, the ball will have far less traction and you will likely have to move your feet more quickly to control the ball across the field.

, Indoor soccer is faster-paced than outdoor soccer, which will keep you in shape and also sharpen your playing skills but the rapid pace will take some getting used to.


Focus on making quick passes and small, controlled movements with your feet until playing faster comes naturally.
Be more verbally communicative. Because the game is so fast and you are in an enclosed space, expect to talk to your teammates more. Oftentimes you may deliver a pass only to find yourself in a great spot to receive the ball again. In these moments, it’s best to yell “pass” or otherwise let your teammates know where you are positioned.

, In indoor soccer arenas, the goals are generally recessed into the walls and are also smaller.Because of this, it’s important to shoot as accurately as possible.


Practice shooting on your own or with a buddy. Try different shots, such as always aiming for just below the crossbar (requiring the goalie to jump in order to block it).

, Perhaps the biggest difference between indoor and outdoor soccer is that you can play off the wall. Professional indoor soccer players will use the walls to their advantage by kicking the ball against the wall to get past an advancing opponent.Practice intentionally kicking the ball against the wall to either pass it to someone or to get past the opposite team. Be patient with yourself however, as this is a very complex skill that will take lots of practice to develop over time.

, Indoor soccer is much more physically challenging than outdoor, as the plays are quicker and each player is engaged more or less constantly throughout the game.


Running (including sprints), lifting weights, and doing other exercises that build your muscles and also increase your speed will help you improve as an indoor soccer player.

, Small movements are vital in indoor soccer as you want to constantly have the upperhand by faking out the other team. Having a set of tricks up your sleeve will make you a better soccer player and give your team an edge.


For example, when shooting the ball, try doing a toe-kick. Since distance isn’t as much of a factor in shooting, shooting the ball using your toes will cause the ball to suddenly jump upwards, which can fool the goalie into not blocking it in time.Instead of passing the ball directly to where a team player is standing, pass the ball into the space where the player is most likely to get possession. The player will be able to see the ball’s course and get likely get there in time to take possession before the opposing team can steal the ball.Another great skill is the Drag Back. To do a Drag Back, roll the ball back under your foot (as opposed to dribbling it forward) and bring it closer to yourself. By doing this, you are protecting possession and also giving yourself more opportunities to either move the ball in a different direction or do a quick pass."

The best position for a nutmeg is when the defenders legs are spaced at least 20–30 centimeter (7.9–11.8 in) apart. This usually happens in a standing position when you are going one on one with the defender.
, You need to stand in such a way that the two of you face each other, since this makes it easier to place the leg. With experience and expertise, you can nutmeg anyone from almost any angle., You need to kick the ball as though it is a pass i.e. you have to kick it with your side foot. the power needs to be about 70 percent, so that it isn't so slow that the defender can react, and not so fast that you cannot do the follow up, A nutmeg is not complete unless and until you get the ball after you get the ball through.

You are not able to use your hands unless you're a goalkeeper.
The game must start with a kickoff from the centre line.
The ball is out of play once it has fully crossed the sidelines.
A goal only counts if the ball goes over the goal line and without an offside play.
If your team kicks the ball out of the sidelines, the other team throws it in (and vice versa).
If your team kicks the ball out of play on the line behind the goal, the other team gets a corner kick. If the other team kicks it out, your team gets a goal kick.
When doing a throw-in, both feet must remain on the ground and your hands must go behind your head.

, When dribbling, keep the ball close to you. Don't kick it very far away from you so that you need to speed up to get it again. Lightly move the ball forward with the outside of your foot. Start out by walking and dribbling. Once you've mastered that, move on to jogging and dribbling at the same time, and then sprinting and dribbling. Finally, you may want to try out some simple tricks(consider watching YouTube tutorials).

, When passing, kick the ball with the inside of your foot. Don't kick it with your toes. Adjust the force that you kick the ball with according to how far away from you the player that you're trying to get the ball to is. Don't kick it too hard, because they might not be able to receive it, but don't kick it so lightly that it won't reach them.

, When shooting, the ball should make contact on the lace area of your foot. The rule for shooting is to take a few steps back, place one foot(standing foot) beside the ball, and then kick it with your other foot(stronger foot). Practice doing this, and then eventually you'll be able to do it without thinking about it.

, Most players are right-footed, so left-footed players have an advantage. Players that are able to use both feet effectively are the ultimate threat.

, Make sure to look up before passing and shooting so that you can determine where you want the ball to go. Bring a friend/family member outside and practice passing to them from different distances. Then practice shooting on net. The more you practice this, the better you'll get.

, If the ball is coming towards you in the air, perform a header. Position yourself so that the ball hits you at approximately where your hairline starts. It shouldn't hit you in the face or too far back on your head. This skill takes a while to master, but it's worth it.

, You can't use your hands in soccer, but you can use basically every other part of your body. If the ball is coming to you, stop it by letting the ball hit your chest, knee, or foot. Don't be scared of the ball.

, These not only look great and will impress others, but they're often used to get or keep the ball away from the other team.

, To do a good throw in, grab the ball in both hands, put your hands behind your head, and throw it as far as you can. Make sure to keep your hands behind your head and both feet on the ground at all times, or else the referee will call it and also your chest must be facing the direction you are throwing the ball to.

Play fairly, at all times.,
Stay calm under difficult conditions.,
Support and encourage your teammates at all times.,
Pay attention to the shape of your team and the shape of the opposition team.,
Play as hard as you can in practices and in games.,
Show respect to your coaches, referees, and your opponents; win or lose.,
A good soccer player must have conditioning, skills and tactical knowledge.",How to Play Good Soccer3," Play according to the spirit and letter of the rules. If you cheat, other players might not want to play with you and/or give you positions that you don't like.

, It's easy to maintain composure when things go right; when they don't real athletes step forward and stand up to the test.

, All of us make mistakes at times and they are not done on purpose. When your teammates make a mistake, don't beat them up physically or emotionally. Tell them that it's okay and that they'll do better next time. Encourage your teammates to be the best they can be, and congratulate them when they make a good play or score a goal.

, A player should be constantly looking around, taking glances at the other players on the pitch to see where the opportunities are when attacking or where the weakness is when defending. If you spot a weakness when defending communicate that to your team mates immediately to rectify the situation before its too late. If you see your team mates out of position when attacking tell them - so as a team you rectify the situation and be more effective in attack. By constantly assessing the position of other players on the pitch you will be able to decide what you should do with the ball before you receive it - this will speed up your play and make you a much more effective player.


Concentrate on your work off the ball (as a team and as an individual) more than you work on the ball as in a typical game an individual player will spend have the ball for only a few minutes in the 90 minutes of a game - the whole team will probably be in possession for less than 40 minutes so what you do off the ball is very important if you want to be a good footballer. A good team will, when not in possession, close down the opposition and cut off their options to pass to their team mates - then when in possession the players off the ball in a good team will be running into space and giving their teammate on the ball plenty of options. Work as a team and that means concentration for the whole period of the game not only when you are on the ball but also when you are off the ball.

, You need to give 110% all the time. Never be beaten because of lack of effort. Even opponents who are bigger or more skilled than you can be beaten if you out-hustle them.

, Having the 'Spirit of Sportsmanship' gives your game a bit of a boost and also earns you a bit of respect within the coaches, team and opponents!

, A player must work on all three to be the best they can be.

Do not just ""kick"" the ball unless it is in a dangerous position in front of your goal.,
Always maintain your position.,
When defending close to your goal, the player closest to the ball should attack the ball.,
On the defensive side of the field, always move the ball toward the touch lines and away from the middle of the field.,
Good ball handlers pass the ball before they get into trouble not after they are in trouble.,
Make no small strikes on the ball.,
Take your shot.,
Don't limit yourself to shots taken only near the goal line.,
Always be aware of protecting possession of the ball.,
When on offense always ""support"" your teammate with the ball.,
Don't be afraid to get aggressive.,
Win, lose or tie.,
Always wear comfortable outfits and footwear.",How to Play Good Soccer4," Kicking the ball to nobody in particular may result in a goal being scored against you. Instead, either pass the ball to a teammate or shoot it. Look up before passing/shooting so that you can aim the ball. Always send the ball to someplace or someone.

, Don't just run around, following the movement of the ball. Know where you are on the field in relation to where the other players and positions are on the field.

, The other defenders should ""mark"" other opponents who could receive and shoot the ball. In ""marking up"" your opponent, you should position yourself between the ball and your opponent and prevent them from receiving the ball. A common error on defense is to have too many defenders move to the ball, leaving opponents open to receive a pass and score an unopposed goal.

, On the offensive side of the field move the ball toward the centre, where your teammates can take a good shot on goal. This is ""centering"" the ball.

, Don't hog the ball. Pass it to your teammates.

, Whether clearing, passing or shooting, move the ball. Proper technique on striking the ball will enable even small players to effectively move the ball a good distance.

, Don't hesitate to fire a shot if you feel an opportunity. Shoot into the back of the net. Shoot where the keeper isn't.

, Good opportunities for goals are hard shots taken further out from the goal. Keep your head up, shoot, and follow through the ball for the goal.

, Resist ""kicking"" the ball directly into the shin guards of the defender in front of you. Passing or dribbling the ball laterally or even backwards can be a better choice if it maintains possession of the ball.

, Supporting your teammate means being in a position where they can pass the ball to you. Stay far enough away so the pass effectively neutralizes the defender. Stay close enough so they can make a good pass. If you are too far to make a good pass to your teammate, then you are too far for your teammate to make a good pass to you, and you are not supporting them or the play.

, You can't push, trip, punch, kick, or slap other players without getting a penalty, but don't be afraid to shove them with your shoulder to get the ball. Soccer is a contact sport, after all.

, If you have given 100%, when you walk off the field, know that you have nothing to regret and no reason to be ashamed. Just be proud of who you are! Whether you scored an own-goal or missed a few goals just remember that accidents happen, and you just have to practice more on your game play strategies!

, Wearing comfortable outfits and footwear lets your body feel comfy during the game and increases your chances of playing better. Wearing shoes that are too tight make your foot pain or strain your legs while running. Also wearing loose shoes increase the chances of the shoes coming out and someone getting hurt. Take care, play safe.

Improve and maintain your fitness.,
Eat right.,
Add in your own training sessions.,
Make sure you seem really enthusiastic and enjoy yourself.,
Show just the right amount of aggression.,
Be confident, on and off the pitch.,
Make sure you are confident playing in a number of different positions and roles.,
Show good restraint on and off the pitch.",How to Make the Soccer Team1," This is very important; if the coaches see you out of breath after a light jog they'll think you don't have the stamina to perform well for a full 90 minute game. If you are getting ready for trials make sure to start a fitness program roughly 2 months before to improve your muscular and cardiovascular endurance, or just try to maintain a good level of fitness all year round. 



Fartlek training is good for simulating the different intensities of a soccer match, it involves working at different intensities and/or across different terrains. Although, you should progress gradually and always perform a warm up and cool down with your workouts to reduce the risk of injury.;
, Reduce the amount of fat and sugar in your diet. Try to eat foods with more carbohydrates, to give you a long-lasting energy supply, and protein, to help your muscles grown and recover quicker.


An example of a good pre-match or pre-training meal would be tuna and pasta.

, This is especially useful if you are struggling to perform a specific skill, such as long passing. The more you practise, the more natural and fluent the movements will become. It will help to develop muscle memory if you repeat skills over and over again. Practise really does make perfect.

, If the coaches see you sulking or complaining they will be concerned about your attitude and work ethic.

, You need to be confident enough to go in for the ball, even when you might get hurt, but equally the coaches and manager won't want you making wild challenges or getting into fights. You need good sportsmanship and compassion whilst still being driven to win.

, On the pitch you need to communicate effectively and make important, split second decisions. Off the pitch, try to get to know the other people in the team/trial and ask the coaches questions if you want useful tips or don't understand something. This will make you seem enthusiastic and it will show you can work well as part of a team and inspire others if you can both get on with your team and work together effectively on the pitch.

, Don't limit yourself to only being able to play in one position. Coaches and managers like to be able to use players in several positions. So, if you are normally a striker try to develop your game as a centre forward and attacking midfielder as well. Same for defenders; if you normally play as a centre back, try out the roles of a full-back and defensive midfielder. This shows you are adaptable and the manager will be able to use you in more positions.

, There are times where other players or people may taunt you or try to cheat, but as a good player, you need to show that you are in control and you are above retaliation. Managers want players who will positively reflect on the entire club.

Behave.,
Study hard.,
Listen to the coach.,
Show commitment.",How to Make the Soccer Team2," Many school will not allow you to play if you are regularly misbehaving in class. This applies on the pitch as well, play fair and be a good sportsperson.

, If you are failing any subjects, the school may ban you from participating because they think it may be affecting your grades. Make sure you always have time to complete homework and any catching up you need to do.

, High school coaches often pick players for the team that they know will listen to their instructions and can be trusted to do their best.

, Turn up to as many training sessions as you can, the coach will get a better idea of your abilities and you will improve more.

Get contact numbers for your potential teammates.,
Socialise and be friendly.,
Turn up regularly.",How to Make the Soccer Team3," This will help a lot with communication if the team doesn't have an designated manager and doesn't play in an official league.

, In casual teams, one of the most important things is that you all get on with each other and can work well together as a team.

, It is accepted that you will miss some training and possibly even matches due to work or school commitments and the odd special occasion, but you should try to turn up as often as possible. This will send a message, that you are committed and reliable.

Get soccer boots.,
Be creative.,
Be confident.,
Dribble.,
Humiliate defenders.,
Dribble the ball with the laces of your boot, don't kick it with the front side of the boot.,
Do footsteps once you're dribbling, this will act as betterment for your ball control.,
Do less touches.,
Watch Maradona.,
Practice.,
Have fun.",How to Play Like Diego Maradona," Obviously, you can't play without a pair of boots. Once you do plan on getting a pair of those, always go for the one that are light, and have less studs. This enables you to dribble and change your pace much easier.;
, Creativity is one of the few things that can help you get much more clever on the ball. Always make love with the ball, dance with it, and do any trick that comes to your mind with it. Create imaginary defenders and dribble past them.

, Never be reluctant once you're in possession of the ball, Maradona never ever hesitated once he had the ball. Even if you're a professional player, seeing those thousands of people watch you should give you confidence and strength, not the opposite of it.

, Dribbling was the main aspect of Maradona's game. if you want to surpass Maradona or just be like him, you have to master the art of dribbling. Practice by juggling and doing inside&outside touches. These exercises are very essential and will you far more skillful on the ball.

, Maradona brutally humiliated and dribbled past any defender that had the motive to steal the ball from him. Always try to change the direction of the ball once a defender is near, this is what Maradona did. If you see a defender coming right at you, use your left/right foot to dribble past him. For example, if a defender is coming from the middle, use your left foot to kick the ball to the right side and then use your right foot to stop the ball once you kick it to your right. Always dribble around defenders, and in tight spaces.

, This will only worsen your ball control and you will not be able to dribble that well. Maradona always dribbled the ball with the laces of his boots.

, Michael Jackson's foot-dance practicing will help you a lot too, this might sound a little funny but it actually does work.

, Touches will make your ball go a little forward and this is not what you want to do.

, Of course, if you want to be like El Diego, then you have to watch him play. See footages of his dribbling skills on YouTube or somewhere else and try to copy his foot-tricks.

, If you want to be a fantastic footballer then you'll have to work hard and practice regularly. As the famous-saying goes, ""practice makes perfect."" Players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Eden Hazard and Franck Ribery practice a lot and this is the main reason why they're so good. Spend your time with the ball daily.

, This is the most important thing, you need to have pleasure, and great amount of joy once you're playing football. Don't let anybody let you down, keep working hard and one day, you might even be on television!

Get the ball.,
Keep your head up so you can see the field - you need to know where you want to move before you go.,
Run directly at the defender before you make your move, do not run to the left or right of the defender if at all possible as you will have to cover more distance if you intend to cut back to the opposite side.,
In general you will not have enough time to make more than one move as the defense will be coming at you from behind.

,
Experienced defenders are taught to watch your hips, not your head or torso.,
As get to within 1–3 yards (0.9–2.7 m) of the defender, lead him to pursue you in the direction opposite that which you intend to go.,
If it appears that the defender is committed to pursuing you in that direction, great!,
Use the arm closest to the defender to bat away his hands or even lay a nice stiff arm.,Pull your feet forward and high; the last thing you want is to be ""shoestring"" tackled after dusting a defender

",How to Juke or Dodge a Defender in Football (Soccer)," Spot the defender who's about to tackle you.;
, The center of the field is usually the best side to run to as it gives you more space to run free. The sideline is the defense's 12th man. Because of this, it may be useful to juke towards the sideline, then quickly dart in the other direction.

, Running directly at the defender will make your move less predictable too.

,, An inexperienced defender (or in the case of a simple pick up game) will watch shoulders; use this to your advantage. Juke with your shoulders rotating in the opposite direction of where you intend to cut back.

, Do this by twitching your hips or wiggling your shoulders in that direction.

, You're one step closer to leaving him in the dust, quickly plant the foot opposite the direction you want to go, shift your weight, rotate your hips, push off with both feet and explode in the new direction (you may need to make this first move completely lateral depending on how good your initial move was).

, If the defender is really close, you can also lower your shoulder and give the guy a really hard hit under the chin or in the chest. 75% of the time, the guy will let go. If done correctly, this can cause plenty of damage.

One of the benefits of our research while creating Blast The Ball™ is we were able to work with players at all levels from all over the world. The “not so shocking” findings to us may surprise you. There are soccer players at the most advanced levels of play that can’t perform all the different types of kicks correctly. If they can, they often can’t perform them with both feet. Understanding the exact and correct form is essential for the development of advancing players. Curing the toe kick is often the first step.;
, It really is quite easy to understand if you take the time to study the progression, the cause and the cure. We spent 18 months studying every phase of the soccer kick from 6 year olds all the way to professional players. Once we captured this “evolution” on video and slowed it down, it became quite evident why we kick with toe and the steps to cure it.


First understand how we first start to kick a ball. Very young players really don’t go into a “kicking mode”. They are simply running at the ball and when they think they are close, or their foot makes contact with the ball, they “push” their leg through the shot. They are simply trying to force the leg forward so it moves the ball. During this stage there is no “forethought” to the soccer kick. (This could be called the ‘collision’ stage.) Kicking the ball is simply an afterthought that combines with the running gate of the player.
As players mature they learn that the harder they “push through” the shot, the farther the ball goes. This seems great in their eyes, but it starts a habit that is hard to cure. Some even “push through” so hard they fall onto the ground after a shot.

, It is the natural foot position. When we run or walk, our foot changes position. At the end of our stride our toe is naturally facing down because we have just finished “pushing off” the ball of our foot or toe area. As our foot comes forward in a walking or running stride the toe naturally returns to the forward pointing position.

, Concentrate on their foot position at the end or back of their stride and then watch as it comes forward. The toe naturally starts to swing forward and upward. Then ask them to walk or jog with their toe pointed down as long as possible. The result is a child or adult “high stepping” across the floor like a Clydesdale horse. The problem is that this “unnatural position” is really what we are asking them to do when we tell them to kick with their laces.

, Note that only adults are allowed to do this. Kick like a toe kicker. Yes, kick wrong. Let your foot swing through naturally just like it was a walking or jogging stride. Your foot stays very close to the ground. Now, without changing anything else, point your toe to the ground and swing your leg through again. If you did this properly, you are now cursing. You are grabbing your foot because your toe struck the ground as you came through and you severely strained the muscles on the top of your foot. Don’t worry. There will be some minor swelling and you will limp for the next 4 days, but hey, if we ask our kids to do this, why shouldn’t we try it? So how do we start to teach this “unnatural” movement? We created Blast The Ball™ video and research program because much of this is hard to describe in writing. We will give it our best shot.

, This unnatural movement or change takes time. You will practice it and it will look good. Then, come game time, the child will revert back to the movement that is instinctive. Eventually the new kick will become a muscle memory or instinctive.

, Most youth players step their plant foot well behind the ball. This causes the ball to be struck on the “upward swing” and naturally kicked by the toe. Having them step next to or even slightly past the ball forces the ball to be further back in the swing circle.

, We have an entire section devoted to the “soccer hop” on Blast The Ball™. It is the slight hop or large stride just before kicking a soccer ball. Just as in any sport such as baseball, golf, tennis etc, when you are going to come forward to hit a ball, you must first load or have a backswing. The entire leg will come back and with “power shooters” you will notice the load or backswing is so large that the sole of the foot almost touches their “behind”. Now instead of a “push” we are preparing to release and kick.

, No, not by surgery, but by maintaining the “V” position of the leg all the way through the swing. When our leg is in the backswing and just starting to come forward, there is a strong “V” position. We want players to maintain this “V” all the way through the shot. Stand up with both feet close together. Raise the kicking hip slightly, and then bend the knee slightly. You must do both. You will notice that if you hold this position you can point your toe down and swing your leg back and forth. Your toe will not hit the ground. While the shape and size of the “V” will change through the kick, it should never totally disappear. (No locking straight leg.)

, We teach the many different styles of correct kicking. One is the straight kick which has no angle approach or “wrap around” leg swing. With the straight kick, the ball IS struck with the laces. However, the angle kick has an angled approach and the leg will slightly swing across and around to our front. This angle arch also allows the toe to be pointed slightly “outward” requiring less “shorting” of the leg and less chance or the dreaded “toe stub”. When working with young players, the angle kick is taught first.

, When we use the angle kick, we really are NOT kicking with the “laces”. We are kicking the ball with the “first metatarsal”. In simple terms that is the bone just above the “knuckle” of the big toe. This is the largest bone in the foot and when the ankle is locked, creates a huge amount of impact force.

, (For right footed kickers.) This applies to the angle kick because we are approaching the ball from an angle. Striking the ball in the center will cause the impact to be more of a “glancing blow” and create a huge amount of side spin.

Position the ball with the valve facing you.,
Take five steps back to the right if you're right footed or to the left if you're left footed.And then take one and a half steps to the left.,
Plant your non-kicking foot and lean forward.,
Contact the ball just below the centre of the ball center with your instep.,
Follow through.",How to Kick Like Cristiano Ronaldo1," This is optional although it can give the ball better flight movement in the air. When Ronaldo takes a free kick, he always lines up the ball so the valve will make contact with his foot. It's difficult to know if this contact has any real effect on the trajectory of the ball or if it's just superstition, but it can't hurt to try., He then stands with his arms straight down and his legs spread very wide, more than shoulder-width. As he approaches, he works a distinctive stutter-step into his kicks. Taking a few quick stutters tends to throw off the goalkeepers and other defenders, so they won't know exactly when the kick is coming.








, Plant your other foot beside the ball and to the opposite side of your strong foot to get the proper angle for an upward arch of the ball.









His free-kicks tend to go up high very quickly, seeming to explode off his foot. This comes from the quick and short follow through right after making contact with the ball. Done properly, the kick won't spin, but will arc up, then dip back down quickly, or zig-zag according to the power put in with the follow-through., You want to make contact on the ball with the long bone in your foot that runs from your big toe to the top of your foot. Aim for the nozzle valve that you faced toward you at the beginning of the kick.









To give it the knuckle-ball effect, you need to avoid putting any English or spin on the ball whatsoever. Try to hit the ball just below the middle but not too low so that it doesn't take backspin.Not rolling it off your foot at all.

, The most important part of the kick is the follow-through. Follow through by pointing your kicking foot where you want the ball to go, swiveling around toward your target and driving your plant foot off the ground and up into the air. Bring your kicking knee straight up instead of the more traditional follow-through in which you end up to the side.









Imagine you wanted to make the knee of your kicking foot touch your chin after you make contact with the ball. Done properly, your kicking foot should hit the ground first. Now stand back and watch your knuckle-ball in all its unpredictable glory.

While strategy and teamwork can be coached, you can build fundamental skills on your own to put yourself ahead of the curve. If everyone else is ready to learn strategy and plays, but you're still working on your dribbling, you're likely to be cut.



Practice dribbling, keeping the ball in as close as possible to your body, and keeping your head up while you dribble.Practice trapping the ball with your feet, your thigh, and your chest, and making controlled touches as you dribble.

Practice your passing, making short, crisp passes that stay close to the ground.;
, Accurate shooting is another essential skill for offensive players, and knowing how to score can make you stand out during tryouts. Practice your foot placement and your accuracy.Practice your approach to the ball, placing your plant foot just behind the ball when you want to get some air under it, and just ahead of it when you want to keep the shot low. Practice driving the top of your foot, along the laces, through the ball, keeping your head down as you shoot.
Not all players need to be able to shoot the ball, but learning to make accurate passes and crossed is a good skill for all players. If you're a defender, practice taking free kicks and corner kicks, passing to open players, instead of working on your shot placement.

, Learning to play from both sides will make you a versatile player, someone who can fill in all over the field. It's very difficult to cut a player who is equally effective on the right and the left, so it's smart to work on developing your weak side as much as possible.


Practice controlling your short dribbles as you run at high speed with your weak-side foot. If you can do this, you'll be an effective ball handler.

, Learning to get the ball from your opponents is just as important as what you do with it. Soccer is a fast-paced game that shifts back and forth between offense and defense, meaning that even primarily offensive players need to learn to mark-up and intercept the ball.


Do lateral runs, moving your feet from side-to-side, to keep your shuffle step faster than the competition.
Practice your vision as well, working on your visual acuity, to keep your eye-on-ball skills sharp.

, Soccer players run an average of 2-5 miles per game (or about 3-8 kilometers), and by some estimates as many as 7-10.While you may not run quite that much at the youth level, it's still true that soccer requires great endurance and stamina, meaning you'll need to build up your breath-support and ability to run around at high speed as much as possible.


Even if you're not a big fan of running, try working on your distance endurance, running at a low or moderate speed for 15 or 20 minutes at a time.
Many teams do team workouts and strength training over the summer, before the season starts. If you want to make the team, it's important to go to these workouts.

, If you want to make the team, watch professional soccer matches. Go to games and watch in person, or watch on television, to get more a sense of strategy and off-the-ball motion. Learn as much as you can about your sport, and how to play it well.Try keying in on a single player and watching how they negotiate the game, rather than just watching the ball. Where does your player move, off the ball? What does your player do that you wouldn't do?

, Every player needs to work on something, and learning what your weak spots are is an essential part of making the team. Showing that you're committed to improvement will make you stand out from the field. Listen to your coaches to find out what your weak spots are, and try to identify them yourself.


Do your passes often get intercepted? Work on making sharper, more accurate passes and keeping your head up to look for available options on the field.
Do you often get beat to the ball? Work on getting faster, increasing your cardio endurance and your on-field awareness.
Do your fundamentals need work? Practice dribbling, shooting, and trapping the ball with both feet.

, At the youth level, soccer games often look like a 20-headed mob running after the ball all at once. It works for rec soccer, but if you're going to start competing for a team, it's essential that you learn to space out and move around to give your teammates passing options and spread the field out. Coaches try to teach this more than almost anything else, and the more a sense of moving to space you demonstrate, the better chance you'll have of making the team.

, Depending on what position you want to play, and what skills you're naturally good at, you need to learn the role of the position you'll likely be placed at, and stick to the role as much as possible. Defenders don't need to be moving up field and asking for passes, just as strikers don't need to be coming way back on defense all the time.


The striker's job is to take passes and score points. These players are generally the quickest and most accurate shooters on the team.
Center midfielders are the field generals, controlling the flow of the ball and the tempo of the game. Their job is to feed the ball to the strikers, or out to the wings, and to defend attacks in the center of the field. Center midfielders play both defense and offense.
Wing midfielders' job is to spread the field out and make crosses in to the strikers, to try to score. Typically, wings will do the most running on the field, going all the way up on offense, and coming all the way back on defense.
Defender's are the last line between the offense and the goal. Their job is to mark up on the strikers and cut off the passes that come to them, keeping them from shooting.

, Like most team sports, soccer requires lots of communication to keep things flowing and effective. If you want to be a good team player and give yourself the best chance of making the team, you need to be a talker on the field.


If you're open, call for the ball and call out your placement on the field. Sometimes, players will yell ""square,"" when they're at a right angle to the player with the ball, and ""line"" when they're straight back or straight ahead and open.
It's also good to warn your teammates of oncoming defenders, or warn your defensive teammates of an impending attack.

, You'll run out of gas quickly unless you learn to stay well hydrated and in shape during practice and games. Your body needs to be a well-tooled machine, and it's important to treat it right. Make sure you get enough sleep the night before practice sessions, and drink plenty of water before you do practice.


Sports drinks are sometimes good for recovery, but they can be filling during your workouts. try to stick to plain water, then have a sports drink afterward to replenish your electrolytes.

, The best way to make any team is to do what you're asked, without offering any resistance. If you're supposed to be doing drills, you don't want to be the one who has to ask how to do them, if it's already been explained. Listen closely at all times and pay attention while you're at practice, instead of messing around with your friends.


It's also important to listen to ways that you can improve. If your coach, or a teammate, is yelling encouraging instructions from the sideline, you need to have your ears open, so you can hear them.

, Just as important as your talent and natural abilities will be your ability to improve on the field. Coach ability is one of the most important things that coaches look for in players on any team, and if you want to be picked to play, you need to demonstrate that you're willing to learn, excited to improve, and are willing to do what it takes.


If you feel like you might not make the team, talk to your coach one-on-one and ask what you need to do, specifically, to make sure that you make the team. This demonstrates a serious commitment and a desire to compete.

, If you're not offering a supportive environment for other players, you're going to be cut. Even though it is a competition to make the team, coaches are looking for players who will put the good of that team before their own individual wants and needs. Be a team player and you'll stand out from the crowd.


A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. If someone is hanging back and struggling with a drill, encourage them and help. Drop back to run with a teammate who's feeling winded. Encourage your teammates when they need it.
If a teammate gets punished and has to run a lap all alone, gather your teammates to do it together. Take every punishment as a team. Coaches love that kind of thing.

, Coaches want competitive players, players who will leave their blood and sweat out on the field to score points and to win. If you lollygag during competition drills, even if they're supposed to be fun, you'll show that you lack that killer instinct, and be a less attractive player. Try hard at each and every drill, during each and every scrimmage, whether you've got a chance of winning or not.

, Be a gracious winner and a good loser. Try to win every competitive drill you're put through, but don't rub in the face of other players, or brag after you win. No trash-talking. let your skills do the talking for you.

, Nothing will get a player cut from the team faster than looking bored during practice. If you complain about practice, or give the impression that you'd rather be somewhere else, the coach will make that a reality pretty quick, even if you're more talented than certain other players.

, The mental game is sometimes the difference between a win and a loss. Every team needs enthusiastic players from the sidelines, supporting the players on the field. If you're not the best player out there, but still want to make the team and give yourself a chance, be loud, even when you're not in the game. If you're standing up off the bench, with your head in the game, invested in what's happening, the coaches will notice. They don't like to cut players who are cheerleaders for the team.

Set the ball up for your dominant foot.,
Take short strides.,
Plant your non-kicking foot next to the ball.,
Point your non-kicking foot in the direction you want to kick.,
Look down at the ball.,
Relax your body.,
Bring your leg back.,
Point your toes towards the ground.,
Bring your leg forward.,
Make contact with your big toe’s knuckle.,
Swing through the ball.,
Land on your kicking foot.,
Follow up your shot.",How to Kick a Soccer Ball Hard," During a free kick when you strike a stationary ball, angle yourself to prepare to kick the ball with your stronger foot. Otherwise, when dribbling with the ball, push the ball ahead of you and towards your kicking foot.


Shift yourself and the ball to get the proper kicking angle. For example, when kicking the ball with your right foot, shift your body to the left or while running push the ball ahead so it is in front of your right big toe.
Contacting the ball slightly to the right or left of center will generate full contact with less sway than a strike dead-center.;
, As you approach the ball for the kick, shorten your strides. This is simplest to do when the ball is set and can be seen when professional players take free kicks. During a run, you will need to quickly shorten your strides right before you choose to shoot, since the short strides allow you shorten your leg swing for more power and control.A small hop forward up to the ball at the end of a last, long stride can help you generate power during a run.

, Continue running forward until you’re up to the ball. The foot you’re not using to strike the ball needs to be set right next to the ball, not behind it. This brings your body over the ball. If you stay behind the ball, you will have a tendency to lift the ball and miss the target or hit the ball with your toe., As you plant your non-kicking foot, point it in the direction you want the ball to go. Pointing your foot the wrong way makes kicking feel awkward and prevents you from maximizing your power.


Pointing your foot towards the ball will cause your foot to get in the way. Point too far to the side and you’ll lose control of the ball.

, Right before you kick it, glance down at the ball. Focus on kicking with the proper technique instead of generating power or watching the spot you want the ball to hit. This will help you keep your body over the ball. You will lean back only slightly when you swing. This prevents you from lifting the ball.

, Many people focus too much on generating power. When you do this, you force your shot, losing control of the ball and losing power because of a poor strike. Instead, let your body drop so that your shoulders are squared and the only tension is in your ankle.Sometimes players shake out tension before taking a free kick.

, Bend your non-kicking knee slightly as you draw your kicking leg back. Don’t go too far back or else you won’t be able to snap your leg forward quickly to get the ball away with accuracy.Large swings are best for long-distance kicks.

, When you move your kicking leg backwards, angle your toes downwards. This causes your ankle to lock., Whip your leg forward towards the ball. Keep your foot angled downwards as you do this. Right before you strike the ball, extend your foot to unleash the power stored in your leg

, Coaches tell you to kick the ball with the laces of your foot. Technically, you are kicking below that. The knuckle is where your big toe connects to the rest of your foot. This large bone creates force when the area just above it strikes the ball. Watch the ball as your foot connects with it.Never kick with your toes. This not only generates less power and control, but it can hurt your toes.
Hit the ball halfway up from the ground for maximum power. Strike further to the sides for more spin.

, Don’t stop when your foot hits the ball. Move your foot through the ball as it leaves your foot. This ensures your leg’s momentum is fully expended on the ball. Your foot will raise up at the end of the swing’s arc.

, Bring your foot down and plant it on the ground first before you try to move. That way the momentum of your swing is maximized and you stabilize yourself as you try to move., If possible, run after your shot. Putting pressure on your opponent may cause them to deflect or drop the ball, giving you a chance to repeat these steps to kick the ball again.

Take the ball into the box.,
Pop the ball up to a teammate.,
Develop your cross from both feet.,
Control your dribble with step-overs.",How to Kick Like Cristiano Ronaldo2," Unlike Beckham, known for his long, elegant, arcing crosses with a metric-ton of English on them, Ronaldo's crosses are more like little behind-the-back passes in basketball. He takes the ball deep into enemy territory, then pops it into the air back across the field of play toward a team made for a header or a shot.


Though he often plays on the left side of the field, Ronaldo also switches, depending on the play as it progresses, and will go to the center to take crosses as well., To pop a Ronaldo-style cross, make contact with your foot straight, and your plant foot well-behind the ball. Make your follow-through very short to pop the ball up as much as possible, giving your teammate an opportunity to get a head on it.

, One of the freakiest things about Ronaldo is that he seems to be just as good from both feet. His left-footed crosses and shots are just as wobbly and accurate as his right-footed crosses. Work on your non-dominant footwork by doing dribbling drills with both feet, and taking as many wrong-footed shots on goal as possible. Practice your fundamentals until you can get the right kind of power from both feet, even if it feels backwards.

, Ronaldo's footwork makes him able to get the crosses off in time, making his play unpredictable and thrilling to watch. If you want to be able to take the ball that deep into territory, you're going to have to be able to evade defensive players and juke them out of their shorts.


Practice step-overs to imitate Ronaldo's great dribble. Also try to practice his distinctive behind-the-leg direction switching pass that he does to himself.

Draw in the defense by driving straight towards them.,
Bring the ball behind your back at elbow height.,
Look in the opposite direction of the ball.,
Hit the ball with your non-dominant elbow.",How to Elbow Pass1," Driving directly towards your opponents will conceal the ball when it's behind your back and will trick the defender into thinking you're doing a standard behind the back pass. When you perform the behind the back elbow pass, make sure that you have teammates on both sides of your lane so that you can misdirect the defenders., Hold the ball in the palm of your dominant hand and bring it behind your back as if you were performing a behind the back pass. It's important to have a good grip on the ball so you don't release it early., As you swing the ball behind your back, you'll want to look in the opposite direction of the ball. This will trick the defender into thinking that you're doing a behind the back pass when you're actually doing an elbow pass that will send the ball in the opposite direction., Lightly toss the ball behind your back into your elbow and drive your non-dominant elbow back with your palm open. This will cause the ball to bounce off your elbow and in the opposite direction.If you want more control and less power in your elbow pass, you can try to aim the ball on your tricep instead of your elbow.

First you need to analyze the situation.,
Then find an opening or space in which you can penetrate, again there are many factors that come into play, is the hole on your strong or weak hand, is there a strong weak side defender, and many more.

,
After you have decided your point of attack you must pick a move in order to beat the man guarding you.,
On the crossover you dribble one way fake that way and cross over very quick to the opposite hand, your opponent should be a step to a half step behind you and that is all you need to beat him.

,The spin is when you dribble one way and spin, so that you trap the defender behind your body, now you should have that 1 half to a whole step advantage that you need,

,
The floater is a relatively low percentage shot if you don't practice it, but on the other hand it is near impossible to block (even if you are playing someone much taller than you are).,
The bull rush is when there is either a very large space to penetrate of a very weak defender is guarding you.,
The stop and go is when you pick one side and dribble as fast as you can to that side and suddenly stop.,
The pump fake is when you fake the shot and you want the defender to jump and then you attack while he is in the air,he cannot change direction while in midair, (this only USUALLY works if you have all ready established yourself as a high percentage shooter.),
Once you have beaten your man if there is no weak side defender than you should go straight up for the layup, but if a weak side defender picks you up there again is a lot of options that you can take to beat him.

,
One of the popular ones is the hop step.,
You can also try to spin again all though this isn't quite as effective but if you are one of the bigger men on the court this will work nicely.,
You can also try the reverse lay up in which you go all the way around the basket and do the layup on the other side.,
Finally you can mix and match these moves in any way you want to create an almost infinite amount of ways to drive in.",How to Drive to the Basket," (Who's guarding you? Are they tall or short, slow or fast, fat or skinny, and many other critical factors.;
,, You can do the crossover, spin,bull-rush, stop and go, pump fake and many more.(these are just the most basic and/or the most successful ones.

,,, You will dribble past your man and get 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) away from the basket and will go up on one foot while your other foot is out and aim to lay the ball right in the basket without aiming for the square.

, you pick one side and just go full speed and try to beat your defender(this USUALLY does not work if your defender is stronger, faster or a lot taller than you are.

, Your defender should be off balance and you can pick the right shot in order to score.

,

,, you simply pick up the ball and take a hop. It makes it so that all your momentum is going forward and like I said earlier in the article you cannot change direction while in midair so you can only go forward unless some one physically touches you and if he does it should be a foul. Then when you land go up again and you should have beat the weak side defender or he should have fouled you, if he has and you are unable to take the shot just throw it up and it will seem like you have been fouled. The ref will call it and you could make it too.

, after you spin you can go up for the shot again.

, It will work if the defender jumped before you reached the other side.

, just remember these are just the basic or most successful moves and there are still many more out there and if you do come against a bigger defender in the low post penetrate hard to draw a foul.

Hold the ball in the palm of your hand at waist height.,
Straighten out your arm.,
Bounce the ball off the inside of your elbow.",How to Elbow Pass2," Hold the ball in the palm of your dominant hand, with your fingers pointed forward and your arm bent. Be warned that in this position the ball is very vulnerable and could be stolen from you easily., Drive your hand forward as you straighten out your elbow and let go of the ball. The harder and faster you do this, the further the ball will travel., As the ball falls, you'll want to bounce it off the inside of your dominant elbow and towards your teammate. To do this correctly, you'll have to time straightening out your arm and letting go of the ball so that it occurs at the same time."
"
Hold the ball in front of your shoulder.,
Look in the direction of your teammate.,
Drive your hand down and throw the ball.",How to Elbow Pass3," Place your hand behind the ball with your elbow bent. Your fingers should be pointed towards the ceiling, and you should have a steady grip on the ball. You can pivot left or right with your hips, and this will help aim the ball when it gets released from your hands.Use your other hand to support the side of the ball.
Your elbow should be directly under the ball and tight against your body.

, Find the teammate you want to pass the ball to and position your hips in their direction. The bent elbow pass is meant to pass the ball quickly in a defensive hole, and you'll want to see where your teammate is so you can pass it to them., Once you find a hole in the defense, you can throw the ball by swiftly driving your hand down and releasing the ball. This pass is best used in high-tempo games and in games where you're being smothered by the defense."

Avoid dribbling violations.,
Practice the ""triple threat"" stance.,

Practice dribbling behind your back.,
Practice dribbling between your legs.",How to Dribble a Basketball," When you dribble, you want your hands to make contact with the ball in such a way that you have good control over the ball and you don't have to use much arm strength to keep the ball bouncing. For this reason, don't slap the ball with your palm. Rather, try to handle the ball with the tips of your fingers. Spread your fingers out across the surface of the ball for a wider, more balanced contact area.









Not only will your fingertips give you more control than your palms - you'll also be able to dribble faster. Indiana Pacers player Paul George strongly recommends against palm-to-ball contact, as it ""slows down the whole dribbling process."";
, When dribbling, it's not smart to keep an erect, up-and-down posture. In this stance, the ball will have to travel all the way from your upper body to the ground and back again as it bounces, leaving it wide open for a defender to steal. Before you start to dribble, get in a low, defensive stance. Spread your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and drop your hips back slightly (as if you were sitting in a chair). Get your head up and your upper body mostly erect. This is a good, balanced foundation - it protects the ball while giving you plenty of mobility.


Don't bend at the waist (as if you were bending over to pick something up). Besides being bad for your back, this stance is fairly unbalanced, meaning it's easier to accidentally stumble forward, which, depending on the in-game situation, can be a big mistake.

, This is it! Handling the ball with your fingertips, take it in your dominant hand and bounce it off the ground. Bounce it firmly, but not so hard that you have to use serious arm strength or you have trouble controlling it. Your dribble should be quick, yet steady and controlled. Each time the ball returns to your hand, without grabbing it or catching it in any way, make contact with your fingertips and push it back down with a controlled motion of the wrist and forearm - again, you shouldn't be tiring your arm out from dribbling. The ball should hit the floor at a spot slightly to the side and ahead of the foot that's on the same side of your body as your dribbling hand.









When you're practicing dribbling for the very first time, it's O.K. to keep your eyes on the ball as you dribble until you get the hang of things. However, you should switch to dribbling without looking at the ball as soon as you can. It's expected that you'll be able to do this at nearly all levels of play.

, When you dribble, it's important to keep the motion of the ball under control. You never want the ball to get away from you, as this can give the other team possession of the ball for free. Try to keep the palm of your hand directly over the ball as you move so that the ball, on its ""up"" bounce, will bounce right into your fingertips. This will give you more control over the ball as you move around the court.









Another reason to focus on keeping your hand over the ball at all times while dribbling is that momentarily ""catching"" the ball on its underside at any point results in a penalty called a carrying violation. To avoid this, keep your palm over the ball and facing the floor as you dribble.

, The shorter and quicker the ball's bounces, the harder it is for your opponent to steal. One sure-fire way to make your ball's bounces shorter is simply to bounce it closer to the ground. Since you're already in your low stance (with your knees bent and your hips dropped back), it shouldn't feel very unnatural to move the apex of the ball's bounce to somewhere between your knee and hip. Keeping your knees bent, drop your dominant hand down to the side of your leg and dribble with low, quick motions.









You shouldn't need to bend to the side to dribble in a low stance. If so, you're probably dribbling too low. Remember that, in your low stance, the highest point of your bounce can be up to your hip while still keeping most of the defensive benefits of a low dribble.

, When you first start dribbling and the process isn't intuitive yet, it's hard not to look at the ball as you dribble. However, it is very important to practice looking at anything (and everything) else. During a game, you'll have to look for your teammates, keep an eye on your defender, and be aware of where the basket is, all while dribbling. You simply can't do this if you're spending lots of time staring at the ball.









Serious practice is the only way to get truly confident in your dribbling ability. When you play basketball, you can't waste time focusing on the minutiae of your dribbling technique. Dribbling has to be second nature - you need to be able to ""trust"" that the ball will return to your hand without watching it.

, When you're dribbling during a game, the way you dribble the ball should change based on the positions of other players and conditions around you. If you are in open court (such as if you're moving the ball up the court after the opposing team has scored a point), you can dribble ball in front of you, which will let you run as fast as possible. However, when you're near defenders (especially if one's guarding you), bounce the ball at your side (just outside and ahead of your shoe) while assuming a low, defensive stance. This way, the defender will have to reach across your body to get at the ball, having a much harder time reaching it and possibly drawing a foul.








, When you're being covered by one or more defenders - that is, they're following you and trying to steal the ball and/or block your shots and passes - defend the ball with your body. Never dribble your ball on the same side of your body as the defender is on. Rather, position yourself so that your body is between your defender and the ball, making it difficult for the defender to steal the ball from you (remember - the defender can't just shove you out of the the way or strike across your body to get the ball without risking a foul for his team.).









You can use the hand that isn't dribbling as an arm bar. Raise your non-dribbling arm and make a fist, presenting the side of your forearm to your opponent. Be careful when using arm bars. Don't push the defender, strike the defender with your fist, or drive through the defender using your arm bar as a wedge. Instead, use an arm bar defensively (like you might hold a shield)to keep space between yourself and the defensive player.

, In basketball, offensive players are allowed to start and stop their dribbles only once each time they have the ball. When you're dribbling in a game, don't pick up your dribble unless you know what you're going to do with the basketball. Once you stop, you can't dribble again, and, if s/he is smart, your defender will capitalize on your inability to move.









If you stop dribbling, your options are to pass the ball, to shoot the ball, or to have the ball stolen from you. If you're planning to do one of the first two, stop dribbling and then do that thing immediately - otherwise, the defense will react and you may have the third option happen whether you like it or not!

, Dribbling isn't always the smartest way to move the ball around the court. Often, it's better to pass. A good passing game is one of the cornerstones of an effective offense. Passing the ball is faster than moving while dribbling, can be used to misdirect the opposing team, and can be used to get the ball to a teammate through a section of the court occupied by defenders. Don't be a ball hog - if dribbling to the hoop means going through multiple defenders, it's usually a good idea to pass the ball to a teammate who has a better chance of making a shot.








, There are certain basic rules that dictate the way you dribble in basketball. Know these rules! A careless dribbling violation can result in a penalty, halting your team's offensive momentum and giving the defending team the ball for free. Avoid committing any of the following violations:










Traveling: Moving with the ball without dribbling. Traveling includes:

Taking an extra step, skip, hop, or shuffling your feet
Carrying the ball while you walk or run
Moving or changing your pivot foot (set foot) when stationary



Double dribble: This penalty refers to two separate violations:

Dribbling with both hands simultaneously
Dribbling, stopping your dribble (catching or holding the ball), and then starting to dribble again



Carrying: Catching the ball with one hand and then continuing to dribble (without stopping the dribbling motion). In a carry, your hand makes contact with the bottom of the ball, then flips the ball over in the act of dribbling.

, The ""triple threat"" is a highly versatile stance that's taken by offensive players after they receive the ball from a teammate in a pass, but before they start dribbling. From the triple threat position, the player can pass, shoot, or start to dribble. The stance allows the player to protect the ball with his or her hands and body while s/he decides which option to take.









The triple threat keeps the ball close to the body with the strong hand grasping it on top and the weak hand grasping it on the bottom. The player assumes a low stance and keeps his or her elbows back, bent at ninety degree angles. S/he leans forward over the ball slightly. From this stance, it's very difficult for a defender to steal the ball.

, A ""crossover"" is a dribbling technique used to destabilize and misdirect a defender. The player dribbles the ball in front of his or her body, transferring it between hands in a ""V"" shape. By ""selling"" his or her movements, the player can get the defender to move toward the ball while it's in one hand, then quickly cross the ball over to the other hand, allowing the player to quickly dribble around the defender or pass the ball while s/he's off-balance.









One useful related dribbling technique is the ""In & Out Dribble."" Essentially, the player pretends that s/he is going to crossover, but keeps the ball in the same hand.

, When you're covered by a defender that you just can't shake, you may need to bust out some seriously fancy dribbles. One classic move for ""juking"" a defender is to dribble behind your back. This move requires serious practice, but it's worth it - when done well, a behind the back move can leave a defender's head spinning.








, Another classic ball-handling move is to dribble between your legs. You've probably seen this done by everyone from the Harlem Globetrotters to LeBron James, and for good reason. A quick, well-executed between the legs dribble can flummox even the most difficult defenders.

Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard.,
Practice until your muscles remember the movement.",How to Do a Lay Up1," Since you're doing a right-handed lay up, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it.








Lay ups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down.
You can do a right-handed lay up if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed lay up.;
, When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot.








, As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot.








, As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan.









When you're doing a lay up, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball.
As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force.

, One of the reasons a lay up is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed lay up, the sweet spot is slightly to the right of the square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net.









You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open lay up when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time.

, The lay up is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do lay ups as part of every basketball practice.









As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your lay up footwork and launch into a jump.
Work on doing lay ups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.

It's difficult to do a lay up with your opposite hand, but it's completely worth the time and effort it takes to learn how to do it.

Work on doing lay ups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.

Push the basketball down with the pads of your fingers, not your palm.,
Use enough force that the ball bounces just high enough for you to control it.,
Keep your head up and gaze straight ahead while dribbling the ball.,
Stand on the balls of your feet rather than standing flat-footed.",How to Dribble a Basketball Between the Legs1," The finger pads allow you to better control the direction that the ball bounces.
;
, This ""sweet spot"" is generally about the height of your knees.












Use enough force




, Looking down actually impairs your balance and prevents you from surveying the court.












Keep your head up and gaze straight




, This allows you to move quickly and make sharp angles with your footwork.












Stand on the balls of your feet

Wear loose-fitting clothes.,
Dress in layers for colder weather.,
Choose sneakers that fit.,
Decide between high-tops and low-tops.",How to Dress to Play Basketball1," Choose tops and bottoms that fit snugly enough so that they don’t slip off or become snarled during play. At the same time, avoid tight clothing that constricts movement. Wear clothes that allow you a free range of motion. In ideal weather or indoors, wear the following:Shorts that fit your waist perfectly and hang loosely to your knees or thereabouts.
A t-shirt, jersey, or singlet that isn’t binding. Favor sleeveless tops to allow your arms the maximum freedom of movement.;
, Use combinations of long-sleeve t-shirts, thermals, warm-ups, and/or sweatwear. Give yourself the ability to adjust to sudden changes in weather by stripping or adding layers as needed.Avoid constrictive outerwear like coats, jackets, and bulky hoodies, which may weigh you down and restrict movement.


For very cold weather, wearing a tighter-than-normal article of clothing as your first layer will help trap body heat more efficiently.
If you wear a number of layers at once, choose a larger size than normal for your outermost layer. Accommodate the greater girth created by all the layers underneath so you can still move with little or no hindrance.

, Reduce the risk of injury to your ankles and feet on the court. Buy shoes that fit properly so your feet have the greatest range of motion possible.Before purchasing, lace both shoes correctly to judge how they will feel on the court. If possible, avoid buying sizes that are larger than needed to keep your feet from sliding around inside the shoe. Also make sure the sole is non-skid so you don’t slip on the court.If you are younger and are expected to “grow into” a pair, ask your parent or guardian to buy one that is only a half-size larger than your current size. This way you will grow into it much quicker.
Prevent blisters and chafing by wearing socks that cover just as much skin as your sneakers do.

, Both styles of sneakers are acceptable, but many people prefer high-tops for the extra support that they provide your ankles. However, be aware that wearing high-tops all the time can create a dependency on that extra support. If you decide to wear these for basketball, prevent this dependency by:Wearing low-top sneakers and shoes for casual wear.
Walking barefoot as much as possible.
Warming up and performing light exercises either barefoot or with thin-soled sneakers like Chuck Taylor’s.

Draw a rectangle in landscape mode.,
Work on drawing one side first.,
Work on the reflected area on the other side.,
Draw a circle in the center area of the court in a way so that at no point of the circle will it ever meet the 3-point line of either side.

,
Draw a line from the top center through the tip-off area and down to the bottom.,
Recognize that there are other things (such as benches and substitution and game official boxes) that can be drawn on the sidelines.",How to Draw a Basketball Court," Basketball courts are always rectangular, if you've had a chance to look at one close up.;
, A basketball court has two mirror images on each side of a center area. Draw from the outside line and work towards the center. Make sure to connect each item (unless otherwise noted) to the left or right side of the drawn court.


Draw a rectangle (connected to the sideline).
Connect the rectangle at the short end of the rectangle to a half-circle. This should become the outer edge of the free-throw lane/area.
Draw the symbol for the basket for the basketball. Leave a little empty space between the outer edge of the court and the free-throw line area. Connect a filled in circle to this line you drew. Make sure this basket is rather center between the top and bottom of the rectangle.
Draw the three point line. Although college basketball has the 3-point line farther towards the free-throw half circle, the 3-point line can be generalized and be given more space on most professional basketball courts. Leave a little space at the top left/right corner and a little white space at the bottom left/right corner, but connect a semi-circle (free-hand) to the outer horizontal lines.

, Almost make a copy of this on the other side. There are no real differences so far.

,, This will designate the mirror images and the equality between the two teams. On most professional basketball courts, this line won't be drawn through the tip-off area, but is known to all players that the game is fair, in lieu of the icon of the team.

, However, if you're looking to sketch out plays and analyze actions on the court, these pieces can generally be excluded.

Give yourself the proper support and plenty of mobility without having to worry about wires digging in or restricting your movement.Male players may also want to consider wearing a cup for added support and protection.

, If you normally wear glasses or contacts, invest in a pair of shatterproof eyewear designed specifically for high-contact sports. Wear a mouthguard to protect your teeth and tongue. Support any limbs and/or joints that have suffered past injuries by wearing fitted braces.If you wear high-top sneakers and find yourself needing to wear ankle braces as well, consider this a warning sign that your ankles may be losing their natural mobility. Your knees may start suffering next as they overcompensate on your ankles’ behalf., Wear a sweatband around your forehead to mop up sweat before it can run into your eyes. Use elastic ties or flexible headbands to keep your hair out of your face. Tie longer hair back into a ponytail or braid.

Also avoid wearing clothing that features aggressive or offensive phrases or logos. Worry less about making a statement through fashion and more about impressing people with your skills in order to gain the respect of potential teammates., Resist the urge to shed this “unnecessary” layer in hot weather. Respect your fellow players. Appreciate the fact that no one wants to be sprayed with sweat if it could be avoided. If you tend to thoroughly soak your shirt after a game or two, bring extra shirts to change into over the course of the day., Use the amount recommended by your particular brand’s directions. Allow your skin the time it needs to fully absorb the sunscreen. Keep in mind that once you start playing, you will most likely start sweating, which will wash away the sunscreen if it hasn’t been absorbed., Remember that a pickup game does not have official rules, referees, or enforceable punishments.Anticipate that the style of play here may be considerably rougher than in league games. Buy yourself an extra shatterproof pair that is meant to stand up to high-impact sports, or go without your regular glasses if you can manage.

, Be ready to move in case he tries to dribble around.

, This is a good mixture of personal protection, and defensive stance. You basically want to trick your man or girl into trying to dribble straight to the basket. If you setup too soon, he/she will just dribble around. Small players tend to dribble around you, so it's best tried on larger opponents.

, Once you've committed to the charge, it's very hard to go back to playing a mobile defense. If you move even to the side, you will probably get called for a blocking foul.

,, Don't lean into the player. Don't lean away. Let their shoulder make contact with your arm and fall.

, A no-call is also a win in this situation, as chances are enough contact was made to disrupt the players drive to the basket.

Understand the right time for a hook shot.,
Start by positioning your body as if you were going to do a normal jump shot.,
Square your shoulders.,

Use your non-shooting arm strategically.,
Make sure your shooting arm completes its motion.,
Land with grace.,
Watch for the rebound.",How to Do a Hook Shot in Basketball," This shot is ideal for low post players who are positioned inside the paint, close to the basket. When perfected the jump shot is notoriously difficult to stop as it gives players a key height advantage over their opponents. However, this shot should rarely be attempted outside of the paint as it is difficult to execute from a significant distance. , Pivot your lead foot so it is parallel to the defender and the hoop. If you shoot with your right, your left foot and hip should both be parallel with the defender. Your body should be positioned sideways to the hoop with the non-shooting shoulder pointing toward the hoop. It’s crucial to make sure your body is acting as a barrier between the basketball and the defender. 







, Make sure your shoulders are even and firm so they can act as blockage against the defender. They should be across from the defender’s chest so your non-shooting arm can block the defender while the other arm makes the shot.

, Keep your knees bent to maintain maximum flexibility in case the defender tries to knock you off balance. This low center of gravity is also crucial when your shooting leg lifts up to give you enough air to shoot the ball over your opponent’s body.

, You need to make the basket your main center of focus so you are able to accurately make the shot. Ideally, you should be making the jump shot from inside the paint, so there will likely be a mass of defenders attempting to block your shot. Pay attention to your surroundings using your peripheral vision, but don’t get distracted from the basket as this could alter the trajectory of your shot away from the basket.

, Your shooting leg should be rising at the same time with the shooting arm. While leaning on your non-shooting foot, bring the other leg up to give you enough lift so you can shoot the basket over the defendant. If you decide to jump off with one foot (left foot for a right-handed shot or vice versa), then try to bring your free leg up, knee bent and towards you to protect yourself from advancing defenders.








, The hook shot is one-handed, so you will have one arm making the shot with the other defending your stance against the opponent. Before making the shot, your shooting elbow should be firmly locked in position while your shooting arm raises up to create a 45 degree angle in relation to your elbow. Thrust your shooting arm upwards and over your head while flicking your wrist and letting the ball release from your fingertips. 







, This arm serves an equally crucial purpose as you keep the defender at a distance in order to give your shooting arm the stability it needs to make the shot. However, make sure you do not foul and push the defender out of the way or onto the ground. Your non-shooting arm should serve the dual purpose of giving you balance and momentary safety from any opponents. Fully flex it at the elbow while keeping it in firmly in front of your body.








, Don’t stop this arm from moving, and don't bring it back too soon as the arm won’t have the lift it needs to ensure the ball reaches the basket. Bring the shooting arm to its highest point of elevation when shooting the ball, and use this arm to lead the ball into the basket. 







, When coming back to the ground, turn your body so you land facing the basket with a firm stance so your chest is parallel to the basket. Ensure your knees are flexed so they can help mitigate the shock from landing and keep you from falling over or losing your balance. Don’t leave your hands by your side, keeping them in front of your body so you can immediately re-enter the action as you land. 







, After you land, keep your eyes on the ball to see if it rebounded from the backboard. Never let your guard down after your shot in case the shot misses and you need to get the ball back in your hands. Your role should immediately switch from a shooter to a rebounder, and your landing posture should be flexed and ready to recapture the ball.

Develop your dribble.,
Fake to your dominant side.,
Hesitate.,
Stay low and wide.,
Cross the ball over.",How to Do a Crossover in Basketball1," Before you attempt a crossover, make sure you've got a good handle on power dribbling and can maintain good ball control. A good crossover requires that you dribble effectively with both hands and can drive the lane from either direction.






;
, To do an accurate-looking fake, push the ball to the side you're dribbling it in. Step the way you fake, and lean that way, too. Keep your eyes focused on the defender's hips and midsection, rather than the hands or legs, which the defense will use for distraction. When the hips turn in the direction you're faking, that's when you'll know you've faked effectively. 








Also consider faking to your non-dominant side and crossing back over to your dominant hand and driving from your strong side. Keep the D guessing.

, This is the most important and convincing part of the crossover dribble. When the ball is up, some players will give a little hop, as if you're about to quickly drive to your dominant side. The ball will be in your palm at this moment, so really what you're doing is less about dribble and more about feigning motion.









Watch videos of great crossover players to practice and imitate their hesitation move. Be careful not to palm the ball, or you'll be whistled for a dribbling violation.

, Since the move involves bouncing the ball in between you and the defender, you'll want to make sure that you're low to the ground and that you're leading with the foot on your dominant side. Allen Iverson was great at keep the ball very far away from his body, but still totally controlling its bounce. You want to look as much like you're heading to that direction as possible. Don't open yourself up to a steal.









Don't look at the ball as you're doing the move. Keep your eyes on the defender and up court, scanning for possible open spaces, open teammates, and opportunities.

, When you've got the defensive player turned in the direction you want, quickly power dribble across your body, switching to your other hand. At this instant, you should be open to set for a jump shot or pass the ball to your teammate. It'll happen in an instant, so be ready to act as soon as you've completed the move. Practise this move a couple times to really get it perfect!

Go behind your back.,
Dribble between your legs.,
Double-up.,
Get creative.",How to Do a Crossover in Basketball2," Instead of crossing over in between yourself and the defender, which can be tricky and dangerous, bounce the ball behind your back to shift directions. This uses your body to shield the ball, and can leave defenders in your dust.









Practice dribbling behind your back before trying this move. You can't see where the ball is going, so it can be a difficult maneuver to pull off.

, Another effective shielding technique is to dribble the ball between your legs. Most typically, you'd dribble back through your non-dominant leg, catching the ball with that hand, but you can improvise in all sorts of ways.









Try going back to front, from your non-dominant side to your dominant side as your hesitation maneuver, fake toward that dominant side and abruptly cross it back over between your legs again.

, If you've gone to the well one too many times and your defender catches you in the act by staying centered when you try your crossover, kick the ball back into your dominant hand and drive in the direction you tried to fake. This double crossover will often go so far as to trip up the defender, leading to this move's reputation as the ""ankle-breaker.""








, Try different combinations of between the legs and directional shifts to improve your offensive game. The simple crossover is really just a quick dribble, but when you've mastered that and can effectively crossover, your offensive game will only be limited by your imagination.

;
, This improves your balance, stability, and response.







, Court awareness is often the deciding factor in whether or not you will be able to drive to the hoop and make a shot.








, Although this move is called the hop step, many players typically have difficulty controlling the height of this jump. Jumping too high will negatively impact your balance.







, This is especially important when learning the hop step. Failing to land simultaneously on both feet can result in a traveling call by a referee.








, Once you land on both feet, you can pivot with one foot or the other, but not both.








Even executed perfectly, some officials may still call you for traveling, as it can be difficult to discern a hop step from a travel.
Possession of the ball and prior use of a player's allotted pivot can also influence traveling calls.

, You should pay close attention to footwork and stance. At random intervals or at the signal of a whistle, combine the footwork you learning with the dribbling and take your hop step.








, Jumping too high will throw off your balance or add to your momentum, which can lead to an unnecessary step and a traveling call.








, This is the key point of the hop step. Landing with both feet at the same time means you can pivot either direction, giving you more mobility on the court.









Keep your knees bent, body low, and head up after landing.

, If your body is familiar with the halting of momentum that the hop step requires, you are less likely to take an illegal second step/pivot.








, This also trains good reflexes which will be of use to you during game time when there is pressure.







, At random intervals, or if practicing with your team or friends, at the signal of a whistle, execute a jump step.

, On whichever foot you stop or the leading foot when the whistle blows, drive downward with that foot and perform a small hop.


Alternate which foot you drive with to build symmetry and prevent the predictability of favoring your dominant side.

, Remember to use proper stance: keep your knees bent, body low, and head up.

, You should switch between sides so that you aren't predictable to your opponents. You should practice coming to a complete stop following the pivot to limit traveling calls.


If you had possession of the ball prior to performing this move and have already used your pivot, you may not pivot a second time following your hop.

, Now that you know the basics of the hop step, you should expand your functional knowledge of the move by practicing a real game scenarios, like passing.

, To receive a pass while doing the hop step, you need to jump before catching the ball. Make sure your teammate is ready before executing.

, Keep your head up while doing so you don't miss your teammate's pass.

, Take a moment and have your teammate evaluate you. Did you land with both feet simultaneously? Are your knees bent, is your body low, and is your head up?, Attempt to complete your motions smoothly and without interruption. This will prevent you from stutter-stop performance during the game., Though many experienced players consider this move to be basic, the mechanics involved make it challenging to do cleanly. Practice receiving a pass on your own by:



Throwing a ball slightly in front of you with backspin.

Executing a small hop while the ball rebounds from the floor.

Catching the ball in the air on its return.

Pivoting on one foot.

If you place a high value on keeping your basketball shoes looking like new, clean them after every wear.The only exception is if your shoes have an absorbent material like canvas, mesh, or suede. In this case, let caked on mud dry so that you can brush the dirt off with a stiff brush, then start cleaning. Otherwise, you’ll just smear the mud further.;
, If you’re dealing with dried on dirt or mud, use a stiff-bristled brush (like a toothbrush or shoe brush). If the mud or other gunk is still moist, use a soft, slightly dampened cloth., Fill a bowl or small bucket with warm water. Add a few drops of a mild detergent (dish soap works well) and swish it around so that the solution is just a bit bubbly.Avoid harsh detergents or chemicals, bleaches, or abrasive cleaners.
Remove the shoelaces before you get down to cleaning the shoes. You can clean them separately with the same solution.

, Moisten — don’t soak — your cloth or brush. Wipe the shoe thoroughly, cleaning off and re-wetting the cloth or brush as needed. Use your fingertip under the cloth — or a toothbrush — to get into seams and creases.Scrub a bit more aggressively in a circular motion on stubborn stains. If desired, add a tiny dab of plain white toothpaste to your dampened cloth or toothbrush., Lightly dampen the cloth with plain water. Don’t dunk the shoes in water or run them under a faucet., If there is surface moisture on the shoes, you can gently wipe them with a clean cloth first. Then just leave them in an airy, warm spot.Do not use a clothes dryer, hair dryer, radiator, or other artificial heat source. This could cause shrinking or cracking.The insides of the shoes should still be dry; but if they are a bit damp, stuff some newspaper inside while they dry., Once they’re dry, you can pitch your run-of-the-mill basketball shoes in your gym bag or by the front door. If you’ve got high-end or especially meaningful shoes, however, special storage techniques are advisable.Make sure the shoes are completely dry. Remove any crumpled newspaper from inside and check.
Place the shoes into individual, large zip-close bags. If you have access to desiccant packets (like those silica gel packs that probably came in the original shoe box), place one in each bag before sealing them.

Scrub stained soles with toothpaste.,
Try toothpaste on leather panels or components as well.,
Clean canvas in an a similar fashion to other shoe materials.,
Clean shoelaces separately.,
Clean insoles and inserts with the same cleaning solution.",How to Clean Basketball Shoes2," Add a dab of plain white toothpaste to a toothbrush, dip it into a cleaning solution of warm water and a touch of gentle dish soap, and scrub away at stains or scuffs. Wipe away the excess with a clean, damp cloth, and repeat as needed.You can also make a paste by putting a few spoonfuls of baking soda into a bowl, then stirring in a small amount of water until you reach a toothpaste consistency.
Pick out pebbles or dirt caught in between the shoe treads with a toothpick and/or a stiff, dry brush.

, Clear surface debris away from the leather with a dry cloth or soft brush. Wipe the leather with a clean cloth that is lightly dampened with plain, warm water.Add a small dab of plain white toothpaste to the fingertips of your first and middle fingers, then dip them in warm water. Rub the leather in a circular motion, then wipe away the toothpaste and dirt with a damp cloth.
Dry the surface with a clean cloth, then let the leather air dry overnight.

, Basketball shoes with uppers or components made of canvas or similar absorbent materials can be cleaned in much the same way as any other pair. Use warm water and gentle soap, clean them with soft cloths or brushes, and allow them to air dry.You can, however, get canvas a bit more wet and scrub it a bit more aggressively if needed to remove stubborn stains.
If the canvas gets saturated, blot or squeeze it with a dry towel, stuff newspapers into the shoes, and let them dry overnight.

, You can’t fully clean either the shoes or the laces if you don’t separate them. Once you remove the laces, you can dampen and scrub them with the same gentle cleaning solution as for the shoes. Or, you can toss them in the washing machine.If the shoelaces are frayed or overly worn or dirty, it’s best to just replace them., Remove insoles/inserts and clean them in the same fashion as the shoes. Allow them — and the shoes — to dry completely before reinserting them. For odor control, try sprinkling a bit of baking soda on them before putting them back in.You could try throwing them in the washing machine, but you run the risk of them being damaged; hand washing is safest.
For overnight deodorizing, you can also dry putting a dryer sheet inside each shoe."

Consult your shoe manufacturer’s recommendations.,
Try the gentle wash cycle and low spin cycle.,
Air dry the shoes.,
Turn up the heat for beat-up basketball shoes.",How to Clean Basketball Shoes3," In most cases, the maker of your basketball shoes will recommend that you not put them in either a washing machine or a clothes dryer. It is particularly wise to heed this advice if your shoes are expensive or otherwise valuable to you.In reality, your shoes will probably make it through a wash cycle just fine. However, only you can decide if you’re willing to take the risk that “probably” entails.

, Use the cool or cold water setting. Add a few old towels to reduce clanging around (and potential shoe damage) during the spin cycle. Add less detergent than you normally would, if possible.Remove insoles and shoestrings before starting the wash. You can wash them along with the shoes.

, Even if you do choose to use the washer, it’s best to avoid the dryer if you can. Place some newspaper inside the shoes and stick them in an airy, sunny spot if possible., If your shoes are filthy and you’re just not all that worried about whether they’ll emerge unscathed, you can try adjusting the washing machine to the warm or hot water settings. Set it to a regular wash cycle, but keep it on a low spin setting. Once again, throw in a few old towels to reduce banging around.Since you’re being a risk-taker anyway, go ahead and throw the shoes in the dryer afterward as well. But don’t get too wild — put the dryer on its low heat setting.

If he hooks you, this is a foul.,
If he uses a drop step, your only hope of legal defense is to block his shot.",How to Defend in the Post," Defenders can get away with a lot of contact in the post.;
, If you are playing street basketball, there is no three second rule, but there are also no off the ball fouls and most street players think it is okay to push the offensive player out of the key.

, In other words, do not stand between your opponent and the basket when he does not have the ball. This way he cannot back you down or give you a bump on the entry pass.

, Most offensive players have no idea how to make a good entry pass, so make them pay. You have to want the ball. If you see a weak or inaccurate pass, go for it. One other move is placing your arm between your opponents arm and torso, only one arm though to deflect the pass.

, Try to make him pass or go under the backboard and out of bounds.

, This makes it look like you are just holding your position and not really bumping him. If you get caught bumping him hard, you will get called for a foul. If he hits you hard enough, flopping can draw a charge or pushing foul. (impeding progress).

, Plant your feet and stand straight up with both hands up. Make it obvious to the official that you are in a legal defensive position. A good note is to keep your palms facing up. That way there is no possible way for you to be called for a foul.

, If you're in a league, foul him and calmly tell the ref to watch for it. If you're on the street, foul him hard. You can't call hooking, but you can let him know what you think of it.

, He's under the basket now, so he has to go straight up with the ball. He's also quite vulnerable since he's facing you now. The most effective defense against the drop step is a blocker from the weak side because usually the offensive player doesn't notice the help coming. Another option could be to get him to drop too low under the basket, you do run the risk of a pushing foul.

Get into position.",How to Serve a Volleyball Overhand1," Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. Place the foot opposite of your hitting hand in front of the other foot. Your shoulders and hips should be aligned with the net. Make your sure your knees are bent. It is extremely important that your weight is on your back foot.A server's posture is one of the most important parts of her serve. The power of the serve isn't from upper body strength, but from the legs. A powerful serve is achieved by being able to transfer weight from the back foot to the front foot correctly. Getting a strong starting posture is pivotal to a strong serve.;
, Place your non-dominant hand directly in front of you, straight but with a flexible elbow. The palm should be face up with the ball in it.Another way to set up is to cover the ball with your hitting hand.

, Swing your serving arm back next to your head. Make sure that your elbow is pointing upwards and your hand is at or slightly above your ear. This stance opens your body.








, Lift the ball with your palm about 18–36 inches (46–91 cm) in the air. Keep the ball in line with your hitting shoulder and about 1 foot (0.3 m) in front of you so you can step into the serve. Your right hand should be at a 90 degree angle behind your body. Remember that you want your dominant hand to make contact with the ball just after it changes direction and begins to drop back down.









Don't toss the ball too high, too low, or too far to any side. This means you will have to chase the ball, resulting in a bad serve.In some variations, the hitting arm is readied as you toss the ball up, not before.

, The majority of the power of your serve is gained from the legs as you transfer weight from your back leg to your front leg. To transfer your weight properly, make sure your starting position is correct. Add momentum by stepping forward with your dominant foot as you serve, transferring the weight forward for a powerful serve.








The ball will go where your hand and toes face, so aim your palm and toes for accurate shooting.

, Lead with your elbow to bring your dominant hand forward. Smack the ball with the heel of your hand or the bottom of your palm.Don't hit the ball with your fingers or fist. Make sure your serving hand is slanted slightly upward. This will help loft the ball over the net. Aim for the middle of the ball to achieve the straightest trajectory for the ball.Stop the motion of your hand when you make contact with the ball.








Watch the spin on the ball. This will show you if you're contacting the ball correctly. If you see the ball sidespin or backspin, then you know your contact was off-center.
Swing fast at the ball from the shoulder., After striking the ball, use your momentum to run to your defensive position.

Hit the ball.",How to Serve a Volleyball Overhand2," Begin with your feet shoulder width apart facing the net. Your dominant arm should be directly in front of you, palm up, with the ball in your palm.


You should be at least 5–8 feet (1.5–2.4 m) behind the line to have enough space for a 3-4 step approach.

, Step forward with your dominant foot and keep the toss in line with your hitting shoulder. As you step forward, throw the ball high into the air and slightly forward with your dominant hand. Flick your wrist when tossing the ball to create spin on the ball.








A consistent toss results in a consistent serve. The toss influences every aspect of the serve; a bad toss can ruin an otherwise good serve. Toss with your strong hand, keep the ball in front of you, and don't throw it too high or low. These things result in bad serves., This should go slow to fast, so that your last two steps are much quicker and should look like they're happening at the same time. On your last step forward, launch yourself into a jump. Use the momentum from the steps above to get higher in the air.









If you're right handed, your steps will be left-right-left. If left handed, you'll be right-left-right. These last two steps are called a ""step close"" and are the most explosive part of your approach.

, Both arms should swing back to generate power for the jump. As you jump, swing your dominant/hitting arm back behind your body at a 90 degree angle. As with the basic overhand serve, your elbow should be pointing upward, with your wrist rigid and at or slightly above your ear. Your non-hitting arm should point at the ball to track it.









Your non-hitting arm tracks the ball in what is commonly referred to as a bow and arrow movement.

, Aim to hit the ball just above the center of the ball.Unlike in a basic overhand serve, don't stop your arm when you hit the ball. Swing all the way through and snap your wrist.


If you can't get the snapping motion, practice. This wrist snap is what makes a top-spin serve powerful and unique. Practice perfecting the snap of the wrist along with hitting the ball correctly to send it sailing over the net.

, Create lots of forward momentum by rotating your hips and body through the serve. You should be broad jumping into the court on your jump serve and jump float. At the highest point of your jump, bring your hand down in a snapping motion slightly underneath the ball. This way you can aim upwards, but wrap your wrist over the top, which creates an up-down arc with the serve.This should create a topspin.









If you're right handed, your left hip should lead with your left shoulder. Then your right hip should power through, followed by your right arm.

Set up the ball.,
Toss the ball.,
Jump.,
Hit the ball.",How to Serve a Volleyball Overhand3," Start with the ball in both hands, straight in front of you. Hold the ball between both palms. Keep your elbows straight, but somewhat loose.


Some people toss the ball differently when jump serving. Some use their dominant hand, some use their non-dominant hand, some use both hands. The important thing for a jump serve is the effectiveness of the toss, not the toss method.

, Step forward with your dominant foot, and then take three quick steps. On the last step of your approach, throw the ball upward and slightly forward. For a float, you only want to throw it 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm), like in a basic overhand serve.









The toss sets up the entire serve. Make sure your toss is not too high or too low. The ball should be tossed with your strongest hand, and the ball should remain in front of the body.
Practice your toss until you have perfected it. Just like any other sport drill, practice tossing for hours to learn the proper technique.

, Directly after you loft the ball, jump upward with your next step, using the momentum from your approach. Bring your hitting arm back with the elbow high and by your ear.







, Leading with your elbow, hit the ball with the heel of your dominant hand as with the basic overhand serve. Your wrist should remain stiff. After hitting the ball, freeze with your palm towards the target.








With any serve, but especially jump serves, send the ball into the opponent's dead zones. They should have to move to get to the ball. As you practice and learn the overhand serve, learn how to send it away from the opponent's zones so you're not sending it directly to them.
Make sure your feet leave the floor before you cross the line. Land across the line."

Strengthen your lower body and core muscles.",How to Be a Better Volleyball Player," While many top players have perfected the jump serve, a simple overhand serve may be just as effective. Stand behind the serving line, toss the ball to a comfortable height over your head and hit it with a flat palm over the net as hard as you can. The ball must stay in bounds on the other side of the net. While underhand and sidearm serves put the ball in play, they are not as difficult to return as overhand serves, and are not as desirable to learn.









Practice your serving pitch. For each type of serve, toss the ball to your hitting hand and aim for the lower part of the ball. Try hitting the ball not with your palm but with the horseshoe part of your hand for a more accurate serve. Make sure you have positioned yourself and aimed correctly or the ball will go haywire.
Experiment with force. What's too much? What's too little? Soon enough your muscles will remember what works and you'll be able to aim the ball like a bullet out of a gun.;
, One of the first things that you'll need to learn after getting your serve developed is how to pass the ball effectively to a player in the setting position and give your team the best chance of scoring a point. The best passes and passers can calm the ball down, removing the spin and getting the ball high enough into the air to give the setter time to get under it.









Develop the proper form to pass. Hold your arms straight in front of you and put one palm inside the other, using the space between your elbows and wrists to guide the ball. Cup one hand and place your other hand on top of the cupped palm. Bring your thumbs together so that they face out and away from you, but do not cross your thumbs.
When you bump, you want the ball to hit the inside part of your forearm. This will be more sensitive at first, but it allows you to have a flat, even surface for the ball to bounce off. Practice passing back and forth with a partner, trying to put the ball in the same place every time you pass. You don't even need a net.

, The intention of a good set is to give others players an opportunity to score for the team. A set, like an assist in basketball or soccer, is the best way of contributing to the flow of the game and give your team a chance to get ahead. Depending on who you're playing with, sets need to be The setter should be loud and clear if calling help and if not, then she should call her hitter.









Place your hands above your head so that when you look up, your index fingers and thumbs create a triangle shape (without your hands touching). When you are attempting a set, you should be attempting to center the ball in this triangle and using only the pads of your fingers to push the ball back up.
Try shrugging your shoulders while bending your arms at a slant during your sets and bumps. If you're moving from your elbows, chances are that you aren't going to get maximum power. When you set, it also helps if you form your hands into a diamond and look through as you're hitting the ball.

, The hit, sometimes called the ""kill"" should ideally be the the third touch on the ball. Performed correctly, it should end with a point for your team. Although it's best practiced with a net, players can drill effectively to get the wrist-snapping action down pat.









Practice hits with one teammate, letting one player pass, the partner set it back, so the first may hit it down to the partner, who digs it up. Repeat this process in the opposite rotation. After a few rounds, you'll be developing the fundamental skills and improving significantly.

, Volleyball is about a lot more than offense. Learning to coordinate your blocks as a team and keep the other team from scoring will set you apart and improve your standing on the court. It's a simple skill, but learning to react and leap quickly into the path of the ball requires practice.









The best blocking drill involves three people and a net, letting other players practice shooting simultaneously. Let one teammate set, one hit, and one block. Let the two offensive players practice setting and shooting and the other player attempt to jump as high as possible and block.
If you don't have a net, practice blocking by working on your vertical leap. Practice jumping effectively and improving your power and the height in your jumps.

, In order to become a better player, you need to learn to play from all the positions. From the net to the back line, you need to get experience all over the court, regardless of your height and your skill set. Even if you're particularly good at one position, play from all over. Have good sportsmanship

, Go after every ball, even if you don't think that you can get it. Go for every ball like it's your last hit, giving it your all each and every time you're on the court. If you're in it 110%, everyone else will feel the pressure, too. Soon enough, your entire team will be firing on all cylinders.

, The game of volleyball relies on good communication and the best team on the court is usually the team talking the most. Call ""got"" or ""mine"" really loud to avoid confusion between you and your teammates. Yell whether the ball is in or out. If you see a tip coming let your team know. Your whole squad will benefit from just one person talking.

, Good volleyball players know that they always need to get better. Learning to take constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement is an important part of improving your play, whether you're on a volleyball team or playing informally with friends. If someone, a coach or a teammate, makes a suggestion, listen openly and try to integrate new ideas into your practice routine. Make it a goal to get better.

, If you hit a ball out or shank a pass, try to stay positive. Just move on and focus on the next serve. Volleyball is a mental sport and by getting down, you will greatly impact your game in a negative way. Stay focused and intent on winning. Find the zone and stay there. When your teammates see you playing with intensity and poise, it'll rub off on everyone and improve the team as a group.


Be alert, even if you are winning with a 10 point lead, the game could easily turn around with a good server. Focus on seeing a game through till the end and not changing your focus until the job is done.
Be a good sportsperson. Know that even if you don't win, you can always play another game and hit the ball twice as hard next time. Your teammates will appreciate your good attitude, regardless of your performance.

, High-fives, vocal encouragement, and positive vibes should always be coming from good players. Whether you're on the court or on the bench, always be cheering your team on and focused in with the game.

, It's a common misconception that volleyball is a sport that requires arm strength. In reality, good volleyball players have learned to be in the right place at the right time, and use the proper techniques. While strength is important, the best players aren't always the strongest, but are able to move efficiently and fluidly around the court.









Practice wind sprints and side-to-side shuffle runs to improve your ability to move around the court quickly and effectively. Learn to be in the right place at the right time.

, Plyometrics involves using your body as resistance, meaning you can do it anywhere, at any time, all by yourself. Working on jumping and using your weight for resistance will help you get into and stay in volleyball shape.








, A high vertical jump gives a hitter or a blocker numerous advantages on the volleyball court. Train hard by jumping rope, doing squats, and practicing tuck jumps, and your vertical will increase dramatically. The key is to keep up with it.









Practice with a jump rope. This is one of the most amazing tools for general fitness, as it increases endurance, and helps your jumping muscles. Look up some good jump rope routines.

, You have to be fast enough to react and pass a ball in volleyball, meaning that training should focus on improving your all-around agility and fast-twitch muscle reaction times.








, Volleyball players spend a lot of time in the ready position, a partial squat that allows players to react quickly and powerfully to the approaching ball. For beginning players, staying in this position for long periods of time can be quickly exhausting, so developing your lower body and core strength will help you be the best player you can be during the whole game. Improve your endurance by improving your core strength.









Try wall sits. If you ""sit on a wall"" then your muscles in your thighs will get strong. You need strong thighs in volleyball because you need to squat down a little bit to show that you are down and ready.
Try a circuit-training regimen, if you're looking for a good all-around fitness workout that will benefit your volleyball skills. This can be a good way to incorporate aerobic exercise, strength-training, and stamina-building workout skills, improving you as a player.

You should have 2 rows of players, with the first row closest to the net and the back row closest to the rear boundary of the court.
The player in the back right corner will serve the ball. You can rotate players around the court so that you will have a new server for each service game.

If you are rotating players out, rotate clockwise -- looking at the net, the player closest to it on the right side would rotate out, allowing for many players to play.

;
, If you serve from in front of the line it will not count as a point. This is known as a foot fault. The ball has to go over the net (but it can touch), and it has to land within the court for the serve to be good.


The player on the right-hand side at the back of the court serves. Each player will only receive one service attempt per serve rotation; you may serve as many times as you can get the ball in the other teams court.
The ball is good even if it lands on a line.

, Thus the rally has begun! A typical play will be bump, set, spike -- but as long as it goes over within three hits, it's good.


Technically, you can hit the ball with any part of your body so long as the ball does not come to a rest.Players may go over the lines, but the ball may not. If a player on your team hits it out of bounds, you may run to retrieve it -- successfully so if it doesn't touch the ground.

, This could be because of any one of the following:


The ball hits the ground.

If the ball hits the ground on the side of the serving team, then the other team has the opportunity to serve.
If the ball hits the ground on the side of the receiving team, then the serving team can serve again.
The point is awarded to the team that did not allow the ball to hit the ground.


The ball goes out of bounds. The team that hits the ball out of bounds loses the point.
Someone touches the net. If a player on one team touches the net, then the opposing team picks up a point.
Someone's foot goes under the net. When this happens, the opposing team receives the point.
Someone hits the ball 2 consecutive times. Players can't strike the ball twice in a row, unless a strike is in the block. A block does not count as a touch.
A team hits the ball 4 or more times without sending it over. 3 is the maximum.

, The team that won the last point gets to serve the ball. If you're rotating, rotate now.


If your team has the ball, it's common for the rows to back up a bit. The idea here is to get ready for an attack. If you don't have the ball, move forward. The idea instead here is to make the attack.

, You can decide how many points you will allow for each game. For instance, you can start a new game when a team earns 15 points.


Recent rules state that regulation games go to 25 points, with the third game (in a set of three) going to 15.A standard match is three games long. Each team should switch sides at the start of a new game.
A game must be won by two points. 25-26 will not cut it; it must be 25-27. Because of this, close games can go on much longer.

, When you're not serving, it's common to take on a basic volleyball stance. Your feet should be placed slightly wider than your shoulders, your weight should be forward on your toes, and your knees bent. Make sure your arms are free and in front of you.


Unlike the opinions of many, volleyball is an intense sport. During a match, players can go the equivalent of a couple of miles in distance., A basic serve gets the ball over the net and into the other court to start the rally. This can be done anywhere behind the serve line. A serve that immediately scores a point (only touches the server's hands) is referred to as an ""Ace.""


More experienced players can try an overhand serve:

Toss the ball in front of you.
Raise your dominant hand in the air. Bend your elbow to bring your hand closer to your shoulder.
Straighten your elbow and strike the ball with the outside of your hand.


Less experienced players can serve underhanded.

Hold the ball in your hand out in front of you.
Make a fist and pull your dominant hand down and to the side. Your elbow should be slightly bent, and your thumb should be stretched across your fingers.
Strike the ball at waist level using the front side of your fist. The ball should hit your fist against your bent thumb and index finger.



, This is the most commonly used shot for returning a serve. Ideally, you would ""pass"" it to the setter on the team. The bump is the first in a 3-move play.


Make a fist with your left hand. Then, wrap your right hand around your left fist. Both thumbs should be flat against the top of your hands with your thumbnail facing upward.
Rotate your elbows until the flat side of your forearm is facing upward. Your arms should be straight out in front of you at a slightly downward angle, and your elbows should be locked.
Move so that the ball is directly in front of you. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and wait until the ball is at the same level as your waist.
Allow the ball to strike your forearms about 2 to 6"" (5 to 15 cm) above your wrists. When the ball makes contact with your forearms, push up with your legs and angle your ""platform"" toward your target.

, Typically, you will not set the ball on the return of serve. Instead, you will use the set to get the ball into the air so that another player can bump it or spike it.


Hold your hands in the air and make a triangle window you can see through. Place your feet shoulder width apart, and bend your legs slightly.Hit the ball with your fingertips when the ball reaches eye level. Push upward with your legs as your strike the ball.
If you slap it with the palm of your hand, in a real game, that will be called out for ""lifting,"" like you actually caught the ball and just lifted it back up.

, This is also known as the ""attack.""


Approach the ball and lift your dominant hand. Your hand should be curved into the shape of the ball, and your elbow should be bent.
Jump up and strike the ball with your palm. Reach as high as you can for maximum power. The ball should travel over the net but sharply downward so that it is difficult for the other team to return.

, For the (three) players at the net, this is used to stop an attack, or spike. There are two types of blocks:


An offensive block aims to keep the ball on the opponent's side of the court. The timing must be exactly right to jump up, predict the trajectory of the ball, and slam it back onto the opponent's side. Ideally, it sends the ball straight to the floor.
A defensive, or soft, block is used just to stop the power behind the ball to make it easier to send back. The ball hits the blocker's palm, rolls along their fingertips (losing power) and is received by another player.
A block does not count as one of the three hits allotted to a side to get the ball over the net.

, This is mainly a term for a dive -- a spectacular play where the player saves the ball right before it hits the ground. It involves a great level of reflex and agility.


In diving, players land on their chests with their arms stretched out. It is very important to do this safely as injury is likely if done wrong. Seasoned players employ a rolling technique to minimize the risk of injury.

, Setting is a definite skill and maintains the offensive for the team. They must be able to operate in tandem with the hitters and place the ball exactly where it needs to be for the attacker to strike the ball effectively.


They must be swift and agile in addition to having technical accuracy when it comes to launching the ball. With a bad set, the ball is going nowhere.
Just be warned: setters have a lot of restrictions. When they are in the front row they can attack and hit the ball at their will, but, when they are back row, they may not attack any ball that is above the net.

, If you're getting up there in skill, using a libero may be a strategy your team wants to employ. This is not counted as a substitution -- this player wears a different color.


This player receives the attack or serve and must have cat-like reflexes. They are a ""defensive specialist."" They usually replace the middle blocker or center when they are supposed to rotate into the back row. If you have a player that is great at receiving attacks, put 'em in as the libero.
That literally means ""free,"" as in they're free to sub in and out as often as they want. However, they cannot play in the front row.

, Each designation of hitter has their strong points. Look at your team and see who falls into what category:


Middle hitters must perform fast attacks and be decent blockers. They are playing offense and defense constantly.
Opposite hitters (or right-side hitters) are a back-up setter and primarily work on defense. They must provide a good block at all times because they are essentially blocking the opposing team's outside, or strong-side, hitter.
Outside hitters should be the most consistent hitter on the team as that's generally where all the serves go. They are also often employed if a first pass goes astray from the middle.

, Though some leagues will allow unlimited substitutions, international rules say that you can have a maximum of 6 (not including the libero).You can also pull in a serving specialist or a defensive specialist (not the same thing has a libero) if your team is lacking in serving or defense skills.

, We'll be assuming you're working with 6 players here. If you're not, adapt your number of players and their skills to other various formations. However, with six, there are generally three to choose from (the numbers refer to positions, not to number of players):



4-2 formation. This has four hitters and two setters. Generally speaking, the setters position themselves on the right; they are the two front attackers. This is generally only used in beginner's play.

6-2 formation. This is where a player comes up from the back and acts as a setter. The front row is all poised to attack. All players will be hitters at some point or another.

5-1 formation. This has only one player as a setter, regardless of where they are positioned in the rotation. Obviously then, there are sometimes 2 and sometimes 3 attackers in the front row. The setter can then change up their strategy as they rotate and even just dump the ball lightly over the net at times. It's very setter-centric!

, The ball could come at you at any time!

, The best volleyballs are made of leather or synthetic leather. Also, the ball should have an inner bladder made of rubber.


For indoor volleyball, choose a ball that is well-pressurized. Also, look for a ball that is a light uniform color.
For outdoor or beach volleyball, choose a brightly colored volleyball that will be easy to see in the sunlight.

, Make sure that the supports for your net are made of galvanized metal or treated wood. Also, consider padding the poles to protect the players.


An official net measures 32 feet (9.75 m) long and 39"" (1 m) wide. For men, it comes in at 7 feet (2.1 m) 11 5/8 in (2.43 M) high and for women, it tops out at 7 feet (2.1 m) 4 1/8 in (2.24 m).If you're playing outdoors, dig a hole at least 3' (about 1 m) deep for the poles. If you want your court to be permanent, pour concrete into the holes before you install the poles.

, An official volleyball court is 29 feet (8.8 m) 6"" (9 m) wide and 59 feet (18 m) (18 m) long.


Use spray paint or bright nylon tape to mark the boundaries of your court. The lines should be approximately 2"" (5 cm) wide. Alternatively, you can use the line markers that came with the net that you purchased.
Your court should face north and south as opposed to east and west. This orientation ensures that no team is ever looking directly into the sun.
If you're playing an informal game, you can simply mark the boundaries with some shoes or any other items that you have laying around. Don't worry about exact measurements; the point is to have fun while you're playing.

, Now that you have all the necessary equipment, get a group together! Volleyball can be played with two people, but it's more fun with a dozen or so. Take the number that you have and figure out your formation -- how will you rotate (if you rotate at all) and account for skill?


If you have an odd number, you can either have the odd man out rotate sides, join the weaker team, or rotate one individual acting as a referee or scorekeeper. Or they could be the designated libero and pop around at will!

Learn the Rules of the Game



Objective
The aim of the game is to score the most by throwing the ball through the opposing team's goal and to defend their own goal from being scored upon by the opposing team.,
Understand the Positions


3-3 Setup
The 3-3 is the most common setup for water polo and consists of 2 lines, each of 3 players.,
Understand Simple Tactics



Starting the Game
It is the beginning of the game when the first possession is determined.",How to Understand the Rules of Water Polo," Wearing helmets are a must and are worn for safety and sometimes to identify opposing teams.

Starting the Game
Each team starts on the wall of their respective side with 7 players: 6 fielders and one goalkeeper. To start the game, the referee blows the whistle and throws the ball in at the center line represented by a white mark on the side of the pool deck. The two sprinters are the players closest to the side to where the ref threw the ball, and are usually the team's fastest swimmers. The two teams race each other to be in possession of the ball and either pass or hand the ball off the the chaser, who follows the sprinter.

Gameplay Rules
After the first possession is taken, a shot clock is started for 30 seconds in which the team must score or the possession of the ball is changed resulting in a new shot clock. Possession changes when the time is up.

Fouls and Penalties
Fouls in water polo vary from simple possession changes to full on ejections:


Minor Foul
These are very common in water polo and result in a free pass. Play is not stopped for these fouls. They include mild grabbing and pushing. If a defender commits the foul, the fouled player gets a free pass to a team-mate, but can be blocked after the ball leaves the player's hands. If the offense commits the foul, then the ball changes possession with a free pass.

Major Foul
These are fouls when a defender is overly aggressive on a player and result in being kicked out of the game until 20 seconds pass or until a possession change. They include grabbing, kicking, pushing underwater, and preventing movement. When committed, the attacking team is awarded a free pass and the defending team must play a player down.

;
, The front center position is the Set who the ball is trying to be passed too and is given the #6. The outside positions of the front line are the wings and given the numbers 1 and 5. The back center position is the point and is given the number 3. The outside back positions are the flats, or drivers and drive for the goal when the set is fouled. The flats are given the numbers 2 and 4.
--------/Goal\--------
----(1)---(6)---(5)---
----------------------
----(2)---(3)---(4)---
----------------------
2-4 Setup
The 2-4 is a set up when the team has man up. Like the 3-3 there are 2 lines. The front has 4 players and the back 2. Position names can greatly vary so here's a chart with the numbers.
--------/Goal\--------
--(1)-(2)--(3)--(4)--
----------------------
------(5)----(6)------
----------------------

, When the Whistle is blown the sprinter goes after ball and is followed by the tailer. If the sprinter gets possession of the ball, then he either passes it to and open player, or if pressed, to the tailer behind him. The offense then set up a 3-3 and continues from there. If the sprint is lost then the sprinter defends the opposing tailer, and the tailer defends the opposing sprinter. The other players also take action accordingly.

3-3 Offensive Tactics
After the sprint or possession change, the team will attempt to set up a 3-3.
--------/Goal\--------
----(1)---(6)---(5)---
----------------------
----(2)---(3)---(4)---
----------------------
The ball is usually started from the 2,3 or 4 positions. By passing the ball around the perimeter, the team tries to get to a position where the ball can get passed to set (6). The Set will then either have a shot on the goal, or get fouled. If fouled, it is the flats' (2 and 4) responsibility to drive toward the cage for a pass and then a shot. If no pass is made, the flats become the wings and the wings move back to the flats and the process is repeated.

2-4 Offensive tactics
The 2-4 set up is used when the opposing team is a man down, do to a foul or brutality..
--------/Goal\--------
--(1)-(2)--(3)--(4)--
----------------------
------(5)----(6)------
----------------------
The front line of the set up is on the 2-meter line and the rear about 5 meters (16.4 ft) out. The 2 and 3 positions are on the posts of the goal. These are the equivalent of a set in a 3-3. The point is to get the ball to the 2 or 3 for a shot or for the 5 or 6 positions to get close enough to shoot. The tactics for offense are much the same as a 3-3 with the exception that there is no drive when a player is fouled.

Man to Man Defense
This defense is used most often when each team has the same amount of players on the field and the way it works is to make it so there is no one for the offense to pass to. Each player chooses one player from the opposing team to guard and prevent a pass from reaching them. When played correctly, the offense will have the shot clock run out, or a pass will be blocked

Zone defense
This defense method is used when the other team is a man up, or in circumstances where normal position line ups are broken. The basis of this defense is to guard the players with a good shot at the goal if passed to, and react effectively if the ball is passed to an open player. The main objective in this defense is to always keep the inside water, so that if the ball is passed to someone on the perimeter, their chance of making a goal is reduced. When played effectively, the shot-clock will expire, or the only shots available on the goal will be from the out side and easily blockable.

Make sure they are about five inches in front of your forehead. Your wrists and palms should be facing toward the ceiling. Spread your fingers out wide.


Both your thumbs should be facing toward your forehead.
Keep your hands at an angle so that the thumb and forefinger of each hand is about two to three inches away from the thumb and forefinger of the other hand.;
, When the ball comes to you, catch it with all of your fingers. Your ring and pinky fingers will help to keep the ball stable while your other fingers will help you to direct the ball. Having all your fingers on the ball makes it easier to control.


Bend your elbows when you catch the ball to give your arms a wide range of motion.
Don’t hold the ball too long when you catch it or you will get called for a “lift.”
Make sure both hands touch the volleyball at the same time or you may get called for a “double contact.”

, Finish your backset by pushing the ball up. Straighten your arms and release the ball into the air. Because you have already started the ball moving backwards, it will naturally travel behind you. End your backset by pushing the ball straight up to give your attacker an easier target to spike.The entire process from the catch to the release should be one quick motion. If your set looks disjointed, you might get called for holding on to the ball.
You should form a “J” with your hands when you pull the ball back and release it.
Remember to follow through with your hands after you release the ball to help it travel where you want it to go.

, Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart or a little wider with your knees slightly bent. Your weight should be distributed evenly throughout the bottoms of your feet so that you can easily move in any direction. Keep your back straight and don’t lean one way or the other.


If you over-commit to moving your body in one direction, you won’t be able to switch the trajectory of the ball in reaction to the other team’s blockers.

, When you see the ball coming your way, position yourself directly under it. Run to the ball in a neutral position. When you get close enough, jump under it and place your hips, feet, and shoulders directly facing the spot the ball come down. Make sure your back is facing the direction you want to set the ball.


You should lift your hands into position at the same time that you square up.
Make sure your back stays straight. You may have to switch the direction of your set at the last second.

, Much of the power in your set will be generated from your legs.Bend your knees when you square up to the ball and straighten them when you release the ball. Try to use the right amount of power for your set. If you’re setting up an attacker that is near you, you don’t need to use as much force as if you’re setting up someone at the other side of the court.


It may take some time and practice before you can accurately judge how much power to use for each set.

, If you see an opportunity to surprise your opponents, you can jump in the air to set the ball. When you jump, be sure that your back is straight and that you’re directly under the ball. By jumping to the ball instead of waiting for it to come to you on the ground, you speed up the offense. Not only do you get the ball faster, but you also make sure the ball doesn’t have as far to travel towards the attacker.

, Hold the ball in your hands above your forehead as if you just caught it. Pull the ball back and then straighten your arms into the air but keep the ball in your hand. Remember to keep your back straight while you do the drill to train your body to stay in position. You should also synchronize your legs and your arms by straightening them both at the same time.


Start off doing the drill slow until the movement becomes second nature.
Do the drill in one solid movement.

, Get a partner. Start out in a neutral position facing perpendicular to them. Have them toss you the volleyball and square up under it facing them with your hands ready to catch it.Catch the volleyball and then toss it back to your partner. Get back into a neutral position and repeat the exercise.


This drill helps your body get used to squaring up to the ball.
Make sure that you’re touching the ball with both hands at the same time each time you catch it. You don’t want to build any bad habits.

, Get a partner. Hold a volleyball in your hands like you just caught it. Push the ball back and up in a “J” motion and release it into the air. Have your partner watch to make sure your ball is travelling in the right trajectory. The ball should make a half circle in the air behind you. If the ball is traveling diagonally behind you, you’re trying to push the ball back and up at the same time and you need to recalibrate your release.


Do this drill until the ball consistently moves on the right path.

, Take turns setting the ball back and forth to each other while shuffling from one end of the court to the other. This drill will teach you to get under the ball quickly and develop proper form when you set. Make sure to have a coach or friend nearby to call you out if you start to lose your form.

The most common way to block is to be in your ready position and angle your hand downwards so the ball can be in your control. Never follow the shooters face or jerky body movements. Wait to attack the ball until it's left their arm.
Block using iron cross. You do this by angling you arms spread as far apart horizontally and lunge when the shot is taken. Many times the shooter will be unguarded and will come in to take the shot inside the four meter line. Make sure your hands are out of the water and that they your elbows are as well.
Lastly the penalty shot. For this shot you have three options. either lunge forward cutting off the angles with the iron cross, choose a side before the shot and cover that side of the goal. or you can wait for the shot to be thrown and try to react.

, A shot can easily slip through your fingers, so it is best to practice knocking shots down in front of you to avoid an embarrassing miss.

, It is generally a good idea to be pushing back/stepping out as hard as you can against the hole defence. Press your back against them and raise your hips up towards the surface of the water with your legs in-front of you so you can swim onto the ball.

, A wet pass should land about an arm's length away from you. Once a wet pass comes to you, quickly swim forward and grab the ball underneath. This has to be done quickly.

, After you get the ball in your hand, position it against your forearm, holding the ball thumbs-down.

, Tread water up high so that your shoulders, back, and shooting arm are out of the water. Bend the elbow on your shooting arm, pointing it at the direction that you want the ball to go.

, Do a snap-action with your shoulder, quickly whipping your arm behind you and releasing the ball once it straightens out, flicking your wrist at the end. If you do all of this in one fluent motion, the ball will go into the goal.

Don't be afraid to push off the defender to separate yourself from him in order to get yourself free to shoot.,
Never shoot on the first pass into 2 meters (6.6 ft) unless you have a clear shot.",How to Play Hole Set in Water Polo," You want to push your defender back, with your hips out in front of you. When the ball is passed, this enables you to step out to it and score. In times when you cannot score, you also have the option of turning your defender. If you can successfully put the defender on your back, the referee will reward your team with an ejection or a 5-meter. A hole set can also take a foul and allow for the 2 and 4 positions to drive.;
, There are several types:


Sweep -- The ball is cradled using your wrist and released after a quick turn. The key to this shot is quickness.
Backhand -- Hold the ball with your wrist pointing forward and you release it quickly. This shot is best taken when the pass comes in from the flat and you are positioned on the far post so you have entire cage.
Lay-out. This shot requires the player to step out to the ball and then come forward to shoot. A defender may reach forward to block the ball. In this situation, you can fake a shot and turn them or you may change your angle of shooting. For instance lean back, then wait for the defender's move. Once he moves, move your upper body left. This confuses the goalie and the defense. But remember, quickness is the key for success.
Opposite Hand -- work on picking the ball up and shooting with your opposite hand. If the defender knows that you are right handed, he will most likely shade your strong side leaving you open to make a move to shoot with your left hand.

, Make sure your hand is positioned below the water and that your movement is not very aggressive.

, It's always easier to get a shot off out of 2 meters (6.6 ft) if you shoot on the 2nd or 3rd pass into set. If you don't have a good shot, take the foul or dish the ball to the perimeter.
